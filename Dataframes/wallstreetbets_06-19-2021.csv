2021-06-19 19:36:12,wallstreetbets,I think the market is going to bounce up a bit Monday.
2021-06-19 19:55:43,wallstreetbets,Dumbbbbb we headin up. All these mike burry fanboys. Inflation means equities inflate too.the party doesn‚Äôt stop until the fed raises rates which is 2023 earliest.

2021-06-19 19:54:31,wallstreetbets,"I watched powell and honestly it was neutral to dovish. We don't really have any real black swan events or grim reapers going ground so I can't bring myself to be overly bearish on these markets. Friday's action was pretty clearly sideways for the entire day on a quad witching, sure they dumped into the close but thats hardly people running to the exits in fear.

That being said what would change my mind is a break on SPY's major bull trendline for the last 12 or so years. They had a successful test @ 406 on May 19/20 and if anything could see them getting back down to it again for a test (its @ 412.5 or so for Monday this upcoming week). If they break that or gap under that with conviction then sure I will believe  you and go full bear mode. Until then thats major support and a great buying opportunity ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"

2021-06-19 19:50:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm curious which asset you think is really valued appropriately in this case.Nearly every stock I research is trading at something like 50x annual profits right now.

The whole market is far more inflated than it was in 2007.Also, it's banks that crash, not the market. When they crash, the market follows, not the other way around.

They hold the vast majority of the assets in this game, and are entirely overleveraged.

that's the beauty of WSB; people like me make crazy bets and we all get to laugh abou them :)

If banks aren't fearing inflation, why are they parking nearly $1T with the fed? Why wouldn't they be plowing that money into real assets (aka markets)?"

2021-06-19 18:12:38,wallstreetbets,"Btw, those closed positions were a total of 15 CC contracts (5 @ $60 and 10 @ $70 strike) that all expired worthless yesterday netting about 5500."
2021-06-19 18:15:27,wallstreetbets,Covered calls are nuts. Its basically being able to options trade with zero risk. Just wish I had enough capital for them to make a big number in my account
2021-06-19 18:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Hi. I've been thinking about doing covered calls, or spreads I actually think it is. Though, there is a thing I've been trying to understand, and really don't. I've been trying to ask my broker, but I don't think they understand what I mean.

So lets say I buy a $60 call and sell a $70 call, and the price closes at $80, on the friday both options expire. Will I need $6000 to exercise my $60 call, to then sell at $70/share? My problem is, I dont have $6000, but I could afford to do the spread. So I'm hoping $1000 is just gonna appear om my account.

I'm kinda confused.

A way around this as I see it, would be to buy a $70 call, because this would even out my short position, and then I could safely sell my $60 call?

Hope you can help, without giving financial advise of course."
2021-06-19 18:44:37,wallstreetbets,I made 5k this month on CC alone. It‚Äôs nuts.
2021-06-19 19:41:55,wallstreetbets,Finally an ape with a brain. Just sell weekly 80+c
2021-06-19 18:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Thanks OP, congrats on the gain so far."
2021-06-19 19:40:21,wallstreetbets,Hey it‚Äôs me I want a refund on those calls you sold me
2021-06-19 18:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Did you make $100k in CC premium solely, or does that include the profit from assignment above your cost basis?"
2021-06-19 19:17:55,wallstreetbets,Adopt me ü§£
2021-06-19 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,How about you invest in some bitches instead
2021-06-19 18:23:52,wallstreetbets,"I gotta learn more about selling CC‚Äôs. What happens if it doesn‚Äôt expire worthless, but close to worthless ? Say for example, let‚Äôs say you chose to sell the covered call at its highest premium, say a week or two ago when the 145c for 6/18 or 6/11 were worth $15-20 each, and it went down to 0 , you keep ALL the premium obviously right ? For each one you sold? But what if something like yesterday, you sold a $60 and the premium was $10 at the beginning of the week, but expired at say for example .50 , would you still make the $950 premium on that?"
2021-06-19 18:26:54,wallstreetbets,Congrats!
2021-06-19 18:56:02,wallstreetbets,How far back did you write those CCs? That‚Äôs about 350/contract which makes me think you had at least a few weeks?
2021-06-19 18:17:03,wallstreetbets,If you make smart moves you will get there!
2021-06-19 18:39:08,wallstreetbets,"No when those options expire you will profit the difference in strike prices. What happens is the $60 call you bought is exercised at expiration so you ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù the 100 shares for $60, but the $70 call you sold is assigned and that means you ‚Äúsell‚Äù the 100 shares immediately to someone else (who bought your call contract) and therefore you are left with the difference between buying at $60 and selling at $70 so you profit $1000.  
Edit: so yea you‚Äôre basically right but you don‚Äôt need the cash in your account because the long call option is collateral for the short call."
2021-06-19 18:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Basically what you do to get around this is don't let options expire/hit expiry date before exercising/trading/covering them. What you're doing isn't covered calls but call credit spreads. Just ask your broker what happens to a call credit spread on expiry. If the person who picks up can't answer, ask to speak to a higher up, eventually somebody has got to know the basics of options trading, especially if the broker offers them."
2021-06-19 18:09:15,wallstreetbets,Np. Thanks man for the info.
2021-06-19 18:56:00,wallstreetbets,"I made about 85k solely from CCs so far. The rest is from selling shares when the price was higher, plus unrealized gains from the 2k I still hold."
2021-06-19 19:24:59,wallstreetbets,Only if I can then claim you as a dependent
2021-06-19 18:34:46,wallstreetbets,If the call is .01 OTM at expiration it is always worthless. It can‚Äôt be worth .50 at expiration unless it‚Äôs .50 ITM
2021-06-19 18:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Contracts that expire OTM always expire worthless and can‚Äôt be exercised unless ITM. When you receive a premium for selling a contract, that money is 100% yours regardless of outcome of the contract."
2021-06-19 19:09:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
2021-06-19 19:15:59,wallstreetbets,"I sold the top two positions last Friday (so with 7 DTE) and the open position was actually rolled from a previous $55 strike CC from the same day. When that one moved ITM I rolled it forward one week and up to $65. But, I have been selling weekly CCs for the past 5 weeks at different strikes between $55 and $75."
2021-06-19 18:25:36,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the smart move to make currently?
2021-06-19 18:49:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, it's the part about my collateral/margin requirements i didn't really get. I guess some people do spreads with 1000's of contracts, and dont have the collateral to exercise all at once."
2021-06-19 18:39:34,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs describing a debit spread not a credit spread.
2021-06-19 18:45:14,wallstreetbets,"But the way I'll make sure a call I sold will not expire, would be to ""close"" it, as I understand, and the way I do that, is by buying a call of the same strike price and with the same expiry date, right?

I can't cover if I ain't got the money for 100 shares, but I could ""cover"" if identical options even each other out. 

I will call them tho, their rules might differ.

When we reach 2 hours before market close, on fridays, they'll start to ""lock"" money for exercising options, and if I dont meet margin requirements, they'll margin call me. What they do is sell the options, but I'm a little scared how this works when writing options, or spreads."
2021-06-19 19:24:52,wallstreetbets,Nice. You have 2k shares left. How many shares did you have at peak selling with those CCs?
2021-06-19 19:27:46,wallstreetbets,"Haha deal.  But def congrats on the gains. 

Feels like a different world when thinking back to investing before covid.  Even during covid, I thought for sure AMC was only PnD and would be lucky to not bankrupt during 2nd wave.  Ah hindsight, you fickle bitch"
2021-06-19 18:37:16,wallstreetbets,"Sorry that‚Äôs basically what I meant‚Ä¶ I meant if it is in the money, do you still keep the premium ? Again, if you sold the call at say $18, and at expiration it‚Äôs .50 or even a $1. What happens? You keep the profit you made ?"
2021-06-19 18:45:26,wallstreetbets,Well that depends 100% on your position...
2021-06-19 19:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Yea that‚Äôs one of the main points of putting on a spread in the first place. It eliminates the need for collateral, also most brokers won‚Äôt allow selling of naked calls without special margin requirements anyway. A spread also vastly reduces your risk and your premium cost. The trade off is that it does limit your potential gains to the difference in the strike prices of the two options."
2021-06-19 19:20:39,wallstreetbets,Are you talking about a call you sold naked? As in you don‚Äôt have the 100 shares to cover it?
2021-06-19 19:30:03,wallstreetbets,I started with 5k shares that I bought back in March at $8.26. I sold 1k at $65 then started selling the calls. Also sold 1k at $67 I believe it was.
2021-06-19 19:32:44,wallstreetbets,To be clear I was fully aware that fundamentally this was never a sound investment. I just took a chance because of the growing popularity I had the feeling this thing would move up a little. When I first bought in I would have been more than happy with the price just moving up to $12 or so... that would‚Äôve been fine with me. The rest is just pure luck and momentum I guess.
2021-06-19 18:43:20,wallstreetbets,"If it‚Äôs ITM at expiration you will be assigned and 100 shares that you own will be called away and sold to whoever had bought the call option at that strike price. So you will keep the difference in premium but your 100 shares will be sold at the given strike price.

Edit: that means if the stock goes much higher that your strike you will miss out on those potential gains had you just held your shares."

2021-06-19 19:22:34,wallstreetbets,No I'm only into covered calls or spreads for now. No naked positions.
2021-06-19 19:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Oh agreed.  But I have a personal rule about momentum based trading, only one ticker at a time.  Find It‚Äôs easy to loose track of the sentiment otherwise. GME was my play at the time"
2021-06-19 18:45:40,wallstreetbets,"I see, so regardless you can still make moneybut you would just make a little less & if you bought your shares well below the strike you sold, then obviously you wouldn‚Äôt lose any money?"
2021-06-19 19:18:01,wallstreetbets,"Well I more so meant your current position in AMC (assuming you have one). If you don‚Äôt I‚Äôm not sure what to say tbh. I don‚Äôt want to give you advice, but I‚Äôm not sure I would personally get into AMC at the price it is currently... that‚Äôs just me though."
2021-06-19 19:26:49,wallstreetbets,Then you don‚Äôt need to worry about not having money to buy the shares. You already have them. So if you let the CC expire ITM then what will happen is 100 of yo ur shares will be sold at the strike price of the call you sold.
2021-06-19 19:35:47,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm gonna assume you must have done ok with GME though...
2021-06-19 18:58:11,wallstreetbets,Right. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm ok with selling these calls right now because I bought these shares at 8.26 so if they get assigned at 60 or 70 I am totally fine with that...
2021-06-19 18:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Yep, or you can buy a cc to lower your entry point. So instead of paying 60 for AMC, you can buy it for 55 if you sold a 60 weekly call."
2021-06-19 19:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Oh definitely. 52k gains on 14k play.  

But next time I think I will trim more on the way up, passed up 300k thinking it would continue its push past $450"
2021-06-19 19:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Well no, if you sold a call at 55 you could get in at 55. If you‚Äôd sold a call at 60 then that will be your entry price should it expire ITM."

The platform and app are easy to use with a nice presentation and it was a lot of fun to shop around. It's not as bad as you make it seem, and I think you're actually the shill trying to spread FUD with an ulterior motive. Wish does have support and active shoppers and is making moves in the market.

You are speaking unfairly and unable to see that the stock price can easily rest above 15$. I'm not saying this guy should leverage his house, bad idea, and I'm not saying this is a 200$ stock, but it's def worth more than 12$ and is well positioned to improve as a company and take some market share from Amazon, AliBaba, and Ebay.

Now, take a look at AMD stocks 5 year performance (up over 1,600%) and average price target ($104.34). Considering AMD is indeed well undervalued, AMD is a much better deal. There's also a fair amount of short interest. I thought WSB was into that sort of thing...Not to mention recent deals with Tesla, Google and a massive merger with Xilinx."

NVDA is value 2x what INTC is. So what is your metrics for valuation, exactly? Unless you just think the issues with Intel are systemic and will never get resolved. NVDA would have to 5x its business to get to where INTC is.

Intel ***STILL*** hasn't taken the fucking leap from 14nm to 7nm, even for their new CPUs coming out. Maybe they're waiting on their goddamn fax machine to send over the plans? Dial-up is too slow? The company is getting left in the dust by being dilapidated as fuck."

AMD is the superior x86 choice. Intel are stuck on 10nm process IIRC, and are still trying to figure out 7nm (which they expect for 2023), meanwhile TSMC will be manufacturing 3nm for Apple next year.

They just can't compete with the Asian fabs, AMD, and the ARM-based chips."

2021-06-19 19:14:52,wallstreetbets,I think a meme stock is just a stock pumped by wsb just for the sake of it or for some obscure reason. Could be any company imo. Pltr was the biggest meme stock on here for a few weeks just before gme blew up.

Pltr has crazy love cause daddy karp and thus the ability to explode. Besides, even if their company was gonna fail... the premium rn is so fuckin cheap that this stock more than any of the other wsb darlings atm makes sense to pump bc option returns would be crazy as theyre dirt cheap rn. Granted im kinda biases bc i think this company will be one of the largest in 5 10  yrs and beyond. My position 1400 @ 23 and another 1k on margin for to trade the ups and downs.

Like right off the bat, for the laymen here:

Establishing Adviser Criteria (investopedia)

The Investment Advisers Act addressed who is and who is not an advisor/adviser by applying three criteria: what kind of advice is offered, how the individual is paid for their advice/method of compensation, and whether or not the lion's share of the advisor's income is generated by providing investment advice (the primary professional function). Also, if an individual leads a client to believe they are an investment adviser (by presenting themselves like that in advertising, for example), they can be considered one.1

Or even better, here...

Who is an Investment Adviser?

 \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm not being compensated to tell you less than intelligent individuals about an attractively valued stock on a deep value basis, you complete meme. DFV was more complicated because he was ACTUALLY a Certified Financial Adviser, but he was not being compensated for his advice and thus had no fiduciary duty to any of you. Nor, to be fair, was he actually involved in the business of giving advice at his workplace. It's why the SEC hasn't fucked him six ways to sunday under the investment act of 1940.

There are literally no guns pointed at anyone's head as they push the buy or sell button. If the brain of the person is actually smooth enough to consider any post on Reddit as advice for their financial future, the future of their family, or even the financial future of their wife's boyfriend...

well, their brain is so smooth that natural selection should take care of them any minute now and initiating legal action will be a non-issue.

On a positive note: If there are a few wrinkles on the brain... Reddit posts MIGHT be a great start to do your own DD, so you can make your own choices to buy or sell. :)"

If you intentionally mislead or recklessly mislead you are a lower level of scum than the shit of a short seller. And I'm starting to fear that there is a lot of that going on here.

2021-06-19 16:05:54,wallstreetbets,"Sorry...

Coke went woke and will be broke.

I'm Pepsi all the way. Everything in my house is Pepsi. Especially their new mango Pepsi and cherry Pepsi. Coke is shit.

I drink soda to be refreshed and quenched. I don't need my soda to push an agenda and preach that my privilege oppressed other people that I don't even know. 

I love AMC. I flipped off a Regal and a Regency the other day when I drove by them. They looked like shit. Sorry dirty buildings and decrepit parking lots. They look like those old places where horror movies happen, not where you watch horror movies. 

By contrast, the AMC here looks clean and nice and welcoming. Shall I say... it looks regal more than any Regal theater I've seen. Bonus, my AMC has the full reclining seats and the couples armrest that you can flip up so you can snuggle with your honey while watching the movie."

2021-06-19 14:28:07,wallstreetbets,You hit the nail on the head with your last sentence. Water Desalination. How can humans create a cost-effective process to mass desalinate water to pump inland from the ocean and Gulf of Mexico?

2021-06-19 18:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Averages are built on extremes.  The earth doesn't even notice a thousand years, let alone a hundred or ten.  Before most on here were born there was widespread flooding in the early 80's in the west.

Northern reservoirs are more full, they'll start dumping Flaming Gorge into Powell and then Mead.

The loss of electricity will be a much bigger problem than the loss of water, Powell is already near critical low for producing hydro-electric."
2021-06-19 14:42:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm familiar with the situation that is going on. The big factor is how will the water from the Colorado river be allocated but the overall thing I see happening: water will become more expensive for everyone in all of the lower western states that rely on Colorado water (NV, so cal, AZ).

My predictions as far as what will happen:

\*so cal will build desalination plants. They make more water but it is energy-intensive + the water is expensive.

\*More people will purchase water conservation type of products. Low flow everything. Grass lawns will start to be replaced with low-water use landscaping.

\*Agriculture farms will invest more in water saving infrastructure. They will grow crops that are better optimized for situations where water is expensive.

As far as stocks that will benefit, I'm not really sure. You would really have to research it. If there is a specific company that focuses on water conservation equipment, that stock might be a good way to play it."

Once the online gaming industry is legal, up and running, the cost of running a website or app is zilch compared to the expensive overhead of a vegas casino. Travel, housing, entertainment and dining all have significant investment; initial and on-going. I didn't say Vegas will become unpopular or that people won't still want to do the things they do in Vegas, but if even a chunk of the gamblers who go to vegas opt for online instead, it changes the calculus quickly for a casino owner as they have such high, fixed overhead to operate all the secondary and tertiary businesses that make a Vegas casino resort a resort."

There's no more water to sell, federal government or not.

Phoenix and Vegas (moreso Vegas) have been especially  egregious about wasting water (think Bellagio fountains) and no one is keen to pony up for the actual costs. 

The only real answer would be desalination and pipelining on a massive scale. The energy required to pull that off would be immense, and nuclear is probably the only way to make that happen. Good luck there."

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit crayon diarrhea all over you, the likes of which would make even Jackson Pollock jealous, and you will drown in it. You're fucking done, kiddo."
2021-06-19 14:38:17,wallstreetbets,MMs make the same amount of money whether or not you hand off the contract to someone else.
2021-06-19 16:26:47,wallstreetbets,Spent $350 on $19c for CLNE expiring June 18th. Was up to $2300 at one point because the contract price increase so much. Held on thinking there would be a squeeze. There was no squeeze and they expired worthless.
2021-06-19 15:59:54,wallstreetbets,This is why I sell covered calls to you morons
2021-06-19 15:39:57,wallstreetbets,Except it was originally for OTM FDs. Either they go to 0 or you make a killing. Go big or go home.

2021-06-19 15:03:11,wallstreetbets,I've had a lot of options go from being down to being wildly profitable. Not necessarily the same thing as holding to 100% loss but the violitility of options can be insane
2021-06-19 16:24:33,wallstreetbets,"I buy only one type of option, every time: stock price at 64, I buy strike 40 out a month for 25$. Gives me leverage and almost no premium. It stock drops to 40, I buy 25 strike for 16$. Now I got 2 calls for less than the price of 100 shares at 64. 

These are my favorites. 50/50 calls and stock"

2021-06-19 18:10:39,wallstreetbets,That's a special type of retard who diamond hands an OTM option.
2021-06-19 15:19:35,wallstreetbets,"Such a pessimistic investing attitude that conflicts with my lived experience.  Just because an Option is OTM now doesn't mean that it won't be worth 10x more by Friday.  DUH.  If it was always OTM then how the heck would anybody ever make money?  Riddle me that.

Guys, there are a lot of people who post on here as if they lick the screen of their tvs whenever Jim Creamer is on.  These are the kind of people who will refer to themselves a ""value investors"" or responsible people.  The stock market isn't for that.  Investing is for showing your wife's boyfriend that you are a risk taker and not to be trifled with and posting screenshots of loss porn to prove you have huge balls.  Anything else is just 6% in your 401k month after month until you die because you were so stupid as to think you would get that money back 30 years from now.  Wise up.  Don't be a sucker.  It's a rigged casino."

2021-06-19 17:44:39,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes i think the market movers just shorting as they like and when people think they lose money they actually make it by buying put options that comes out ITM because they always force it to be ITM when they like.
If such a thing is possible, isn't it sort of endless diluting as they please?
So yea eventually they close their shorts and lose by it, but cant they make a ton on the way to make that loss irrelevant?"
2021-06-19 18:21:08,wallstreetbets,So am I fucked? I am holding on Wish 12.5 call exp July 16. Then 22.5 in October and dew in December. Same goes with CCIV! ü§¶üèª

2021-06-19 18:34:20,wallstreetbets,"Learned that early on after I lost about $1,200 when I first started haha.  

I‚Äôd also add that averaging down on options is extremely risky and almost never worth it to try and get out unless you are as close to certain as you can be that there will be enough movement to break even. And it only works on consistently high volatility stocks like TSLA, GME, AMC etc. when they‚Äôre making huge swings."

2021-06-19 19:29:02,wallstreetbets,I spent 3k on CLNE $13 calls right before it gained traction. Was up almost 20k so I decided to sell 6k worth (initial bet + 100% gain) and let the rest ‚Äúride the squeeze‚Äù. Good thing I did that because I held the rest too long and sold the remaining calls (which were worth around 13k at one point) for roughly $1500.

2021-06-19 19:31:13,wallstreetbets,Best part about this post is that the concept of an expiry longer than a week isn't mentioned. I love this place.
2021-06-19 14:47:40,wallstreetbets,"Discipline. Use half your settled cash day 1, the other half day 2 and by day 3 the cash from day 1 has settled. Rinse and repeat"

2021-06-19 18:19:29,wallstreetbets,Yah I remember seeing the term in 2018ish or at least 2019.
2021-06-19 17:17:46,wallstreetbets,Reddit is serious business üòé
2021-06-19 18:22:54,wallstreetbets,You must be new. It was a joke. Haha. Wallstreetbets is  for gamblers. Not for investing.
2021-06-19 17:53:14,wallstreetbets,"Buying shares isn't making a bet, it is making an investment.

An option is a bet that the price will be higher (or lower) than a certain value on or before a certain date. Its essence is that of a bet. That is why the sub is called WallStreetBets"
2021-06-19 17:44:41,wallstreetbets,This is dumb
2021-06-19 19:57:09,wallstreetbets,What? The lesson here is implied volatility and theta eat the fuck out of options. Most newcomers like me took the strategy of holding from antiquated rules of owning stocks. But options are heavily time based. You own them for a fraction of time since the majority of options expire worthless.
2021-06-19 15:29:01,wallstreetbets,"No, that was me"
2021-06-19 16:21:02,wallstreetbets,Big beefaroni hits different

2021-06-19 15:26:37,wallstreetbets,Faster than Chris Christie is a low bar.
2021-06-19 17:55:56,wallstreetbets,"This is true on underlying who barely sell options, most MM's will buy your options back (the spreads are just going to be wacky on option chains you should probably avoid). This is because options always have a chance until they close, and they can also balance out other positions and provide liquidity. Any stock that has options has MM's to buy and sell  those...however, if you're going deep OTM, you're going to find your options having zero value, to anyone (even if they show a value for that option) very quickly in option chains where you already see a huge spread. 

TL;DR you will always find a buyer and seller in more frequented option chains. Ones that have wide spread gaps warn you that it isn't the case, and you could get jipped and/or be completely on your own if you go OTM on their chains. Good luck!!"
2021-06-19 15:51:12,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt have to but if there are no buyers the MM can buy back at less then the options theoretical price  in most cases (something that is a statistically good strategy at large scale). Also about 55% of all options are closed out before expiry so it does show that market makers are willing to buy back.
2021-06-19 19:51:03,wallstreetbets,"You sell options for work, or for fun? 

Because a market maker and a MaRkEt MaKeR are two diff things"

2021-06-19 14:06:32,wallstreetbets,100p? Does those even print lol. Why not go for like. 380P ?
2021-06-19 15:04:33,wallstreetbets,"Bingo this shit right here is the way. And if you really do end up blowing 50% of your account day after day after day, you'll either end up broke or above 25k in no time. No matter what your problem will be solved."
2021-06-19 15:38:14,wallstreetbets,"There is no pattern day trade rule when you have a cash account, is the point. You aren‚Äôt restricted to a certain amount of trades, you just can only spend your settled cash. For options, on E-Trade for example, the cash will settle T+1. Buy today, settles overnight, buy again tomorrow."
2021-06-19 17:18:56,wallstreetbets,Just don't be poor. /s
2021-06-19 15:22:28,wallstreetbets,Oh lord ü§¶üèΩ
2021-06-19 15:39:13,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs T+1 for options on almost every broker, you just wait till the next day for it to settle?"
2021-06-19 18:36:21,wallstreetbets,Ah no you‚Äôre right I know it‚Äôs for yolos. Just sucks to see people losing tons of money they might not have had to lose if they timed their decision differently. The exact same decision made an hour earlier or later could completely change the outcome even if the option never switched to itm or otm.
2021-06-19 16:54:17,wallstreetbets,"Not if it's grated properly and you take your antacids with chugged milk. 

That shit is Fruity Pebbles yo.

Or you can just butt chug it with a Crayon Bong."
2021-06-19 17:14:35,wallstreetbets,Buying back happens with two things in mind: how much risk I have and is there something else that is better than not buying it back. Closing a position has it's own reward. Booked profits are the real profit.

2021-06-19 19:56:16,wallstreetbets,Cool. So a literal market maker would have to buy options no one else wants. Why do you think there‚Äôs always bids and asks for options

2021-06-19 13:39:17,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôll pay off later this year
2021-06-19 14:21:23,wallstreetbets,"Well if I was bag holding a company, atleast it's TSLA, you are going to be more than fine in the long run, might want to AVG down but you probably feel too deep. You are going to be fine, delete apps, don't sell."
2021-06-19 13:38:38,wallstreetbets,Dont listen to gey bears. Tesla will be at 1k EOY
2021-06-19 16:09:53,wallstreetbets,Not like you have a choice
2021-06-19 17:25:39,wallstreetbets,Buy more to bring down your average
2021-06-19 17:32:14,wallstreetbets,Tesla was killing me and I was only $28 in
2021-06-19 17:58:20,wallstreetbets,wow what you lost is more than I and my family made since they lived.
2021-06-19 18:01:22,wallstreetbets,I just don‚Äôt see why y‚Äôall can‚Äôt at the very least yolo in 2 actions and wait for it to come down a bit. Like if you bought half of those now it‚Äôs be much better

2021-06-19 13:48:42,wallstreetbets,This will pay off certainly. Hard to go wrong with Tesla.
2021-06-19 13:39:20,wallstreetbets,"If you wait 2-3 years to sell, this actually isn't the worst move that you can make, since Tesla will go back up one day."
2021-06-19 13:36:41,wallstreetbets,Good luck man. Rates are increasing and the market is about to go full bear retard. Everything gonna tank
2021-06-19 17:51:56,wallstreetbets,hold!!! squeeze is coming
2021-06-19 18:32:46,wallstreetbets,"I love the guy but he has made some promise that is just not possible in next 5-7 years. The level 4 and level 5 driving is not possible anytime soon until the cities start becoming smart. Meaning, the traffic lights have to talk to cars or car have to talk to other cars (V2X or vehicle to infrastructure). You can see that the dream it far out because Waymo is also folding. 

Tesla might have lots of data but it's not as easy as just training a model to drive you around. Tesla had billions of miles of data for years but they're still at Level 2 while Cruise is at Level 3!! Think about that for a second. Tesla also sold the hardware ADAS package but they will have to deliver full ADAS in few months because it was promised like 2 year AGO. If they can't deliver they will have to refund the $10,000 to each customer that bought it. That will be a huge loss plus the loss of hardware that's already deployed in each car. 

I highly recommend Blackberry BB! You will do about 10x within a year i believe. Not a financial advice but do your own DD."
2021-06-19 17:08:29,wallstreetbets,"I have about triple your position, but got them pre-split 800. Not sure why wsb is so toxic with Tesla. My price target is ATH again by year end, world largest company in 2 years."

2021-06-19 13:41:25,wallstreetbets,Ufff ur fucked u idiot ass.. Tesla was so last years pump.. Now is AMC
2021-06-19 16:18:18,wallstreetbets,Genuine question why people would sell when big companies go down when they will nearly always come back in like less than a month
2021-06-19 18:20:47,wallstreetbets,I have a spreadsheet of rules I‚Äôve learned trading. Never bet against Michael Burry is definitely on it.

2021-06-19 14:04:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs definitely easy to go wrong with tesla. This comment is beyond idiotic.
2021-06-19 15:22:29,wallstreetbets,Do you not see other manufacturers catching up to the EV trend? And actually making solid cars?
2021-06-19 16:33:04,wallstreetbets,If he sells covered calls he should be completely fine. Would be wasteful not selling them though

2021-06-19 16:22:22,wallstreetbets,"It's overvalued as it is. Ford will dominate the EV market in a few years, tesla will lose value quickly. I'm not a Ford fanboy in the slightest but that's my opinion."
2021-06-19 14:09:27,wallstreetbets,You do if you‚Äôre not fucking retarded. You can always buy it back or sell puts until you get assigned.
2021-06-19 16:16:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah but I heard the real winner was Elon because he filmed the whole thing which he uploaded when he invented the hub

2021-06-19 17:49:10,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre wrong, there is absolutely no way of going wrong with telsa, that would suggest that someone buying at the top of the historic share value price during an inflationary cycle period is not poised for imminent great success."

2021-06-19 16:34:03,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs overvalued bc of the infinity gamma squeeze it went under and all the Tesla shorts getting clapped hard. I mean loyal auto legacy people will most likely buy Ford, etc in the beginning but once they see the supercharger network, UI of Tesla, and many other things they‚Äôll be doing‚Ä¶auto legacy companies won‚Äôt stand a chance. Tesla also has the 4680 batteries they haven‚Äôt even implemented in their cars and that alone will make the model 3 and y be in the mid 400 mile range easily"
2021-06-19 17:06:33,wallstreetbets,Ford isn‚Äôt putting enough into battery production IMO to dominate like you say
2021-06-19 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the Mach E? Just the infotainment system is a joke. Tesla is the Apple of EVs.
2021-06-19 16:30:56,wallstreetbets,Ford is dead nobody will like their brand unless they change the next gen minds at least for another decade
2021-06-19 14:23:43,wallstreetbets,Options are so expensive on that stock. It‚Äôs dumb not to sell them.
2021-06-19 14:15:45,wallstreetbets,We do sell puts ^^
2021-06-19 14:25:31,wallstreetbets,Who said they are not retarded?
2021-06-19 14:06:39,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt play it off as if you were being ironical. You‚Äôre a Musk ball-licker. Taste the scrotum.
2021-06-19 18:32:54,wallstreetbets,"Euros are accepted here. If you‚Äôre not brown and from the south, we let you in. I have a British friend who lives in Idaho that invests and trades in the American markets."
2021-06-19 18:20:19,wallstreetbets,"you're not buying the calls. say you hold 100 shares of Tesla then you can sell 1 call that is considered covered because you can pay the shares out without needing to go into the market. The point of selling high OTM calls like say 800+ $ calls is that for someone to exercise it then they pay you 800$ a share + the premium already paid to buy those shares from you. If the share price is lower than 800 then the call expires useless since it's cheaper to buy in the market and it won't be exercised (if they do they're an idiot and just go buy back the shares cheaper than you sold em at.) Now when it expires you keep your premium + the shares. 

Generally pretty safe play if you know how high a stock can go and you give yourself an extra margin of safety though you can certainly get higher premiums playing more risky and closer to being ITM"
2021-06-19 18:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much it from yung_white or whatever the fuck that name is. If I was selling covered calls on TSLA Monday, I would probably go with the 650-660 strike expiring Friday. However, as someone else pointed out theta decay is maximized 3-6 weeks out, so I might go with the July monthly at $680"
2021-06-19 16:42:25,wallstreetbets,You bring up good points for sure.
2021-06-19 16:49:53,wallstreetbets,"????? Ford is absolutely not dead, the f150 is the best selling vehicle in America and the ev version got 45,000 preorders within 48 hours of its announcement, you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about"
2021-06-19 14:25:22,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not just dumb. It‚Äôs retarded.
2021-06-19 15:35:26,wallstreetbets,Ngl Tesla premiums have dropped significantly ever since it‚Äôs 30% drop and consolidation. Premiums still are worth a lot but not as much when it was in the 800s

2021-06-19 18:38:53,wallstreetbets,Which broker accepts European residents?
2021-06-19 18:38:33,wallstreetbets,Would people buy $800 calls? Wouldn't the sale price be low?
2021-06-19 18:26:51,wallstreetbets,That too
2021-06-19 19:36:34,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know about that. I meant the US in general. Move your physical being here.
2021-06-19 19:25:15,wallstreetbets,There is an open interest of 1800 contracts at $800 expiring June 25. People buy them like lottery tickets and people buy them to hedge. Far OTM calls have their place.
2021-06-19 18:41:45,wallstreetbets,That's where you decide how close to ITM you want to sell it to find a buyer / better premiums but then your risk goes up too.

2021-06-19 17:57:35,wallstreetbets,"There's a joke to be had about Robin Hood and glory holes... in fact, glory hole should become a technical stock term. The meme rocket stock that crashed, all in a big glory hole... actually, do Americans even know what a glory hole is..."
2021-06-19 17:57:44,wallstreetbets,"Instead of saying you use Robin Hood, you should‚Äôve just said you‚Äôve been seeing prostitutes."
2021-06-19 17:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Your wife thinks you‚Äôre cheating. I read a psychology study that said, ‚Äúif your partner accused you of cheating and is reading your text messages. That means she is already cheating on you.‚Äù You whole situation sucks bro. Good luck? üòÖ"
2021-06-19 17:59:09,wallstreetbets,Just tell her robin is an old friend from the hood

2021-06-19 15:05:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this sponsored content is really low energy. Who ever still uses Robinhood deserves what‚Äôll happen in the coming days, weeks after their shenanigans they‚Äôve already pulled previously. Really who says Robin Hood?"
2021-06-19 16:42:01,wallstreetbets,Why divorce him when she gets free loss porn AND the chance to cuck him?
2021-06-19 16:27:10,wallstreetbets,Hell I'm divorcing you right now for being on Robinhood...

Edit: it occurred to me you may be partaking in an experiment and that‚Äôs why your still supporting RH‚Ä¶if that‚Äôs the case, everything else is still applicable, no excuses!"

2021-06-19 13:54:03,wallstreetbets,Using robinhood? Mega ban
2021-06-19 15:03:54,wallstreetbets,Of course he is. His wife just has a new boyfriend now.
2021-06-19 15:31:05,wallstreetbets,"Hey, how am I supposed to be his wife's boyfriend if he isn't married?"
2021-06-19 14:37:33,wallstreetbets,He had his chance to lose an easy 150 lbs and he blew it.

2021-06-19 17:55:35,wallstreetbets,Have you seen all the screenshots lately? They have been pushing Robinhood HARD. I say we start a petition for mods to ban them altogether.
2021-06-19 15:45:13,wallstreetbets,The X rated texts would have drawn attention away from the underlying story. Which is to avoid RH by all means since this is obviously a shill post.
2021-06-19 17:15:01,wallstreetbets,Spot on. This fake ass Robinhood post is my cue to unsub from WSB. This place went from my fave sub in 2020 to a dumpster fire in such a short period of time.

2021-06-19 16:26:05,wallstreetbets,"so go with Fidelity or TD. Do you know why we hate Robinhood? During the first GME rise RH forced sold peoples shares ""to protect them"", halted contract sales until they expired and stopped all trading of GME. YOUR money. YOUR assets. When it came time to cash out RH refused. It was dirty. Google it. You can see the screen caps where RH said ""weve liquidated your assets automatically to protect your account"". Ive never even heard of Scott Trade, TD or Fidelity (brokers with a long history) ever doing this. And they were around during the 08 crash. Only WeBull and RH that Ive heard have ever touched clients assets without their permission. i think what likely happened is, since most day traders see red they believed, laws of average, theyd make more money by not buying the shares and using a credit system. But thats just a conspiracy theory. Unless congress or a lawsuit llooks into it, Ill never know the truth."

2021-06-19 18:24:55,wallstreetbets,"Privacy is still important in a relationship. Having a partner *does not* mean they stop being individuals. I think being urged to share phone and account passwords on the basis of ""trust"" is a red flag in most all relationships. 

If you trust your partner, you shouldnt feel the need to helicopter over their personal life. If you do, that's just unhealthy paranoia and/or a sign that you shouldnt be with the person you're with.

Hey OP, **positions or ban.**"
2021-06-19 12:47:45,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD OP. I think Wall St continually undervalues $CRSR and price to sales, PE is lower than peers and other similar growth companies. 

3 $30 2023 LEAPS I am up on and I will continue to accumulate shares when under $33. 

Good luck!"
2021-06-19 12:30:29,wallstreetbets,"I unfortunately made a similar position at $38 due to the last WSB pump before it dropped back down to lower 30s. If you are interested in CRSR I definitly think nows the time to get in at the 30-33 range as that‚Äôs probably best for short term and long term plays. Long term it‚Äôll take off based on all the analytics due to a variety of reasons you can do your own research on. Just don‚Äôt FOMO like me and buy in the upper 30s if you are looking to get into CRSR in the next couple weeks. Looks like price keeps getting pushed back down and bottoms at 31-32 range as of this writing. Obviously not financial advice, just my experience. Also still hodling my position at 8k and bought in another 3k as it dipped the last couple days to bring my average to $34."
2021-06-19 12:38:07,wallstreetbets,"I like corsairs products. When video cards are easier to get and are not crazy high in price, a company like Corsair SHOULD put up some good numbers. They make everything from cases and power supply units to RAM sticks and cpu coolers. All decent to amazing quality. A large percentage of gaming PCs out there contain Corsair branded parts. 
They also have the elgato video capture devices under their umbrella which is a mainstay for every teenage kid who dreams of being a streamer and ‚Äúcontent creator‚Äù before they realize they will need a real job. 

Also in their subsidiary is SCUF a company that makes modified gaming controllers used and promoted by big streamers like NICKMERCS who have very big followings across all the major social platforms. 

I love this stock but the volatility of the market these days makes everything a fucking gamble. So good luck out there. No matter how smart the play seems keep your butthole clenched."
2021-06-19 12:58:02,wallstreetbets,Long CRSR... its a matter of time this runs above 40 and stays above 40
2021-06-19 12:38:18,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve gone pretty big on CRSR, and I‚Äôm adding to it as it‚Äôs in the low 30s. If it pops above 32 on Monday I may just throw what I‚Äôve planned to put in it, but I‚Äôve been hoping it dips a little bit lower so I can take full advantage

Edit: Although I believe in this DD. Show us a pic of that at 38, 13k shares?!"
2021-06-19 12:44:46,wallstreetbets,everyone loves corsair on discord lol. i already here ppl talking about their shit. sounds like a good company with good buzz. i‚Äôm in!
2021-06-19 13:03:21,wallstreetbets,Seems oversold after the early week pump. Expect it‚Äôll be up in the 40s again but might suffer in the short term.
2021-06-19 14:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Low valuation ratios compared to peers, very high short interest, major shareholder with 58% ownership (he‚Äôd be the selling pressure until he reaches 50%?). I personally see the recent retracement from breakout an opportunity to enter/increase at low prices"

2021-06-19 17:15:33,wallstreetbets,"I lost almost 8k on CRSR at the opening Monday, I like the stock but I will way until it hit bottom again then at 10k to it on a options with a very long expiration date to it, because I will go get my almost 8k back from the bigger pockets trader."
2021-06-19 18:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Love CRSR but it has been my longest red position lol briefly broke green last week, none the less a good long hauler."
2021-06-19 17:29:41,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is about to have a very good couple of years. We‚Äôre on the cusp of the ddr5 super cycle which will cause millions of new builds over coming years, especially as the gpu shortage gets better. 15 forward pe, 1.5 price to sales, and $3 billion market cap on $2.1 billion projected ‚Äò21 revenue (from a conservative ceo).

Black rock and others are in. If you aren‚Äôt using this sideways action to build a position on one of the most misunderstood and undervalued stocks in the market I don‚Äôt know what to tell you."
2021-06-19 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,"These prices won‚Äôt last for long, smooth brains have picked this one up. CSCR üöÄ üöÄ"
2021-06-19 15:37:54,wallstreetbets,"Its rare in this day and age with the market the way it is you find a stock that is genuinely undervalued, especially in this sector. At the minute the prices on this stock are equivalent to the same prices we saw at the absolute bottom on the April FUD where tech stocks absolutely sank. It can't go any lower IMO and its the reason I loaded up on friday. I wanted to get into this stock for a while and now I think is the perfect time"
2021-06-19 16:44:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding calls right now. They just fell to their normal resistance level, the chart looks really promising."

2021-06-19 13:52:29,wallstreetbets,"Why do these CRSR DD‚Äòs keep popping up on the weekends lately? Don‚Äòt get me wrong, I‚Äòm a long-term stock holder and even scalped it a bit last Monday pre-marked. But, wtf?"
2021-06-19 18:27:25,wallstreetbets,"CRSR is undervalued as fuck but it will not go up untill eagletree finish selling their 55m shares, just the fact of it."
2021-06-19 16:35:21,wallstreetbets,"pumping bags, huh?"
2021-06-19 18:59:16,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a different world now too, I remember when workplaces used to buy you cheapo keyboard and mice with a shitty single monitor set up. Now I get to spend hundreds of dollars on shit that doesn‚Äôt make me much more productive but makes it more fun to work. We have gaming mice and mechanical keyboards in both our home offices and the actual office. I think the next step will probably be getting stream decks for employees. 

Once you get the expensive shit it is hard to go back and Corsair is going to be a big winner in the work from home or office world as long as they keep releasing marginally better products every couple of years."
2021-06-19 19:24:03,wallstreetbets,"I like Corsair, but I use Logitech all the way for peripherals"

2021-06-19 18:34:17,wallstreetbets,No matter what anyone says this is a great pick for solid long term gains! In 3-5 years people are gonna be salt they ignored this stock 100% guarentee
2021-06-19 14:00:26,wallstreetbets,"Bagholder spotted , think of the opportunity cost"
2021-06-19 13:10:22,wallstreetbets,"Logitech is the better play here and also pays a dividend

2021-06-19 17:06:25,wallstreetbets,Bag holder spotted. CRCS was a pumo and dump.

2021-06-19 19:42:49,wallstreetbets,"""Premium"", about as premium as my GFs new PT. Sorry OP but this peace of ""made in China with a US sticker on it"" isn't premium. Its not something hyped up amongst *actual gamers or PC builders*. They're not unique, not innivative, they got nothing...

2021-06-19 13:36:04,wallstreetbets,What are leaps?
2021-06-19 12:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Currently the price is optimal. There's absolutely no downside risk. Only problem is whenever it tries to go up, it gets pushed down. Even if the stock is massively undervalued, no one just gets it."
2021-06-19 12:47:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah gonna need a timeline hoss.
2021-06-19 15:20:41,wallstreetbets,You seem to know a good bit. I heard they are planning to start making mobile phone products but haven't been able to find much. Do you know anything about this? Feel like any news about mobile products would give them a great bust if it's true.
2021-06-19 12:56:35,wallstreetbets,Added.
2021-06-19 15:00:32,wallstreetbets,"The pump was completely fabricated by internet hype. There was no news, no reason for it to jump almost 50% in one day. It's already fully corrected that should tell you somethig."
2021-06-19 15:30:29,wallstreetbets,Agreed. There is higher than normal short interest and it's something to note but most of us are not claiming any sort of short squeeze. Thought I'd say that because I've seen people freaking out anytime short squeeze is mentioned (usually in a negative way). It's still a factor and should be mentioned.
2021-06-19 14:06:15,wallstreetbets,How many more shares do they have left? Or % of company? Seems like this is the reason the price is pinned
2021-06-19 15:25:23,wallstreetbets,"If you listen to any conference calls, they are very confident in exceeding their numbers and lowering their debt this year. Insider selling happens often, I mean we saw this with NET recently too a few months back. But you‚Äôre right, eagle tree is the main issue. Until they unload their shares, the price will keep dumping around $35. Most people recognize this is a great long term play because their fundamentals are the best they‚Äôve ever been"
2021-06-19 14:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Honestly its not that bad, its not like you are being diluted."
2021-06-19 19:46:02,wallstreetbets,The red still hurts though.
2021-06-19 15:34:36,wallstreetbets,"Plenty of big money ""boomers"" are invested too. BlackRock for example and plenty other smaller  financial and capital management groups as well. It's got good support from all sides I'd say."
2021-06-19 15:25:22,wallstreetbets,People work during the weekdays and have time to right on Saturday or even geek out and stay up late Friday. Honestly it usually seems the ones on Saturday and Sunday are a bit more down to earth and there is some variety to them. Idk I'd be interested to see if anyone else has noticed this or feels the same/differently. How is spending time writing long dd during the work week except people who are doing it as work. Maybe maybe not
2021-06-19 13:09:27,wallstreetbets,No volume any how
2021-06-19 15:39:06,wallstreetbets,Lol what do you want us to see in the charts please tell me. Logi doesn't build ANY PCs only side add on products which definitely made me less interested in them. Further more CRSR's PE is significantly lower than logi's further making it a better by with better fundamentals.
2021-06-19 15:40:30,wallstreetbets,"They are ITM calls with an expiry date far into the future and a very high delta. The idea is that they‚Äôre a cheaper way of owning 100 shares of a stock while still getting relatively similar gains from the stock‚Äôs price increase. It‚Äôs a bet that a stock will increase in price over a longer period of time (as opposed to FDs, which is a bet over a very short period of time)."
2021-06-19 13:46:45,wallstreetbets,"Search YT. INTheMoney explains them best imo 

Also r/thetagang"
2021-06-19 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,Basically ITM long call for 1 year+ that levers 100 shares for far less than the face value of owning 100 shares at market price. Downside is you're paying for price action instead of holding shares outright.
2021-06-19 15:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Easy explanation ? Your buying options calls that are for at least 3-4 months later dates, usually people would buy out of the money calls for example expiring in September , or even next January"
2021-06-19 17:46:57,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs absolutely no downside risk‚Äù

I know we‚Äôre retards in here, but please don‚Äôt listen to anything this guy says."
2021-06-19 13:01:55,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what CC are for, make money off the flat trading"
2021-06-19 16:00:54,wallstreetbets,I do not know of any Corsair plans to make phone stuff.
2021-06-19 17:23:31,wallstreetbets,Razor and I think Asus recently put out some high end mobile phones. So its possible they'll follow but idk how many of those really sell. Obviously they cna play any mobile game at the highest level but most games are probably atleast partially optimized for iPhones so idk that anyone would really care playing fortnite or w.e at max Fps on mobile.
2021-06-19 13:07:58,wallstreetbets,"You are a real one, good sir! I‚Äôm excited for this company"
2021-06-19 15:07:45,wallstreetbets,Oh I don‚Äôt disagree there. I was watching the hype last weekend and couldn‚Äôt see any reason why. Still CRSR has decent earnings and personally I think it‚Äôs oversold and slightly undervalued at 31. I doubt will selling pressure from eagle tree that it‚Äôll stay in the 40s for long until they‚Äôve exited their positions fully.
2021-06-19 18:25:24,wallstreetbets,It was up like 20 percent at the max and closed at like 10 percent...
2021-06-19 14:16:29,wallstreetbets,"They still have 55 mil shares, around 53% of the outstanding."
2021-06-19 15:46:18,wallstreetbets,"But how many CRSR DD's do we need every weekend? Call me tinfoil hat. Or maybe those DD's work the same way like optimal eBay action times... or methane production... You wanna give them enough time to ferment, gain steam and release their full potential Monday morning. Who knows."
2021-06-19 18:07:58,wallstreetbets,doesn't mean they won't build them in the future...
2021-06-19 16:01:11,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation, I think I‚Äôll def look into this."
2021-06-19 17:05:16,wallstreetbets,You can also leverage more at a smaller risk
2021-06-19 15:38:00,wallstreetbets,"I would say 3-4 months is the minimum timespan for leaps, usually they‚Äôre closer to 9-12 months or more out."
2021-06-19 17:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Or maybe specialized phones oriented toward streamers. Idk I'm sick of iPhones being the ""best"" option and I think a lot of other people are as well."
2021-06-19 15:20:26,wallstreetbets,"It's a weird time, this market. You have companies like Intel sitting at $55~ and can't move an inch, but then you have something like RBLX hit $100. It makes no sense and valuation seems to have nothing to do with actual metrics."
2021-06-19 18:38:21,wallstreetbets,TIL 43 is only 20% above $31.
2021-06-19 14:23:13,wallstreetbets,Guh. It will def get better as they sell.
2021-06-19 16:03:44,wallstreetbets,"I've just come across this one so far but I haven't looked at the very new ones. Guess I'll go check those out as well.
Edit. Looks like This is the only CRSR dd this weekend so I'm really not sure what your on about."
2021-06-19 18:10:50,wallstreetbets,Sure but they've had the time and now they are behind CRSR and others. It's like me saying TYSON'S should be valued higher because there is a possibility that they will start a fast food franchise. Doesn't make sense.
2021-06-19 16:00:35,wallstreetbets,Yea you have a poin t
2021-06-19 17:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Android has alot of good options too I think the issue with gamer phones is the stigma and there's very good ""normal"" phones from Samsung and such which is also just a more established brand. I've seen 1 gaming phone ever in public on a subway ever. I wouldn't count on it being a large source of revenue"
2021-06-19 15:37:07,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah fundamentals went out the window sometime last year. There‚Äôs been some great opportunities but some share prices are just ridiculously detached.
2021-06-19 17:40:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've got an Android. I still think there is some room for new brands in the phone market but it would mostly just be a specialized thing and it would get attention but I doubt it would be a very contributing factor to revenue. More of a shiny new product that gets some good PR

2021-06-19 16:05:34,wallstreetbets,Maybe but as far as I've seen shit dips after earnings calls regardless of whether it was good or bad news announced. I'd be more inclined to sell in any positive movement ahead of earnings with an eye towards buying the dip after if I wanted to maintain the same position

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I am more bullish about the longterm future of Canoo 





I consider Canoo as one of those investments that are totally misjudged by the mass market. Only if you take the time to really dive into their technology, their products and their vision, then the real value will show.

Unfortunately, as shareholders, I honestly believe we had to deal with one of the toughest roads of all post-SPAC plays. Getting pummeled for months and months. Not particularly because of the share price (who cares in the short term) but because the company was pivoting hard, while not giving enough details through March - May for shareholders to keep their confidence.

However, the earnings call in May and the Investor Day sealed it for me: Canoo is on it's way to become a strong global player in the EV ecosystem (not just car manufacturing). The most important take-aways for me were the following:

¬ª Manufacturing deal is done, and it sounds better than I hoped for. Our own factory with >$300 million dollars in incentives, operational in Q4 2023, in one of the most energy-neutral states in the USA (please correct me if I'm wrong), with a government who really want to support a strong EV company in their location.

¬ª The partnership with VDL Nedcar is excellent. Being from that region myself, I know VDL decently well. They have been doing contract work for many, many years for large automotive companies. VDL Nedcar is a staple and a very important company for the region. They are the real deal. Canoo has been getting a lot of attention in the news here. Added value that this gives direct exposure in the European market, way earlier than I anticipated. As Tony said, that after the first models are sold in Q4 2022 in the USA, Europa will soon follow.

¬ª Their confirmation that they have the capital to bring the Lifestyle Vehicle to market is very re-assuring. Especially as they explained their calculations and thought proces, instead of just saying 'oh yeah sure, we got this'.

¬ª Their focus on data and technology is interesting. I am a bit skeptical about the expected addressable market and their math. But I am excited that they want to build an EV ecosystem, instead just cars. Although I am hoping they are not spreading their focus too much.

¬ª Their subscription model might be less important than before, but the business model regarding the 1st to 4th owner is underappreciated. I don't see any other car maker focus on the next owners. Canoo understands very well that they can be part of the customer journey and add value over the entire lifespan of the vehicle, getting revenue after after resale or wanted upgrade / personalization.

¬ª I was also impressed by a couple of the other senior managers. Especially the chief manufacturing and the marketing guy. They really seem to know their stuff and seem genially passionate about their job. Als I have to give a compliment to Tony, who is taking on a more humble approach than during his first earnings call. Guess we are not just seeing the company grow up before our eyes, but also the people involved.

I am looking forward to the future and are staying heavily invested in Canoo, if they keep true to their promises and roadmap. 

Wishing you all the confidence to join the ride as OG Canoobro's and hopefully one day, we can look back and tell our friends that we saw the potential early on. Until the share price goes up so much, you don't want people to know you are a millionaire. :-)"

2021-06-19 12:52:42,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand what the fuss is about range, even coming from a more rural area.  Canoo can charge 80% in 28 minutes.  Pull over for lunch and run your generator if you're that far out. I don't know about you but I dislike driving distances over 200 all in one go. It's better to stop and see what a local town is all about or get a milkshake at a diner along the way. The EV charging network is about to explode, so range can and should be less of an issue for both consumers and investors alike.   

TL;DR. Sure this is going to make for some different road trips, but maybe that's not such a bad thing."
2021-06-19 12:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Nah, Canoo will shine, but this is copied from the canoo thread.... Canoo has major league players, full scale contract manufacturing begins within months. American manufacturing begins in 2023. 

Short squeeze or not, Apple investment or not, Canoo will be a competitive player in the auto industry by 2025, if not sooner. 

Exceptionally bullish after IR day. They have defined cash flow to make it through manufacturing and will be able to aquire a talented workforce while doing so.

2021-06-19 13:12:23,wallstreetbets,"Issue being, we don't have the proper infrastructure to allow people to safely charge their cars while heading away to eat food.

People are used to filling up in less than 3 minutes at a gas station. Turning that into 30 minutes will need to give people more incentives to spend 30 minutes of their time in the same spot to charge.

This isn't Canoo or any other EVs fault, but it will definitely be a big concern.

Unless stations have dozens of chargers, you'll have lines of people stuck waiting. There are not many EVs on the road right now, so infrastructure needs to be built.

Tesla tossed around the idea of a Sonic for EVs where they essentially have a captured audience while they charge. Imo a big incentive would be steep discounts to those charging and making purchases.

All that can be done but ideally people will want faster charging, which we can't do with current batteries without killing them.

State incentives and taxes to build the infrastructure can work, but it will take time. We NEED this infrastructure before we start pushing more EVs."
2021-06-19 13:05:48,wallstreetbets,Not everyone has a home they can plug in at and the charging infrastructure is still lacking despite the efforts being made to bolster it. A larger range for vehicles is necessary not just for long trips but also so that people don‚Äôt have to waste time seeking stations to charge at on a regular basis. Furthermore the vehicles should be able to outlast potential power grid failures that may last a week or two (Texas) and not have an issue.
2021-06-19 13:06:05,wallstreetbets,Isn't it small scale contract manufacturing first? 1k units in 2022 and 15k in 2023
2021-06-19 14:21:27,wallstreetbets,"After seeing a coworker drive an older Cadillac truck and spending the equivalent of 10k a year on gas (with today's prices) I definitely see a bigger push being implemented somehow. Not everyone likes to only get 13mpg like he does.

Honestly, just having rows of electric chargers in American rest areas would help to keep long distance driving going while giving people a reason to just take a break after driving so far.

Soon as Im able I plan to buy the Canoo sports sedan assuming they don't introduce it at 40k+"

2021-06-19 13:25:49,wallstreetbets,"Nvidia doesnt make their chips for their high end graphics cards. Micron does. 

Nvidia is a solid company from a product standpoint. I just built a gaming computer and used the highest end parts available for gaming. I use a nvidia rtx3090 and intel i910900k for a cpu.

As someone who is in this market as a consumer i feel safe speaking on it. Nvidia is awesome. But right now AMD is about to sweep the whole market.

AMD not only has very comparable graphics cards at a better price point but they also make their own cpus. 

AMD at the moment is gaining major ground. Their flagship cpus are THE BEST for workstations. Point blank. No comparisson. Their multi core cpu like the 5950x is actually as good as intels i910900k processor for gaming if not just a cunt hair better...plus it blows intel out of the water for multicore uses but at 2x the price. I used intels 10900k in my gaming build as it is neck and neck for the best cpu for gaming for half the cost. I have no use for the amd 5950x because i dont do content creation or stream. If i did i hands down wouldvw went for the 5950x.

Give them a full year of earnings without the pandemic lockdowns and see where its at then.

Im not nocking nvidia. I like their product.

Just look into what rigs these content creators, streamers, and gamers are using. Thatll give you the answer like a crystal ball

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Sunrun $RUN DD - seems ripe for the launch!!!! Analysts yelling a BUY and high Short InterestüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ Morgan Stanley analyst re-iterating it's BUY rating and raising target from $86 to $91 (with a **bull case target of $128**!!) now when the stock has been under pressure.

Stock price as of 18th June: $52.71

YTD: -24% (after a 20% increase in past 3 days); 52w high of $100 in Jan and now trading at \~$50

**Short Interest: 33mio shares (23% of float) -** covering of the shorts itself can shoot it to beyond the price targets!

Market cap: 10.7bn with 2021e revenues of \~$1.4bn

Morgan Stanley analyst: We view Sunrun as the most compelling clean energy stock they cover, driven by minimal growth reflected in the stock, a growing 'economic wedge', low financing costs, consumer demand for reliability and convergence of EVs & renewables.

The stock is reflecting \~6y of continued operation followed by zero customer additions - meaning Sunrun will go out of business after that, which is nuts!

The rapid growth of EVs adoption will be a major source of upside and can create as much value as existing set of customers.

Addressable market is large and rising, only 3% penetrated so far. The upside potential is huge!!

And you need to roll up, out, credit when your covered calls are in money. I had to do it twice and still keep OCGN for weekly income.

When you roll, always do the credit roll. Therefore OCGN goes up or down you still gain (but going up is better)."

2021-06-19 11:43:25,wallstreetbets,"Rolling covered call with credit you will gain more, not cutting into your profits.

You will gain for increasing strike price and receving premium."
2021-06-19 12:09:43,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't the credit only offset the cost slightly and if you really end up that far itm then you'll still have your premiums for the week completely eaten up? It just doesn't add up in my head. Yeah I guess if you're bullish on the stock it's better to hold than fold, but I'm not. I really don't think it has much steam left in it. That EUA cancelling really hurt and now every time I open up my broker app I am forced to stare at all these spam articles about law suits against OCGN. It's not a good look.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cramer and WSB Cramer clearly has a pathological need to be liked by all. This is why he fawns all over money managers and CEOs on tv while trashing the retail investor in the next breath. Then he faux supports the small guy while throwing tiny bits of shade at the wealthy. He tries to ingratiate himself with all market cohorts (including Santelli) because he sees himself as a beloved, unifying, peace making market icon. He fails to realize that it is exactly this duplicity and two-faced behavior that causes everyone to hate him. He acts as if he embraces the self-assigned title of 'most hated man', but it is clearly destroying his ego. His attitude towards the WSB crowd illustrates his desperate attempt at relevancy. He tries to explain WSB to the masses, but he cannot because he is too slow to follow them and lacks the credibility to lead them. One day, he tells them to stick to AMC and GME. The next day he tells them to diversify away from those two stocks. It is sad to watch.

Jim, you will never be Mark Haines. His legacy was calling a market bottom during a crash on live television. Yours will be telling millions of people to hold onto Bear Stearns stock as it became worthless, annoyingly childish sound effects and chasing the WSB crowd around like a lost puppy.

Rant over, please return to your regularly scheduled program."

Crammer has some good comments some times but reaches too far to be relevant with younger retail crowds. WSB in my opinion is about sharing information between all as investors some long term and some short bets.  We all want to make money and take care of our families. Wealthy peeps have huge advantage over us retails in old days,  but now we have alot of shared current ideas and mostly good information and can move markets. They ( MM and Established Wallstreet.and Hedge Funds) don't like that and also HATE that they aren't the only information source that can pump and dump.."

Literally the only thing he cares about is as many people talking about him as possible.  All of his actions should be looked at through that filter.

And when you do that it makes sense.  And then you stop commenting or talking about him.  And then he goes away."
2021-06-19 10:39:20,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what to think about Cramer. He's obviously a character, the person we see talking online isn't the actual guy. He kinda wants to be in league with us, has talked about an AMA before, but then he never shows his face. He says he's alright with us, then he talks some shit.

What do you want, Jim? In or out?"

He's a talking head, on TV. His whole paycheck is dependent on people liking him, or at least trusting him enough to turn in for ratings. Fawning over fund managers and CEOs is one way to get these people on the show (they don't need money, most of the time, they need their ego's stroked), and retail investors a la WSB have (rightly) screwed with ""the system"", of which he is a part. Reverting course when WSB and individual stock buying retail investors are starting to be a new significant thing (rather than just sticking to pension funds, 401k managed funds and index funds, like the upper middle class used to do in decades past), is par for the course, for both politicians and entertainers alike

And if you're day trading, not holding for the moon, liking a stock one day and not the next is normal."
2021-06-19 13:22:52,wallstreetbets,Cramer does seem to be having a good time lately messing with wsb.

2021-06-19 13:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Jim doesn't hate the retail investor. He's just stating the obvious. What you guys are doing with meme stocks is not ""investing"" but pure speculation or gambling.

With "" investing"" you buy stocks for the long term and look at fundamentals.  With meme stocks, you are doing nothing more than gambling as the fundamentals of the company you're buying mean nothing! You can call it ""sticking it to the man"" ( I.e. Short seller, investment hedge fund, billionaire investor, etc) , but in the end it's all speculating or gambling. 

Sure you can make a ton of money, but you can lose your ass too. As long as you understand that, fine. Go ahead and play.  But don't blame Jim because he's not 100% on board with all your bets.

Down vote me if you want, I don't give a shit."
2021-06-19 16:48:36,wallstreetbets,"No he doesn't. He's a shifty old snake. He's been doing this for years. He absolutely knows what he's doing, he can milk this thing to oblivion. All he cares about is staying relevant. He doesn't give a fuck about being wrong or right. It's the views and attention. 

You think he's new to all the hate? His wife hates him  most likely and he doesn't care as long as she tunes into that sorry ass show where he pretends to know shit. He's been wrong on so many occasions it's become a part of his show but out of the million wrinkly old twats that would have considered for this job. He got it."

The biggest reason he hates WSB is because we don‚Äôt play along with his ridiculous persona the way all of his coworkers do. If he says something Moronic when he‚Äôs desperately trying to be funny, his fellow anchors, analysts, & CEO‚Äôs do their awkward fake laugh & WSB looks at him like üôÑ and he can‚Äôt stand it.

I find the condescension towards short term trades ironic since they account for the majority of trading volume and without them, the market would have little liquidity, which would only create larger spreads. All investing is speculation. I dislike him because he is two-faced and duplicitous, not because he approves or disapproves of any particular trade."
2021-06-19 15:33:41,wallstreetbets,"Meme stocks have different fundamentals. You're banking on its ability to hold public interest and have extreme volatility. Rather than having a really strong foundation like eps, etc. But people aren't just going in blind. I mean obviously some are. They hear about a cool new thing and fomo in with no research. But I don't think that's the norm. 

You're still buying based on market info and patterns. But they're different from any other stock. It's no more gambling than me buying any other security that isn't a sure thing. Like an index fund or amazon.

Then again I haven't been doing this for long and I could be actually retarded so who knows. But it doesn't seem random to me. The ones that seem actually random (ie: no high short interest, no opportunity for gamma squeeze, nothing that actually stands out about them, etc), seem extremely sketchy. And are probably just attempts at artificial inflation so they can gain personally."

You'd be better off going to Vegas as they would at least comp you a meal...

With respect to Cramer, he's a smart guy. Two faced? Duplicitous? I don't know if I would go that far. 

But I will say he is very pompous and believes others in authority, such as the Fed, looks to him or his commentary in their decision making( oh please Jim, the economic universe does not revolve around your opinions) and has a tendency to change his outlook on the market or stock at a moments notice and will not admit his prior position was wrong.

Also spy has hit its moving age and at least for the last year it has bounced off of it... 

Unless it seal team drills back down to the 390s and starts to follow the 2-5year average again. 

It will bounce up again next week more than likely. At least I hope because I fucked up by selling my puts to early."

With NVDA stock rallying, now is the time for investors to buy. The company‚Äôs share price is likely to continue rising in the lead-up to the July 19 stock split. And investors wanting to cash in on short-term gains can ride the pre-split momentum to decent returns. Of course, Nvidia is not a bad long-term investment. Investors who own the company‚Äôs shares as of June 21 will participate in the stock split and receive a dividend of three additional common shares for every share they hold. Over the long-term, those shares can be expected to grow substantially. Again the deadline is this Monday to get in on the action to benefit from the split."
2021-06-19 10:28:30,wallstreetbets,So you want everyone to jump in at ATH for what? Best to wait for the sell off after split to get in on it.

It wouldn't make sense otherwise... what would happen to people who bought between 6/21 and the split? they're stuck holding the same amount of shares/contracts, but they're just worth 1/4 as much?

edit: see u/limewire 's reply to a comment below.. he explains why the 6/21 date is important.  (basically, If you buy between then and the split, you'll still get the shares but will not receive dividends on the extra ones post-split)"

2021-06-19 11:14:39,wallstreetbets,The June 20th date is the record date. If you buy after (but before 20th July) you're not entitled to dividends on the new shares but you still get extra ones

2021-06-19 13:18:16,wallstreetbets,I accidentally made money on CLOV. I had bought some awhile back around $10 and had a standing sell order at $17 I forgot about. I random got a notice of the sale...
2021-06-19 16:32:50,wallstreetbets,Lol I made a ton of money on clov.  Just had to search for tickers with highest short interest.  It's a well known spac by Chamath.  You'd have to have been under a rock to not have heard of it.
2021-06-19 16:35:42,wallstreetbets,Lmao called the fuck out.  Thank you for automod. My brain hurts reading that.
2021-06-19 16:48:21,wallstreetbets,I think what most people are getting at is yes CLOV made a good amount of people money. I myself didn‚Äôt trust the long term $CLOV and believed that it was a way for Hedges to quickly make a bag for the extra shorts. So I bought low and decided my exit strategy was 2 days. 2 days past and I sold and the next day it was almost like clockwork when it got dumped. I don‚Äôt trust the Clinton‚Äôs and one of them is on CLOV‚Äôs  board so Ill just stand clear from that lol.
2021-06-19 16:51:23,wallstreetbets,"When the market wants to squeeze, then hedges will come out and squeeze with retail. I'm sure as shit not gonna baghold back to $10 lol"
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$Wish is going places (UP) First look at the charts. 

On Friday Wish closed above the 50 SMA for the first time since trading publicly. This is a sign of technical strength and big buying signal. This means wish will show up in more bullish stock screeners and it likely will cause some short algos to quit selling the stock and run for the hills. 

The large downtrend that has been in place since February has now clearly been broken. Last weekend I saw some posts that drew the downtrend line slightly higher and they argued Wish hadn‚Äôt broken out yet and still needs to prove itself. Now, clearly, no matter how you draw the trend line, it has been broken. Not to mention, Quad witching, which included June monthly options expiration, was yesterday which means that wall of expiring options is no longer hanging over the stock. 



The next obvious resistance is around $15 and I expect we head back there this week. Whether we break through without a fight or we stop and consolidate for a while remains to be seen. IMO this thing is obviously heading back to the IPO price of $24, but I personally won‚Äôt be trimming until we get a new all time high over $32. 

As for the fundamentals, they improved this week as well. IMO the way to value this company is as follows: 

Wish management has the following long term financial targets: 

-25-30% (of revenue) Cost of goods sold

-40-45% sales and marketing expense

-8-9% Gen and Admin expense

This implies long term net income margins of 16-27%. Analysts believe they will continue to grow revenue by 20-25% per year over the next several years.

Looking out 5 years to 2026 if we assume conservatively: 

-19% annual revenue growth from 2021 projected $3.2 billion 

-15% net income margin in 2026

-We get $7.64 billion in revenue and $1.146 billion non gaap net income. Put a 30-35 p/e multiple on that and you can see that the fundamentals will be dragging the share price much much higher over time. And the market will be forecasting that net income a few years beforehand and will adjust the valuation higher accordingly. I did a similar analysis with Pinterest in 2019 when they went public on the thesis that Pinterest makes $1 billion in net income by 2024. I heard some of the same bearish arguments back then that I‚Äôm hearing about Wish. And now we see the market expects Pinterest to make $1.30 in EPS in 2022 (1 billion would be like $1.61..)

None of these numbers include this new deal with Prestashop announced earlier this week: 

‚ÄúThrough this partnership, more than 300,000 merchants and brands on the PrestaShop platform will be able to quickly and easily sell to millions of consumers on the Wish marketplace. PrestaShop merchants will have free access to a direct integration module on the PrestaShop platform that connects them directly to Wish‚Äôs merchant dashboard. The module will sync their products and orders between PrestaShop and Wish. PrestaShop merchants will also benefit from a suite of additional marketing and sales support and a number of special incentives.

Wish will enjoy official ‚ÄúTrusted Partner‚Äù status on PrestaShop and will benefit from a special landing page on the PrestaShop platform for merchants.‚Äù

Wish will now have 300K more merchants selling on their platform. This improves the platform by offering new products for consumers and instantly fixes some of the criticisms that wish is just a bunch of low quality products from China. This will also come with MUCH more data for Wish to utilize. And some of these merchants will likely also use ProductBoost (advertising by wish) and Logistics. The Wish landing page link on the Prestashop platform is particularly valuable since it will lead many new consumers directly to wish. 

I‚Äôd like to remind everyone that the large rallies in 2020 for Pinterest and Facebook only occurred after they announced partnerships with Shopify...

2021-06-19 18:24:03,wallstreetbets,"There is no way wish should be trading at a valuation lower than 2017 when it had less users, rev, etc. 

Should be worth about $20 right now. I have 7400 shares at $11.88 average. I'm selling covered calls for fat premiums and have no worries about it dropping. Made $6500 and dropped my avg cost to $11. Will continue to write calls with the high IV. If it keeps dropping I'll just keep writing calls and rolling that shit out. 

Does the company sell shit, sure. But so does dollar tree, dollar general, a large portion of amazon, etc. Nothing these days are really buy for life. The argument of it selling junk is pointless if it's still selling with a growing userbase, rev, etc"

2021-06-19 10:10:51,wallstreetbets,In 5 years this will be AT LEAST 50 dollars a share. This is the way. Dollar store for the world and developing world as purchasing power parity becomes prevailing and developing nations get more disposable income. Merchants will then reach economies to scale with better logistics and quality. There are 8 billion people and counting in this world and the vast majority of them live in developing nations. There‚Äôs sooon much more market share to capture with primary consumers from developing nations and too much potential for this company to be not valued at at least 50 billion in market cap in the next 5 years given stable macroeconomic condition. Shit - a dollar store for the vast majority developing nations? I‚Äôm all in!

How much lower can it really go?  The lowest it every was was around 8 or so right?   I don't see Wish going entirely out of business.  So at worse I face a 30% loss of it goes down and never goes back up.  The meme power and potential upside is huge though.

2021-06-19 12:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Even though wish is a global company, the majority of their sales are the US & Europe. It‚Äôs main strategy has been a dollar tree/thrift store e-Commerce phone app.. These places can bring in lots of sales from people who don‚Äôt laugh at their product selection & appreciate the low prices. However, as has been discussed on the last 2 conference calls, they‚Äôre focusing on bringing in higher cost, branded products because those are more profitable to ship than 1 small cheap item. Their Prestashop (European e-commerce platform) partnership announced this week is a perfect example of the advances they‚Äôre making, brining on 300k new merchants, many new products, and many new customers as well."

Add that to the fact that they have awful customer support and almost never help customers, and you have a shitty company that's gonna get sued and lose.

No way I'll order on prime day. I have a ""Amazon Prime Shipping"" order from 2 weeks ago, shipped Monday, still hasn't arrived. Said it would be delivered yesterday. I contacted customer service and they put me on hold for 10 minutes and never came back. It took me 20 minutes and all I got was, ""I'd feel frustrated too if I paid for Prime and my packages didn't arrive on time"". 

I have been ordering 200-400 items a year for years and now  I'm going to order as little as possible through Amazon. YOUR SERVICE HAS BECOME HORRIBLE!!

ü§¨ amazon can kiss my a__! If you can't train your drivers to FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS - even the label states ""all deliveries to the back"" then you don't care that you lost me/my niece as customers after MANY yrs of being prime members!!!!!


I am a long-time Amazon customer. I have run into a problem with a camera I ordered from Amazon warehouse.

The correct box was sent to me but it contained the incorrect camera. I immediately reported and returned what was sent to me. I have now spoken with many agents at Amazon and I have run into a wall. 

The agents insist that the correct item was sent. They are correct in that the correct box was sent, but inside was the wrong item. I hope this was an honest mistake and not dishonesty in the Amazon warehouse shipping department.

I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I have started a claim with my credit card company.  It is hard to find someone at Amazon to speak to who understands the problem. 

Is there anyone at Amazon who can help?  Or must I rely on my credit card company to catch this fraud??


I am so disgusted w/the drivers who in past 2 months have just dumped my stuff on front door when I have ALWAYS had instructions for delivery to back patio! In past 2 months, I've had 10+ items stolen from front as the drivers cannot understand instructions or don't care! Before, I used to have drivers who DID deliver to the back but not in recent months! What happened?!!! Well, after a recent incident caught on Blink, when I saw the driver throw the pkg at the front then had the nerve to take a pic I complained to the supervisor or drivers dept!!! NOW, I am no longer an amazon customer after YRS of being loyal customer!! I am taking my business and money elsewhere! I have ordered from Target and Walmart before AND the UPS/their delivery drivers have ALWAYS put my stuff in my back patio!!! 


I have to make a return because their Goodthreads brand sucks. So now I have to drive 30 miles to a UPS store to return it? I may as well shop 30 miles away and cut you out! I'm sure the Waltons, Target and everyone will have specials next week! Good luck!

I have amazon prime in the US but now live in outside the US, why do I have to have another membership in my other country when it's all the same company!!! It makes no sense!


  Amazon after yrs of shopping online & few occasional calls to #CustomerService today was the #worst experience ever. Three reps need to be retrain. Starting with Kelly in #kentucky. Customer are always right even if they are  not. You need value the fact the the customer chose to spend their hard earn money  #amazon instead of elsewhere. No smiles today at all just over an hour of frustration. #JeffBezos 

This is B.S......I've waited more than 5 days before, and then it was delivered to the wrong address.....

2021-06-19 13:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Lmao this is one of the most desperate attempts at defending a shit company I have ever seen. Going to the 1-star rating of the largest package delivery service and the most used one on the planet, where a bunch of people are complaining about their packages coming 1 day late or it accidentally going to the wrong address. All of those things can be summed up to user error or shipping errors.

Find me 3000 complaints about Amazon stealing people's money and running off with it, then not picking up the phone when they call, and maybe delivering it over 1 1/2 months later. Wish does that. Amazon does not. Wish is not defendable. Amazon is.

Wish never delivers. Do some unbiased DD next time. Once again, ban."

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

2021-06-19 11:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for clarifying however this sub has devolved into a complete shit show. You can see why people frustrated.. heck you even know why. Bots pushing questionable tickers all day everyday.

The daily ticker thread was made specifically so bots can pump tickers, and you mods can put your hands up and say 'it's out of our control now, discussion dictates which tickers are included in the daily thread.' 

It's basically killing two birds with one stone.

I understand moderating a community such as this one can be a very unrewarding, tedious job but there has been a very noticeable shift in the actions of the Mods and this sub for sometime now. 

I'm sure I'll be down voted to hell for saying this but it had to be said. I'll go back to lurker mode now."

If you can't see that as an 'established' member of this sub then maybe its time to take of those rose tinted glasses you're wearing.

Even mainstream media are using WSB as the home of 'apes' when most have moved to other subs. It just fits the narrative and they use it to promote other  stocks with this whole 'ape talk' we see with every TICKER.

2021-06-19 15:42:18,wallstreetbets,"I don't know, why don't you? Are you saying that if *we don't* go and post about tickers ourselves when the users aren't doing it themselves, then therefore we must be *suppressing* them?

Do you have any specific posts in mind that were unfairly removed, or are you blaming the mods because WSB did what it always does: moved on to more meme stocks.

GME had the longest, most intense attention of any meme stock on here. I don't know how you can then turn around and say that it's being suppressed, especially when your reasoning appears to be ""it didn't just stay on top forever""?

But to directly answer your second question: I'd say different user demographics. If you're one of the newer users and don't like the WSB rules, you're more likely to go to one of the off-brands instead. It also *just so happens* that a huge portion of the new people are obsessed with GME and AMC for obvious reasons."
2021-06-19 19:28:44,wallstreetbets,"For the record (and really for anyone else who ends up reading this, since I doubt anything I could say would change *your* mind): we don't encourage this pump and dump shit. We'd like old WSB back and we're doing what we can to try and bring it back. If you think we're making any more money on this than you guys are then I don't know what to tell you. It's not like we're the ones organizing the brigades that come here constantly and then accuse us of being paid off when we figure it out and delete their shit.

Apparently we're being paid by tons of different sides to simultaneously censor *and* pump every stock? We're censoring all but a few ""chosen"" stocks when we deleted the posts that the WKHS and CLNE subreddits brigaded this week. We're also apparently censoring GME and AMC according to the brigades from SuperStonk. And yet according to guys like you, we're also only allowing posts for those few select stocks. What would *you* like to see done? What do you think I should do differently?

And I looked in your history to find your post. Your post was deleted by the bot because it was a total of two sentences long. Seriously, dude?"
2021-06-19 12:09:21,wallstreetbets,"1) I don‚Äôt believe you

2) Yes. The sub is in a fucked state right now. And the mods are trying to fix it. It‚Äôs not easy. They literally have to infiltrate pump and dump discords and secret Reddit pump and dump chats to ban users abusing systems to try and cash out. 

What you‚Äôre wrong about is the ‚Äúactions of the mods‚Äù changing. What changed is the sheer amount of fucking work they have to do to try and make WSB even the tiniest bit manageable."
2021-06-19 12:46:24,wallstreetbets,I heard about wsb off blind personally.
2021-06-19 14:58:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the market manipulation's been getting really bad. For some reason people are having a *really* hard time understanding that if the end goal of their comment is to bring the price up, then it's manipulation..

Every time I see the words ""we need"" now my eye twitches, even outside of WSB.

We try to remove and/or ban when we see them but it's harder when you look through a post's comments, clear them out, and then a new wave shows up after you leave. So we end up relying on reports and the bot mostly, since otherwise we would constantly have to revisit the same posts throughout the day.
And that shit's just boring lol."
2021-06-19 13:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Looking at your most recently removed post it's better suited as a comment not it's own post. Secondly the ""distraction"" talk. There are fucking 1000s of stocks, one isn't a distraction to another. Companies can exist outside of your favourite ticker."
2021-06-19 10:30:55,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs actually something that can‚Äôt be proven, it‚Äôs more of an opinion post. Why not just post about it in the daily?

I've thought about doing some poor man's covered calls while I wait, but I also know theta will be eating my ass away every day it stays below my break even price ($17.58). 

CLOV seems to be one of the weaker meme stocks. Not sure why. WISH, CLNE, and lots of the others were green on Thursday and Friday, but not my stupid CLOV.

I think so far hedge fund losses for June are about $6 billion so far."

2021-06-19 12:38:20,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  Wall Street media shilled in favor of CLOV right after it shot up the first time, making sure to use the magic words ""short squeeze"" in the titles.  If it was really a short squeeze, would they really advertise it to everyone, especially so early?  Or would they bash the stock GME-style to try and drive people away instead?

When was the last time Wall Street ever wanted to help retail?  Never, because it would come out of their own pockets."

CLOV isn't a meme stock. Any research into the company shows it's a long term investment. It's barely tapped its market and has huge growth potential. Having a Clinton on the board helps too.

It doesn't even belong on WSB.

2021-06-19 10:50:03,wallstreetbets,"If the stock goes lower, average down your call, sell it all on the next spike, and then buy shares instead. CLOV is being manipulated on the same level as GME so eventually it will moon. This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor."
2021-06-19 13:06:24,wallstreetbets,"I have been in the stock since it was IPOC. I have held as it went under $7, up to $28, and now to $12. As of today, it seems like we have picked up more diamond hands and the stock will hold above $10, IMO. The shorts had to work really hard to get it down to $12 last week, raising the short interest from low 40% up to 48%. I think there is a greater than 50% chance your calls are ITM at some point over the next month. As you know, the risk with calls is they sometimes become worthless."

2021-06-19 12:19:48,wallstreetbets,These idiots on WSB have no clue what‚Äôs going on with AMC and GME. Sad to see people spinning in Citadel‚Äôs WSB falling for the pump and dumps when life changing money is staring at you in the face.

2021-06-19 15:12:24,wallstreetbets,I may add more on Monday.
2021-06-19 18:06:27,wallstreetbets,shares are the only way to help the squeeze if you are looking for one. its always good to have shares to hedge you options bets anyways.
2021-06-19 12:04:45,wallstreetbets,"In fact, the last notable squeeze was Volkswagen back in 2008. The fact that everyone expects them out of 6+ stocks at the same time is hilarious."
2021-06-19 10:04:14,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-19 10:46:57,wallstreetbets,Neither of those have the SI to squeeze.  20% on Amc isn‚Äôt that much.  Especially since 20% short means 120% long.  Which means there‚Äôs a lot more Longs covering Amc at 0. Simple math Amc is worth 0.  120% long - 20% short means 100% Longs end up covering at 0 and 20% of Longs cover to a short bid.
2021-06-19 09:27:08,wallstreetbets,"Way I can best see it is that compared to 1 month ago CLOV is up around 70%, at some point you will no longer have people adding more shorts and selling will stop. This may likely be in the $10 range, at that point stock may make a turn around to the upside. Atleast in your case you have some time on the options, I assume you got that much time as you were unsure it it would reach $14 by expiration..."
2021-06-19 10:29:08,wallstreetbets,"If you bought shares you probably would have paperhanded them by now for a loss and put them into one of the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù meme stocks.

2021-06-19 14:47:00,wallstreetbets,The remaining 4% ? Lol rather chance it of it comes back up to 25$ I can at least break even
2021-06-19 15:19:36,wallstreetbets,"I've been watching shares available to borrow for clov in multiple brokers every day for the past two weeks and it has been fluctuating by hundreds of thousands daily, usually starting the day with 200k-400k and dropping to 50k-100k by mid-afternoon. In other words, there is definitely a lot of shorting activity going on.

As shares are short sold, the shares available to borrow gets replenished, but the fact that it keeps getting depleted shows that huge short sales are occurring which keeps the share price down.

Short selling activity certainly happens on other stocks I've watched, but I've never really seen it happen day after day after day (exception is this also happens with AMC). If you look at BB, they usually have around 39m volume and somewhere around 10m shares available to short, and that number doesn't change much - it was basically the same all week last week. So it's very strange to me that CLOV consistently has less than 500k available to short with similar mkt cap and volume to BB... (clov also has about 40m volume per day). It's heavily manipulated imo"

2021-06-19 12:32:36,wallstreetbets,"Thanks.  Ok, so Citadel owns a much higher percentage of CLOV according to Fintel's numbers."
2021-06-19 12:28:46,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but the thing with GME and AMC is that the heaviest moves are done and the same people who are taking new short positions are also taking new long positions. Both of these stocks have ever cycling short floats now that are hedged with long positions. 

I expect they will continue to go up forever in waves but not because of any short interest or gamma squeeze potential, just because people will buy based on their names. When it goes up thats because the hedge funds are helping it go up too and when it consolidates at these new highs, they cycle out their shares to new holders willing to buy st these levels. Rinse and repeat over and over.

Doing this will just indefinitely allow them to play both sides with new willing buyers each time while they get away with some of the other OG GME level plays like CLOV was presenting before they silenced her."

2021-06-19 10:11:30,wallstreetbets,$2 to $20 is a much higher percentage change than $10 to $70. AMC picked up a massive volume swing to hit $70. You‚Äôll never see that with CLOV.
2021-06-19 12:38:53,wallstreetbets,">Simple math Amc is worth 0.

Dude, what??"
2021-06-19 15:34:04,wallstreetbets,"The past week CLOV short interest has notably increased, but you're right, the share price is still up from where it was when CLOV was under the radar. This can only mean one thing - that CLOV now has a lot of (bag) holders that are sticking to their guns and going long.

Short squeezes are triggered by unexpected price increases in heavily shorted stocks. I consider the current price bump from where CLOV was 3-4 weeks ago an ""unexpected price increase""... Currently shorts are trying to wait it out (while also increasing their short positions). They're waiting for WSB to lose interest as they always do and move onto something else. The question is will the new CLOV army be able to wait out the hedge funds that have been increasing their short positions to instigate FUD and shake out WSB. Personally, I think all the new investors that have been introduced to CLOV as a result of the price surge are here to stay and some of the hedge funds will eventually realize that they're better off being the first to cover rather than paying the 7%+ fee to maintain their positions. They can try to wait it out, but it's a hell of a lot easier to just be first."
2021-06-19 14:56:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah my bad, glossed over the 96% part"
2021-06-19 15:31:11,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree. And each time the shares get replenishished it is after a small spike in share price which is likely from mini short coverings but only about less than 3% each time (ie. There are 42 million shares borrowed and only about 500-800k returned at each time). The largest amount I saw this week covered at once was about 900k and that cause the price to go from $14.30 to $16 real fast. And that was only from about 2.5% of the short shares borrowed of which all have been borrowed again for new shorts taking.

Lots of manipulation in my mind."

725k-ish out of 510 mil shares for amc. 0.0014%

Rough numbers, but Citadel has over double the investment in clov."
2021-06-19 15:50:59,wallstreetbets,"I fail to see how that has any influence on AMC at this point. When it was trading at $15-20, sure that was definitely a factor, but now? The real move has already happened and its taking AMC about 200 million volume a day to essentially just trade sideways. This level of volume won't keep up forever and the risk for any new money coming in to take the trade is significantly greater at this point.

AMC right now presents the same underlying factors for short volume, options open interest, and float as WISH along with similar levels of daily volume yet I would feel 100% more comfortable taking WISH at these levels than AMC. I'm not taking WISH personally because I do believe it is a hype play now but it shows more potential upside right now with less downside. AMC shows limited upside with more potential downside.

When it comes to CLOV, it has a better set up across the board compared to AMC right now so taking it here just makes more logical trading sense.

1. Smaller float so less volume needed to make moves.
2. The highest short interest around right now which keeps going UP each day.
3. Almost half of the entire float is borrowed short (42 million shares) yet only about 100-300k shares available each day to cover. As of Friday close there is only 30k available after significant ladder attacks.
4. Highest borrow fees of any other meme stock that topped more than 116% when it was going last week. This alone is an indication of how screwed shorts are and when more shares are available to borrow the fees have been going UP. That doesn't make sense unless the same shares are being covered and then re-borrowed again since no other shares can be taken to bring it down.
5. More than $5 billion lost so far in June and its BARELY done anything yet.

Yeah I won't even look at AMC, GME, WISH, CLNE or any of the others since the real money will be made on CLOV. Sorry not sorry, this is not financial advice."

2021-06-19 11:17:12,wallstreetbets,"AMC and GME are $500 stocks all day long.  They will be that way forever!  

You have to use the meme stock value formula.  A meme stock is under valued at a P/E ratio above -$350.  At an EPS for AMC of -1.42 it‚Äôs P/E is only -$42 @ $60/share.  Therefor ipso facto shazam AMC won‚Äôt hit a P/E ratio of -$350 until the stock hits exactly  $497.  AMC price target is $497 or the EPS need to improve to -$0.17.  This makes perfect sense because math.  As soon as earnings go into the positive it will lose it‚Äôs meme stock status and go back to traditional methods of valuation which would target a P/E ratio of about 15.  This simply means the earnings will transition from -$1.42 EPS($650m in the red) to $33(14.85T in positive earnings). This is of course very logical.  The US GDP is 21T currently and my estimate is by 2025 AMC will be responsible for roughly 75% of that.  

With a current market cap of only 29B this puts AMC not even in the fortune 500.  A target of 250B market cap is much more logical putting it on par with XOM.  Obviously with electric cars taking over and mobile entertainment being required for long autonomous driving trips(max 300 miles because you know electric is the future) the value of AMC will soon surpass that of XOM.  

Sound fundamental deep dive.  Your welcome."

Sure sometimes are inflated by big man in suits to drive up the value of a stock to arbitrary numbers, and a problem I do believe is trying to change for the better for humanity, similar to what WSB does here. But I do believe it driven by hatred and angry.

2021-06-19 12:08:44,wallstreetbets,"I'll blow your mind one further. We are in a 'realm' and not a physical space. That's why flat earthers can prove the earth is flat and round earthers can prove it's round. No, we are not in an Elon Musk simulation on someone else's computer either. That is just the best analogy we can come up with at the time because we always use the latest technology we have to make metaphors for things not easily explained in words. Plato used a cave and a hole out of the cave to explain the illusionary nature of this so called physical existence. We use computers now because they are a little dark box like a cave that create illusions on our screen.  


So yes the stock market is fake and manipulated but so is the very fiat currency behind it that almost every human being is controlled to some extent by at some point - even the most ardent 'off the grid' wilderness dwellers who ripped up their birth certificates, social security numbers, ids, credit cards, are effected by it. Animals don't have banks, credit cards, and such and they get along fine. We are the only thing that must pay a cartoon paper to exist on our home. Silly, is it not? We are a society who does not know where this fiat currency comes from - we really don't. You can go down the rabbit hole as far as you want and say the federal reserve is private, manipulated by the central banking system which is private, manipulated by the world bank which is private, manipulated by the IMF which is private - but you can never find out the actual top of the pyramid and name names as to WHO actually and truthfully issues currency and controls it. You can name the standard 13 families and blah de blah and the Pindar and you can even go further out David Icke but you never get to an actually nail able truth except a lot of bullshit is going on and most people don't even question  


So for now the imaginary numbers in stock portfolios get us real tangible things in this realm, but I can see a time when they won't... and I'll also say this - no man ever on his death bed wishes he had made more money or waisted more hours of his life staring at stock candles sticks, tickers, and graphs.   


However - AMC to the moon.

2021-06-19 14:29:43,wallstreetbets,"are you that dumb?

\- is THIS true:  
<<life expectancy for people who die young is low>>  
...  <duh?>.. really ?

Your definition of ""poors"" includes what percentage of the population? .. and WHY are they dying faster?.. OR **MAYBE** the percentage of poors is GROWING and there are many MORE of them, but still living as long ??

If you have 50% ""poor"" and 50% ""rich"" and the poor die at 50 and the rich die at 60, then the average age of death will be 55, right?

but if you have 90% poor and 10% rich the average age of death will be 51

So now if the poor start to live a year LONGER and the rich live a year **SHORTER** then the average age of USA death will RISE by MORE than a year.  
= too bad for the rich.

Did you check where your OWN income fits into the life expectancy graph .. or your weight, or your job, or climate change, or your sex, or your State, or your sport, or your IQ?

If you habitually get **blowjobs** from **whores** in your **lambo** while snorting wealthy quantities of **coke** you will live a **long time**? -LOL-

So are we really fixing the problem or is it a band aid until they can figure a way to fix their fuck up? As I see it now it‚Äôs up to us.
2021-06-19 11:52:34,wallstreetbets,"No problem at all I put my business out there. Well coke burns your nose off literally. The longer you do coke the more your burn off until our get what's called a deviated septum. Where the lining separating your nostrils is eroded into just one hole pretty much. Usually the hole you use more often will erode quicker meaning one half will be thinner than the other side giving your nose that crooked look. Next time you watch a movie pay attention how many actors have a crooked nose. Safe to assume it was coke lol.

Maybe tmi but during the end of my habit I knew I had to stop soon because eof my nose, but I was desperate to find a way and actually put some coke on a cut on my finger thinking this would work getting into my bloodstream. Beyond stupid I know but this is how addicts think. The tiny amount of coke on this cut ate. The. Fuck. Out. Of. My. Hand. It was like acid on my hand and stung just a little but it made a little cut grow into a decent size scab. Ironically this revelation led me to stopping for good see how damaging the shit is in front of your face."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Three awesome quotes that will help you keep your cool when your stonks drop in value The hardest part of investing is controlling your emotions. If you don't know how to do that, then you might sell your stonks too early because you got scared off, or hesitate to buy - and then miss a huge run-up. That's especially important when your stonks go down in value and you start seeing a ton of red in your account..

Here are three quotes that really helped me get control of my mental game. Each of them covers a slightly different aspect. Read them, understand them, combine them in your mind, and your profits should get a lot better. :)

**First, this long but awesome quote from Warren Buffett, all the way back in his 1987 letter to shareholders:**

""Ben Graham, my friend and teacher, long ago described the mental attitude toward market fluctuations that I believe to be most conducive to investment success. He said that you should imagine market quotations as coming from a remarkably accommodating fellow named Mr. Market who is your partner in a private business. Without fail, Mr. Market appears daily and names a price at which he will either buy your interest or sell you his.

Even though the business that the two of you own may have economic characteristics that are stable, Mr. Market‚Äôs quotations will be anything but. For, sad to say, the poor fellow has incurable emotional problems. At times he feels euphoric and can see only the favorable factors affecting the business. When in that mood, he names a very high buy-sell price because he fears that you will snap up his interest and rob him of imminent gains. At other times he is depressed and can see nothing but trouble ahead for both the business and the world. On these occasions he will name a very low price, since he is terrified that you will unload your interest on him.

Mr. Market has another endearing characteristic: He doesn‚Äôt mind being ignored. If his quotation is uninteresting to you today, he will be back with a new one tomorrow. Transactions are strictly at your option. Under these conditions, the more manic-depressive his behavior, the better for you. But, like Cinderella at the ball, you must heed one warning or everything will turn into pumpkins and mice: Mr. Market is there to serve you, not to guide you. It is his pocketbook, not his wisdom, that you will find useful. If he shows up some day in a particularly foolish mood, you are free to ignore him or to take advantage of him, but it will be disastrous if you fall under his influence.

Indeed, if you aren‚Äôt certain that you understand and can value your business far better than Mr. Market, you don‚Äôt belong in the game. As they say in poker, ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve been in the game 30 minutes and you don‚Äôt know who the patsy is, you‚Äôre the patsy. An investor will succeed by coupling good business judgment with an ability to insulate his thoughts and behavior from the super-contagious emotions that swirl about the marketplace. In my own efforts to stay insulated, I have found it highly useful to keep Ben‚Äôs Mr. Market concept firmly in mind.‚Äù

&#x200B;

**Second, the famous Litany Against Fear from Dune, one of the best sci-fi books of all time:**

""I must not fear.

Fear is the mind-killer.

Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.

I will face my fear.

I will permit it to pass over me and through me.

And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.

Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""

&#x200B;

**Last but not least, my personal favourite - by Covetous Shen from Diablo-3. :)**

""Hope... Do not look down, my friend. Even in the darkest of times, there is always hope. Hope for a better day, hope for a new dawn. Or just hope for a good breakfast. You start small, then see what you can get.""

Good luck - I hope this helped you. If you do end up making some extra cash off this advice, no need to thank me - just give some cash to your local charity. :) Or, if you're in Seattle or Toronto, let's hang out! The cider is on you hahaha

Wellllll, he did buy up a bunch of stamps - but he didn't realize that nobody would pay him more than the face value for just another stamp among all the thousands LOL.

CZR is still battling with the POC (Point of Control) on the volume profile 4hr chart. 

&#x200B;

On the daily, we have an inverted hammer candle sitting on two support levels - the POC and support from previous reversals in its uptrend. 

&#x200B;

Name of the game here is to weather the storm of the market and overcome the downfall we are experiencing.

&#x200B;

Levels I am looking at:

Entry: 102.39 (small volume area above POC)

Target: 106.44 (first area with major volume)

&#x200B;

For now, we wait for confirmation of a reversal with increasing volume and higher highs.   
Patience is key.

The fact that it‚Äôs popular enough for WSB to pick it up and spread hype around it is a completely inundated response to the public realizing the company has turned around on its origins..? For example, Gme completely hype fueled but overly shorted was picked up by wsb not because wsb is for short squeezes but because risky FD‚Äôs and odte‚Äôs are a given on something so hair-brained.. even when the company has no real concrete future plans. Please tell me what evidence is available for BB being a pump n dump? It literally is in one of the most coveted and demanded industries now. I‚Äôm not here to convince you to buy it, but to reiterate no SHOULD be dumb enough to think it‚Äôs much more than another risky position play by investors cause the company was somewhat ‚Äúshorted‚Äù down to a low share price along with the fact that it ACTUALLY has a future and earnings. It may not be a $100-300 company by earnings next week whatever the report is but it‚Äôs got huge FD and 0dte allure for investors lol. I just hate seeing people call it a pump n dump.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why WKHS is going to be the next rocket ship to Tendie Town üöÄüöÄüöÄ **Disclaimer:** *I am not a financial advisor, or hedgefund shill trying to distract you from AMC, you fuckin monkeys.*

Alright boys and girls, listen the fuck up cause I'm going to get straight to the point. Currently estimated **60% Short Interest**, with a *market cap* just **below 2 billion** and *float* of **112.69M**.

[Ortex Data \(SI 60.03&#37; of float as of 06\/18\)](https://preview.redd.it/voulhjhuz4671.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=f727dda32e1ba8ebc6ca3faf6f06a34a93ca1ad6)

So now what the fuck does this mean? Let's compare to AMC. AMC currently have a *market cap* of **30 BILLION** with a *float* of **448.49 MILLION** and only **13.45% Short Interest** as of last Friday.

Now because the float & market cap of WKHS is much lower, it takes significantly less bananas to get the rocket ship going. WKHS only needs a mere fucking fraction of the volume AMC saw for it to see a Thanos Infinity Squeeze and fuck the shorts to kingdom come.

# Technical Analysis

[This is my take on le squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/j7eyz7id25671.png?width=2672&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0c124f1d0a848dd4deb3e0303154e4332123496)

Now listen here you fucks, I do have data to back this up. ORTEX send out trading signals based on algorithmic backtesting or some bullshit like that. They sent out a Short Squeeze Signal on June 10th, which according to them you are likely to see the highest returns *11 days* after the signal was fired, which would be on the 25th of June.

[SS Signal](https://preview.redd.it/3tecoxx835671.png?width=2472&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad5d18dcc26caf74bb0f358b59efc590f1ac4eaa)

So now, let's compare the ORTEX data now with the previous squeeze.

[ORTEX data with estimated Short Interest for WKHS](https://preview.redd.it/8eyf1oeo35671.jpg?width=3200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98399c773dc00abb4938c20c655976bdccf09671)

Looking at the previous squeeze that occurred on the 26th of Jan, we can see that it gapped up to a high of **$42.96** on just **33% Short Interest**. Now imagine what the fuck we could do with **60%**.

How I see it is, we are so close to seeing a huge run up to at least **$30**. For you monkeys that don't math, that's a **+100% gain**, and anyone will the balls to yolo options you'll see significantly more.

I don't know why I don't see anyone posting their positions anymore but here they are:

120x Jul 16 45/60 Bull Debit Spreads  
1x Jun 25 15.5c  
2x Jun 25 16c  
5x Jul 02 18c  
50 Shares

**TLDR:** WKHS has 60% Short Interest and is the next trip to the fucking moon."

2021-06-19 06:48:25,wallstreetbets,"Reason why it's so heavily shorted and been for a few months is mainly the loss of the USPS contract to Oshkosh back in February. Everyone pretty much expected it to happen and would've been worth a few billion over a number of years as the contract was to electrify the majority of the USPS delivery fleet. That, together with production being very slow and then being investors of Lordstown have also negatively impacted their earnings. HOWEVER, the circumstances of Oshkosh being awarded the USPS contract seem suspicious (they didnt even make electric vehicles) and WKHS filed a lawsuit against USPS last Wednesday on grounds that losing the contract was unfair

Edit: An article from last week on the current WKHS situation and lawsuit: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/06/16/usps-trucks-workhorse-lawsuit/ 

Something I didn't note earlier is a securities filing from Oshkosh themselves saying in Nov 2020 that they ""didn't have the expertise or resources to build electric vehicles""... and they won the contract 3 months later. Make of that what you will..."

This is a trade, not necessarily a long term investment (unless you want it to be - there are worse choices). Assuming a squeeze situation does happen, it will be the covering shorts who are forced to buy shares at a higher price. Therefore if you get in early enough, you needn‚Äôt worry about bag holding. Just don‚Äôt diamond hand past your desired exit point.

[Shitadel WKHS Investment](https://fintel.io/so/us/wkhs)

Scroll down to the 13F and NPORT Filings and search for ""Citadel"". You can see they opened substantial positions in WKHS on May 21st, just days before the stock began to rise because of all the chatter.

I'm all for folks making money in whatever way they can, but if you care about the GME/AMC squeeze and the general cause of screwing Shitadel to the ground you may want to check out how heavily they are investing in all of the companies that, since the end of May have been purported to be ""short squeezing"" (WKHS, CLOV, etc.). Shitadel has substantial investments in many of them and is basically using pushes like this one as a slush fund to keep their short war going against the apes. Just keep in mind that GME/AMC is a BLACK SWAN, and anything else (like WKHS) is pie in the sky. Remember, Shitadel is going to fuck off with their money long before you know it's time to. Just to be clear, I'm not here to bash anyone or tell anybody what they should or should not be doing; make that money homie.

2021-06-19 16:48:13,wallstreetbets,17?! How does it feel to know you‚Äôre gunna be a millionaire??
2021-06-19 15:43:55,wallstreetbets,I know it gave me those same vibes I got when GME was the only green stock back in I think April
2021-06-19 14:56:00,wallstreetbets,"At the very least, purchasing calls can encourage the market maker to purchase an equivalent number of offsetting shares and puts to offset their short call position that was just created. 

Thereby creating a synthetic call position offsetting their short position.   Maintain that delta neutral status, well and the other greeks too."
2021-06-19 18:02:22,wallstreetbets,"I held 77 because I liked the number.

Now I hold 100."

2021-06-19 04:46:08,wallstreetbets,Don't
2021-06-19 09:11:03,wallstreetbets,They packed on 20 lbs of SI just this past two weeks without anymore bad news so it‚Äôs just the shorts tryna suppress.
2021-06-19 03:05:00,wallstreetbets,I think they have a healthy back log but the issues are with production‚Ä¶
2021-06-19 09:41:39,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs just a strategy hedge funds use with early stage growth companies. If they‚Äôre successful they make money on the way down, can make money in the way back up, and it can be a strategy to end up owning valuable IP. If it worked in wkhs and everyone sold their shares for pennies, these guys end up owning the patents for ‚Äúpackage delivery by means of an automated uav dispatched from a conventional delivery vehicle.‚Äù That patent is worth billions because drones lower cost of delivery as much as 96% so it‚Äôs the future. It‚Äôs a shitty way to do business and it used to work until retail caught on and just refused to sell their shares to the HFs. The thing is the HFs won‚Äôt accept that their age old tried and true tactics won‚Äôt work anymore so they keep borrowing shares, even creating them out of thin air if they have to, and keep piling on the short interest. Go look at the failed to delivers for wkhs on 4/20 and it‚Äôs around 10% of total trading volume. It‚Äôs insane."
2021-06-19 10:03:36,wallstreetbets,"The answer is exactly why I am invested. Because they got it wrong. With GME the headline view was ""oh that company is going to fail because of the pandemic, brick and mortar are over."" Anyone who did zero research believed this. So did the shorts.  

Now we have a situation where the headline view is ""oh isn't that EV start up who bet it all on an USPS contract but lost? I guess they have a shittier vehicle. No wonder they are shorted so much.""  

Not a word of that sentence is true, and they got it wrong again."
2021-06-19 10:04:26,wallstreetbets,"As others mentioned, a lot of SI happened when they lost the contract.  WKHS was around 40% a month ago.  However, as momentum has built a bit, they've added 20% in just the last couple weeks trying to supress the price.  They are in a tough spot.  Just go look at EOD yesterday, pretty interesting.  Someone started buying to push the price to 15.  It was working until 3:59 a sale of 400k shares sold just to make sure it didnt cross 15 and trigger calls.  They are starting to feel it"
2021-06-19 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,I remember hearing that they lost the gig with usps
2021-06-19 09:52:57,wallstreetbets,Didn't the usps go to oshkosh and that's why the stock plummeted? Also it IPOed thru a spac and there are way way better spacs out there.
2021-06-19 10:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Maybe because they can't build their vehicles at scale, lose $100 million per quarter and are currently trading at 1,000 times revenue?"
2021-06-19 12:09:55,wallstreetbets,What days and what prices did u get?
2021-06-19 09:30:29,wallstreetbets,">on grounds that losing the contract was unfair

Ohh well that should work out for them.

üôÑ"
2021-06-19 10:00:13,wallstreetbets,"I'll be making a post later but for now....For your thoughts... !

usps dejoy postponed the usps postal contract award until after the election. Everyone and I mean everyone believed WKHS was going to win. OSK got the award and someone made a very suspicious trade the night before the award announcement... dejoy...? some wonder, Politics at Play..? Remember dejoy was a never Trumper...!

Now WKHS owns 10% of LMC (RIDE) and LMC is where the postal trucks were supposed to be built and as a result creating jobs for Americans while rebuilding the Mahon Valley Ohio which had been devastated over many years of manufacturing job losses and unemployment.

Another significant timely move is that WKHS filed a complain/lawsuit on 17 of June 2021 regarding the issuance of the USPS Contract Award... and when did they do it...? Right after a major management change at LMC (RIDE)... Was that change done to put favorable people in charge of LMC (RIDE)...? Politics at Play...?

Appreciate to hear your thoughts...!"
2021-06-19 12:38:25,wallstreetbets,When could a result on the lawsuit the expected? Lawsuits usually are long and drawn out‚Ä¶ Is this something that could turn around quickly?
2021-06-19 11:15:43,wallstreetbets,Bingo!!! There is a valid reason this company is being shorted.
2021-06-19 13:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Oshkosh builds everything, you say you want something built, they build it.  That's what they do.  They have a long successful history of delivering on government contracts."

2021-06-19 11:24:55,wallstreetbets,Be careful with this one. There is a reason the short interest is so high
2021-06-19 08:15:36,wallstreetbets,"Just reviewed the company info and financials pretty well. I also live in OH so that‚Äôs a small extra reason to invest lol just like RIDE or Cleveland Cliffs. But HOLY SHIT why is this company‚Äôs short interest so high?! It‚Äôs not failing by any means. Interesting. I love the play tbh, and I‚Äôm def buying in this week"
2021-06-19 00:28:01,wallstreetbets,"This is the way. I personally believe in the long term valuation of this company but am not trying to convince everyone of the fundamentals, otherwise I would‚Äôve just done a DD on that. 
After all, this is fucking wall street BETS üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-06-19 01:33:54,wallstreetbets,Set take profit at $300 just to stop shorts borrowing shares
2021-06-19 02:49:56,wallstreetbets,"Here is a thing though: unlike AMC and GME WKHS is easily worth it's market cap right now. It's not a risk free investment but it's not completely fuking bananas. If anything it's one of the cheapest EV stocks, if not THE cheapest. So, if you don't go total ape-mode with options and actually buy shares at $14 you can call yourself a value investor.

The fact that 60% of flow is fuking insane. It's an opportunity of the lifetime."
2021-06-19 02:56:51,wallstreetbets,SI is a number that has a context. Not a stand-alone red light/green light.

2021-06-19 00:09:03,wallstreetbets,It doesn't have enough public interest to overcome the HF shorts. That's why it won't fly. My dumb bet is on $wish instead for now.

2021-06-19 05:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that‚Äôs a pretty huge increase‚Ä¶And honestly it almost makes the stock more suspicious grounds for possible naked shorts

Like why are they trying so hard"
2021-06-19 08:39:35,wallstreetbets,"What is your point? It has low volume, surely if a whale got onboard the price hike would send it high enough so that shorters have to cover by buying shares?"
2021-06-19 01:23:07,wallstreetbets,"Disregard the length for now, understand the idea of float/market cap and how that affects the price of the stock.

2021-06-19 13:56:07,wallstreetbets,"Taking a big OTM options position definitely increases the odds of a gamma squeeze if the stock were to rally‚Ä¶The only thing to keep in mind is that this is the **second** time Ortex called for a short squeeze. 

Ortex also called for the same (level 3/ 5star) short squeeze on June 4rth. Shorts covered just a little bit, stock popped to $17, made it look like that was the squeeze, and re-shorted to force the price back down to $13.

In the event that they do this again and successfully depress the price back down by taking out more short interest, your options could be expire worthless, and we‚Äôre back to repeating this ‚Äúshort squeeze cycle‚Äù all over again.

This possibly presents a longer than anticipated timeframe. Which is why shares might be the ‚Äúsafer‚Äù/risk adverse play. Safety first-Buckle up!"

2021-06-19 10:09:45,wallstreetbets,"That's an interesting take and the time lines do come across as suspicious. As for postmaster general DeJoy, he reeks of under the table dealings and conflicts of interest. He got in trouble for financial conflicts and some political stuff last year so wouldn't be surprised if something shady happened re the OSK deal.. He also keeps flip flopping on the electrification of the USPS fleet - first promised majority to be fully electrified and recently has been saying that only 10% will be electrified which pissed off a lot of policy makers and congress... with Biden at the helm and his green infrastructure package I can't see them accepting only 10% electrification of the delivery fleet by 2035"
2021-06-19 13:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you're correct, a final conclusion of the suit will take a long time unless some type of settlement is agreed between all the parties.

2021-06-19 10:45:37,wallstreetbets,"Just a guess, but I‚Äôm familiar with wkhs from social media, I‚Äôd say it became too popular for its fundamentals and the shorts took notice and ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù the price as is supposed to be their place in the market. The short interest is probably where it belongs, and will decrease as the company grows. You know, like normal market shit. Not everything is a squeeze."

2021-06-19 15:49:29,wallstreetbets,"When a MM sells you calls they are now in a short call position - which is bad for them because now they are no longer delta neutral.  MM's always want to be delta neutral - they make money on the bid / ask spread - not when a stock goes up or down.

If they don't remain delta neutral they could get blown out if a black swan event occurs - like a Sept 11, or a meme stock goes nuts like GME.   And some do occasionally when they start using leverage and it goes against them.

Anyway - the way to offset being short a call is with a synthetic long call - returning them to delta neutral.  So they would buy an equivalent of underlying shares and buy an equivalent amount of underlying puts which = a synthetic long call.

They now are short an actual call but own a synthetic long call.  Stock goes up and the short calls are worth more (they lose money) but so are the shares they now own (making them an equivalent amount) offsetting any risk to them.  Stock goes down - their shares are worth less but the long puts they own are worth more = offsetting any risk to them."
2021-06-19 14:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Ortex signals are to be taken with a grain of salt but historically have seen good results. But since they are purely algo-based they need to be paired with DD. 

I do agree shares are the much safer play, but that isn‚Äôt what this sub is about. Short squeezing is a long game but I do think that with the estimated 60% SI and 100% utilization, it‚Äôs going to be increasingly hard to keep the price down, especially with the growing stock sentiment. 

Not to mention the fragility of this ticker, even if one whale steps in with 500B capital (which would be over 25% of the market cap in this case), they could completely obliterate the shorts.

The upside potential this has compared to downside is incredible! And my bull debit spreads actually only cost 0.04 a piece (exc. commission). They‚Äôre dirt cheap if you buy during a period of low IV."

2021-06-19 00:55:39,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm on the WKHS rocket, but I think you‚Äôre wrong here. It‚Äôs not just S.I. that incentivizes people to hop on board. Most of the P&Ds we‚Äôve seen the last 2 weeks are exactly that. But the most successful squeezes, namely GME and AMC, both had retail sentiment behind them. They had a story. GameStop was the asymmetrical upside play with Cohen magic coming to the rescue to rebrand the company. People have a connection with their video games and pop culture figurines from childhood. With AMC, it‚Äôs as simple as the fact that people love movies. They have fond memories of going to the theatre after school, or spending time with their friends. That, and they had seen the success of GME and probably wanted to be a part of something similar. 

So no, WKHS will not squeeze on S.I. alone (although it could if wsb decided to make it happen). It will need some kind of positive Catslyst or story to amplify the retail sentiment behind it. However if that does happen, then watch out. 45% SI is quite the doozy. üêéüöÄüåï"

2021-06-19 05:09:09,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre telling me a ton of investors are putting their money into AMC and GME because they‚Äôre great companies with huge futures ? Right üòÇüòÇüòÇ
2021-06-19 01:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Agree on the USPS contract - that's some bullshit. All the hype around EVs and going green for the single most important vehicle thats ever hit the US, the postal service. And now the 1% decides that a defense contractor(OshKosh) should get the billions worth of the deal only to make ""hybrids"" which are nothing but gas sipping instead of guzzling(might as well guzzle that shit if youre even going to use any).

2021-06-19 14:37:24,wallstreetbets,"I think WKHS has a good chance at getting a big piece of the federal infrastructure deals, whether the USPS contract or otherwise. The Biden admin put out an executive order saying that it wants ALL federal vehicles to be \*\*\*100%\*\*\* EV.  Not 10% EVs, as Oshkosh proposed. Oshkosh never even proved it could provide ANY workable EV (never submitted a functioning prototype and can't/won't say whether it even tested what it proposed, which was to -- at some point -- swap in EV engines on originally gas-powered vehicles). The government is not going to shell out for a gas-powered fleet as its big outlay for vehicles intended to last for the next decade or more. The government wants and will use American-made EVs. Plus, WKHS is based in Ohio, an important swing state. Finally, WKHS is closely affiliated with GM, which has indicated that it wants in on the government EV action."

GME was a historical play betting on the underdog. How I see it is WKHS need much better PR or some of the wsb magic, but either way I can see several whales bumping up the stock like we saw on Wednesday which will kick off a gamma ramp regardless. Imo retail investors only make up a small fraction of the firepower. I don‚Äôt know how accurate the metric is that retail own 80% of the AMC float but I find that very hard to believe."

Stocks will be CRUSHED, especially more so those with a ton of debt lol. Interest coverage ratios will fall like a brick, higher expenses, lower revenues, higher operating costs.

2021-06-19 02:40:07,wallstreetbets,"Nice gains but you should have done SPX puts. You would have needed to buy less of them because 1 SPX option = 10 SPY options. Less commission that way.

Also SPX taxes are 60% long-term gains and 40% short-term gains no matter how long you hold them for.  With SPY, you're paying 100% short-term taxes at the shittiest possible income rates.

So you're halfway there by using a real broker besides Robinhood but switch to SPX if you want to save money on taxes.

You're already going to owe like $3K or $4K more in taxes so far from using SPY instead of SPX."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What happens in the event a major cyber-attack hits the financial markets and causes a prolonged halt? **Disclaimer:** If you scare easily just dip. This isn't meant to be FUD shit. This is meant to be someone in this shit trying to get an answer from others that may know the situation better than myself. I posted this at another place full of |experts| and got ran out of town for 'trying to strike fear into the market.' As if there isn't 8000 other things going on that is accomplishing that just fine. **/disclaimer**

Let's start with the SIPC's statement on hacks and how they affect what they insure: https://i.imgur.com/hKGC2Pg.png

If I'm reading that correctly, they don't? I've reached out for clarification in the event of a wide-spread hack/cyberattack but haven't heard back at the time of this post.

So.. with cyberattacks being a hot topic lately in the news I was thinking after close today; hypothetically, what if next week the market was halted? Say for an entire week. What would happen on the following Monday at market open?

Would all derivatives that expired during the halt be worthless? Would the ensuing panic possibly get some very shady financial institutions out of some *very* big holes?

What if brokerage's records become corrupted? Would Cede have the paper/digital records of who owned what and reimburse lost shares? Lost options? What happens to ITM strikes? 

The World Economic Forum is holding their annual exercise to address and implement some actions in the event of such attacks on July 9th. It's called ""Cyber Polygon."" Maybe someone more familiar with their event knows how well protected our securities are?

https://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon

It's a huge what-if scenario that I'm sure is practiced against daily.. but it is a big damn ""what if?""

I'll list some articles below that caught my eye with regards to such a thing happening. If pipelines can be halted, and meat production facilities can be halted, and other country's exchanges can be halted in the name of ""cyber attacks,"" where do we stand as retail investors on the NYSE?

Hopefully WSB has some expertise in the matter.

2021-06-18 23:57:22,wallstreetbets,"So... any company that cares about its data will have a business continuity plan. Since most of the financial business is based on ones and zeroes getting transferred around, let's assume they have a good one. That includes disaster recovery, which is hot sites, warm sites, and cold sites, where backups are stored and can roll back any data corruption or malware that may have taken place. When they're well prepared, these places are geographically separated and the cold sites are disconnected from any network. They're hardened against bombs and physical intrusion. They might lose recent data in the process of restoring it, but there's a lot of other mitigations that prevent a total loss of availability, such as having failover routes in case of network outages, multiple redundant servers that are geographically and virtually separated, creating accounts with the principal of least privilege and delegation of duties to remove the possibility that a single compromised account can do as much damage.


Basically, if they have a good cybersecurity policy in place and pay those people well, any attack that will cause the kind of damage you're talking about would require multiple acts of war to accomplish. They lose more money (by the minute) by not having these protections if an attack would happen (because they make money by keeping the market open) than they would save by cutting corners. Class action lawsuits aside, the bigger players would each sue, individually,  for billions if they didn't have the necessary precautions in place and lost them big bucks.  One of the assurances you have about security in the stock market is that a lot of the unthinkably rich motherfuckers all have guns to each others' heads. No one group is going to strongarm the market into taking a dive for them because another would pull the trigger without hesitation once it seems like they're gonna get caught up in it. Mutually assured financial destruction."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ford drop blackberry qnx for google android? really? That's exactly how the hedge fund run media outlets were printing across the internet!!! you even see many bear commenters saying this across the reddit board to scare everyone. Here's an example of one of the fake media outlets saying ford dropped qnx [ford drops qnx](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-sync-google-android-blackberry-qnx-infotainment/)

**The truth is.....NO, Ford did NOTTT drop blackberry QNX!!!!! they switched to QNX Hypervisor**

Each car has 100 Electrical Control Unit (ECU) performing all the smart functions from automatic brake to rear view camera to seat belt checks to acceleration to lane change etc....blah blah blah. **ONE  of hundred ECU runs the infotainment of the car**. The infotainment is the unit used to change your music radio etc...THE NON CRITICAL AND SAFETY FUNCTION OF THE CAR. SO IF INFOTAINMENT CRAPS OUT WHILE DRIVING NO ONE WILL GET HURT OR DIE. Ford essentially is dropping blackberry QNX to go with google android. BUT, remember car companies are consolidating ECU to reduce number of chips they need, so FORD instead is using Blackberry QNX Hypervisor on the chip and running android on top. The hypervisor runs the infotainment(fm/am radio etc) and the instrument cluster(speed gauge....critical stuff). 

Blackberry QNX Hypervisor ([here](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-hypervisor)) lets you run non-critical (google android) and critical (qnx for cluster) on the SAME CHIP!!! 

Essentially Ford is paying more to use Blackberry Hypervisor. They chose this route becuase they don't want to continue developing the infotainment portion in-house due to cost. they're out sourcing it to google...this is a non-critical function inside the car that no one care if it fails. For everything else inside the car QNX is used extensively because it's the only ASIL-D certified software. 

&#x200B;

Google and Blackberry are working together for this infotainment portion. If you read this article it specifically refers to Hypervisor. Basically android will be running on BB QNX Hypervisor!!! You can't run cars on android!!! Every piece of critical ECU inside the car including the modem that connect to the internet is running Blackberry QNX.

&#x200B;

**Summary:** It's bunch of FUD that Ford dropped QNX. **In fact Ford has switched from Blackberry QNX to Blackberry QNX Hypervisor**. The BB hypervisor will run non-critical/non-safe android on top for the infotainment function. **So please stop this fake stuff about how ford dropped BB**. There are 400 Blackberry employees working at Ford design lab!!!!

IVY also opens the window to any right-to-repair legislation."

look at my previous QNX design wins article. Basically anyone serious about iot devices have signed up to use QNX. It's a secure platform that can be connected to internet. From drones to meters to lights to cars to trucks to industrial robots to all robots!! There is no way Canada will sell BB. This is why canada government invested in BB few years back.

2021-06-19 00:12:57,wallstreetbets,"Dear lord no!!

I have a family member who runs a company that organized an event for Ford a few weeks ago. They basically brought every dealership owner in the country to a convention... what was the convention for? To tell them that they had NO cars to sell... well not really they have cars... tons of cars... no chips!! 10s of 1000s of finished cars that can't be shipped or sold because they don't have the chips to run all the systems. 

The convention was to explain the situation and to explain what they are doing to fight it(basically nothing). They brought them out in person because they wanted no email or memos that could be leaked. They are expecting to have left over 2020, and 2021 cars sitting chipless into 2023.

They are going to CRASH but lucky for the big dogs,  this issue can not be just them and they are likely expecting another golden parachute bail out.

EDIT: Ford is also so broke right now that they forced the owners, who were required to come, to pay their own way, including flight, hotel, food & rental cars.   Anyone who has gone to a corporate convention knows everything is always included and paid by corporate... they are bleeding out right now."
2021-06-19 02:20:44,wallstreetbets,"It's also from February. Nothing new, everything is already priced in. As much as folks love to praise $BB, the only jump this stock got in the past few months is from WSB pump."

2021-06-19 12:34:10,wallstreetbets,"thanks bro! this is a good read but the analysts all miss the main point. Ford did not ditch BB for infotainment, They switched to BB Hypervisor! Basically they ditched QNX and switched to QNX Hypervisor which cost more to license!!! So essentially ford is paying BB more money than before.

I work in the industry (GM, not Ford) and can confirm that for us, at least, chips are being used to roll cars off the line, the chips are then removed and returned to roll off the next batch.  Thousands of vehicles completed and parked in rented space (golf courses, defunct malls, anywhere with parking space) and unable to be sold because they don't have the chips to sell the complete vehicle.

Not financial advice."

2021-06-19 12:22:07,wallstreetbets,"that wasn't the point of this post. the point was that the stock price took a hit because of FUD put out by hedge funds and fake sites without contacting or researching. Blackberry was never dropped by Ford but every site that covered it basically said QNX is no longer used by Ford, which is false. This article is to clear that fud and let everyone know that FORD has like 15 modules that have QNX and QNX Hypervisor!!!!

This is not priced into the stock price. Wallstreet has not priced in the revenue from QNX, Ivy, or Spark. They are still pricing blackberry as a hardware company...look at the multiples. Having leadership in car software space and iot space and having best cybersecurity in the world deserves much much much higher market cap and stock price ($140 lets talk)!"
2021-06-19 12:23:42,wallstreetbets,if you watch the interview the analyst is asking about ford dropping BB QNX and the president is saying NO! he's saying by time ford releases the 2023 version the QNX will be in many MORE ford modules. They're currently in 15 modules of ford!!! The BB hypervisor ford switched to actually cost more to license!!!

It said ""Stop Men"" and I find that hilarious for a few reasons. Firstly it's so vague but also ominous. Like stop them from what?? Secondly, whatever misandrist that did that graffiti had to scale the outside of that building and it is tall. We are seeing it here from about 30-40 feet up on the freeway. I've looked at it and from that angle and the way it was hand written with spray paint, this bitch had to do some dangerous batman shit and honestly I'm kinda proud.

When I was there, I had a mile walk from my apartment in Nob Hill to the Financial District. Routinely on that walk, I‚Äôd see car windows smashed in. For those cars with their windows intact, some would have paper signs hanging in them saying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt break. Nothing of value in here.‚Äù

I personally saw 2 grown men shit on sidewalks in broad daylight. I saw a woman sitting on Sutter shooting up. I saw a dude facedown on a sidewalk, pants around his ankles, not breathing. 

Prior to SF, I lived in Santa Monica which has its own issues but not near SF. Before that, I went to college and worked in NYC. SF is the only one of those I was disgusted by. It‚Äôs a shit hole. Let‚Äôs not forget this was the city of the Summer of Love (which was really anything but). Need more proof? Go walk through Tenderloin at night. Let me know if you survive."

What about like, just being a tagger in it for the art that gets sketched out when ppl you're with get strapped up to go paint?"

What happened here is the Fed agreed to borrow some more money out from the financial institutions by writing IOUs. The IOUs will be bought back at a higher price by the FED. Here‚Äôs how the conversation went.

Banking Institutions: Aye yo big brother, I got too much stimmys in storage. Got anything for me to buy?

Institutions: Not much just 752bn

2021-06-19 17:16:16,wallstreetbets,"I think you‚Äôre right bc SPY is so tech heavy. Covid changed the world forever, and the sector that benefits the most is tech.

2021-06-18 21:39:21,wallstreetbets,I need 430 by monday eob
2021-06-18 23:00:10,wallstreetbets,You can sell your contacts before they expire so you don't lose it all if it doesn't hit.

2021-06-19 02:55:17,wallstreetbets,Right?‚Ä¶ it is sitting at $414 currently‚Ä¶ we are mid June. Lmao. I thought I was crazy reading this too
2021-06-19 03:12:40,wallstreetbets,Some of these stocks could drop 90%. Even the sky high premiums won't save you then. They are high for a reason. AMC could drop 90% and it would still be 3x higher than where it started 2021.
2021-06-19 13:23:58,wallstreetbets,I don't think you'd be talking to us retards if you knew where SPY was heading.
2021-06-19 00:43:53,wallstreetbets,You could make a lot more rolling weeklies and strikes up or down
2021-06-19 00:06:44,wallstreetbets,My guess is we go to 400 then to 372 then to 420 then to 400 then to 420.69 then to 400 then to 450 then to 420.69.

2021-06-19 15:25:33,wallstreetbets,Sure. But we‚Äôre talking about a stock that can easily make a $150 move up in 3-6 weeks. Safer to roll every week and move your strike if necessary.
2021-06-18 21:10:35,wallstreetbets,Aye yo big brother 9000. How‚Äôs it going.
2021-06-19 02:56:29,wallstreetbets,I wish it was $330 honestly. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è a five year chart of spy is scary to look at. Looks like Enron is running the SP500.

2021-06-19 05:53:50,wallstreetbets,WISH is actually a solid e-commerce company. It‚Äôs low risk in my opinion (see 1Y chart). It‚Äôs a buy and hold long term. You most likely won‚Äôt see it have 100% days. This is why options (time decay) is so dangerous for your account.

WOSH..."
2021-06-18 22:02:04,wallstreetbets,You can WISH in one hand and WORKHORSE in the other and see which one fills up faster. HINT it‚Äôs not WISH
2021-06-19 08:17:25,wallstreetbets,It's not AMC or gme dumbass
2021-06-19 09:08:54,wallstreetbets,"I mean, all these obvious hedge fund pump n dumps that got promoted here were fucking obvious.

Idk why you retards fell for them, amd or didn‚Äôt dump once the all ran. I dumped... spent on amc.

I also don‚Äôt get why y‚Äôall are fucking with stocks other than amc and gme, since that‚Äôs the whole reason 99% of people are here to begin with.

Sure, 50k of us are real wsb retards, but the other 6.95 million aren‚Äôt and clearly the mids are compromised and promoting bullshit from hedgefunds now.

I‚Äôll be happy when they ban this sub tbh, and it used to be my favorite too. But it‚Äôs grown too big and can‚Äôt support its own crushing weight."
2021-06-19 12:11:35,wallstreetbets,SO glad I didn‚Äôt fall for WISH straight PNd

Fucking Wish???"
2021-06-19 13:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Wish is like the crappiest shittiest most fucked up fakeshitcrap online store, by far. Why would anyone buy anything from it let alone its shares. wtf."
2021-06-18 23:23:09,wallstreetbets,Citadel what you doin?
2021-06-19 01:50:57,wallstreetbets,"I got out of wish right before it dropped, it‚Äôs important to know when to walk, take the gains and put them into AMC options or shares. NFA obviously. Just be careful on some of these other plays, I just think it‚Äôs a good idea to know when to take the money in front of you, that is if you don‚Äôt plan on to exercise. But honestly I‚Äôm pretty stupid so what tf do I know."

2021-06-19 01:06:47,wallstreetbets,Fucking bizarre that people here are falling for this shit.
2021-06-18 23:53:42,wallstreetbets,Right. Like GULLIBLE
2021-06-19 01:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Yep, more people need to understand this. Why do you think Jim Cramer ""Jimmy chill"" (cringe) is pumping WSB picks?"
2021-06-19 01:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Bought in early at the 7.50 then again on the 9 stoped at buying a few at 11 that didnt make money, but other wise.

Thought about buying the 12.50 as a lotto ticket. It was like $13 a call, so who cares buying a few ticket‚Ä¶ everyone love the lottery"
2021-06-19 02:34:19,wallstreetbets,I would not be surprised. It fked up and funny.
2021-06-19 10:00:33,wallstreetbets,To be fair it does sound likes a lot of fun

2021-06-19 02:58:11,wallstreetbets,"The DD on wish seemed ok.

I don't think I know enough to discredit it at least. But I think the stuff is so cheap quality that people shouldn't be spending money on it"
2021-06-19 07:59:21,wallstreetbets,You act as if shitty company‚Äôs can‚Äôt have high stock price or be manipulated.

2021-06-19 00:51:59,wallstreetbets,There are more convincing examples currently out there than WSB.  But I agree if you're referring to blind ass follow whatever pump DU jour is.
2021-06-19 01:16:21,wallstreetbets,Bro same. It goes on some great runs sometimes and then just loss loss loss. 100% chance if it does blow up I probably won't be in on it.
2021-06-19 01:17:41,wallstreetbets,Honestly smart. We keep trying to call them in weeklies for them free premiums and higher leverage but shorties probably know this
2021-06-19 08:42:08,wallstreetbets,Be sure to have a lot of red ink
2021-06-19 02:15:32,wallstreetbets,"The original crowd left after Gamestop, and its all been pump and dump since."
2021-06-19 07:50:11,wallstreetbets,I wonder why they wouldn't want those calls to print (sarcasm)
2021-06-18 22:31:12,wallstreetbets,but what if i could have 20x the gain?
2021-06-18 21:31:55,wallstreetbets,Weeklies just came out yesterday or something.
2021-06-19 09:10:08,wallstreetbets,Still have 1k shares that im holding till July

2021-06-19 02:08:56,wallstreetbets,The problem is not that they sell cheap Chinese knock off garbage.  It's that Amazon is better than them at selling it.

2021-06-19 10:58:58,wallstreetbets,"Well the price is closing in on 11.50 so that's 2.50 up from your strike. Unless you paid a crazy high premium, just the intrinsic value of those options alone should be up more than that 20%!"
2021-06-19 07:42:44,wallstreetbets,Not defending WISH but exactly same thing was said about AMC in the day how it was there to distract people from going after GME. It's also been on a trail for reversal
2021-06-18 20:30:34,wallstreetbets,I had calls in amc that expired last week. This week was round two of fails
2021-06-18 20:31:03,wallstreetbets,Stfu bag holder
2021-06-19 08:40:46,wallstreetbets,"Hold strong to what, you fucking retard? They're calls that expired yesterday."
2021-06-19 01:24:19,wallstreetbets,"It's not exactly easy to summarize, I would watch a video tutorial. But if I had to try, you're basically betting against someone that a stock will go up within a specific time frame. The longer window you buy, the more expensive it is upfront. 

The reason why it's popular is because you can simulate owning shares for a fraction of the cost. If wish is $11, instead of buying 1000 shares for $11k, you can buy a call for 1000 shares for $5k (depends on the window) and functionally own the shares for that time.

So if it goes up when you bought a call, you can sell that call for mad cash or exercise the call meaning you now own those shares at the cost you bought the call at.

If none of that makes sense, watch a video üòÇ"
2021-06-19 10:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Nah but ive also never bought anything from gamestop, that didn't stop me from losing money with GME."

2021-06-19 03:06:18,wallstreetbets,">The DD on wish seemed ok.

We must have very different definitions of ""ok"".....This company is a joke.  There are so many direct competitors who are head and shoulders better.  It probably is going to run into regulatory issues or lawsuits at some point based on the fly-by-night way it facilitates transactions with shady vendors.  It has exposure to China amid ongoing hostilities.  It likely won't be around in 10 years for these reasons.  These are very obvious signs to not retards that you should not invest in this company cuz in the long term it is certain to decline, as it has already been doing  for the last year on the death march to zero.  


But people investing in WISH here don't care about any of that stuff."
2021-06-19 01:10:18,wallstreetbets,I always take advice from people with no money.

2021-06-18 20:47:12,wallstreetbets,May those shares take you to greener lines.

2021-06-19 01:19:17,wallstreetbets,Ain't that the fucking truth. Oh I blew $1k on shitty weekly calls? I've seen worse. I'm going to have $0 life savings in three months at this point.
2021-06-19 01:32:31,wallstreetbets,And it's definitely not gonna be what you wanted.
2021-06-19 08:48:13,wallstreetbets,"You have heard about gme, amc, nok and bb from the beginning in January. Unlike wish, which came like a week ago?

2021-06-19 02:22:38,wallstreetbets,I mean.. wish is actually up 25% this month.  I assumed the stock must of tanked today but it's been going up.  OP aimed too high and forgot to sell in time.
2021-06-19 01:19:56,wallstreetbets,you mean the wish/wendys/bb/clov/workhorsgroup/silver/amc trap?
2021-06-19 01:29:28,wallstreetbets,"Why? I bought late (like just under 11), and it's still up 5%. Sure, that's not impressive but it's also not like you're gonna be a bagholder on it. Plus several investment agencies have it on their watchlist for growth. If ya don't like it don't buy it but it's not like weed stocks where you just wipe your brow and are glad you avoided the whole fiasco. Then again buying 25k call options with a strike price of 250$ on a 11$ stock is..... bold."
2021-06-19 07:38:55,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs nothing wrong with buying Wish. It‚Äôs an undervalued play. It becomes a problem when someone like op goes full retarded with these calls. I bought commons a couple weeks ago and I am doing just fine.
2021-06-19 11:42:44,wallstreetbets,It was up on friday lol
2021-06-19 12:05:05,wallstreetbets,Wish has worked out great for me so far. Bough shares on Monday and I‚Äôm already up 13%

2021-06-19 10:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Just to clarify. What I meant was that the DD I had read sounded plausible. Not that I thought it was a good company. It's like the epitome of 'cheap Chinese garbage'. I saw someone talking about a wish mansion and was shocked people give the brand any credit but it seems to be doing well in spite of obvious logic.

I thought maybe people here knew something I didn't, and the company had something good under the surface. I still wasn't going to buy into it. But I was willing to accept I might be wrong about them."

How can a company that is fraudulent (using fake pictures and delivering very low quality knock-offs of the pictured products) be successful.

2021-06-19 04:51:52,wallstreetbets,the only reason it's up is *probably* from billions of dollars of hedge fund money buying it before pumping it here on wsb lol

Idk why everyone on here loves funding the hedge funds who keep them poor."
2021-06-19 01:57:53,wallstreetbets,You putting AMC in the same category as wish or Wendy's only shows how ignorant and clearly afraid you are about your current positions.
2021-06-19 02:13:02,wallstreetbets,Hahaha just my thoughts
2021-06-19 01:39:13,wallstreetbets,Strike price is 12.50. Current market value was $250. Or 2.50 a contract.

2021-06-19 01:48:48,wallstreetbets,"I'm a moron, no idea why I thought the market value was the strike price. Then again 12.50... 250... either way the option expired worthless. In the spirit of Wallstreet bets shoulda put the strike price at 250 would of made a better story."

2021-06-19 09:29:48,wallstreetbets,"There used to be 50k of us. Now there‚Äôs 6m. 

And we‚Äôve realized the larger game at play. The hedges are killing us and stealing from us, and they are using this sub to steer people towards the opposite of their bets. 

The only way we end them is through amc and gme. Then stonks will go up again. The only reason the market has been sideways is because the hedge funds are tanking it to hurt us. They don‚Äôt want us making money as it comes from their bottom lines. 

Everytime someone pumps these distraction stocks it just makes all us original wsb people who‚Äôve been in this battle since January minimum continue to lose and drags it out. 

Imo we should Just all in on amc and win this. Clearly that‚Äôs the battle front now. No ones getting rich off anything until we shut down these fucking jackyls."
2021-06-19 09:31:27,wallstreetbets,With AMC even though the company has issues I liked the stock I felt when the pandy was over people would invest in entertainment again and with the help from the Reddit community I made a few hundred off of a sixty dollar investment. I feel like now I can‚Äôt trust Reddit because it has become infiltrated.
2021-06-19 02:07:38,wallstreetbets,"AMC is doing well though, there is no one near the quality of GME yet."
2021-06-19 09:36:26,wallstreetbets,"Amcs market cap is way higher than gme now, the battle has shifted. Gme got wrecked when rh fucked it up, they were able to exit a lot of positions and the squeeze is dead there until amc goes.

The cause of this was not fundamentals, but rather us broke asses couldn‚Äôt afford gme shares. So we stocked up on amc hoping for the squeeze there instead. And now look? We‚Äôre winning on that front. Gme hasn‚Äôt had weeks like this since January, and that one in feb after dfv doubled down. 

If you‚Äôre holding then good for you, but if amc fails, this whole squeeze is over."

2021-06-19 09:39:52,wallstreetbets,"100% I made some good ass money on amc too, but the squeeze is coming. These retards trying to hate on it are either shills or salty that they sold at a loss or bought in at 70 and bag holding until we pick them up, which we will."
2021-06-19 02:39:07,wallstreetbets,"AMC is doing well as far as stock price. But you can't tell me you think that AMC should be trading at 24x the market cap it was in 2019.

My prediction is that AMC has eliminated debt off the back of retail, and gotten some good publicity. But at some point when the rug starts getting pulled, AMC doesn't have a true base to stand on.

What's thedifference between AMC 2019 and AMC 2021? 4x the number of shares and less debt. That isn't something many people would want to invest in outside of a prolonged P&D"
2021-06-19 10:19:19,wallstreetbets,"GME is actually trying to pivot. New management, supposedly a new vision for the future. Could they fail? Definitely, but this is at least something different than what got them to this point.

AMC was also a failing business prepandemic, but even with all that has been happening, they don't seem to actually be trying to shift or pivot, and the pandemic introduced another hurdle, movie streaming. 

IIRC AMC managed to make a deal with a few places to get some sort of cut of those streaming revenues, but basically, they are still in the same place they were prepandemic. losing money with no real plan for change for the future."
2021-06-19 09:38:18,wallstreetbets,"Amc has a hope of staying open, as Americans like movies. I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs been to a game stop in over 10 years. We download our games"

2021-06-19 14:04:28,wallstreetbets,Totally agree. I‚Äôm sorry I will not put any money in stocks like BB because I don‚Äôt like it. It seems like people post loss porn like it‚Äôs a good thing. Maybe I don‚Äôt have enough money to laugh at thousands lost.
2021-06-19 11:32:08,wallstreetbets,"Which is all AMC is. Just go ahead and ask anyone in AMC how many times a day do they check the price? 

And why is that? No confidence in the stock and expect it to get cut in half at any given moment? 

HFs are playing retail like a fiddle and sure, they may have lost a few billion here and there in this, but when the dust settles from this retail / short frenzy what is going to be left are HFs that made all of that back and then some off the backs of a lot of bag holding retailers."
2021-06-19 11:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop is selling shit online and shifting to e-commerce. 

You saying AMC has hope of staying open = you in denial. Movie theaters were dying before covid. People will go to the movies now maybe a couple of times and they will go right back to being dead once the AMC hype / post covid life goes back to normal. 

And AMC will go right back to being a dying movie theater getting fucked into irrelevancy by a growing number of streaming services. They are even releasing movies straight to streaming platforms now... 

AMC is just trying to kick the can down the road and get as big of bonuses as possible for execs as they ride off into retirement and leave behind a dead company in a few years time."

2021-06-19 17:57:35,wallstreetbets,"Well, I‚Äôm not long amc like that, I‚Äôm in for the squeeze. Amc can just add a streaming service and they‚Äôre set. And I believe is. Gme is cookedX no ones trying to download 3rd party when they can just download direct to platform. 

Both companies are in bad shape, but the shorts over compensated and tried to push too hard. We caught on and stuck them and they haven‚Äôt accepted it because they believe after enough time we‚Äôll leave and fundamentals will win out. 

I don‚Äôt care about the fundamentals other than the over leveraged hedges who haven‚Äôt covered."

2021-06-18 21:26:01,wallstreetbets,Thats true however this meteoric rise in value of clne or clov is due to wsb pushing it up
2021-06-18 21:31:11,wallstreetbets,Overall CLOV and CLNE both have great underlying value (aside from CLOVS insane SI) and contracts for service and product.  Do some DD....also I like the stock
2021-06-18 21:33:58,wallstreetbets,I have done my dd on both while both have potential imo they are high risk regardless with unknown potential for good return due to them being memes at this point and didnt do super well before wsb joined in

2021-06-18 20:35:24,wallstreetbets,"I bought Wednesday. was browsing Tuesday but I expected it to drop Wednesday and bounce back Thursday.  coulda grabbed for $800 to 900 Tuesday, and it did dip down wn to $900 briefly on Wednesday.  I'm a little nervous since it's ATH and RSI is pretty high, but last prime day in October the stock closed Monday 6% higher than the Friday close...so I'm looking for a similar thing to happen over the weekend. 

Looking to sell one Monday and one Tuesday.  If it does repeat the pattern I might sell one right away and let the other ride since a 6% increase would mean its trading ATH and the stock could keep going up as it looks for a new resistance."

Merchants will then reach economies to scale with better logistics and quality. There are 8 billion people and counting in this world and the vast majority of them live in developing nations. There‚Äôs sooon much more market share to capture with primary consumers from developing nations and too much potential for this company to be not valued at at least 50 billion in market cap in the next 5 years given stable macroeconomic condition.

ContextLogic Inc $WISH

The company that removes the middleman and brings slave labor products directly to western consumers is currently in a class action lawsuit and has record low earnings every single quarter.

>On May 12, 2021, ContextLogic reported its first quarter 2021 financial results and disclosed that MAUs had declined another 7% to just 101 million. On this news, ContextLogic‚Äôs stock price declined by $3.36 per share, or approximately 29.3%, from $11.47 per share to close at $8.11 per share on May 13, 2021, significantly below the IPO price of $24 per share.

>The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) ContextLogic‚Äôs fourth quarter 2020 MAUs had declined materially and were not then growing; and (2) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants materially overstated the Company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects.

>If you purchased or otherwise acquired ContextLogic securities, have information, or would like to learn more about these claims, please contact Thomas W.

On this news, ContextLogic‚Äôs stock price declined by $3.36 per share, or approximately 29.3%, from $11.47 per share to close at $8.11 per share on May 13, 2021, significantly below the IPO price of $24 per share.

>The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) ContextLogic‚Äôs fourth quarter 2020 MAUs had declined materially and were not then growing; and (2) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants materially overstated the Company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects.

>If you purchased or otherwise acquired ContextLogic securities, have information, or would like to learn more about these claims, please contact Thomas W.

>The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company‚Äôs business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) ContextLogic‚Äôs fourth quarter 2020 MAUs had declined materially and were not then growing; and (2) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants materially overstated the Company‚Äôs business metrics and financial prospects.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I just bet against SPY and the DOW based on some DD. Am I stupid? So I took positions against SPY today (and against the DOW, A/K/A ""Boomer SPY"") because I noticed what I thought to be a divergence between the movement of the market and the underlying indicators.

From April 23 to June 17th/18th we can see the following:

The price of SPY has increased slightly.

The MACD has formed two bear crosses. Importantly: the second cross is at a lower point than the first cross, and thus it diverges with the underlying direction of the stock price (which is positive).

The RSI is also at a lower point on June 17th than it was on Aril 23, despite the underlying price going up.

Below is everything I've described thus far summed up in a doodle:

https://preview.redd.it/vabpwvs9s3671.jpg?width=1108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3bbdc21acb8bf33d5b1245b33d68e7d63cc73040

Generally, when you see the indicators moving in a bearish direction while the stock is moving in a bullish direction it can be an indication that the stock price may reverse. This is also known as a divergence.

Another bearish indicator can be when a candle closes below a moving average. Swing traders tend to look at the 9 day and 50 day moving averages for confirmation of whether to enter or exit positions. Here, we can we can see a full candle close below the 9-day MA on 6/17 and a full close below the 50-day on 6/18. I think this is pretty significant because these candle closes formed right after the lower RSI/MACD figures.

For full disclosure I have positions in SPXS (which is a 3X inverse SPY ETF) and SDOW (which is a 3X inverse DOW ETF). I think we may see a continued reversal into next week based on this information and I'm posting this because I'm curious if other people are taking similar positions, or at least selling positions in anticipation of a reversal?

Also this is not financial advice. Nothing on this sub is financial advice.

And yes, I do have a beard."
2021-06-18 20:26:17,wallstreetbets,I use these indicators too but IMO what you're showing with the RSI there isn't bearish to me it means it's stabilizing at a higher level.  And I find that for MACD the best strategy is to try to anticipate the cross before it happens I don't pay attention at all to where it is vertically.  Warning: this is based on nothing other than my own autistic strategies and is probably retarded

To bet on inflation I to refuse 25 years of lower treasury yields and they aren't stupid... my take is we are still in boom economy for another 2+ years and this summer is a shakeout before the market is let to fly higher than ever before. Check the interest rate to avg s&p p/e and you'll find a viable modeled range of something like 15 to 40 being reasonable p/e avg for the entire market. As interest rate goes to 0 avg modeled p/e goes to infinity... thus volatility and 0 fundamentals... in short... if you are against the markets short term could make some money... don't hold the positions too long though... cuz this market can bend you over at low interest rates.

Well, I have had my shares now for almost a year and made a pile of cash just clicking the ""Call -- Sell Open"" button week after week.

The markets are rigged.  Bet with the Fed."
2021-06-19 00:31:52,wallstreetbets,"Yep I know about the divergence stuff I just find in practice it doesn't work for me.  I still look at RSI to get an idea if it's oversold or not and MACD to get an idea of which way the momentum is swinging but don't really use them the traditional way.  I just look at the price action and general trend. I don't think it's insane but I wouldn't have taken this trade, if monday opens slightly red the dead cat bounce could easily turn into a FOMO rally"
2021-06-19 06:08:21,wallstreetbets,Maybe he's just betting against the Biden.
2021-06-19 08:01:30,wallstreetbets,Sit back and watch
2021-06-18 22:58:24,wallstreetbets,Doesn‚Äôt your underlying sqqq shares just bleed out tho?
2021-06-19 03:06:05,wallstreetbets,how many calls do you roughly sell a week ?
2021-06-19 00:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Not talking FOMO weekly rallies here. This is over 1-2 months for a minus 10-20% or over a year for -50%
edit: should confirm that this doesn't have to be the top - it can continue putting out bearish signals while rising more so don't FD the entire market"
2021-06-18 23:37:46,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't matter.  Just buy more when it reverse splits so that you can sell more covered calls.  I have made more on the covered calls than I have spent and it was free to get started because of the stimmies anyway.  One of these days the market is going to collapse and SQQQ will be at like $75.  It's my own tiny version of the Big Short.  I am enjoying the comedy of it all.

We are living in a world where everyone is diving into piles of doubloons like Scrooge McDuck...  A pile of doubloons that was free.

I have been doing this with GUSH and DRIP too by the way.  The entire market is insane.  Go nuts.  Do something totally different than you normally would.

This is of course not financial advice.  If you need to do something meaningful with your money then you should plan to do that wisely and never ever hold a goofy leveraged ETF overnight."
2021-06-19 09:25:56,wallstreetbets,10-15 now.  In the beginning it was 1-5 but I just keep shoveling the freebie proceeds from the sales into more SQQQ shares.  It's not a perpetual motion machine because of the decay of the leveraged ETF but it's pretty darned close.
2021-06-19 01:14:47,wallstreetbets,Lmao I take it back then. If you guys are planning on holding 3x leveraged inverse SPY derivatives for six months+ you are both completely retarded and 100% belong on this sub. Please make sure you post the results here when you‚Äôre done I will 3x cum to that loss porn

2021-06-19 00:16:31,wallstreetbets,"Interesting 
What's is your favorite timeline for selling calls? 
I mean 1 week 1 month etc? 
And how do you choose your strike price? 
Thanks"
2021-06-19 10:54:33,wallstreetbets,"So to sell a CC, you need 100 shares of SQQQ and then sell a call? Does it matter what strike, or to go as you said and sell 1.00 above or below?"
2021-06-19 00:47:44,wallstreetbets,"I usually do a week out but sometimes a month.  Since it seems like the Fed and Wall Street have already determined what their support/resistance lines are so I try to sell a call based on those lines with some wiggle room for whether I think the S&P is going up or down this week.  The S&P is really sideways or going up week over week so I pick a strike price .50 or 1.00 more or less than the current price on SQQQ.  Everything is stuck in a sideways pattern and has been for so long that this is really not all that crazy.  I just keep buying more SQQQ with the proceeds from the covered calls.  It will be extremely fun if the S&P drops like a rock and SQQQ skyrockets.  I have some in reserve (not sold as covered calls) to sell if the price explodes.  That's what I am really hoping for.  What led me to do this was the fact that A) I think the market is going to collapse eventually and B) they are paying NOTHING in interest on savings accounts anyways.  There's nothing to buy.  So I am just gambling it on an eventual market correction, which seems inevitable.

Originally I was very surprised that you could buy a covered call on SQQQ for a week or a month out since everyone says not to hold it over night.  Seems like that shouldn't be legal given the nature of leveraged ETFs honestly.  But it is."
2021-06-19 10:57:03,wallstreetbets,You pick the strike that is most profitable.  There a zillions of videos about selling covered calls for income on the internet so I won't bore you with the details.
2021-06-19 03:31:53,wallstreetbets,"Smart move specially in the moment of huge correction or collapse 
Good luck!"
2021-06-19 11:00:40,wallstreetbets,I'm genuinely in shock since it's working that well for you my dude. How do you determine whether wall street thinks its going to go up or down?
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021.

# **The Fed will continue to dominate the market in the week ahead after sell-off - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/the-fed-will-continue-to-dominate-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-after-sell-off.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve‚Äôs signal that it is looking to step away from some of its easy policy is expected to be a dominant trading theme in the week ahead and likely for the rest of the summer.
*****
> In the past week, investors repositioned across the financial markets after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank was considering tapering its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities. That is important since when the Fed eventually acts, it would be the first serious reversal of the easy policies it put in place to add liquidity to markets when the economy shut down last year because of the Covid crisis.
*****
> The purchases, which amount to $120 billion a month, would be gradually whittled away once the Fed decides to slow down and end the bond buying, or quantitative easing. That could then open the door to interest rate hikes, which the Fed now projects would come in 2023.
*****
> The Federal Reserve sent ripples across financial markets after its meeting Wednesday. The dollar jumped, stocks fell and bond yields moved to imply higher short-term interest rates in the future. The Dow fell 3.5%, its worst week since October. The S&P 500 was down 1.9% for the week, its worst weekly loss since February, and the Nasdaq lost just 0.3%, helped by a small weekly gain in tech.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the market is still digesting the Fed meeting,‚Äù said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Stocks were trading sharply lower Friday, after weakness Wednesday and Thursday. Yields fell on longer duration bonds, like the benchmark 10-year, but rose on the shorter duration 2- and 5-year notes.
*****
> The spreads between those shorter-duration notes and the 10- and 30-year bond yields narrowed dramatically in a so-called flattening trade. That‚Äôs common when interest rates are rising. The higher short rates reflect the expected increases in the fed funds rate, while the longer duration yields fall, because the thinking historically has been that a tightening Fed slows the economy.
*****
> The Fed also provided new economic forecasts, including a chart on interest rates that shows it expects to hike its fed funds rate twice in 2023, after its prior forecast included no increases.
*****
> Fed speakers will get a lot of attention in the week ahead. Powell speaks Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the Fed‚Äôs policy response and the economy. His remarks could be a highlight of what looks to be a slow, but volatile first week of summer for markets.
*****
> There are a number of other Fed officials speaking, including New York Fed President John Williams on Monday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both Tuesday. Other Fed speakers include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
*****
> ‚ÄúGetting more color from others will certainly be key,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Global Advisors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm most interested certainly in what Powell has to say. They‚Äôre all going to give us now the fine print of what was in the statement and what Powell said‚Äù at the end of the Fed‚Äôs June meeting.
*****
> There should be a lot of interest in personal consumption expenditures data next Friday, since it includes the PCE inflation index, closely watched by the Fed. The Fed has been pressing its view that elevated inflation readings are just temporary and that they should calm down next year.
*****
> Boockvar said the inflation data should reflect the same spike in prices that showed up in the consumer price index for May, up 5% year over year.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to show some pretty robust month-over-month increases,‚Äù said Boockvar. He said inflation data will be the most important for markets.
*****
> ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the rest of the year is all about ‚Äî inflation, inflation, inflation and how does the Federal Reserve adjust to that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn this inflation debate, it‚Äôs not just a U.S. thing, it‚Äôs a global thing.‚Äù
*****
> While the Fed has now penciled in two interest rate hikes for 2023, the market is more skeptical about inflation. According to futures markets, investors believe there could be one or more rate hikes next year and at least four in total before the end of 2023.
*****
> The Fed forecast 3.4% PCE inflation for this year, up a full point from its March forecast, but it still expects a tame 2.1% pace next year.
*****
> Housing data will also be of big interest to markets, after the Fed‚Äôs tiny step forward toward tightening unleased a surge in mortgage rates.
*****
> The rate for the 30-year fixed loan jumped to 3.25% by Thursday, the highest in months, according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed is currently purchasing about $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and that would slow down along with Treasury buying.
*****
> Existing home sales are released Tuesday, and new home sales are reported Wednesday.
*****
> # Value versus growth
> Keon said the market is choppy but taking in stride the change in the Fed. He said he has overweight stocks in his portfolios. ‚ÄúWe like that position with earnings likely to grow 40% this year, rates staying pretty low. That‚Äôs a good environment for stocks,‚Äù he said.
*****
> As the market traded lower this past week, tech and some growth names held their ground. Tech was barely positive, registering a nearly 0.1% gain for the week. The worst performing sectors were in the value space ‚Äî commodities-related or part of the reopening cyclical trade.
*****
> Materials were down 6.3% for the week, and financials were down more than 6% as a flattening yield curve has the potential to hurt bank profits.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe had a very good move for value stocks and for the reopening plays. They really did well for six months or so,‚Äù said Keon. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing in the market that keeps going forever. This is probably a bit of a counter rotation. Whether it‚Äôs the beginning of a major shift or a slight bounce back [for tech], is hard to say and rates are going to be a determinant.‚Äù
*****
> Keon said if the closely watched 10-year yield goes to 2% from its current 1.5%, that would be a positive for value stocks. But if it stays anchored around 1.5%, tech could continue to do well.
*****
> The 10-year yield, which is the benchmark Treasury, fluctuated widely in the past week. After starting the week at about 1.45%, it moved higher right after the Fed meeting to as high as 1.59% but then fell back down to about 1.44% Friday afternoon.
*****
> The 2-year note yielded 0.256% on Friday, up sharply from the prior week‚Äôs Friday close of 0.149%.
*****
> ‚ÄúMy guess is that the thinking is that at the press conference, Powell made it pretty clear he has no intention of raising rates until 2023,‚Äù said Keon. ‚ÄúUntil you get to 2023, you‚Äôre going to get the boom we are in now, and you‚Äôre going to get pretty strong growth in 2022. By the time, you get to 2023, the economy is going to be slowing and is the Fed going to raise rates in a slowing economy? Probably not.‚Äù
*****
> Keon said that would keep a cap on the size of the Fed rate hikes. He said there‚Äôs little chance the Fed will hike before 2023 unless there‚Äôs an upside surprise in inflation.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe market thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates until 2023, absent an unexpected surprise to inflation, and that they‚Äôre not going to raise rates that much in 2023 because they‚Äôll be risking a recession,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the Fed has now injected a new level of volatility into the markets. He expects investors will be on edge now as the Fed‚Äôs late July meeting approaches and again as the Fed heads to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August for its annual symposium.
*****
> Many economists expect Jackson Hole to be the forum where the Fed releases details of the tapering program. Once the Fed announces it will cut back, it is then expected to wait a few months before slowly paring back the purchases over many months. The end of the easing program is important since it would then open the door to a potential rate hike, based on the strength of the economy.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe narrative here is the markets are likely to continue going back and forth with regard to their view on the Fed assessment of whether transitory is correct or not,‚Äù Emanuel said. ‚ÄúTransitory‚Äù is how the Fed describes its view that the surge in inflation will be short-lived.
*****
> In the past week, some of the inflationary pressure in the market dissipated with a major sell-off across the commodities complex. The Fed‚Äôs policy talk helped spur a surge in the dollar, which was part of the reason for the selling. But the first catalyst was a move by China to cool the hot commodities markets. Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency planned to release reserves of aluminum, copper and zinc.
*****
> Copper was down more than 8.4% on the week, its worst week since March 2020.

> # Down Triple Witching Weeks Trigger More Weakness Week After

> As stocks continue to sell off on this Q2 Triple Witching Friday it is a good time to review the history and the pattern of down Triple Witching Weeks triggering more weakness the week after. This phenomenon is detailed on page 106 of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac page 2022. The updated table of the four annual DJIA TWWs is pictured here.

> The most important fact to note is that the week after TWW is the worst in Q2 ‚Äì down 26 of the past 30 years since 1991. Down TWWs not only trigger weakness the week after, but that trend is most pronounce in Q2 and Q3 ‚Äì the quarters within the Worst Six Months. Since 1991, of 39 down TWWs, 27 following weeks were also down. But in Q2 10 of the 12 down TWWs were followed by a down week after and it‚Äôs 11 of 12 in Q3.

> Proceed with caution next week. And Happy Father‚Äôs Day to all the dads!

> # Big Drops In The Percent of Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs

> In yesterday's Sector Snapshot, we highlighted how the internals of several sectors have weakened dramatically in recent days. One such measure in which there are drastic differences versus a couple of weeks ago is the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In the charts below, we show the changes in this reading across sectors and for the broader S&P 500.

> As shown, the two sectors which have seen the largest share of their stocks fall below the support of their 50-DMAs are Financials and Materials. Two weeks ago, both of these sectors boasted some of the strongest readings of all sectors, but through yesterday, those readings have fallen over 60 percentage points. Meanwhile, Energy and Real Estate have seen almost all of their stocks trade above their 50-DMAs over the past two weeks without much change. While the declines were not as dramatic as Materials and Financials, Industrials and Consumer Staples have also seen a significant share of their members fall below their 50-DMAs. While most sectors have seen a decline in this reading, Tech and Health Care have been notable standouts with both sectors having more stocks above their 50-DMAs now than two weeks ago. This is indicative of the rotation that has been going on underneath the surface throughout the entire bull market that began when the S&P made its 2020 low after the COVID Crash last March.

> # Leading Indicators Continue to Forecast Growth

> As the economic focus has frantically shifted from inflation concerns to peak growth fears to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) tightening timeline in recent weeks, it can be helpful to take a step back and assess the broad economic trend with a diversified set of indicators.

> Through this lens, we are encouraged by the latest reading of the Leading Economic Index (LEI), which strongly suggested that economic growth would continue at a strong clip in the near-to-intermediate term.

> On Thursday, June 17, the Conference Board released its May 2021 report detailing the latest datapoint for the LEI, a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special attention to the LEI, as it has a forward-looking tilt to it and spans many segments of the economy. The index grew 1.3% month over month, building on the strength seen in recent months since flirting with negative territory in February.

> ‚ÄúThree consecutive monthly gains in excess of 1% tend to be rare, and in fact, we never experienced that coming out of the 2008 recession,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThat we have seen this dynamic twice now exiting the trough of the most recent recession speaks to the speed and strength of the recovery. We certainly understand near-term jitters, but we expect broader economic trends to remain positive over the intermediate term, consistent with the LEI‚Äôs message.‚Äù

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI has shown strong growth the last three months after limping through the second half of winter.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.18.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

> Seven of the ten components grew in May, while two fell and one remained unchanged. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread represented the three largest contributors. Building permits and manufacturers‚Äô new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft detracted from the overall index‚Äôs performance, while average weekly manufacturing hours held steady.

> Strong breadth among the underlying components reinforces our view of continued economic strength. While supply chain bottlenecks and a slower-than-desired labor market recovery have acted as near term speedbumps, we expect those dynamics to largely self-correct and propel the economy further in the second half of the year. Reopening effects are snowballing, and we believe ever-increasing vaccination numbers, warmer weather, and the potential for strong employment growth later in 2021 warrant continued optimism for this economy.

> # Citi Surprise Indices Surging But Not Everywhere

> It is a boring start to the week with nothing on the docket for earnings, Fed speakers, or economic data. With regards to the latter, the slate will pick up tomorrow with several US releases including retail sales, PPI, industrial production, and more. Expectations for tomorrow's releases are a bit mixed relative to the prior readings in each indicator, but overall, recent US data has been beating expectations at a healthy rate. The charts below show the Citi Economic Surprise indices for a variety of global regions and the US. Positive readings in these indices indicate economic data is coming in above forecasts, and vice versa for negative readings. Additionally, higher positive or negative readings would mean that economic data is exceeding or coming up short of those forecasts by a wider margin.

> Currently, the US index is well off record levels from the past year, but it has bounced since the start of June. The index has risen 42.7 points in the ten days from the end of May to last Friday. That move stands in the top 2% of all 10-day changes since the index began in 2003. That also comes not even a full month after the index saw its first negative reading in a year. While the negative reading was far from anything extreme, the sharp rebound has been impressive, leaving the index at a historically healthy level in the 83rd percentile.

> The US is not alone in having seen a rebound. Although it is similarly off the peak from last summer and generally trending lower since then, the global index has consistently sat at the high end of its historical range over the past year. The current reading is still in the top 1% of all periods, and the move higher over the past ten days is again dramatic ranking in the top 5% of ten-day changes in the index's history. While the jump in the US index has likely played at least some part in this, other regions around the world are also pulling weight having seen just as, if not more, significant moves. Sticking with a look at the move over the past ten days, the gains for the indices covering APAC and Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all rank in the 98th percentile while the move in the index tracking Latin American countries ranks in the top decile. Each of these indices now sits in the top 1% or 2% of their historical ranges. One outlier region not contributing to the pickup in the global index has been Europe. While the Eurozone index is far from weak, it has not seen much of a move higher recently as other regions have.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-Regions.png))**

> Likely thanks to the weakness in Eurozone countries, a similar dichotomy can be seen comparing the indices for major developed economies (the G10 members) and emerging market countries. While the index tracking major economies has simply held up at healthy levels, the emerging markets index has leaped to new record highs, breaking well above the previous records set earlier in the pandemic. BRIC countries in particular are some to thank for that sharp move higher as the index has seen one of its largest short-term moves on record.

> # June Quarterly Options Expiration Week and After Historically Volatile

> The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last eighteen years, but down five of the last six.

> Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 27 of the last 31 years with an average performance of ‚Äì1.14%. S&P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 31-year span, declining 0.79% and 0.29% respectively on average.

> # Sentiment Shaky

> Although there has not been any sort of dramatic breakout to the upside as the index has fallen over the past few days, the S&P 500 did manage to tag new record highs in the past week for the first time since May 10th. The record-high milestone has done little to shift sentiment though. The AAII survey of individual investor sentiment saw its reading on bullish sentiment rise 0.9 percentage points to 41.1%. While higher, that is still three points below the reading from just a couple of weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The biggest move was in neutral sentiment as that reading fell 6.4 percentage points to 32.7%. That is the lowest reading in over a month and marked the biggest drop in neutral sentiment since the week of April 8th. Even though that was a big drop, neutral sentiment remains slightly elevated versus the historical average (31.42%) and especially relative to what has been the norm over the past year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> The past couple of weeks have seen historically muted readings on bearish sentiment. While that is still the case with this week's readings remaining at the low end of its historical range, bearish sentiment saw a big 5.5 percentage point gain rising to 26.2%. That one-week uptick in bearish sentiment was the largest since last September. It also marked the first time since the end of last month that over a quarter of respondents reported as bearish. While the move was not nearly as large, the Investors Intelligence survey echoed that increase in bearish sentiment with the bull-bear spread in that survey falling from 38.3 to 37.8 after inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment. In other words, broadly speaking, optimism has appeared to have peaked for the time being.

2021-06-19 02:25:29,wallstreetbets,Hoping but doubting a UPS bounce from FedEx earnings. Picked up more JPM puts and hoping the trend continues down so I can recover meme loses!
2021-06-19 11:04:15,wallstreetbets,My biggest play is Atha. Dropped 40% due to something the CEO did back in college.
2021-06-18 23:18:35,wallstreetbets,Astrology for apes

2021-06-18 22:17:21,wallstreetbets,"Haha, yee of little faith, one day you'll look back at this comment and laugh."
2021-06-19 14:10:42,wallstreetbets,cant wait till it hits 650 next week
2021-06-18 22:50:43,wallstreetbets,"facts, you don‚Äôt want to have to eat your words later OP. Just invest (risk) however much you‚Äôre willing to lose and you‚Äôll be fine üíéüëê"
2021-06-18 22:18:48,wallstreetbets,I hope you‚Äôre right.
2021-06-19 14:11:37,wallstreetbets,Still won‚Äôt be in your affordable range üòÇ
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,It ain‚Äôt much but YOLO quad witching w/ NVDA 
2021-06-18 20:17:28,wallstreetbets,These screenshots are intraday and not closed positions. NVDA stock lost all its gain today and closed flat. Did you close before the fall from 775 to 745? Provide proof. Most got burned today
2021-06-18 20:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Nice and fuck you , I bought 785 calls for 7-19, will the stock keep going"
2021-06-18 21:23:48,wallstreetbets,NVDA be lettin you put it on auto pilot
2021-06-18 22:13:35,wallstreetbets,nvda is for strong bulls üò§ congrats n fuk u
2021-06-18 20:12:50,wallstreetbets,Could go down on Tuesday since ownership record day for split is Monday.
2021-06-18 20:57:32,wallstreetbets,Why nvida?
2021-06-18 20:19:43,wallstreetbets,You are correct. I also have them all in my order history. I can send to you if you‚Äôd like. I actually sold for higher prices than these.
2021-06-18 20:22:28,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been burned hella plenty times. On Friday‚Äôs I‚Äôm selling in the first 2-15 minutes. Today I waited a little longer.
2021-06-18 20:43:43,wallstreetbets,Ape Theory dictates stonks only go up ü¶çü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíéüôåüöÄ
2021-06-19 08:18:04,wallstreetbets,One analyst gave a pre-split pt of 900. It's hitting 8 for sure
2021-06-18 21:24:50,wallstreetbets,Billy Mapes here. Just set it and forget it.
2021-06-18 22:17:26,wallstreetbets,[üôè & üñïas well fellow ü¶ç ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yio9_-5TMew)
2021-06-19 07:55:27,wallstreetbets,How does the split work for people that buy after Monday?
2021-06-18 20:16:03,wallstreetbets,Very good point but remember retail traders loves them post split price stock they once thought was expensive. Let‚Äôs see what the new brings us all üòéü§ûüíéüôåüöÄüåö
2021-06-18 21:13:57,wallstreetbets,Well. Cause the I like the stonk
2021-06-18 21:42:20,wallstreetbets,Because there is something called a stock split happening.  Hint check stock prices for Tesla and Apple last year in run up to split.
2021-06-18 20:53:18,wallstreetbets,LFG800
2021-06-18 21:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Set it, forget it and your tendies come out cooked to perfection.  Even better. For every tendie you put in June, four delicious tendies come out in July."
2021-06-19 09:19:15,wallstreetbets,You will still get the ‚Äú4 for 1‚Äù but your broker will be the one forwarding them to you. Most people just prefer to buy before then.
2021-06-19 15:21:40,wallstreetbets,They don't get the dividend on the additional stocks
2021-06-19 02:38:50,wallstreetbets,Good luck with that
2021-06-18 21:42:51,wallstreetbets,"If you buy before 4 PM today, you‚Äôll get 4 for the price of 1 on Monday üò±üò±üò±üò±"
2021-06-19 02:39:39,wallstreetbets,You short bro?
2021-06-19 08:18:50,wallstreetbets,I think July 20 is the date.
2021-06-19 02:40:27,wallstreetbets,Nope. I never short
2021-06-19 10:33:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that‚Äôs the date but I think OP is wrong.  I was thinking the same thing but that would be giving away a lot of money free.  We are misunderstanding it OP, our stock gets split into 4 so the 1 we own now is 4 hence 3 free shares.   Ideally wished they gave us 3 free stock per one we own‚Ä¶. That would be at today‚Äôs price , 2320 of free $ in shares lol"
2021-06-19 10:33:55,wallstreetbets,Can anyone clarify if I‚Äôm right?
2021-06-19 02:44:34,wallstreetbets,"Never say never. Buy the ticket, take the ride."
2021-06-18 20:04:29,wallstreetbets,Iiinteresting.
2021-06-19 11:34:32,wallstreetbets,That would be nice lol
2021-06-19 10:35:36,wallstreetbets,The price also splits : )
2021-06-19 10:39:30,wallstreetbets,It's worded very oddly. June 21 is the shareholder of record date. July 20 is when we're issued the additional stock and it starts trading at the new price.
2021-06-19 03:30:57,wallstreetbets,If anything l‚Äôd be short on nvda. Wish you the best tho
2021-06-19 10:55:25,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôll get three more shares totaling over 2320$ (at today‚Äôs price) for every 1 you own 6/21 when the split completes in July ?
2021-06-19 10:58:52,wallstreetbets,No you'll have four shares at 750 (or price on7/20)/4
2021-06-19 10:59:35,wallstreetbets,"So if it's $800 for 1 share, on 7/20 you'll have 4 shares worth 200 each"
2021-06-19 11:04:18,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs still great considering we will see a run up after since more guys will jump in at a lower price per share
2021-06-19 11:22:29,wallstreetbets,That's definitely the impetus to get in before the split
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Life Savings $WISH Yolo 
2021-06-18 20:23:59,wallstreetbets,My life savings has dropped from 100k to 10k thanks to my idiotic bets. I will return from whence I came... one day
2021-06-19 00:54:29,wallstreetbets,Holding my 781 shares. Looking fwd to snorting moon dust off my üçå

2021-06-18 22:11:10,wallstreetbets,Want to see gain porn when this takes off
2021-06-19 08:53:44,wallstreetbets,If we dip. I load up with another 2000 shares.

2021-06-19 09:12:27,wallstreetbets,"Fantastic holding .... Impressive 

Hold long and this could be a life changing investment"
2021-06-18 22:23:29,wallstreetbets,I wish you succeed. God speed retard!
2021-06-19 00:11:13,wallstreetbets,poor shitadel social media team.. they'd probably turned to stone by now
2021-06-18 22:44:05,wallstreetbets,Damn Citadel in here pumping everyone hard.
2021-06-19 14:25:03,wallstreetbets,"I have WISH, but I am buying AMC at every dip. AMC is leading to a historic squeeze. You guys will forget trading anything else. Let's focus on AMC first."
2021-06-18 22:00:52,wallstreetbets,Stop pull out of wish
2021-06-18 21:38:20,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs one of them days
2021-06-18 20:38:18,wallstreetbets,Think your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will estrange himself from you for such a horrible play.
2021-06-19 09:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Fuckin piece of shit im in. 

Apes strong together ü¶çüöÄ"
2021-06-19 18:33:26,wallstreetbets,What do you know that we don‚Äôt?
2021-06-19 16:40:37,wallstreetbets,I'll invest in some lube for your upcoming loss porn.
2021-06-19 16:45:52,wallstreetbets,"Idiot. 

https://i.redd.it/aincuinu69671.jpg"
2021-06-19 07:35:27,wallstreetbets,"Most options expire worthless. True, they are the real way to make insane money, but I don‚Äôt think this sub does a good job representing how many people lose their money using options"
2021-06-19 09:24:23,wallstreetbets,"It will go back up. Just hold, but man you really should have bought that $50 dip‚Ä¶."
2021-06-18 20:45:18,wallstreetbets,What has been the worst investment?
2021-06-18 23:40:18,wallstreetbets,More like car repossession and home foreclosure next week.
2021-06-19 06:25:21,wallstreetbets,How long did it take amc clov and gme? Sometimes drekin  forever. With that said next week
2021-06-19 00:45:42,wallstreetbets,It will
2021-06-19 09:30:18,wallstreetbets,"Poor GME holders, have lost 35% over the past 2 weeks while people trading AMC, CLOV, CLNE, BB have tripled their money"
2021-06-19 09:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how retarded you sound? People have made more money on AMC, CLOV, CLNE, BB than you have made holding GME. Everyone‚Äôs here to make money and they are making more than you. Keep your conspiracies on that other subreddit"
2021-06-18 23:12:45,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre an idiot
2021-06-18 23:43:35,wallstreetbets,I wish your dad pulled out.
2021-06-19 10:13:58,wallstreetbets,I feel like this most options expire worthless thing often fails to take into account all the OTM options purchased specifically as hedges that are never meant to expire ITM.
2021-06-18 21:02:11,wallstreetbets,"The worst single bet I made was GME at 400, that was a 50k loss."
2021-06-19 07:46:45,wallstreetbets,"One or the other, lol"
2021-06-19 12:25:40,wallstreetbets,"I owned amc, and clne. Sold both for nice profit and put it into Gme. You have no clue how much I have made off any of my investments. Difference is I actually research it's why I have already sold the ones citadel is pumping."
2021-06-19 16:55:23,wallstreetbets,Wish is an obvious pump and dump you sellout shill.
2021-06-19 00:01:51,wallstreetbets,U even eat crayons???
2021-06-19 09:35:04,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not buying wish and attempting to fool you. I‚Äôm worried you might loose all your money.
2021-06-19 16:46:29,wallstreetbets,"> Seems like these shorts are getting desperate

You sound like a complete fucking retard."
2021-06-19 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,OTM calls are the only way I roll. And never as a hedge. Though never with much money either.
2021-06-19 00:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Still holding, or did you sell?"
2021-06-19 16:30:37,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $85, sold in the 60s, bought back in the 90s, watched it hit 480 and cried all the way down to $45 when I sold.....whew...fuck gme"
2021-06-19 00:02:17,wallstreetbets,Jesus fudge packing Chrysler Tower.
2021-06-19 12:33:17,wallstreetbets,"I also bought amc at $8 and clne below $9, however you were probably one of the retards that bought Amc yesterday,on Amc day at 2:45 like Cramer told you too. The media and citadel are playing you."
2021-06-19 17:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you GME bagholders are getting stressed üòÇüòÇ, don‚Äôt worry, if the shorts don‚Äôt cover in your lifetime at least your kids will be rich (if you find a wife that is)"

2021-06-19 12:52:10,wallstreetbets,My avg return is above 500% which wasn‚Äôt made by buying AMC at $50
2021-06-19 16:49:17,wallstreetbets,"My mother would cut your shriveled cock off and feed it to her dog, you dumb poes."
2021-06-19 18:56:02,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt argue with you there.
2021-06-19 12:56:20,wallstreetbets,Good I have seen alot of those fomo buyers on here. Congrats on your gains. I sold my amc when I saw the media pumping it. Admittedly I did not make 500% but I was happy with my profits.
2021-06-18 22:50:07,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-18 20:03:41,wallstreetbets,"Wow it‚Äôs almost as if you have meme stock fever too and see only the positives in an investment decisions with none of the glaring risks associated with said investment. You have now learned why people can make any meme stocks sound appealing. We all want to make money. Now please, grandpa, let me get back to my video game."
2021-06-18 23:05:23,wallstreetbets,"And it's been as high as 12.10 and as low as 10.05 in the last week.  That's 20% swings = volatile.

Lowest low a week ago = 10.05.  Lowest low after that = 10.39.  Lowest low after that = 10.89.  Lowest low after that = 11.00.  After that = 11.20.  = upward trajectory for the week.

Seriously dude, what the fuck are you doing here?  Are you dumb or a paid shorty?  Or just a bored troll?"
2021-06-18 21:55:40,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had BB since it was 6 dollars because of the auto driving technology not some dumbass meme.  That is just luck. I keep investing because of decisions and moves that they‚Äôve made, not because someone shouts ‚Äúyolo‚Äù and ‚Äúmoon‚Äù thinking it makes a difference."
2021-06-19 06:26:50,wallstreetbets,Are ya winning son?
2021-06-18 21:57:51,wallstreetbets,That hilarious considering I see nothing but amc and BB in your history. You‚Äôre lying to yourself and that‚Äôs okay. After some time you‚Äôll come to terms with it.

2021-06-18 20:16:09,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs called WISH for a reason
2021-06-18 20:53:01,wallstreetbets,The stock doesn't need to hit 45 for the option to profit. Implied volatility will bump up that premium nicely if WISH pops anywhere in the $15-20 range anytime from now until June 27th.

2021-06-19 11:40:27,wallstreetbets," So math says that if he lost 12,750 off 300 contracts, that each contract has lost 42.50 since his purchase. With the mark being 22, it seems he purchased these for about 64.5 a piece. So he now needs the value of those contracts to damn near triple just to break even. Based on current greeks, optionsprofitcalculator estimates that for him to break even next week, lets say Friday, then the price needs to go up to about 17.50 a share. To double his initial investment, he would need the share price to hit 22 by Friday, so almost double in five days. His chances get worse as time goes on, obviously, especially that fucking far otm. Of course anything is possible, but there are actual ways to plan a strategy rather than buying the farthest otm call that someone is willing to sell you and just hoping. IV can definitely have an impact on this if it rises, currently sits at about 280% IV, but man that is one helluva a hail mary. Also, gotta make sure you can actually unload 300 contracts for a call that expires in less than a month with a strike that is 4x the current share price. I just never get why someone will spend 20k on a whole bunch of contracts waaaay far otm rather than just buying less contracts for something closer to reality."

2021-06-18 22:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Let me give you better reason to be bearish on Amazon instead of already priced in news. 

Economy is opening in US, and everyone doesn't have to stay at home to receive their needs. This will lead to decline in sales, and AWS growth will be slowed because everything is re-opening.
In fact, retail store sales are up everywhere by huge amount this quarter, and it's an indirect competition for Amazon. 
Amazon wasdirect beneficiary of COVID lockdown and since economy is re-opening, the decline in sales amount will be reflect both QoQ and YoY"

2021-06-19 17:48:18,wallstreetbets,"I don't know how long you've watched the markets, but semi-rational thoughts like that will burn you. Plus, it's news when they announce it. Not on the day it actually happens. 

I would say it's significantly more likely the price goes up, as there is ""hope for the future"", ""fresh eyes"", ""the next 10 years are already planned out"", and on and on. There's way more opportunities for people to rationalize this as a positive than a negative."

2021-06-19 08:54:36,wallstreetbets,I dunno about that.  This is the first I‚Äôve heard of it and I keep up with the markets.  Expect MM to use this as an easy chance to drive price down and steal some shares off retail.
2021-06-19 10:23:57,wallstreetbets,I think Bezos stepping down will have the same long term effect on Amazon's stock price as Steve Jobs _leaving_ Apple or Bill Gates leaving Microsoft

2021-06-18 20:27:40,wallstreetbets,I actually think this is good timing because with half the country being vaccinated to corona and even the blue states opening up; fewer people are relying on Amazon to ship them the stuff they normally pick up at the store‚Ä¶. People are doing their own shopping again or at least doing curbside pickup‚Ä¶.  This smooth brain think you smort!
2021-06-19 00:44:19,wallstreetbets,Didn't happen when Jobs left Apple - either time; didn't happen when Gates left MS - generally doesn't happen.  I'd argue Aubrey McClendon was an exception.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Where was the AMC Squeeze? After 2 weeks of AMC hype videos filling up my YT recommendation lists, countless online ""analysts"" completely bullish on the impending ""gamma squeeze"" that was all but assured to hit on Friday 6/18.... today passed with not much difference than any other day.

It honestly feels like we're playing poker at a high stakes table with the Hedge Funds with our cards facing up and looking around the room like we're secretly the smartest guy at the table.

Is it time for us to truly snap back into reality and really look at what's going on here?  Let's be honest... the hedge funds have had weeks/months to learn from their GME mistakes.  Any call options that would have been out of the money today was probably already hedged against days/weeks ago.  Even if they let $40 and $50 OTM options expire today, they are probably recuperating their losses in profits elsewhere in their portfolio.  There may never come a situation where the AMC short squeeze will actually happen.  The gamma squeeze??  Well, that's already happened when it spiked from $10 to $72.  If that's not ""to the moon"", I'm not sure what is, especially for a stock that is 70% over-valued atm.

I understand that this is a ""movement"" and that it's ""ape/retailers vs the big funds"" but I'm also seeing alot of people here yolo their entire savings onto a meme stock.  Am I the only one who thinks that we're doing a complete disservice to the amateur investors here who do not really know what they are doing and \*actually\* thinking they are making wise investments?

At the end of the day, there is no reality where the big hedge funds will just sit & watch and roll-over while we squeeze AMC to $100+ and then tuck their tails between their legs and just swallow the losses without any strategic plan.  I think anyone who is still waiting and believing in this will be the ones left holding the bag.  The same people who held at $20 will be holding at $60, will still be holding even at $120 (if that ever comes) and one day, they will be left holding the bag regretting all of the chances they had to cash out for profit along the way.  Do these ""diamond hands"" actually have an exit plan?

As the old saying goes, it's not a loss until you sell.  But the inverse is also true.  It's never a gain if you hold forever either.  Am I missing something here or are we still all convinced that the hedge funds will stare down an oncoming semi-truck and just stand there like a deer in headlights while retailers rob them blind?  Something makes that very hard to believe...."
2021-06-18 20:48:19,wallstreetbets,"Uhh it closed another 10$ up from last Friday.  There‚Äôs no guarantees in the stock market, if youre listening to a bunch of guarantees from people you don‚Äôt know then you‚Äôre the dipshit and shouldn‚Äôt be investing.

2021-06-18 21:59:55,wallstreetbets,"I'd say 8 of the 10 million subscribers to WSB are shills, bots, or full on morons that think only about these meme companies and how they're all ripe for a squeeze."

2021-06-19 11:24:34,wallstreetbets,"Okay buddy, first I wanna say you‚Äôre a goddamn hater. Second, the average short position is 47 days old which means most positions are in the 10-12 dollar range. They‚Äôre already underwater and have to buy the shares back eventually. If apes keep up the pressure obtaining higher closes each Friday like we are, shorts are going to have to cover either due to risk management or margin call. 60-80 million shares to cover. Now the available float is less than 10 million according to Adam Aron which means if we push the stock up, it‚Äôll go bonkers because of supply and demand. Now IMAGINE the shorts cover when there is low supply and high demand, it‚Äôll RIIIIIIIPPP. Look into the Volkswagen squeeze, low supply when the shorts covering cause that bitch to go to 1000."
2021-06-18 22:41:54,wallstreetbets,When 80% of the stock is owned by retail we are in very uncharted territory.  They have thrown every punch at us and it‚Äôs still close to $60 today.   Nobody is fucking selling.   This is a runaway train.

Trey shouldn't have said he expected the squeeze this week. Everyone needs to stop setting expectations on timelines.

The simple fact is, average short came in around $10-$15. Even from official exchange data the shorting percentage is extremely high. If retail keeps the price pressure up, HFs have to cover at some point, even if it's a slow burn.

It's just a matter of chicken, whoever blinks first loses and the HFs are pretty sure that dumb money retail will fold first."

They could wait a whole damn year or more if they want.  

Brokers will only force them to cover if they cant pay up, and they absolutely can.

2021-06-18 22:37:35,wallstreetbets,"Well said.

You guys need to wake up. It‚Äôs not retail that trade 1M shares a fucking minute. You see large blocks of 2m shares changing hands. You have millions $ in unusual options activity. Some hedges are probably making a killing right now. 
For the short theory, it would take about 2 hours for all the shorts to cover their damn position! And btw, it‚Äôs not even highly shorted anymore. 
When the music stop, you better not be the one left without a chair."

2021-06-18 22:54:39,wallstreetbets,"So what's your point exactly? Hedge fund have X method to not get caught in a short squeeze? Being what? Getting themselves into a deeper whole and shorting more? I mean correct me if I'm wrong but the fact they couldn't even drive the price down to 0 when it was 10 ,7 or even 2 dollars does strongly suggest they aren't winning this. 

Sure they can keep raising capital. Who cares. Deeper grave for them. Cost me nothing to hold. if HFs had a way out of short squeezes then we wouldn't have even had one. But we did. 

By the way, I'm assuming from your old comments you do believe there will be a squeeze for GME. so what's stopping your very own post being applied to Gme too? Nothing. 

I'm going out on a leap here and say you're just here to shit on AMC while holding GME. Which does scream paid shill to me. But whatever"
2021-06-18 23:18:17,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a lot of time you took to bash AMC. We‚Äôre going to the moon not 70s !
2021-06-18 23:43:03,wallstreetbets,You even eat crayons????
2021-06-18 23:41:36,wallstreetbets,"The problem with the squeeze is that every time the stock goes up in wild swings it creates massive opportunities to SHORT the stock in a better position. 

If I was a hedge fund I would get plenty of loans to short at current levels which are almost guaranteed to crash at the end of the day. And with that you can profit and close old positions. Or you could close old short positions and reopen new shorts positions at current levels. I mean this isn't a game that hedge funds will lose unless they are incredibly stupid."
2021-06-19 00:23:19,wallstreetbets,Good point. Retail only has power because we can share DD and info on here gamma and short squeezes can happen. The irony is that when you broadcast that to hedge funds they know exactly what you‚Äôre planning and can react accordingly without us knowing.

2021-06-18 23:28:37,wallstreetbets,"GME was always the better play.  Still is the safer play as they have a competent team made of amazon, chewy and google executives.  AMC has yet to prove itself.  If it does not adapt, it will fail.  Sure, there might be a ""squeeze"" but why bet on AMC when GME has a higher chance of a squeeze and higher chance of emerging as a dominant company ? 

AMC investors probably saw AMC as being ""cheaper"" and incorrectly thought AMC at $60 a share could be like GME and go to 300$ or higher like GME.

Ask yourself, why is the media constantly talking about AMC?  The media rarely ever mentions GME. Seems like they really want to you notice AMC.  Why? Because the media is in bed with corporations and HFs that are long AMC.

Looking at the data you have as a retail trader, look at the buy/sell orders on Fidelity.

If you compare GME and AMC, you see AMC has far more ""paper hands"" than what you have been lead to believe.

But the VC were obliterated in the process. What's the point of your side winning a war you don't survive?

Having new investors pile in is likely exactly what big money wants because they don‚Äôt understand and will close positions at small gain or a loss.

2021-06-19 10:45:12,wallstreetbets,"The variables favor the retail investors, as does the history of short squeezes. Since the early 20th century, from J.P. Morgan to the Railroad fiascos, the strongest force against short sellers has been the masses; that is, people fighting back against the short sellers through purchasing the shorted stock to raise the security price. Your comment about hedge funds learning from GME has a minimal point, yet logically flawed: GME isn‚Äôt the first short squeeze ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply the first short squeeze powered by social media.

Now, AMC may or may not squeeze; I‚Äôd go with the former, however.  The shorts have an awful liability as I write this response. They, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, have entered at the $ single digit mark (give or take). Therefore, the price has gone from $5‚Ä¶$10 to now $59; consequently, they must raise their asset/liability to match their short. That number must be astronomically high. Once it reaches a consolidation at $69‚Ä¶$79‚Ä¶ to maybe, $100, then I personally believe margin calls will come in. And then indeed, they will sit back and watch with their tails tucked in ‚Äî that‚Äôs if they can‚Äôt meet their liability, of course. 

Worst comes to worse, the NYSE neutralizes the short squeeze at their equal price discretion. Article vIII section 1354 of NYSE constitution, if I‚Äôm not mistaken, states the aforementioned."

I cashed in profits during the GME heist, soaked up alot of information and taught myself how the market works.  I bought in 100 shares of AMC when it was at $12.60.  Been holding onto it ever since.  I think WSB is a great place and I think it really helped put the blue collar average retail trader on the map.  It's a force to be reckoned with.  

But at the same time, the blind hive-minded mob mentality is a double edged sword.  If all we are is a one trick pony, then it makes it pretty damn easy for hedge funds to completely manipulate and walk all over us.

As the old saying goes, if you're still looking around the table trying to figure out who the chump is, guess what, it's probably you haha."

2021-06-18 20:20:57,wallstreetbets,Mine keep getting called away but it was fun for a while. It‚Äôs a little rich for my blood at this price but I might write some puts next week.
2021-06-18 22:44:02,wallstreetbets,Well said
2021-06-19 02:14:15,wallstreetbets,And what exactly are these other opportunities people should be looking at? Sounds more like you‚Äôre trying to discourage AMC holders.

2021-06-18 22:35:58,wallstreetbets,Today it's a gulag
2021-06-18 20:05:07,wallstreetbets,"If you got in at $5 congratulations and good on you.  You can diamond hand until the stock falls back to $20 for all I care, it's none of my business.  But not everyone had the luxury of hopping on at $5.  Alot of newb apes out there still buying at low 50s out of sheer FOMO hoping that this is the golden ticket to a 6 figure pay day.  I'm just calling out the obvious that it's clearly a bad gamble."
2021-06-18 22:30:48,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-06-18 23:34:39,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the strategy! You don‚Äôt sell it all, you keep some in case a spike happens. If it never does then just sell in a comfortable level above your entry point. This way you get some gains and don‚Äôt miss out on some crazy never before seen rise IF it happens.. either way you‚Äôre winning."
2021-06-19 00:13:17,wallstreetbets,"Wait, emojis don‚Äôt move the stock?"
2021-06-18 23:48:48,wallstreetbets,2 hours if people sold. Your talking pure theory now. If they held 90+ million shares is still a significant number
2021-06-19 03:42:21,wallstreetbets,Grow up.
2021-06-19 00:33:22,wallstreetbets,"Has it ever occurred to you that HF's can cover their losses in more ways than just being forced to buy back the shares?  Even if the alleged stats are true and retailers own ""80%"" of AMC shares, the squeeze is still not guaranteed if hedge funds never put themselves in a position where they *actually* need to buy back the shares.  Meanwhile, while we're holding onto one stock and putting all our eggs in one basket, they are probably recuperating a killing on their gigantic, billion-dollar portfolio.  Do you honestly think that a bunch of apes on a reddit forum are playing 5D chess while multi-billion dollar hedge fund sharks are running around panicking, playing checkers?  Food for thought."
2021-06-18 23:44:37,wallstreetbets,"Doubling down on short positions is something they have done all along. It's how we got here. Lol.
You said guaranteed to go down on a stock that has gone up for two months straight."

2021-06-18 22:15:08,wallstreetbets,Uwmc has been behaving like a pump and dump for the past two weeks. Amc on the other hand has a lot more support behind it.
2021-06-18 21:29:21,wallstreetbets,Nope. Was Amazon's massive increase in value a squeeze? A squeeze is when short positions are forced to buy their positions back from the market. There are still 90 million shares shorted against AMC (Per Ortex daya). When that interest significanty drops the short squeeze will have occurred.

2021-06-18 22:30:16,wallstreetbets,CLOV is different. That stock is definitely done but AMC is a different beast. CLOV only has bag holders. Some dude even bragged he didn‚Äôt sell at 4x profit and he‚Äôs diamond hands. Logic is so flawed and dumb I don‚Äôt even know where to start.
2021-06-19 00:49:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm not here to manage someone else's money or life.  People can do (and will do) what they want regardless of what I say.  I'm just offering a pragmatic perspective so that hive-minded apes who know nothing better than just following the mob can actually have an opportunity to process this information and think for themselves for a change.  Regardless of how market savvy you are, you do still have permission to use common sense and logic....  Just because I'm not spamming rocket/moon symbols doesn't mean my words don't have merit.  Do with the conversation and information discussed in this thread what you will.  I have no problem sharing my moves so far as I don't see it as a big deal as I'm not a financial advisor and just another regular retail investor.

I bought GME stock at $220 during the FOMO hype and sold around $340 to make a few thousand profit.  I was too chicken to risk any more money but still happy with my earnings.  I bought 100 shares of AMC at $12.60 and sold enough to cover my initial principle.  I've been waiting for the bubble to pop for like 6 months now.  But I'm beginning to think that the retailers still holding onto AMC are the real bag-holders at this point.  If by Tuesday, there is still no movement, I'm cashing out for sure.  This thread serves me no purpose except loss since I still own AMC stock.  But I still wanted to share my concern with everyone here because it is genuine.  If you don't believe that, then I can't do anything for you."
2021-06-19 02:46:17,wallstreetbets,"Good on you.  Don't let these ape bullies crap all over your gains.  Every one of them is looking out for their own portfolio anyways.  They talk about ""apes strong united"" but they will sell your tendies in a heartbeat if it meant an extra dollar for them.  Do what you feel is right and do what you feel is the more pragmatic approach.  Not everyone has $50k of disposable income to take yolo risks.  If you do, then all the more power to you.  Buy and hold AMC forever, it's not my business.  My post was directed more for the people who actually can't afford to lose $5,000 and being peer pressured into FOMO buys.  If we don't help those people out, the retail trader club will become no better than the hedge fund guys we despise.  Think about it.  If you own AMC because you smartly invested when it was $5-10 then I got no beef.  Hold and profit until your heart's content.  I wish you the best of luck.  My gains have help pay for my backyard renovation.  I'm just another blue collar 9-5 person who used WSB to make an extra buck."
2021-06-19 01:54:19,wallstreetbets,Gme has gone down 50% lol that has squeezed and is crashing ..duh

2021-06-19 05:17:43,wallstreetbets,"GME's crash is still well above where you'd expect a crash (or GME stock in general 12 months ago), so shorting any meme stock is the worst possible idea, regardless of whether you believe GME is running on pure meme energy or is a legitimate squeeze target."
2021-06-19 00:28:32,wallstreetbets,GME crashed  within days . It never hit that high again amc did not crash
2021-06-19 02:51:13,wallstreetbets,"The demise of AMC‚Äôs current SP are the retail investors themselves.

2021-06-19 00:21:52,wallstreetbets,"Just because someone is dormant doesn't mean they aren't a real person.  Not everyone feels the urge to wake up and troll WSB with a thousand rocket/moon symbols.

Everyone here drinking that mob mentality kool-aid like if you don't post rocket/moon symbols then you must be a HF shill bot.  SMH.  

I posted a few comments 4 months ago to ask questions during the whole GME fiasco.  Made a few thousand on it and started to really learn about how the market works.  So yes, 4-6 months later, now that I actually know wtf is going on, I can actually make a post that actually provokes some intelligent conversation.  I guess I could say, however, that intelligent conversation doesn't seem like everyone's priority though...."

It's like my grandma holding onto her AM/FM radio convinced that it's still the only way the government can get ahold of her in the event of an emergency...."
2021-06-19 03:56:53,wallstreetbets,That's a dumb as fuck statement. The play is for a short squeeze.  At this point in time the DD shows a very high probability of that happening. We know the hedgefunds havnt lost shit yet. We know what reverse repos are. If you're following along and verifying dd for yourself you would know your not getting accurate information on WSB at this point at least as far as AMC and GME goes. 1000 is hardly unreasonable for a short squeeze
2021-06-19 00:58:33,wallstreetbets,"if any of those favors involve frosties, fries, chickie tendies, and handjobs, sign me up."
2021-06-18 23:54:12,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers but it went from like 23% of the float shorted to 11 or 12% that day
2021-06-18 22:13:34,wallstreetbets,Oh no! I bought in at 52 and made a 200 dollar profit already! Cry me a river! Such a bad gamble! My life is over. I hate you elon musk.  You made me lose everything!
2021-06-18 21:52:38,wallstreetbets,"I know they are different companies... but was GME a bad play at $50? I'm sure there were dozens of people like you saying the exact same thing back then. It is exactly that, a gamble."
2021-06-19 02:29:11,wallstreetbets,"I just want to see 100. People talking about 100k per share I just can't take seriously, but saying 100 isn't viable in the short term I can't take you seriously either. I averaged up too bro I didn't buy all my shares at 5. The only tangible gamble that I see is whether or not the powers that be stops the movement in its tracks, because no question they can. But will they? 
I don't see the short term bear thesis on amc at all, and I don't think you articulated it tbh."
2021-06-19 00:50:53,wallstreetbets,All your doing is doubting data and asking questions trying to spread doubt. But it really all boils down to nothing. They are using all their dirty tricks to force the price down and still the price goes up. That's all
2021-06-19 00:02:32,wallstreetbets,"It has been up and down. If you think this is sustainable you are not looking at the big picture. The gme high is 483. The current price is 213. That s not going up for 2 months. That s a more than 50% crash and a very easy short position. I dont play meme stocks and I root for the small guys but the games will stop at some point and I am betting on the people who have the bigger wallets. (Or the small investors who know to quit while they are ahead.) 

Again it was impressive that the stock got to 483 to begin with. It is possible it even surpasses that level but very long term it creates easier short positions."
2021-06-18 23:56:31,wallstreetbets,GME best play.

2021-06-19 01:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Well you talk about dd and that‚Äôs all well and good but in the same breath you fail to acknowledge that A. today was a crap day for the entire stock market and 2. at the end of the day AMC is still up. Like HELLA UP. Tons of people haven‚Äôt lost a dime are up 200+%. And this insane upward trend has happened in what? 3-4 weeks. Most stocks are looking good if they gain a few cents in that time frame. People who got in on this early have no reason not to be bullish. And I get it that a lot of people also FOMO‚Äôd when it hit the ATH and are now holding the bag but it‚Äôs up to them to evaluate the risk/reward of waiting it out vs. selling at a loss.

I‚Äôm just saying that when it‚Äôs pretty much confirmed that there are people being hired to come into subs and post ‚Äúdd‚Äù encouraging people to sell, a post like this, on a red day, that complains about no squeeze in 2 weeks, but  omits that the stock is up 11 dollars in the same 2 weeks is kinda sus."

2021-06-18 22:41:09,wallstreetbets,Idk why they cant see that lol they keep applying that logic to stocks like AMC and GME  when its literally us dictating how far it can go. I just let them ramble on like the OP
2021-06-18 23:36:02,wallstreetbets,"Nobody with a sane mine would buy shares for $100 let alone $100k lol. I have no overlord, just common sense."

2021-06-19 07:24:42,wallstreetbets,I am just messaging you to thank you for your eloquent post and efforts. I keep trying to tell these guys the same thing but wow. You know what they say about a fool and his money. Anyway good luck.

2021-06-19 02:52:08,wallstreetbets,"None of what you accuse the HFs is false.  And that just proves my point.  They will do anything and everything to manipulate the price to make sure that retailers don't just waltz out of their house with their money.  Even if it means incurring 100M in fines, they'll rather break every law and get slapped on the wrist before losing billions of dollars.  Do you actually, for a single second, think that the hedge fund sharks will take this lying down?  You're basically fighting a war in which you've publically broadcasted your entire gameplan on a public forum for everyone to read.  You don't think the hedge funds have already planned 20+ moves ahead of every single retarded ape on this forum?  You honestly think they are ringing their hands in fear just staring at the clock hoping that the price doesn't go up?  If you do, then you guys are truly more naive than I've imagined."

2021-06-19 19:35:38,wallstreetbets,That would be the only indicators. Slowly sell as it rises and with gains you‚Äôre comfortable with. The SP currently is amazing to any investor looking to take a profit!
2021-06-19 02:39:51,wallstreetbets,"I've already replied and shared this in other comments.  I bought in at GME during the Jan/Feb. hype around $220.  Sold for a few thousand profit at $340ish.  Bought 100 shares of AMC when it was $12.60.  Sold some to cover my initial investment principle (which is the smart thing to do).  The rest I've been holding until now.  But something tells me $100 is not going to be in the cards.  So if by Tuesday, the price doesn't move, that means the hedge funds have already de-leveraged whatever they've lost in the OTM puts that expired today, which also means there's no point for me to risk holding onto AMC any longer and just be thankful for the $6-7k profit that I'll make.  I'm not a financial advisor, just another fellow retard who prefers to sprinkle a little pragmatism and common sense.  As RDJ once said, everyone knows you never go full retard."

2021-06-19 06:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Then tell me us, wise one... How will they ever get out there (continued) short positions without having to cover? If you don't know how, then I'm afraid you are just speculating"
2021-06-19 14:38:16,wallstreetbets,To make money. Dumb question.
2021-06-19 10:44:13,wallstreetbets,"Actually buying a put can be expensive too right?  The price of the iption also reflects IV both ways. At least when you are writing a contract, time is on your side. Just need alot of money."
2021-06-18 23:46:07,wallstreetbets,"Move on dude, lol its cracking 100 im sorry you dont think it will but it will, now take your logic elsewhere"
2021-06-19 05:53:39,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I don't think you have any idea whats going on. Difference in outstanding share between the two companies has nothing to do with anything. As i said, go do some research on whats going on"
2021-06-19 10:12:06,wallstreetbets,"They aren't really going higher and higher at this point though. Jumping from below $10 to around $70 was AMCs big jump, and a jump like that is nothing to shake your head at. But to expect it to continue upward at that rate is being dishonest with yourself."
2021-06-18 23:47:53,wallstreetbets,"They won't have to, because that won't be happening. It is an extremely unrealistic situation lol."
2021-06-19 14:41:39,wallstreetbets,So why even argue valuation of the company when it's not even about that or even the reason you bought in for?  Just because you're out doesn't mean the play is over.
2021-06-18 23:47:21,wallstreetbets,"I really have my doubts there lol. I think 80 is the absolute peak, if it even reaches that."
2021-06-19 10:08:55,wallstreetbets,"The amount of outstanding stocks very much has something to do with it. If GME had over 450M outstanding shares it wouldn't have reached the prices it did, nor would it be where it is now."
2021-06-19 13:46:47,wallstreetbets,"I expect it to go higher because I know whats going on, you don't expect it to go higher because you have no clue on whats going on and just feels its to high."
2021-06-18 23:51:07,wallstreetbets,I'll send you a pic of my tendies when it's over.
2021-06-19 05:57:06,wallstreetbets,"The peak will be way higher if shit hits the fan on wallstreet with hedge funds getting liquidated or something bad with the banks, but as of now i think you are right."
2021-06-19 13:44:54,wallstreetbets,"You see it dosent really matter if GME had 1 billion shares or 1 million shares, the only thing that mattered was that approximately 140 percent of GameStop's public float had been sold short.

You really should educate yourself on this matter before you start commenting on stuff you clearly don't know anything about"
2021-06-19 13:51:52,wallstreetbets,Yes I'm sure you have all the insider knowledge lol.
2021-06-18 23:51:45,wallstreetbets,I'm sure they'll be cheap ones.
2021-06-19 13:50:57,wallstreetbets,It is pretty ironic that you say I know nothing after saying the amount of shares in circulation doesn't matter. That very much does matter lol.
2021-06-18 23:54:43,wallstreetbets,Dude you're trying way too hard lol. How much they paying you?
2021-06-19 14:00:18,wallstreetbets,I give up. This is fucking retarded. Go buy your stocks based on shares outstanding lolz
2021-06-19 00:09:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm just being realistic lol. This isn't a longterm investment, and the risk of buying it at this point is quite high. Hopefully you got a good escape plan, unless you bought it back when it was $10 or lower."

I‚Äôm in Austin. 500-600k signing bonus is extreme like top.01% and that vests annually over four years. It‚Äôs not unheard of but not standard. Distinguished principles may get that but I haven‚Äôt even heard of a VP getting a package like this. With that being said, my boss left to go with a startup and his signing bonus was close to that and with the stock increase he cashed in 25% for several mill. But he‚Äôs VP level. Regardless, these are way above industry standard"
2021-06-19 18:29:56,wallstreetbets,I am constantly surprised by the jumps every year
2021-06-19 19:52:41,wallstreetbets,"First year with signing bonus does not mean you make 500k btw. Your salary is 200k plus bonus which is anywhere from 15-25%. A signing package vests over four years, so even if you include that you‚Äôre at 300-375k and it goes away after four years. Special awards are common but not reliable and rarely amount to more than 10% of salary. I was awarded one last year for 25k and with our stock increase it ended up being six figures. Nice but timing was lucky."
2021-06-19 01:59:56,wallstreetbets,"When you sell puts you want the price to  go up so you can keep the premium collected from others buying them (Its not just HF, IB, and MM selling you those contracts).  Selling contracts is riskier though because when you sell, you're obligated to do what the buyer wants.  Price drops to $15 and the person on the buy side wants to sell you their shares at $21?  You're buying 100 shares at $21."

2021-06-19 14:55:08,wallstreetbets,"Kind of, but with a few key differences.  When you buy a call you pay for the privilege of getting unlimited upside gains if the price moves above your strike price, i.e. you make money if the price goes up.  When you sell puts you also make money when the price goes up but only the cost you sold the put for (the premium) nothing else.  The other difference is when you buy a call and the price goes below the strike (out of the money or OTM) you can only lose what you paid.  If you sell a put and the price goes down you are obligated to buy 100 shares, per contract, at that price regardless of what the stock price is."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying a cruise ship! YOLO  Cruise ship stocks are overvalued and laden with debt, fuck that. I‚Äôm buying my own cruise ship. $18M for a 163 meter 1,244 passenger cruise ship. At this price it‚Äôs like $28K per guest cabin. You can‚Äôt find rental or Airbnb for anywhere close to this per unit and this is a fucking cruise ship. If I borrowed for the entire $18M, the financial burden per passenger per week would be like $21 compared to about $360 for a typical cruise ship (assuming 20% vacancy).

So how am I going to pay $18M cruise ship. Easy. Airbnb! I‚Äôm preemptively putting all of the cabins up on Airbnb. I‚Äôm starting with the spring 2022 cruising season. There are 405 guest cabins and 365 days in a year which is 147,825 guest cabin days in a year. If I get it 70% filled for a year that‚Äôs over $20M in my pocket and I buy this cruise ship outright. And since I don‚Äôt have to worry about any interest expense once I own the ship and based on the pre-2020 financials of other cruise ship companies, I should be easily able to generate $75 net income per night per cabin. At an 80% occupancy that‚Äôs $9M a year in income. At a reasonable PE of 15, that‚Äôs a $135M company with $0 initial investment and all I risk are a lot of nasty emails from Airbnb about canceled reservations if it falls through.

My only question to you illiterates‚Ä¶. What should I name my boat?

Here's my boat:

2021-06-19 09:18:53,wallstreetbets,"> The most straightforward answer to this question is that small ships consume a much lower amount of fuel than large ships traveling the same distance. According to the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, a large ship might consume up to 250 tons of fuel per day. To put that in perspective, that‚Äôs equivalent to over 80,000 gallons of fuel a day. Regular-sized ships, by contrast, may use up to 150 tons of fuel per day. As vessels shrink in size, so does their fuel consumption. In general, a more massive object requires more power to get moving. That power comes from fuel.

Now for those who are wondering what I was thinking, best analogy I have is deviation for card counting in black Jack. Occasionally you go ""against the book""
Hindsight is 20/20. I could have bought shares instead. I could have sold puts, or timed the top and bought puts instead. I could've done anything...but I didn't. And here I am.

I intend to recover from this in about a month or 2, post a screenshot update, and post gain porn when I hit double comma club by Christmas (goals)

You bought a call at 65 and you decided to exercise it when the stocks were not going towards 65?

So you bought how many shares at 65 and it dipped to 59? Then these are unrealized losses and since we all know AMC is going to the moon you're still gonna make tons of money



There's no way the premiums cost you 42k... so I know its not that 

Can someone explain wtf he did because I'm not seeing how he ""lost 45k""

Did he sell naked options? 

Im just wondering wtf he did"
2021-06-18 22:29:10,wallstreetbets,Not a loss. You still got 500.  Now all you gotta do is find another amc and gme and all in.

Also, why do people do options, when the stock shares were so cheap a few months ago.

Buying a few thousand shares when they were around $2 a share in December and then selling some to cover costs of the initial shares, all the rest would be short term gains (if sold.)"

(Bought calls at around 11:00, when it was still flirting with 63.) Instead I lost a third of it, since I won't hold options if I'm not there to babysit them. By babysit, I mean sitting there watching their value go down, hoping for a miracle."

2021-06-19 06:05:31,wallstreetbets,Give me your $8.89
2021-06-19 06:05:49,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs ironic to me that with all of the hate for the market makers, people here give them so much money by buying calls with no exit strategy and letting them expire worthless. Who do you think gets that money?"

2021-06-19 11:31:29,wallstreetbets,"Another misled individual who BOUGHT a CALL instead of SELLING a PUT.

If you had SOLD a $65 PUT you would have been paid about $2000 in contract writing payment per contract, and guaranteed getting those shares for $65 (well actually $45) a share if it dropped, or just gotten paid multiple thousands if it didn‚Äôt.

Instead you ate 42k"
2021-06-19 11:33:48,wallstreetbets,Why dontcha just buy 500 shares and sell options. You may not make 50k but 3k a month per call was doable. Less greed?
2021-06-19 11:40:41,wallstreetbets,"If calls have less than 30 days, just sell them and buy the ones with 60 days. This extends the theta as you lose more than half in 14 days."

2021-06-19 09:47:38,wallstreetbets,I guess I‚Äôm not sure I understand his play. They bought those awhile back I assume to make money on the options. No doubt over the past month they were worth a significant amount more than they paid for them why didn‚Äôt they sell some of the options take the profit?

2021-06-19 01:31:59,wallstreetbets,Go gay bear and you will go far
2021-06-18 22:11:00,wallstreetbets,"Basically you spend x amount of money to buy a contract saying ""any time before the specific date I can buy/ sell 100 of the stock for the price specified."" Calls are buy contracts puts are sell contracts. So if you buy a call saying ""any time before next Friday I can buy 100 of the stock for $10"" you will pay a ""premium"" to get that contract. That premium is the cost you pay when you buy it. The premium is based on how volatile the stock is, how much time is in the contract, and how close to being ""in the money"" the contract is. Plus probably some other math. The price of that contract goes up and down based mostly on the price of the stock and current volatility. And every day it is worth less because there is less time left in the contract. This time loss is what kills most people. At any point you can resell that contract. I think that is the part some people don't realize. You do not need to hold it until the end. You an also choose to ""exercise"" the contract which means you want to buy the 100 shares at the price in the contract. Obviously you need the money in your account to afford to buy the shares at the specified price if you want to do that. If you want clarification on anything I'll do my best. I'm not a professional I may have some stuff wrong I'm not a financial advisor."

2021-06-18 22:20:10,wallstreetbets,"Someone else sold those calls to him. A call buyer has purchased the right to buy 100 shares from the seller for an agreed upon price. 

If I have 100 shares of XYZ I can sell a call.

XYZ call, expires July 2nd, at a strike price of $10. 

The current price of XYZ is $8.

You think XYZ will go up, so you buy this call. The premium (price) of this option is currently $1.50. A call essentially represents control of 100 shares, so you actually pay $150 per call option here. 

Options sellers get this premium because they're taking the risk that the stock might go up and they will have to sell their shares for below market rate. Also the risk that their underlying 100 shares will go down.

You and I have now entered into a binding contract. Of course the broker takes care of all that behind the scenes, just like with trading shares.

You now have the right to purchase 100 shares of XYZ directly from me at any time between now and market close July 2nd. 

If XYZ goes up to $10 at you could exercise that right. I give you those 100 shares I've been holding on to, you give me the agreed-upon $10 per share (strike price) so $1000 total. 

You turn around and immediately choose to sell those shares at the current open market price of... ten.. dollars. I still get to keep the $150 you gave me from before, of course. It's in the contract. Bye, good doing business with you.

But suppose XYZ actually went up to $14. You exercise the contract. I have to sell my 100 shares to you for $10 each. You immediately sell them for the $14 market price. Cool, $1400. Minus the $1000 you paid me for the shares. Minus the $150 you paid me for for the contract. You pocket $250 overall. 

I got $150, but I was also forced to sell my shares way below market price. Bummer, but I knew the risks and agreed to the $10 strike. That's just lost unrealized gains.

Your initial investment of $150 turned into $250. A $66% gain, when the stock price only went up 40% 

And of course if it goes down, all the same. XYZ dropping to $6 would mean there is absolutely no reason for a sane and rational human being to exercise the contract to buy shares for $10 when you could buy for $6  on the open market.

You can hold the options all the way to expiry if you still believe the price will go up. Or sell it to someone else to recoup some of your investment. Nobody is forcing you to hold to expiry, you can sell it away at any time. But either way I get to keep that $150 premium. 

If it hits the expiration (July 2nd) without exercising it, then it has expired worthless. I get to keep your $150, but now I'm left holding the bag of 100 shares of XYZ at $6. That's a real bummer, especially depending on what I paid for them. Not your problem though. 

You lost 100% of your investment. But you did control $1000 worth of shares for just $150 put into it. 

As you can see I'm not necessarily bearish on XYZ, I'm just profitable if XYZ doesn't go up *too much*. 

The premium is set by the same bid/ask and price discovery action as any kind of market. Option premium tends to increase as the underlying stock experiences volatility. For example a stock that just went on a sudden 10% run from good news will naturally have higher prices for calls because some people anticipate the share price will continue to rise. Puts could go either way, depending on if people think a correction is coming.

I hope this explains some of the motivations and risks taken by both sides of the trade."

2021-06-18 22:38:22,wallstreetbets,I should also mention the premium is per share but because contracts are for 100 shares you pay 100x the price. For example if a contract costs $3.50 you actually pay $350 because it's multiplied by 100.
2021-06-19 02:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Probably ran out of time. If the contracts expire today and it is under the ""strike price"" in this case 65 then no one wants them. Why would you pay for the ability to buy shares at 65 when it only lasts today and you can currently buy the shares at 60."

2021-06-19 09:45:25,wallstreetbets,I find paper trading to be of limited value. There is the fear and hesitation element when real money is at stake that you need to learn to manage.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why ITUB still has potential and why you shouldn‚Äôt sell The muted giant. The new apple smart product the iTub. Ran by a legendary Chad‚Ä¶who we all aspire to be. iTub was very big talk on wsb and Reddit the past week but has since gone dark. 
Why?

Because no one has enough to say about it for their post to not get removed‚Ä¶

Anyways, those 7/16 8c whale orders everyone was talking about are down about 50% now. I myself have 307 7/16 8c at .09 a contract so I‚Äôm down about 54% or $1,500. But‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm not worried at all. Anyone holding these calls will see significant upside in the 7+ $range. Whales don‚Äôt buy calls to lose money, right?

iTub has decided to contest the allegations of currency manipulation that‚Äôs supposed to cost them a trillion dollars or whatever.

When we look at the chart, we see an upwards channel that has created higher highs and higher lows. This is Brazilian banking beginning to come out of the covid crash. Rates were just raised, Buffett is betting on Brazil, the CEO is named Chad, and whales are betting on this stock that also has roughly 20% short interest. This could easily move to the 7+ range in the next few weeks and I‚Äôm sure we are going to get some sort of news in that time period.

TLDR: Chad=iTub

Positions even though I already said it:

307 7/16 8c. They are cheap af so pick up some lottos while you can."
2021-06-18 23:20:27,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you on those 7/16 $8c. Loaded up on them earlier in the week. Not ideal so far, but not sweating it. Biggest bank in the Southern Hemisphere, looking for a little 2-3 week Brazilian bank run is all ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

Two weeks ago WKHS was considered a great squeeze candidate at 27% short ratio because AMC squeezed at half of that. 

Last week WKHS was up to over 40% short ratio.

This week WKHS ends over 60% short ratio. 

So where is the stock price after this doubling down of the doubling down by shorts? Oh, higher than it was 2 weeks ago. How is that possible?

Where else do the shorts have to turn? It looks inevitable. And squeezing from 60% short on a low float would be absolutely insane."

My reasoning for manipulation is that I don't understand why anyone would dump their shares yesterday knowing what would happen if it reached +12.

2021-06-19 12:31:20,wallstreetbets,"I think the most important thing about leaving my government job to farm is this: I no longer go to work; but I always have work to do. It‚Äôs a subtle difference, but I want you to understand.

Work used to be more of a noun: a place, a thing, that took 40+ hours a week. Now it‚Äôs a verb. Some days I work two hours; others (most) I work 16 hours. Work is no longer about filling time. It‚Äôs *about* work. Actual activities that must be done, so a plant doesn‚Äôt die or a customer is happy. It‚Äôs all fascinatingly tangible and *real*. My job in a corporate setting (yes, the whole private sector is guilty of this, not just government) was often pointless. The form I filled, the analysis I wrote, the process I completed was‚Ä¶for no one, for no obvious end.

On the farm, there is no wasted time. Last week, my brother and I spent four hours picking up large rocks (fist sized or bigger) from earth my father had cultivated, so it would be a better home for annuals we planted, like sunflowers and zinnias. Nothing can be more low skilled than picking up rocks, and yet, in a weird way, it was infinitely more important than what I wrote for the President at the CIA. The sunflowers that have sprouted are real and green and fabulous. I don‚Äôt think the President even read what I wrote for him, and if he did, there was no action item. It was a novelty, the whole charade of analysis. Rocks are just rocks, but at least they aren‚Äôt a fucking charade."

Demand has plummeted for bonds and America was using that to keep the printer going as that was paying debt

Some 101:

-yields go down when there is a lot of demand for the bonds

-If there is a lot of demand, the¬†bond will go to the highest bidder at a price¬†above¬†the¬†face value. This lowers the yield

-Demand rises because investors consider U.S. Treasurys¬†to be an ultra-safe form of investment

She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's AimeeC. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. There's no stock market in Mexico. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of a hedge fund. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell AimeeC to meet me in Paris, by the¬†Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the puts."

2021-06-19 06:35:45,wallstreetbets,"Alice in wonderland.
CHAPTER I.
DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE.

ALICE was beginning to get very tired of
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, ‚Äú and what is the use of a book,‚Äù thought Alice, ‚Äú without
pictures or conversations ?‚Äù
So she was considering in her own mind,
(as well as she could, for the hot day made
her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
worth the trouble of getting up and picking
the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in
that; nor did Alice think it so very much out
of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
‚Äú Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !‚Äù
(when she thought it over afterwards, it oc-
curred to her that she ought to have wondered
at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waist-
coat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after
it, never once considering how in the world
she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down what seemed to be a very
deep well."

2021-06-19 02:24:54,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre a female elephant, there‚Äôs a right way and a wrong way to play the mating game. To maximize your chances of reproductive success, it‚Äôs best to pair up with a dominant bull elephant in musth, a state of heightened arousal in which testosterone courses through the bull‚Äôs body, increasing both his sex drive and his aggression. A high-ranking musth elephant not only makes the fittest mate, but he can protect you by scaring off the less desirable younger males who would otherwise chase you around.



An experienced female knows this well, and plays the game accordingly. When she goes into heat ‚Äì or oestrus ‚Äì and attracts male suitors through chemicals in her urine, she gives impressive senior bulls the green light by holding her tail high, walking with an exaggerated gait, and exchanging affectionate trunk caresses. Lower-ranking young males don‚Äôt fare so well. She actively avoids them and, to the extent they aren‚Äôt chased off by her favored partner, she‚Äôll often spurn their advances by running away. (Little known fact: female African elephants can typically outrun male ones.)



It‚Äôs not so easy for a young female entering oestrus for the first time. She sometimes runs from the larger musth males, who can weigh more than twice as much as her, and not infrequently ends up consorting with a series of younger, lesser males. This can lead to unfortunate results, especially when you consider that an elephant pregnancy lasts 22 months."

2021-06-19 11:02:25,wallstreetbets,"In March 2009, at 17 years old, Miley Cyrus released the hit single *The Climb* with lyrics *Ain't about what's waiting on the other side,
It's the climb* - she was not kidding. After the release of *The Climb* Miley went completely off the rails in a downward spiral similar to both Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan at similar ages. Miley went from being America's Sweetheart to America's Bratty Thot Next Door right after the release of The Climb, again *it's not about what's waiting on the other side, it's the climb* - and the release of *The Climb* was Miley's peak climb. 

If you watch [the 2009 Climb video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NG2zyeVRcbs) you'll see a Miley that is completely unrecognizable from the Miley we know today - seemingly a lifetime ago, on a different planet,  a  completely different person. 

*Party in the USA* was released later in 2009 - a seemingly upbeat, innocent enough smash hit that took the U.S. by storm. You may not be able to see it in the [Party in the USA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M11SvDtPBhA) - but I can. *Welcome to the land of fame* ***and sex*** *am I gonna fit in*? Innocent The Climb Miley was dead, and what was to come was much, much worse. 


Struggling to ""fit in"" in the land of fame **and sex**, in 2013 Miley released *Wrecking Ball* - her boldest attempt at being a mainstream sex symbol - the video went viral as soon as it was released, not in the ways she had intended but no press is bad press and again Miley had yet another hit. *Wrecking Ball* was just the beginning of Miley's *Wrecking Ball* that she was serving up on over-sexualized impressionable youth. Miley used her *Wrecking Ball* launch to twerk all over Robin Thicke at the 2013 VMAs - one of the most prominent over sexualization of awards shows in modern history that was way overshadowed by Cardi B's strip tease at the latest Grammys.

*I can almost see it, that dream I'm dreaming* - was 17 year old Miley really dreaming of becoming a thot influencer and over sexualizing modern youth? I doubt it watching the 2009 Climb video, but as you can see *it's not about what's waiting on the other side* - it's not. What's waiting on the other side was a beat up and abused Miley Cyrus from years of drug abuse and failed relationships."

By the time Toyota sells their first 5m EVs, TSLA will have already sold well over double if not triple that.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Transocean $RIG: Energy Stock - 17% Short Interest - 6/18/21 Update Position Update:

https://preview.redd.it/1flv5ugdi2671.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=25b2ebbcacba61c7e5eb8465887f1c16f61c90f6

What Happened This Week:

A bunch of positive developments happened for RIG this week. I'll list them briefly below in plain English.

1. RIG signed two new contracts for $116mm of new backlog, a huge blow to the shorts who said it couldn't be done
2. RIG announced a $460mm vendor financing deal with its shipyards, delaying the capex on the newbuilds until 2022, which substantially improves the company's liquidity, another huge blow to the shorts
3. Board Member and Company Insider Frederick Mohn bought $5mm shares between $4.17 - $4.20
4. Oil prices continue to move higher, even after Fed officials appear to be focusing on controlling rising inflation

Another development occurred which I view as neutral.

1. RIG disclosed an ""At-The-Money"" mixed shelf offering of $400mm, which could include issuing more stock. However, the filing gives RIG maximum flexibility to help the company beat back the shorts. It's ""credit positive"" in that it allows RIG to avoid drawing on their corporate credit card and makes them a safer lender. It also gives RIG until 2023 or longer for the offshore drilling cycle to kick into gear, which is a lifetime in this business. With the shipyard financing deal they signed, RIG has no immediate need for cash, so there's zero chance they issue this equity today when their stock trades in the $3s. Further, an insider like Mohn isn't stupid. He knows this business is totally undervalued. I think his open market purchases of RIG stock on Jun 15 / 16 indicates that i) offshore drilling has bottomed and ii) the company is going to be supportive of shareholders. Buying today means you're buying into a super undervalued company with a 17% short interest at a cheaper price than a 12% shareholder with a ton of upside if things play out like I think they will.

**Bottom Line: I think $RIG trades to $7 - $10 by October, if not sooner. The investment thesis has never been stronger. All signs continue to point to a massive win for $RIG.**"
2021-06-18 22:30:01,wallstreetbets,"This is a company that's being shorted to death on zero fundamentals, it's pure insanity. The vendor financing deal resulted in a 10% down day and massive short selling, which is ironic because that very deal confirmed that RIG has basically cleared any risk of bankruptcy. It's now trading at almost 20% less than it was in March, when oil was only at $68.
 
Imo this is an earnings play, they have an amazing team and truly care about their shareholders. It's going to be impossible to ignore strong earnings and great guidance. Expect a 20-30% pop after earnings if it's kept down until then, but it's so overdue for a strong rally that buying now has very little downside potential.

Add to that a few more years of low rates and you have one of the best positioned companies to profit off the upcoming oil price boom, I have no doubt they'd be a good long term value play too."
2021-06-18 20:41:43,wallstreetbets,"I think BP took the big hit on Macando. But Transocean does have some concerns, I know there is a lawsuit currently with a rig staying on station during a storm.

That said, RIG is better off than their competitors, Seadrill is a hot mess as is Valaris. Noble just merged with Pacific so they are another decent competitor."
2021-06-18 21:52:53,wallstreetbets,"How do companies like $KOS, for example, fit into this? I‚Äôm a geologist but mostly work with infrastructure and resource contracts. Would be curious to learn more. If you are an offshore speculation company, who are you hiring? And why? I‚Äôve always liked $RIG but dont know enough about what differentiates them"
2021-06-18 22:15:38,wallstreetbets,"Kosmos Energy? They are an example of a client for RIG. For instance, a company like BP or Shell or KOS or Deep Gulf Energy hires a rig for xx days to conduct exploration (or well intervention). KOS pays the day rate as per the contract while RIG provides the expertise to drill. KOS will bring on their own geologists to make a well plan and direct the overall operation in tandem with RIG. KOS will have their own company man onboard as well as other third party contractors(occasionally these are hired directly by RIG, depends on contract). That company man directs drilling in collaboration with RIG‚Äôs drilling superintendent(may have a different title depending on company). KOS looks at dayrate, company performance, and likely other factor to select a company. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what they look at beyond those two since I‚Äôve only worked on the drillers side. I can tell you that the majors (BP, Shell, Total) ask for loads of information while your smaller energy companies focus more on day rate. The packages we‚Äôve prepared for the majors can be hundreds of pages."

This is only the beginning for this stock as they will dominate the sector over the next decade. They have 115000 charging stations worldwide at the moment. In 2025 that number will be 2.5 million according to the CEO. Any longs on CHPT know that this is a huge opportunity right in front of our eyes. I would not chase to buy at the moment maybe we will experience a pull back to high 20s. But maybe at the same time 30 is the new floor. Let me know in the comments if any of you long on CHPT.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid ( RAD ) Earnings Due Out Next Week - June 24, 2021. Strong results due to COVID-19 vaccinations administered could be a catalyst for the stock price to climb higher. As we head into next week (week of Jun 21, 2021) with Rite Aid ( $RAD ) set to report fiscal Q1 earnings of Thursday, June 24th, some points to consider:  
  
1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars. Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA last year (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?  
  
2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million. This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.  
  
3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year. Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid. This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings. Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.  
  
4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up against RAD recently.  Short interest is up to 15.5% of the total outstanding shares.  That represents 8.33 million shares short.  Institutions, mutial funds, and insiders own more than 60% of the total shares outstanding.  That means that 35.8% to 46.3% shares are short excluding ownership by institutions, mutual funds, and insiders.  **Positive earnings on June 24th could be a catalyst for a major squeeze.**   
5) The Bartell Drugs acquisition closed at the start of 2021.  While it is unlikely to contribute materially to net earnings during the current fiscal year, it is expected to do so next year. The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.  
  
6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.  
  
7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year). For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).  
  
8) Break-up value of the company is estimated to be in the range of $40 - $50 per share.  This despite a current share price of under $21.  

Does this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $21 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?"
2021-06-19 10:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Bought the Friday dip here. This is conceivably an acquisition target too, no?"
2021-06-19 00:43:53,wallstreetbets,Earnings beat followed by sell off?
2021-06-19 10:50:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:

\*\*\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \*\*\*  
  
CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:  
  
""It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""  
  
Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:  
  
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI  
  
So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.  
  
\*\*\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \*\*\*  
  
Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  
  
A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  
  
Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability  
  
All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  
  
Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.  
  
\*\*\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \*\*\*  
  
Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.  
  
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021  
  
An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  
  
\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS  
  
\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category  
  
\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.  
  
So, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!"
2021-06-18 20:50:58,wallstreetbets,Institutional ownership according to Fintel shows 74% ownership. Tracking RAD Institutional ownership. In the last 3yr. Ownership has gone from 47% to 74%. A steady increase overtime. BlackRock owns 9% of RAD just on their own. Some other Institution own 10%. That shows a lot of confidence from Fund managers. Not that they know everything.
2021-06-18 21:06:13,wallstreetbets,"The only way that happens is a coordinated Short Attack. We have seen several. If you do see you, back the truck up. They never last because the price is already ridiculously low. Funds come in and buy right back up. Look at 2yr chart and you will see it. Last earnings they did that very thing, however there's going to come a time when it just takes off and doesn't look back."
2021-06-19 19:11:26,wallstreetbets,Brilliant write up here. Thank you!
2021-06-18 20:53:04,wallstreetbets,I know I do.
2021-06-18 20:21:31,wallstreetbets,"If you buy them after Shorts attack the stock. You can do well. Shorts are constantly attacking RAD to suppress the price. No it's not easy, but they have a pattern. Like buying $23 strike calls after the 9th expiration will likely do well. In fact RAD could be well  into the $30 if earnings do well with good guidance. Shorts will have to cover at some point. For every $10 move up in RAD's price. Shorts lose $160 million. Being in Calls if RAD squeezes could pay very well. So use play money, but it beats a lottery ticket. 10 shares could double your money easily, but 10 contracts could make you 15k."

I see why some of wall st bears r shorting this spreading wrong information that covid revenue may taper down. But let me clear all the facts. 

1. Yes covid Rvenue will come down. They made staggering Rvenue this year close to 800m$. 
2. Rvenue from non covid jumped 180m$ 3x last year. Coming years they will include cancer related testing and expanding in Europe and China. 
3. Ignoring covid Rvenue. They will be asking more than 200m$ from 2021 and taking in to account covid Rvenue. They will make additional minimum of 100-300m$ unlike 700m+ in 2021. I can see easily crossing 300m$ in 2022 and CAGR 15-30% 
4. peer comparison- ILMN and INVITAE trade at 15x sales 100x eps. If u apply same
Comparison to this great growth company. It shud trade at 4.5b$ market cap. 
5. It has 700m$ cash of today and will go to 1b$ by 2021. 
6. Fair price should be 150-180$.

Weedmaps officially merged and became public as $MAPS.

This early opportunity means big gains with extra girth üçÜ Get in a space suit because we are not just launching to mars we‚Äôre going to fucking colonize it üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Weedmaps is a well established app and website that many would consider to be the ‚ÄúYelp of Cannabis‚Äù, but it‚Äôs much more than that. Their online business model and popularity has made them a very dominant leader in the Cannabis Tech industry. One very important advantage Weedmaps has is that they aren‚Äôt weighed down by Cannabis Laws or Regulations because they don‚Äôt physically handle the plant. Some main features of Weedmaps is that you can find dispensaries in your area and read/write reviews; as well as view products, find deals, search for a specific product and make online purchases from dispensaries who deliver. Weedmaps has millions of active users in just the US and Canada and can expand far beyond that. Since they are an online tech company they have a massive opportunity to grow worldwide as the Cannabis Industry takes off. Since dispensaries pay to be listed on Weedmaps, this world wide market screams profit. ü§ëüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"

In these same patients, simufilam also improved dementia-related behavior, such as anxiety, delusions and agitation, by 1.3 points on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, a 29% mean improvement from baseline to month 6.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLF devotees what does this mean? So I read today the following:

| ‚ÄúArcelorMittal North America Holding, a wholly owned subsidiary of ArcelorMittal SA (‚ÄòArcelorMittal‚Äô or ‚Äòthe Company‚Äô) announces today the conclusion of the sale of its remaining 38.2 million common shares in Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (‚ÄòCleveland-Cliffs‚Äô) following receipt of the shares on 9 June 2021.

The value crystalized from this sale of Cleveland-Cliffs common shares will be returned to shareholders via a new $750 million share buyback program of ArcelorMittal common shares. This new share buyback program will commence immediately and follows the previous buyback program which is now complete.¬† 

The disposal of the remaining common shares in Cleveland Cliffs brings the total cash proceeds from the sale of ArcelorMittal USA to $1.9 billion so far, all of which will have been returned to ArcelorMittal shareholders via share buybacks.‚Äù

Ummm‚Ä¶does this mean ArcelorMittal just sold
$1.9b of CLF common stock since June 9? If so‚Ä¶that seems like a shit ton of negative stock pressure. And now that it‚Äôs done, can CLF resume its gains on surging steel prices?

If I look at a graph of CLF stock price, starting on June 11 or so, it‚Äôs a straight nosedive from $24 to $20. 

Can someone who knows their ass from their elbow chime in and tell me whether the ArcelorMittal announcement means what I think it means?"

2021-06-18 23:34:26,wallstreetbets,"If that‚Äôs the case why wouldn‚Äôt it just be priced in now? Everything is priced in, and nothing is priced in. It‚Äôs the market paradox."
2021-06-19 10:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Steel prices and other basic material prices have run-up a lot already, and inflation has occurred already. The fear is that these prices will become permanent and will affect prices further down the industrial chain. The Fed tries to contain inflation below 2%, except in the current economic recovery they have decided to let it ""run hot"". 

That made some since because we've been in a deflationary environment for years, but there's pretty good evidence that it's hotter than the Fed expected. That kind of thing moves markets.

The Fed says they will stay the course with their policy because they need to create more jobs, but there's a possiblity that they could be forced to intervene as early as sometime next year. Runaway inflation would be an economic crisis. It's a lot more complicated than I've just explained, but that's the gist of it."
2021-06-18 23:58:26,wallstreetbets,"Well, with CLF giving guidance updates frequently - it should be priced in, but there could be some surprises."

2021-06-18 23:57:40,wallstreetbets,Hard to say market dropped about 10% now so it‚Äôs in correction territory.  Not sure when it‚Äôs done and CLF could get caught with the market.
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wallstreet Hold'em ODDS: Reverse Repo, Inflation, Interest Hikes. Everyone loves money and the casino is shutting off some games.

edit\* Here's a scratch off ticket:

**Key words to understand:**

**Inflation-** Things cost more, the purchasing power of the dollar is less. You probably already notice that  materials have cost more. Inflation as mentioned by the FEDs is temporary and here to stay, for now. Think materials like stock, people hoard, lack of supply, lumber hits $1000 per 1000 ft. The overestimated inflation is now coming back to to find a midpoint. Because inflation is here we need to take a look at the return on investments.

&#x200B;

>!Inflation short term, it's already here! Commodities are dumping from being over inflated. With inflation being here, better make sure you beat inflation.!<

&#x200B;

**Interest Hike** \- Everyone is talking about whether or not JPOW is going to raise interest rates to counter inflation. By raising rates you would make people spend less because you get more of a return from savings than spending. If people spend less, then demand goes and deflation will occur.

>!Interest rate hikes adjust from 2024 to 2023. More inflation?! Possibly, but the 5 year yields are going up and the 30 year yields are going down. More return on investments for 5 year vs 30 year. What does this mean?! Borrowing short term money will cost you more than borrowing long term money. The 5 year and 30 year. Growth is slowing so you get punished for not growing. With the rates of 5 years going up to pass the 30 year, an economic slow down is suggested. Better make sure you beat that short term treasury rate.!<

&#x200B;

**Reverse Repo-** June just provided the highest reverse repo of all time. Reverse repo is the buying of securities or equities and and promising to only sell them at a higher price. Think stocks now. Where will money go if you are guaranteeing you'll only sell at a higher price.

>!Repos and reverse repos are short term borrowed money. With such high reverse repos, better make sure you beat that increased short term borrow rate.!<

&#x200B;

**TOUR OF CASINO**

You walk into the casino, the thermostat is set at a mild temperature. Maybe a little too warm. The lights turn on. There is suddenly a halt and an announcement that there are table staff changes.

&#x200B;

Let's take a tour of the casino and look at the systems in the casino and see where we are positioned.

**Slots** (>!Dividend Stocks!<): People tend to like dividend stocks because the companies pay you for holding the shares. Dividends generally pay 2-4%. The issue here is that in an economic slow down, companies may see a reduced revenue and the dividend payout might not beat the interest rates. If you get 2% in a savings account, why risk the biscuit for the dividend?

**Roulette** (>!Defense Pharma & Research Heavy Stocks!<): To save money during inflation, there are generally budget cuts to stop spending. This affects the defense sector in many ways. Future grants are generally pulled and R&D is usually cut.

**Craps** (>!ETFs, recovery, inelastic holdings!<): Not sure what to hold, want to be safe, let someone else do it for you. ETFs generally hold some form of dividend stock or businesses that stay flat for stable growth. At times like this where there are still better investments on the table like hiked treasuries, foreign investments, and growth stonks. Who likes watching money burn in ETFs? Talk about .5% fees.

**Blackjack (**>!Meme stocks, trenders!<**):** Memes don't last forever, but we will forever remember the meme. The come and go, that's just the way it is. Big money, small money, no money, doesn't ever want to bag hold. Just here to win it and make a killing. With money moving away from the stock market going out, volume will be a lot less. It's one on one with the dealer. How many hands do you want to play?

**Poker (**>!Growth Stocks!<**):**  So you're telling me growth stocks don't need to spend much on R&D?! YES! Let's narrow down the list that has shown exceptional growth. Got dealt two aces, might as well push everyone else out. Ace 1( Growing Revenue YoY), Ace 2 (Growing footprint YoY)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Which game do you want to play? Seems like the casino is shutting down some of it's services and the others don't have many players.

&#x200B;

**I can't bluff well so I'm going to try the games:**

**Slots** You start playing and accumulate into year 2030. >!You're finally at your breakeven point, the bullmarket starts. Oh the joy of saving and making null.!<

&#x200B;

**Roulette** baby, here we go! Yolo is the only way of life, either get rich or die trying. >!You died!<

&#x200B;

**Craps.** Throw ten darts and land three, win some lose some. It's only money. Time to roll the dice. You start winning, then you start losing. Then you win some more. >!Radioshack bled out by accident. Fuck my life.!<

&#x200B;

**Blackjack**. Man, I don't really want to play alone, let's find a crowd.>! You find a good seat with a lot of players. The table suddenly goes out of service. You panic and rush to the nearest one and go all in. You died.!<

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ah.... you chose (**Poker)**

Not a bad choice. Fun game.

Let's look at what growth stocks there are that are generating great income and expanding the foot print.

There's large caps like: >!SQ, FB, NFLX, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN!<

There's small and mid caps like: >!FVRR, ETSY, PINS!<

There's proven foreign growth investments like: >!BABA, JD, TSM!<

There's semis who can't meet current demand: >!AMD, NVDA!<, >!oops \~\~INTC drank one too many drinks \~\~!<

&#x200B;

14 choices!? So many to choose from! Takes step back. (**over 9000 tickers**)

&#x200B;

**I'll buy the dip, no worries**....  >!who says there will have to be a dip for growth stocks?!<"
2021-06-19 01:28:13,wallstreetbets,Why not wait for cpi ppi data next month üôÑ? The market is very frothy we need more clarification. If those numbers will be higher than expected Powell speech will change. He can‚Äôt say transitory inflation forever if numbers tell different stories
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Just a 40 yr old NVDA bull Full disclosure I am and have been long Nvdia since 2015. I want to give props to all of you who have profited on the meme/short squeeze phenomenon. I personally did not participate but thoroughly enjoyed watching it unfold. My advice would be to take some profit off the table, if you haven‚Äôt already done so, and move into a long term play. NVDA is on a tear and will own the next decade. I‚Äôm looking forward to putting my feet up and watching them continue to spread their tentacles into the many emerging themes they are involved in. AI,Datacenter, Gaming, autonomous/IOT. They are splitting 4:1 in July and I invite all of you to join. Again, congrats on the money made and continued success to all of you!"
2021-06-18 20:39:56,wallstreetbets,Something you might want to add is they were given recently upgraded price targets of $850 and $900. Today saw a high of 775 until it dropped back to opening price. With the crazy upswing in price recently it may drop more in the next few days. So for the inpatient that can chill for a couple of days for a rebound you might see a good opportunity to play options.
2021-06-19 00:43:37,wallstreetbets,Get in while you can ! This is 2T within 2 years.
2021-06-19 11:12:53,wallstreetbets,Always wanted to get into Nvidia but its gonna cost all my ribs to get in lol.
2021-06-18 20:09:50,wallstreetbets,Hopefully they don't split 1:4. I like their current plan in splitting 4:1
2021-06-18 21:57:13,wallstreetbets,Nvda is a super play. One of the stocks I needed to grab last March around 200. It has been good and I have no reason to believe it won't keep going
2021-06-19 04:31:10,wallstreetbets,I regret selling my NVDA last year. Got a bitter taste at the thought of buying in at multiples of what I sold at lol
2021-06-19 07:02:06,wallstreetbets,You sound like Cramer.
2021-06-19 17:31:12,wallstreetbets,"I've wanted to go long with them, but it's just been going up so much I don't trust getting on board right now. I'd almost rather take the risk and wait to see if there's a remarkable correction.

If I miss it, then it is what it is.

Sometimes you need to accept your so late to the party that your better off turning around and heading home. That's kinda how I feel about this company."
2021-06-18 23:09:05,wallstreetbets,I have around 10k sitting around in SPY @400 should I throw into NVDA before the split or afyer

2021-06-19 13:47:16,wallstreetbets,"No thank you. NVDA looks overvalued. It's currently trading above the average analyst price targets...

2021-06-18 20:16:32,wallstreetbets,Haha good point
2021-06-18 22:06:08,wallstreetbets,Agree. It‚Äôs interesting because there are people who still aren‚Äôt familiar with Nvidia. I think that will change and they will be a household name in the next 5 years. Jensen is a genius and the company is extremely innovative

2021-06-19 19:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Fair statement and I agree, they have gone up a ton. My opinion is there is still room to run, specifically post split. A lot of investors will want to have exposure, who may have shared the same sentiments as you regarding share price. Never want to chase at high levels and it sounds like you are a patient investor , which is a virtue. I feel pretty good about where they are headed. Good luck on whatever direction you end up going"
2021-06-18 21:41:26,wallstreetbets,That Xylinx deal for AMD is good business. I can‚Äôt justify owning both of these semis but I definitely think AMD has a nice runway in front of it

2021-06-18 23:25:14,wallstreetbets,"I would nibble at it on down days. A share here and there when the option presents itself. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor but am a firm believer in what these guys are doing. Maybe try to build half your position pre split, if there are some  down day opportunities , and the other half post split. I would imagine that a lot of buyers will join the party after the share price has come down. 

A couple of others have mentioned AMD. Maybe take a look at that one as well. Good luck brotha"
2021-06-19 07:53:18,wallstreetbets,It has run a lot but there will be opportunities. Come back to us when the time is right for you
2021-06-19 14:44:58,wallstreetbets,That Xilinx merger is good business for AMD. Nvidia is best of breed but I definitely respect AMD and expect them to continue rising. I probably would own it too but I can‚Äôt justify owning another semi in addition to NVDA. Good luck with all your investments brotha
2021-06-18 23:42:58,wallstreetbets,Do you know much about how the sectors work in relation to price action? Like hasn‚Äôt tech been taking a beating but is poised to make a run up in the coming months or nah
2021-06-18 22:06:47,wallstreetbets,"Geez, we all could only hope! The issue I see is the data center 3x profitability is predicted out to 2025. Any data center investment/expansion in the near term will mean more cost to NVDA so expecting short term dips, but long term reward. But, then again, NVDA has big dick energy so maybe it continues to climb.

Edit: also, since you been holding since 2015 have to say congrats! And hope you bought more than 10 shares üòú"

2021-06-19 07:47:35,wallstreetbets,"Tech has taken a beating but a lot of that has come
back. Nasdaq is at 14k. A lot of people rotated out of tech for reopening trades but I think what‚Äôs happening is those same people are coming back in to tech.

2021-06-18 22:53:07,wallstreetbets,Thanks brotha. I appreciate it . I hear ya and agree there will be down days. I am of the opinion that any pull back is a gift and the company is too good to stay down. Here‚Äôs to 1000 pt !!
2021-06-18 22:44:42,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm optimistic on the arm deal closing. Jensen publicly stated about a month ago that  he is confident the deal will close. I trust the guy. Those against the deal are concerned Nvidia will become gatekeeper of ARM technology but Nvidia has repeatedly said it will maintain Arm's open licensing model.  Not only that, but their tech in ARM chips is a game changer . The regulatory process is going to take about 18 months so there will be good vibes and bad, but ultimately I think the deal gets done"
2021-06-19 07:43:58,wallstreetbets,Glad to hear you are investing. And looking at winners. I started early too. Time is on your side
2021-06-19 09:55:18,wallstreetbets,"I made some solid reopening picks months ago. But when they became the new narrative around February and March, I was incredibly skeptical. I looked at cruises...ATH; airlines...ATH; retail...ATH. 

Ahhh....no thanks. I stayed my own course, but I knew, I felt it, that at any day the narrative would switch to no more runway for reopening plays and everyone would look at the consolidating tech had been doing and buy back in. I actually believe I bought a value etf around that time too, and it has literally stayed within 5% of its purchase price after 3-4 months lol"
2021-06-18 22:56:07,wallstreetbets,"Haha, it truly is a juggernaut. Cheers!"
2021-06-19 11:09:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, agreed. The rotation out of tech turned out to be a great buying opportunity. Money managers eventually swooped in when they saw what was happening. Glad to have had some cash on hand to buy some high quality names , aside from NVDA, during the down time. Congrats on staying the course brotha. Sometimes it‚Äôs tough, but if you truly believe in a company and trust your DD the dark clouds will eventually clear. Good discussion and enjoy your weekend"
2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Avocad-No I'm thinking of buying some puts against CVGW.

Calavo growers is the largest grower and distributer of avocados in California.

Rational:

1. California is a horrible state for businesses due to high taxes.
2. California is entering a  bad drought and I think avocados need water
3. Inflation cost are starting to hit food and avocados are seen as a premium food item,.
4. People are migrating out of the state so demand will also decrease, or transportation cost will increase
5. I hate avocados, I don't know if they are a fruit or a vegetable and I don't care.

I haven't had any experience buying puts and was wondering if there is any helpful advice, or other peoples thoughts on hw hard the company will get hit.

2021-06-18 20:50:32,wallstreetbets,Wow brave man
2021-06-18 20:39:49,wallstreetbets,All stocks took a hit this week. Just gotta ride it out and ride it twice as hard when they go backs up
2021-06-19 09:44:58,wallstreetbets,"**Why I bought in:**

* \- 48.45% Short Interest with 100% utilization and super high costs to borrow according to ORTEX (6/19)
* 100/100 Squeeze Score from S3 (Ihor)
* $700,000,000 in cash, no debt
* No threat of stock dilutions or market offering
* Insider's can't sell stock unless stock is >$30 for 90 days
* Citadel owns 7x more AMC than CLOV, they take positions in stocks they short as a hedge or secret final weapon.
* Machine Learning AI Assistant for doctors and works with Medicare (growth market)
* Victim of hit piece from shorting hedge fund FUD Hindenburg (same people who slandered DKNG falsely in laughable reports), DOJ investigation from months ago hasn't gone anywhere
* Let's be real, high org ownership is actually kind of good for this squeeze, they're far more diamond handed than day traders or brand new apes.
* Last run up was from $10 to almost $30 - only 5% of shorts covered! For a 3x return we only had 5% cover. Imagine if we forced them all to cover. They've only seen a FRACTION of our POWER.

This is a fundamentally sound business using machine learning and AI to help docs make smart decisions with patient care. This both increases the quality of care and reduces cost of care, something our country desperately needs. Be a patriot, consider CLOV!

Remember, the stock market is a wealth transfer device for moving money from the impatient to the patient.

Not a financial advisor or any kind of advisor. Don't listen to me."
2021-06-18 21:01:06,wallstreetbets,"i bought in clov, is there evidence that its still shorted?"

2021-06-19 07:23:04,wallstreetbets,CLOV is NOT the wayü§£ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è U pathetic morons dont realize the only Plays are GME and AMC?? U are shills. U gotta be. Enjoy ur crappy CLOV.
2021-06-18 23:01:25,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs one stock that‚Äôs pretty famous that didn‚Äôt take a hit this week overall. I‚Äôm sure you know which one I‚Äôm referring toüòè
2021-06-19 04:06:04,wallstreetbets,"50% of the float is shorted but there is evidence that it‚Äôs more close to 95% of the float is shorted. Greenoaks capital it‚Äôs listed and there shares are being counted. However it has been uncovered that they hold Class B shares that have not been converted and are not available. There has been a big push to suppress CLOV from trending. FUD ran rampant this week as BoA coincidentally downgraded the stock.. and it should be noted that the have a decent short-interest position‚Ä¶ The institutions have been banking that the FED would raise rates thus causing a market cool down to promote a rotation out of growth in efforts to drive the sector down so they could buy back in at lower prices.. it didn‚Äôt happen and now a lot of shorts are stuck‚Ä¶ 

CLOV short interest is speculated to be above 90%.. but even at reported levels of +50% it‚Äôs still warrants a feeding frenzy.. I challenge everyone to take a little time and do your own DD.. 

Here is the Link to the 13G SEC filing that shows Greenoaks Capital Partners shares as class b:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001801170/000090266421001020/p21-0536sc13g.htm


Giving further validity to this, it is rumored that CLOV was left off the 2021 Russell 2000 rebalance list due to not having enough voting shares available among its current common stock float 

Nasdaq List 184 institutional holders:

156,065,359 total shares held 
96,331,338 shares held by Greenoaks capital 

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/institutional-holdings

If DD is correct that means only: 59,734,021 available float

Short interest on 5/28 was reported at 41,274,556

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/clov/short-interest

That equates to 69.09 % it is estimated that short interest has increased 5-10% over the first 2 weeks in June.. those numbers should be out Monday. 

I again challenged the gamblers to do their own DD and place your bets accordingly.

I am not a financial advisor I.. I‚Äôm just a geek with a computer‚Ä¶ i like to gamble so i place bets.."
2021-06-19 10:04:04,wallstreetbets,"Dude every CLOV post gets destroyed on this sub.. it‚Äôs crazy.. the same people bashing can do their own DD.. the people bashing never address the DD.. they reject the ideal of doing DD it‚Äôs like everyone bashing CLOV is a bag holder or locked into a trade (i won‚Äôt mention any particular stocks but let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves)‚Ä¶and they are scared of the free money going anywhere other than the 2 stocks that have already üöÄüöÄ‚Ä¶.. 

We are gamblers and we make strategic bets‚Ä¶ these levels are too high for many that missed that train for the previous squeezes‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not smart to risk piling in this late and smart gamblers would recognize and honor that choice‚Ä¶. However there is another that‚Äôs about to pull out the station and a lot of us are on that train no shade to anyone that wants to pass on On this ticket ‚Ä¶ we are all gamblers.. some of us are just placing a yolo on CLOV.. you don‚Äôt have to join.. but don‚Äôt shade the bet because your money is locked up somewhere else"
2021-06-19 05:26:07,wallstreetbets,Yes. Just follow @ihors3 on twitter. His latest post about $CLOV reports 46% of short interesr and 6% from last week. üçÄ üöÄ
2021-06-18 23:00:12,wallstreetbets,What price do you think CLOV could reach once the shorts cover? $50? Or over that?

2021-06-18 21:36:01,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha
2021-06-18 23:09:13,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the sentiment üôè. I‚Äôm really fine with it though.  

This stock appears so heavily shorted that websites are reporting that the institutional investors own more shares than are reported to be in the float.  That doesn‚Äôt even include individual investors like us who also likely hold millions upon millions of shares.  And still not including the eons of synthetic shares that probably exist.  I‚Äôm not the sharpest ape but I can count.  

These bozos are shorting $CLOV more and more almost every day from what I see.  This thing seems to be wound tighter than Willie Nelson‚Äôs headband.  In my humble opinion in a short time with a little volume these shorts are gonna get sandpapered faster than white on rice‚Ä¶. And we holding long will be rewarded nicely.  All the foregoing my opinion only and not financial advice.  Best wishes for all üöÄ"

2021-06-19 12:13:00,wallstreetbets,"I saw the same information online from different sources, thank you for summarizing very well. I just want to add to the FUD related to Grenoaks. Greenoaks is a wealth fund investor, basically they manage wealth funds from countries and pensions. Investors like this are for the long run and interested on either long term returns or dividends so their clients can pay their pensions. They bought CLOV went it went public with an average price of $11 (CLOV ranged in IPO went from $7 to $16).
IPO investors were offered Class B shares, which could be exchange to Class A shares at any time at no cost. The catch? Class B shares can‚Äôt be traded in the market but has 10x voting rights. That means is in the best interest of Greenoaks Capital to maintain control of the company more than loan their shares or trade with a small profit compared to their acquisition cost. 
These are the guys that endorsed executive compensation stock to trigger when the stock price is above $30 for 90 consecutive days. I will be worry of higher float only when I see that happening, as internally CLOV has set that as a target."
2021-06-19 10:10:58,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree, it's got the most easily apparent potential without stretching any logic."
2021-06-19 14:04:03,wallstreetbets,This. Why can't CLOV get any love on this subreddit. New calculations might have us at 99% of the float shorted. But CLNE and CLF can get copy pasted till the cows come home. Come on man.
2021-06-19 01:10:22,wallstreetbets,"My guess is above $70 mark that we saw with AMC, simply because AMC has 4x the float of CLOV. GME on the other hand has half of the float of CLOV. 
If you look at this with the perspective of share availability to short, then CLOV range should be between the squeezes that we saw in AMC and GME"

Just an ape fantasy, no financial advice here"
2021-06-19 15:01:19,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately for you, you don‚Äôt realize that AMC has not had its big squeeze yet, but I do believe CLOV is a good investment, it‚Äôs just missing the resolve in shareholders that AMC and GME have. But that could come with time"

Please explain that one to me, without using extreme US legislative speculation."
2021-06-19 05:41:11,wallstreetbets,Okay my analogy still holds if you swap McDonald‚Äôs for Starbucks.  Care to explain how Tilray is going to do anything other than get their lunch eaten by American firms once it‚Äôs federally legal?
2021-06-19 14:09:47,wallstreetbets,Aphria which is now Tilray only had 1 down quarter...Canada was locked down....Really I need to explain.
2021-06-19 15:25:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, i would love to.  Right now canadian companies have been getting footholds in a world wide market.  US companies have been thriving in their state bubbles without competition and no global footprint.  This is just facts, not meant to hurt your little baby feelers.

So when the US opens its borders, that will allow canadian companies to execute on mergers that give them instant ground in the US, but the US companies dont have any deals set up to gain ground in other markets other than their own states they operate in.  So in other words, competition will come in and take market share away from US companies, which currently dont have any global market income yet.  

Nobody in their right mind thinks canadian companies will ""dominate"" the US market.  Thats not their goal, they just need a small percentage of the market share.   Also, nobody worth their salt thinks that US legalization wont be beneficial to LP's.....  because it absolutely will.  

There will be big players from canada and US, its not going to be just one big company that wins everything and obtains a monopoly.  US legalization benefits LP's through access to US market.  It benefits MSO to uplist and grow into global market.  But unfortunately, MSO are 3 years behind in the global market, i think only trulieve and curaleaf (maybe cresco) will be able to catch up to LP's.

And current MSO revenue trends wont maintain.  When switching from cash to digital banking, you'll see a decline due to inability to launder money, as well as loss of market share to competitors. Current LP revenue trends wont last either.  

If you like an analogy, think of this as a race.  The car closest to the finish line is in first place, but has half a tank of gas (car is the company, gas is the money).  The other cars in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or even 20th have full tanks of gas still.... whos in first place?  The amount in the tank doesnt mean shit to your position in the market, it just means you got road to drive on.  LP's are farther ahead at the moment, but have less road to drive unless they can get access to a market like USA.  MSO have full tanks of gas, but have a lot of catching up to do, and some will succeed at that, and so will LP's."
2021-06-19 14:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you do, considering Tilray had quarter over quarter revenue losses, and Aphra just combined with a dumpster fire.

That with the combined market share erosion small grow operations are taking from LPs in Canada.

Time will show us who is right, because clearly the underlying isn't showing you anything"

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DKNG: Current Wall Street Views Aggregated (Median PT per Factset: $74.00) $DKNG is my top pick and the most bullish I've been on a stock in a while. I work at an investment bank, so we often look at consensus research views for sentiment and analysis on stonks. Thought I would gather some quotes for you all this morning from thousands of dollars worth of research reports...

Do with it what you will, but takeaway is üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I'm not cherry-picking. These are all the reports I have access to.

***Guggenheim***: ""We are maintaining our **BUY** rating and our **$76 price target**. Our target is based on our $80 DCF target using WACC of 8.3% and 4.0% LT growth rate and our $72 forward Price/Sales target using a 25.0x multiple (a \~10% premium to peers).""

***Morgan Stanley***: ""We remain **overweight** DKNG as an almost pure play on the attractive, high growth US sports betting and online gaming opportunity. We expect the market to grow from <$1bn revenue in 2018 to >$15bn in 2025, **resulting in DKNG's revenue growing from $306mm to $4bn**. In turn, we see DKNG's revenue significantly **outperforming consensus**, which will ultimately result in **higher profitability**. Since its IPO, DKNG has **materially outperformed our revenue and spending expectations**; this should drive a **larger TAM**, benefit DKNG's **market share**, and ultimately lead to greater profitability."" (**Price target of $58.00**)

***Argus***: ""We are maintaining our **BUY** rating on DKNG.  DraftKings is the **leader in daily fantasy sports**, with approximately **60% of the U.S. market by revenue**, according to industry sources. The online gaming industry is in the early stages of growth, with **only** ***4%*** **of gross gaming revenue in the U.S. generated online**, compared to ***45%*** **in more mature online gaming markets** such as the U.K. As more states loosen restrictions, we expect DraftKings to benefit from its market leadership. Investors  have  recognized  the company's potential, and the shares have outperformed since the company went public in April  2020."" (**Price target of $60.00**)

***Evercore***: ""All-in, **DKNG is simply executing at levels that are well ahead of what we would have anticipated**: states are **legalizing at a rapid pace**, the **ramp** in the most recently legalized states is accelerating quicker, and **legacy states like NJ are sustaining growth for much longer**. As such, both our **near and long term estimates move higher**...DKNG is not resting on its laurels either, this quarter the company announced two acquisitions: VSiN aimed at **supporting engagement and lowering CAC** and BlueRibbon to build **technical infrastructure for iGaming**. In addition, the company outlined plans to launch DraftKings Social, which we believe could **enhance / differentiate the user experience**, increase user **stickiness**, and potentially give rise to powerful **network effects**."" (**Price target: $75.00**)

***Jefferies***: ""Focus on **near-term market share is relevant but besides the main point** of our thesis, which is that **proliferation continues faster than originally expected and DKNG remains a top constituent**. Our take from the last quarter is that DKNG remains on track to grow as a **first mover** from multiple perspectives: technological integration, product breadth and ultimately revenue. We expect revenue guidance and shares to continue progression higher. Reiterate Buy"" (**Price target: $75.00**)

***Cowen***: ""We estimate that DKNG is able to grow net revenue at +24% CAGR from 2020 - 2030 to $5.4bn, and achieve its $1.7bn EBITDA target by 2030, in line with management targets outlined at their March 2021 Investor Day. DraftKings holds **key structural advantages vs. competitors** including its **differentiated daily fantasy sports** led **customer acquisition capability** and **agility to market** in legalized states. Our Outperform rating reflects our view that the 2half of 2021 to 2022 legalization path is robust, and our **confidence DKNG will sustain >25% US online sports betting market share at maturity**."" **(Price target: $70.00)**

The company was co-founded by ex-Faraday Future employee Stefan Krause, who stepped away as CEO in August for [personal reasons](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20807575/canoo-ceo-leave-temporary-stefan-krause-startup-ev-designs-car-subscription). Mr. Tony Aquila has since taken over as CEO. The primary goal of Canoo‚Äôs vehicles is autonomous operation.

**SHARE LOCK-UP EXPIRATION**

**On Monday (6/21), insiders will be able to sell 116.2mm shares** in the open market. This lock-up represents **117% of the company‚Äôs current float** (99mm share float). Given the significant issues the company faces (incl. the pending SEC investigation), it is **very likely insiders will head for the exits**.

Insiders such as **Chinese-based Pak Tam Li (79.5mm shares)** and **Remarkable Views (39.8mm shares)** will be able to sell their shares in the open market. The management team, including **CEO Tony Aquila (12.4mm)** will also be able to sell. **The 50-day average volume is 4.7mm shares (\~$48mm ADV at current prices), which will make it difficult for the share price to absorb significant insider selling**.

**PENDING SEC INVESTIGATION**

The company is **currently under a wide-ranging SEC investigation** related to, among other things, Canoo‚Äôs *‚Äúoperations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings‚Äù* and *‚Äúthe recent departures of certain of the Company‚Äôs officer‚Äù*

**SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT SELF-DEALING**

Canoo paid **$561,000 to a company controlled by CEO Aquila for the use of aircraft**, suggesting a lapse in corporate governance.

Further, despite receiving $561,000 in related party fees, **Mr. Aquila‚Äôs aircraft company received over $147,000 in federal government support (via forgivable PPP loans) last year**.

**POTENTIAL RUSSELL 3000 INDEX INCLUSION**

$GOEV could be added to the Russell 3000 next Friday (6/25). The list is preliminary and there is no guarantee it will be added, but could represent forced index buying. **Short sellers will likely cover next week ahead of Russell 3000 inclusion, so degenerates could look to buy the dip next week.**

**TLDR;**

**Insider selling on Monday (6/21) represents significant potential downside risk**. **Strongly recommend buying puts today (expiring on 6/25 @ $10 strike price) or waiting until next week to buy shares (ahead of Russell 3000 inclusion).**

**DISCLAIMER**

No position, but may initiate one today (puts) or next week (buy stock on dip ahead of index inclusion).

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC now has a catalyst to squeeze thanks to the fed Listen up retards,

You should all be thanking the Jim Bullard for his comments this morning around a rate hike in 2022. Let me attempt to access the one minor wrinkle I have in my otherwise glass smooth brain to explain:

Expected inflation is highly correlated with actual inflation. E.g. If you think cocaine is going to be more expensive tomorrow than today, you'll want to buy more today. If you think cocaine is going to be cheaper tomorrow than today, you'll wait to buy (not really because it's cocaine and you'll buy it no matter what.) This becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that impacts the actual price of the goods. It's why the fed honey dicks you with when they will actually raise rates. Now replace cocaine with mortgages and you'll see how this impacts UWMC. The threat of higher interest rates will get those thinking about a new home/refi to actually commit. This will cause the demand for mortgages to frontload (come sooner). Which is exactly the kind of change in a stocks momentum that can cause the shorts to get squeezed out.

I also have got my crayons out to show you that on the technical analysis, the stock has broken out of it's downtrend line (purple) and is winding up similar to other squeezes.

Started trading w/ around $58k (includes 2019 Uber money and previous life savings)  in April 2020, continued to Uber and save from my main job monthly as well. Grew my own earnings to approximately $74k trading it grew it to $110k (and I was awful, my first year trading). Went all in on AMC  Scraped the last $4K out of My account to exercise 5 $9 options. Emptied my daughters college savings to buy 70 more shares around $50 each 10570 shares. As for DFV I said he affected my mentality on trading GME was an example to me of what was possible. The going after him post was when I heard he was being sued I believe. I also don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing with posts or karma because I‚Äôm working 3 jobs and raising 3 little girls on my days off. Trading is my favorite new job. I‚Äôve invested $74k of actual job earnings and clicked buttons on my phone and computer over the last year for the rest. Position is still open so technically I could still lose, but I watch it like a mad man. Replying at 3am because I just got done ubering and I don‚Äôt like being called a liar. My house is almost paid off too. I‚Äôm 38 and sleepy now."
2021-06-19 12:07:14,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs no where else for it to go man. The play is dead. Everyone is gone. Wallstreetbets owns the stock - how is it going to go any higher?  Cash out and take your money man, or be a bag holder when the rest of the sub sells before you."

2021-06-19 09:11:28,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I understand the skepticism online especially here. Hard to get karma which is frustrating but I also don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing. Best of luck.
2021-06-18 20:12:44,wallstreetbets,Definitely interested - what made you focus on AMC instead of GME?
2021-06-18 20:41:02,wallstreetbets,"I looked at all my gains of 2020 in the market (around what I make at my main job in a year) as the price of market education. I decided I would risk all of it on the right yolo trade. I also learned from some of my own trades and DFV you have to truly be willing to lose to win big. Enter AMC, built the position heavier and heavier as I dug into its potential. All in about $114k. The key is you have to be willing to lose the gains. All of them. I don‚Äôt want my initial investment burned but if I‚Äôm wrong and I lose the gains it was an ‚Äúeducation‚Äù. The stress might kill you though, I think I‚Äôm tough and this stuff does something to you. My final though on the trade was this. If I‚Äôm wrong and lost the worst I can lose (approx 2/3) I‚Äôve lose my gains and the last 2 years of ubering and that would suck but what would I do? The same thing I always do, my life is the same. If I‚Äôm 1/2 right it fixes everything."
2021-06-18 20:21:39,wallstreetbets,"Can‚Äôt leverage something when it‚Äôs that high in price so I felt GME exponential gains possibilities had passed, now I‚Äôm not sure about GME but I‚Äôm fine where I am. Basically 10k shares vs 1k shares. I called AMC when it was $2 in December but I was afraid of everything, started trading April 2020 and man what a ride. I made horrible mistakes and held losers for 5 months until they came back from 60% down. Sold winners too quick. Just about everything a new guy does.... but. Every trade was a lesson. I asked myself every trade, what was the lesson? So here‚Äôs my theory....it‚Äôs risky.... and a quick version of my story and risk tolerance."
2021-06-18 20:28:58,wallstreetbets,"I worked nights ubering for a year and a half and did not spend any of my earnings. I‚Äôm a warehouse MGR by day. Started investing in April 2020 original plan was airlines and cruise line recover play. Enter WSB, sort of anyway. Started putting more and more in. The short short version is a lot of stress later and by January of this year I was 48% up on most of my money. The whole time in the background I was studying yolo winners. I feel ‚Äúusually‚Äù 2/3 is max loss on stocks, then most stocks sit there. So you most likely will not ‚Äúlose everything‚Äù....."
2021-06-18 20:54:35,wallstreetbets,Huge balls bro - very happy for you. Where do you see AMC going from its current position - do you have any plans to take profits soon?
2021-06-19 15:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Broooo yes, I feel it, i yolo‚Äôd all the money I had at AMC which was only 5k, and that was the most I‚Äôve ever had at the time. I figured if I lost it all, my life would just be the same, but if I was right my life would change. A month later and that 5k is now 6 figures. Those 40s were monsters and I threw about 2k at those. definitely get into options trading more, being leveraged to the tits is nice"
2021-06-18 21:00:05,wallstreetbets,"There is a large part of me that is ethics based on this as well. The whole taking away the buy button thing. As for the trade itself after they cover, or the game changes, no targets. I‚Äôll feel it day by day. Figure I could ride it down to $22 and I doubled all my money worst case now. I‚Äôd be ok with that. I‚Äôd feel better doing that than selling here, at least then I could say I tried not just for me but for everyone."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Big Lots (BIG): The story of an underdog with strong financials Searching for companies that have a low price/earnings ratio is the fundamental principle behind value investing. It is in that regard that I bring to you Big Lots (BIG).

Here we have a company that cares about its share holders and delivers year after year. Its financial record is strong as can be seen:

&#x200B;

[note increase in revenue & net income, decrease in shares outstanding every year](https://preview.redd.it/j11gf8otq1671.jpg?width=1553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=268d11048e09a2d8ac572f8cdd25bf2abf4c1e59)

&#x200B;

[cash on hand increased, 2020 was the company's best year](https://preview.redd.it/mut21up0r1671.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5939f22b8158279987737c5f5818e27b59807e9)

Net income has increased every year and its financial position became even stronger in 2020. The company has been profitable every year since 2006.

Now you would think that a company like Big Lots would see some of its revenue eaten up by the likes of Amazon and other online retailers but this is not the case. This is because big lots offers an alternative shopping experience that other companies without retail shopping centers cannot provide, BOPIS or buy online pick up in store. Unsurprisingly, many people don‚Äôt want to wait for shipping and would rather pick up their item(s) in store.

Now that does not mean that big lots is not aware of the changing dynamic within the customer shopping experience. In 2019 they launched Operation North Star.

This has three major objectives:

1. Drive profitable long-term growth

a. grow e-commerce sales.

b. grow store count.

c. strengthen their home offerings.

2) Fund the journey

a. expanding gross margin rate

b. increasing organizational efficiency

3) Create long-term shareholder value

a. the first two objectives will increase earnings growth

b. the 2020 share repurchase program which in the fourth quarter of 2020 consisted of buying back 1.6 million of their 39 million outstanding shares.

When looking into the financials of Big Lots there is a trend that dates back to 2005. Back in 2005 they had 115 million shares outstanding and as of 2021 they currently only have 39 million shares outstanding. I found this to be of particular interest when considering shareholder value, typically as time goes on the shares outstanding of a company tend to increase but in the case of Big Lots the company has a consistent record of buying back their own shares. This reflects in their earnings per share as it was $0.21 in 2005 and now is a whopping $16.11. Everything in the financial records of the company indicates that Big Lots is undervalued.

Lets compare big lots to target to see if the market has priced it accurately:

|**Year 2020**|**Big Lots**|**Target**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Number of stores|1404|1909|
|Market Capitalization|$2.38 Billion|$115.2 Billion|
|Net Income|$629 Million|$4.368 Billion|
|Price/Earnings Ratio|3.99|19.02|

&#x200B;

As can be seen the market does not realize the true value of big lots. This is a company that has a proven track record of increased revenue, gross profit and earnings per share year after year.

Big Lots also offers customers incentives to continue shopping at their company through the BIG rewards program. This program provides coupons and incentives for customers and encourages new membership. Through the beginning of 2021 the BIG rewards program had nearly 21 million active members. The value presented in this base of membership cannot be overstated; incentivizing customers to keep coming back by providing discounts for further purchases all but ensures that they will be retaining their core customers.

TLDR: Big Lots (BIG) is an underappreciated company with an impressive balance sheet. Its current shopping experience is only rivaled by companies that are valued at hundreds of billions of dollars while Big Lots‚Äô entire market cap is $2.5 billion.

*Not financial advice, please do your own research.*

edit: current position 1x $72.5c exp 7/16. & 10 shares

EDIT #2: Looking through the financials it appears that a large portion of their net income came from the sale of four distribution centers in 2020. In 2020 revenue increased 16% while their net income increased 260%. This also explains the significant increase in cash on hand."
2021-06-18 22:20:36,wallstreetbets,I went into one once and it smelled bad.  I can‚Äôt shop in a stinky store.

2021-06-19 16:30:18,wallstreetbets,I just checked out the website for $BIG.  Room for improvement for sure.
2021-06-19 11:27:50,wallstreetbets,BIG indeed
2021-06-19 12:40:56,wallstreetbets,"they own 50 of their stores and lease out the rest. the typical lease terms are for approximately ten years with multiple five-year renewal options. the foreclosure/eviction moratorium does not apply to them as it in not listed in their risk factors. also, 2020 was their best year by all metrics, allowing them to significantly increase their cash on hand."
2021-06-19 00:07:10,wallstreetbets,"Could be worse. AMC near me closed down months ago. Then all these DDs popped up. Glad people made money, but damn if it‚Äôs not scary having the only threaten in your area turn into a hardware store."
2021-06-19 00:10:06,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd argue that their furniture is junk. You‚Äôre better off going to a local discounted type store and picking up something there. Even ollies gets some good brands every now and then. 

There‚Äôs a place near me that deals in bulk, local place on 380 (hence the name 380 auction) that gets all sorts of name brand furniture and sells it at fractions of the cost of Levins. My couch and love seat combo was $900, a simple couch at any of those places is upwards of $1k; I‚Äôve had it around 7 years now and it still looks and functions great. Ashley brand."

So imagine all the boomers in call centers/bank tellers/etc. Building at home offices and then mixing their at home computer habits with their VPN to their workplace.   


TLDR; marketing from the vendor and interest of the company to protect internal networks (and employees) are primary drivers. Insurance wont care too much about ransomware attacks imo (idk if you could make a claim for those)."

2021-06-19 09:15:59,wallstreetbets,The percentage is quite misleading. The vaccine was tested on every strain of the virus and the percentage counts for all strains. There is no guarantee that biontec or moderna have a higher chance against the mutants cause their percentage is for the original strain. But correct me if im wrong. The media is just blowing it out of proportion again. No position btw.
2021-06-19 13:03:16,wallstreetbets,"BioNTech is also German so they still have in theory a claim to success over the pandemic. They received more government funding than curevac also. I don‚Äôt think Germany would want a China vaccine situation under their hands. In which countries that used that vaccine are being hit heavy again with the virus. It may ruin the credibility of the German medical field. 

Germany may however have a point to prove as this is a historic event and they may not want to tarnish their image.

Many European countries however prepared for such a situation by preordering many doses from many different sources as to minimise risk to their vaccination program efficiency. So this will not really affect them.

As for 3rd world countries novavax‚Äôs efficacy percentage has been found to be higher and would have had the same benefits as CureVac‚Äôs vaccine."
2021-06-19 10:44:48,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs true but they only hit 50% or something of later variants, but that would correspond to something like 70% efficacy which is still much lower. Moderna and Pfizer do a lot better vs the variants."
2021-06-19 10:59:02,wallstreetbets,"Are there already numbers for bio and moderna for the newer mutants? Didn‚Äòt read any, just read there are signs they‚Äòre working against them too. Thx."
2021-06-19 12:44:42,wallstreetbets,There are real world studies. The tldr is cvac 2 dose looks like what a single dose of the other mRNA vaccines looks like. And yes Moderna and Pfizer have boosters that are more or less good to go but need a bit more testing. Those boosters are optimized vs the SA strain. They don‚Äôt have delta but it should hit delta pretty well.

2021-06-19 12:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Nah, WSB is totally lost. 

I get that 480% is a great return for a stock, but it isn't all that exciting for WSB.  People make returns like that with options every day. 

Up until last year, anyone talking about buying stocks was called a boomer and told to go to /r/investing. That was like the main joke on WSB, because this was an options sub. If you had told me WSB would just become an /r/investing clone (with less educated traders) overnight, I wouldn't have believed you. 

But here we are. One big GME news story blasted across social media, and WSB became an /r/investing clone (with less educated traders) overnight

WSB is lost because it's no longer an options sub, and there is no good replacement for what what WSB was from 2012 to 2020. That really sucks ass for people like me, who are options traders and have been here since 2013. WSB also legitimately used to find interesting stocks and post good DD from time to time, now it's just bots talking about the next shOrT sQuEeZe. 

I really don't see a huge benefit in seeing the same 5 meme stocks being spammed into oblivion for 8 months straight. That doesn't help anyone or provide any new information. This is no longer a trading sub in any real way, and is now just a confirmation bias ""cheer squad"" sub. 

Rip WSB. Now go ahead and downvote me apes like igaf look at my profile I'm karma rich booooooi"

2021-06-19 14:50:12,wallstreetbets,Great observation. You can thank DFV for bringing the attention this way. Glad you got do much from it all those years. I'm in learning mode so I appreciate the background.
2021-06-19 19:03:14,wallstreetbets,The sub has been obliterated by idiots who post rockets. Anyone who posts a rocket should be banned. You aren‚Äôt a real trader. You are a meme trader and we are laughing at you.
2021-06-19 11:30:06,wallstreetbets,Lmao how much kool aid u drink?
2021-06-19 10:54:49,wallstreetbets,That point gets lost a lot of times.

2021-06-19 12:27:44,wallstreetbets,It sure does
2021-06-18 20:02:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a dumb hedge fund that wants to see AMC destroyed, and my price target is $20.  I am not going to be a pig and try to ride it to $0, nor do I want AMC to die, as I am a customer and I like them, it's just the current price is totally irrational.  I am greedy, and I embrace the greed."
2021-06-19 17:24:54,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I know.  And for some reason you think a nearly-bankrupt chain, that you saved from the brink, isn't going to take what opportunities it can to issue more shares and dilute your position?  Don't get me wrong, I love that y'all saved AMC, I love that you helped them raise capital.  But come on.  This isn't a company that is in a position to do more than survive off of meme sentiment.  Which, again, is great, you saved them from COVID and I am genuinely happy about that.  But really, lol."

2021-06-19 12:04:49,wallstreetbets,Not enough.  500k floor.
2021-06-19 11:15:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah I initially beat myself up when I sold at 31 because it rocketed the next day but I can't be too mad at 300%+ gains
2021-06-19 11:31:59,wallstreetbets,Start selling on the way down
2021-06-18 20:05:00,wallstreetbets,You can justify it in your mind all you'd like. You're still the same as them in my eyes.
2021-06-19 02:38:48,wallstreetbets,"I really don't believe you held in Jan, maybe you sold it for super cheap because you didn't believe another squeeze would come. Who cares point is you're spreading fud because it suits you."
2021-06-19 02:37:37,wallstreetbets,Brother every stock follows TA it's human psychology on a chart. Who tf you kidding? Who said anything about a long term hold? Not me. I attacked your short term bear thesis which I believe to be nonsense. It sounds more like you're pissed you didn't get in when you could have pre 10.
2021-06-19 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,"AA won‚Äôt get the vote for 25 million. The vote is already NO. He should have asked for 5 million. The Army already said NO. It‚Äôs time for a nice push, maybe a final push but it‚Äôs going to happen. 

Good luck. I didn‚Äôt downvote but everyone did because you need to leave the  Army in peace. Go your own course but no need to irritate the Ape army. We are just trying to carve a niche."

2021-06-18 20:26:56,wallstreetbets,And 6 to 220+ is not relevant? I‚Äôm glad the bois are making cash but citadel probably was the big winner on amc
2021-06-18 20:03:21,wallstreetbets,"How does the company turn a profit? Someone please explain to me. Squeezing a company up to a crazy valuation is obviously a thing, and I‚Äôm not claiming GMEs fundamentals justify its price but it actually has a lot of great runway ahead of it. I just don‚Äôt see it with amc. I did just buy 100 shares today that I‚Äôll be repeatedly selling covered calls to the AMC hopeful though. Will happily ride 1k a week on 6k investment till reality comes calling."
2021-06-19 10:47:49,wallstreetbets,Anybody who sold before AMC reached it‚Äôs pre-pandemic price shouldn‚Äôt have been in the game to begin with
2021-06-19 11:41:08,wallstreetbets,I bought 150 shares at $3 and sold at $14/$15
2021-06-18 20:09:40,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino, and we're all gambling.  It's silly to hate the guy who put his chips on Black because you're a Red kinda guy instead.  I hope you prosper.  I am just laying out my thoughts."
2021-06-19 17:15:35,wallstreetbets,"Shorting now when it's going to fall to $10 is equally as good as getting in at $10 and selling today.  If you people somehow push it to $150 or something, I'll short even more."
2021-06-19 17:18:17,wallstreetbets,They won't.  I am not YOLOing.  I am keeping a healthy buffer against getting margin called.  I know you monkeys can push it to $150-$200 for a few nanoseconds.  But it's a pipe dream to think it's going to stay over $20 forever.
2021-06-19 06:34:48,wallstreetbets,Shiƒ∫lllllllll
2021-06-18 23:53:01,wallstreetbets,I didn't say that. But youre talking like AMC hasn't gone up 800% in the last 6 months lol
2021-06-18 20:53:27,wallstreetbets,Was??
2021-06-18 20:08:23,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a fundamental thing and we've been saying that from the beginning. 

Fundamentals are not the only thing that drives a stock."
2021-06-18 21:28:48,wallstreetbets,K is*
2021-06-18 20:23:16,wallstreetbets,Upvoted you for a sensible reply but I haven‚Äôt really changed my idea that GME is the play. If everyone piled into one or the other we‚Äôd be in another dimension. Loving selling covered calls on both regardless üìà
2021-06-19 10:46:42,wallstreetbets,GME was already too expensive for most people to ‚Äòpile on‚Äô. Bc it already worked with GME. Lol
2021-06-19 04:02:38,wallstreetbets,Honestly I don‚Äôt get why you guys bet all those money on options. Buy actual shares for Christ sake
2021-06-18 20:38:44,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm pretty sure that if every single person in this sub buy a single share tomorrow, could get to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-06-18 21:31:21,wallstreetbets,Was about to say those shares don‚Äôt look that .....aww fuck you went and gone full retarded.
2021-06-19 11:02:19,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre here wining and complaining about how BB didn‚Äôt make you money within a week, maybe the stock isn‚Äôt  for you. AMC went through the same shit, ups, downs, so like an idiot I sold early, happy that I got out, saw prices dropped, kept telling people how smart I was‚Ä¶until one day‚Ä¶$$$$. And the rest is history. So people, if you have at least one ball working properly, hold on to it and enjoy the ride. If the stock drops, be happy and buy more if you can at a bargain price. I say and believe BB will go up it‚Äôs just a matter of time."
2021-06-18 23:39:59,wallstreetbets,1800$ in shares and 22k in options. Lmao.
2021-06-19 03:16:49,wallstreetbets,You've convinced me to buy more
2021-06-19 03:23:50,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget me guys, I got it at $19, so when you guys get tendies, make sure to pick me up!"
2021-06-19 03:50:01,wallstreetbets,"You shoulda unplugged your phone. You're wasting battery, and judging by what I see, you won't be able to afford a new one."
2021-06-19 04:29:52,wallstreetbets,The shorts had a green day Friday. I can almost assure you that they'll be buying those stocks back Monday morning. If they don't I will. I predict a good profit Monday morning. I only have 250 BB shares but by the end of Monday. I am going to have at least 1k if not more üòé
2021-06-19 10:42:08,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôre a ¬´¬†value investor¬†¬ª hold that puppy - seriously BB are well positioned to bounce back with their offerings. It seems like a joke because their phone business cratered but they are in a good spot to offer return in the future if you hold the stock.
2021-06-19 17:27:47,wallstreetbets,Buy more to average down
2021-06-19 19:40:18,wallstreetbets,"Let come back BB, last week I lost some on call options, buy more options with new expired date, strike price 15."
2021-06-19 02:44:29,wallstreetbets,"BB is not an option stock despite its low share price. BB is a buy and hold for 10 years. You‚Äôll be Ritch!!  Like seriously, they are an autonomous vehicle cyber security business. We‚Äôve got a few years before they (self driving cars) are on the streets, but everyone will rely on autonomous vehicles in 10-15 years. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm buying up 100s of shares at a time. I don‚Äôt know who will run the autonomous vehicle revolution but I know who will provide the cyber security under the scenes. That‚Äôs BB Babayyyy!! 

Anything under $25 is a steal!!"

2021-06-18 21:36:33,wallstreetbets,Buying bb was your first mistake
2021-06-18 21:36:58,wallstreetbets,i think the lesson of the last 6 months is the stock prices are so manipulated that buying options is a casino with horrible odds and no oversight.  after someone posted the max pain theory then watching how many weeks millions and millions of dollars of options expire worthless as the price gets driven down on a friday to cause the most loss.  when you can watch the feed and see small wash sales just crashing the share price.  it‚Äôs a fake market and the only way i see to win is to buy and hold.
2021-06-18 21:42:06,wallstreetbets,Why call? Just share! Not fa
2021-06-18 21:43:34,wallstreetbets,I managed to buy BB at $19 last week. I dont know how

Citadel owns nearly million BB shares they needed money because of sudden rise of AMC so they pumped BB by using their shills and bots on this sub to talk about and promote BB. You fell for it and it sucks for you. Notice how GME posts get constantly banned? That should tell you something.

It's about to moon the bots and shills said

With no mention of the stock until hours after it grows 200% in a day

The peak is coming the bots and shills said

So you buy BB not realising they're bots and shills

Immediately you're holding the biggest bag of them all

2021-06-19 01:11:41,wallstreetbets,I mean it will moon. One thing I can't tell is when your contacts expire or if they already did. But what the fuck..you are using RH so who knows when Vlad will take your money.

2021-06-19 01:14:52,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure this has been covered, but... $22k on options, but you only bought $1700 in shares? That shit is backwards. You fucks never cease to amaze me with your stupidity.

Options require LESS capital for profit. They also carry a greater risk of loss of your entire investment. Shares require MORE capital for profit. However, if the company is sound, you're highly unlikely to see your investment go to zero, and certainly not as fast as an options trade."
2021-06-19 01:15:40,wallstreetbets,"Oh damn... welp, my main focus is AMC but I‚Äôve been having my eyes on BB for a while now. Maybe I‚Äôll buy it soon to take advantage of the dip ‚úåüèª"

>I'm not stupid enough to believe that tracking social media hype and understanding ""investor narratives"" is some kind of permanent new paradigm to replace fundamentals. Nothing will change the fact that long-term returns ALWAYS correlate eventually to underlying return on equity of companies.  Companies with efficient deployment of incremental capital will always outperform.

>But it really does feel like the boomers that completely ignore this factor, and reflexivity / feedback loops will get left behind.

If you don't understand the role of investor sentiment and psychology, then you literally have zero chance in the current market.

When I say ""you"" not you specifically but in general.  Will fundamentals matter again?  Of course.  It's like gravity and inevitable.  But with the printing press on, this is where we are at for likely at least 6 months or more."

2021-06-19 01:28:03,wallstreetbets,"The $88 value I have there is what I have left after the -$22,217 

if you add 22,217 + 88 it = $22,305
which was my total cost for the 30 calls (contracts)
$22,305 divided by 30 calls = $743.50 (which is roughly what I paid per call option contact)

When you buy calls most important thing is the break even price & the date of expiration, for example, my break even price for this was $22.50, meaning if the stock price was there I would be able to sell my calls and break even, now if the stock price would of went above that I would be making a shit ton of money since each contract represents 100 shares and I had 30 (3000 shares worth)

but the same happens the other way around if the stock goes down since this is a call and not a put

that being said, I‚Äôm not sure what happens if you wait till expiration, I‚Äôm not someone that does calls often, whenever I do I always sell either the day before expiration or early in the day of expiration, since it has happened to me before that you try to sell some calls like I tried to do with these late in the day and since there is no buyers for it you just end up losing everything cause it expires with out any worth. Hope this helps, since you‚Äôre pretty new to this, learn from my mistakes and don‚Äôt put anything over $500 into calls. Hope this helps."

2021-06-19 10:24:18,wallstreetbets,"I feel like this is the play.  I was reading up on BB, and they basically transitioned from phones to QNX (think unix/linux).  I know of QNX from my days working for a company that built digital EEG machines.  Basically monitoring brainwaves for seizures that we synchronized with digital video so you could actually see the seizure happening.  We used QNX because it is a real-time operating system...meaning, it places emphasis on being able to collect data from the inputs, and not have any lags/drops that would miss data.

This makes QNX a good choice as an embedded system for something like an automobile (overkill)...but ideal for something like a self-driving car with the amount of data it has to analyze real-time.

It is a gamble, as I would not be surprised if most large car manufacturers went with developing things in-house.  But for startup EV manufacturers...outsourcing to BB/QNX seems like a cost-savings.

But auto industry is only one industry that needs real-time, I would think manufacturing would too, along with anything medical-related like EEG machines."

2021-06-19 11:47:40,wallstreetbets,"Are we going to split hairs?  Know vs predict?

You CAN predict with reasonable certainty how the price is going to react to news.  If a drug maker announces they have passed phase 2 testing with almost 100% positive results (for example CTXR), with phase 3 testing and FDA approval still needing to be done, you CAN ""know"" the price is going up on that stock...at least until phase 3 test results are published.

Now if you are talking whether the stock price will remain at that price forever based on that news because it is somehow ""priced in"" now...well, that is placing too much importance on current price into the value of the company long term, or the fundamentals of the company in general.  And it is placing too much importance on the strategy of holding a stock for a long time.  Does it work?  Sure.  But shouldn't you amend your statement of ""don't trade news, invest in an index fund/ETF instead""?  But those have risk too...so bonds?  There is a certain percentage of risk in everything you choose, so to categorically say ""don't trade the news"" is categorically wrong."

2021-06-19 01:39:02,wallstreetbets,"those calls could get pretty expensive by the time you are considering buying them back.  It isn't as simple as ""Oh just buy them back!""

You might buy back your calls just in time for the price to peak out and plummet, completely screwing yourself over.

There is no easy, guaranteed win here.  

Selling covered calls makes sense when you think that a stock's price isn't going to move very much.

If a stock plummets, then you lose way more money due to the depreciation of the underlying asset than you gain from selling the worthless contract.

If a stock skyrockets, you would be better off not selling the contracts and just selling the stock outright.

If a stock stays relatively horizontal, the covered call is a good choice, because it gives you bonus gains on a stock that otherwise isn't doing anything.

Meme stocks are hardly stocks that I expect to stay relatively horizontal.  They tend to be incredibly volatile, making them poor candidates for selling covered calls.  It is a big reason why calls of these highly volatile stocks can get so expensive: The issuer of these contracts takes on quite a bit of risk when selling a call for a volatile stock."

2021-06-18 22:25:58,wallstreetbets,"My thinking is that I have cash on the sideline in case if BB does dip a significant amount to buy more shares to further lower my cost basis. BB for me is a long term play anyways, so even if I don't find a buyer for my calls or volatility becomes stale where the premiums aren't worth writing CCs, I can still sit on my decent number of shares with a much lower cost basis now.

I've only been selling CCs for a little over a month, so I'm by no means an expert, but my CCs are max 3-4 weeks out and if I made 70% back on the premium then I Buy To Close and roll it over to a new CC. My hope is lower the cost basis enough times to run parallel with any price drops, so i can set my strike prices relatively close, but still have it greater/equal to my cost basis."
2021-06-18 20:12:26,wallstreetbets,Literally ‚Äúroll.‚Äù On your app or website for your broker there should be an option to ‚Äúroll‚Äù which basically is a 2 legged trade where you buy back your current CC and immediately sell another CC at a different strike for the same or different date. It reduces your profit from the next CC in exchange for no risk (right now) of assignment.
2021-06-19 12:14:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if one is that risk averse, then they should not be trading in the stock market at all.  So how much risk is too much risk?  I won't do options right now, because I know jack-shit about options.  So my risk acceptance is lower than someone else's, and they say ""calls and puts only"".

It is all varying degrees of acceptance of risk, and therefore blanket statements about risk just don't apply to everyone."

We need to manufacture our own products again, and provide jobs for our country, and yours, so that there will be more money in the local economy, so we can afford to buy higher priced goods again.

BB‚Äôs annual revenue has been shrinking for almost a decade and they‚Äôre shrinking again this year. They managed to shrink during a time where all tech skyrocketed. They‚Äôve been failing spectacularly on the main stage for years. 

Even if what you‚Äôre saying is true and they‚Äôve established this great position in the market now, history will repeat and they will get bullied and knocked off of the pedestal again and again until they shrink into oblivion.

The Hyundai deal was a deal for part of QNX, in the *future*. It's a deal with the R&D arm, Hyundai Autron, which has multiple partners they work on their AV stuff with, like Kia. That specific deal is another future looking one for Hyundai's attempt at autonomous cars.

**BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY:** Just a couple weeks before that announcement was a bigger one by **Ford** that said they're **dropping Blackberry in favour of a Google solution for infotainment.**

Did you even read the article I linked? No. Clearly not. It‚Äôs literally there, but you‚Äôre not actually listening. Yeah they‚Äôre still using QNX for a different feature, but not for Infotainment anymore, which is still a cancelation of another deal. There are always multiple deals for different things and this was still a dropping of one of them. It ends up affecting the potential Net revenue negatively.

By the way, I actually gave up on you having any sense of logic long ago. I‚Äôve been posting in attempt to show other people that going off the deep end like this is illogical and dumb.

BB does have a growing future again, but trying to shoehorn it in with the other meme shit is ridiculous. It is a good long term play, but there is no baseless rocket. There is no squeeze. It will grow as it is meant to. There will still be small tertiary ties to GME, AMC, etc. runs because of WSB, and I‚Äôve made money playing BB off of those, and will continue to do so, but I‚Äôm still realistic.

I am 100% sure you had no idea what BB even was 4 months ago. BB was recruiting me and my friends in the early 2000s.

And with that little time in the contract that deep in the money the market maker that has to deliver is nearly 100% certain to have the shares set aside to cover - wether the MM holds the contract or someone else does.  The shares to deliver are already bought at this point so the MM stays delta neutral.  The MM will just charge the broker who charges the seller of the call.  They won‚Äôt go buy them late on a Friday for an options contract that had over a 90% chance to hit for days and start buying shares."

Nebraskan meat pack worker here. Yeah that stuff is terrible, Though I think cow belches (not the farts) make more methane. I'm not sure if going biogas works as I know biodiesel isn't as good as fossil fuels, aka both suck. Then again, electric doesn't work for heavy loads or long distances and we need to do something"

2021-06-18 21:32:10,wallstreetbets,"i‚Ä¶dont‚Ä¶comprehend what you‚Äôre saying or trying to say. your thought process isnt linear so im not able to follow. but i will try my best to answer.

i think you‚Äôre missing the main point versus the meme-able nature of this company. its not all about cow farts, its not all about amazon, its about the conversion of methane gas into useable energy. this has been done. they are currently providing RNG. they‚Äôre a plug and play into existing pipelines for other fuel. methane gas is created from many different sources: cow farts and manure, landfills, dairy farms, byproduct of oil and gas production, etc. cow farts is just the most funny and meme-able one with emojis.

population is only growing. food growth is only growing. u want more of those ribeye steaks and filet mignon? well its just adding more methane gas into the atmosphere. and what does that cause? global warming. how? methane gas traps heat. a lot of heat. oceans will warm, glaciers will melt. and then we‚Äôll be a planet of either drowning in water or dried to a crisp with all the trapped heat. its linear logic based on science. 

‚¨ÜÔ∏èpopulation = ‚¨ÜÔ∏ècows for meat and dairy = ‚¨ÜÔ∏èmethane gas = ‚¨ÜÔ∏èraw materials = ‚¨ÜÔ∏èenergy

if you continue this equation in üîÅ format, the solution = ‚ôæ energy

2021-06-19 06:59:07,wallstreetbets,"Well we talk about a rate hike but never the rate itself. To get over 1% we would need more than 3 hikes... I personally dont think we are going above 1%. So what would you recommend? Keeping cash which looses around 4% net? Most of the inflation is just caused by state handouts which keeps the workforce at home and supply chain disruptions. Mid term boomers gonna get older and die which should cause lower consumption and demand. People talking for more than a decade about inflation, crashes etc... They will come but before we completely crash the Fed will lower the rates again...In addition we completely forget about the digitalisation of the world which should drive company profits and lower workforce expenses and so prices. I gonna stay invested cuz I don't see much alternatives. Houses and gettin in debt for decades? Keeping cash and loosing? Buying hedges and paying high premiums to time the market? Maybe precious metals and stocks are the only real alternative."

Ive yet to see any item anyones bought thats worth a fuck or costs any less than Amazon. Wish has no chance of competition where thats concerned. Im just confused on where these new ""to the moon"" stocks came from. I still swear it was a decisive play by the hedge moguls to stop the inflation of the OGs, breaking the bank of potential new rally participants, discouraging people from trusting the pack... 
I've seen nothing but red on all these meme stocks recently, and this didn't start till all these new stocks popped up, after AMC started climbing like GME did. They panicked, set up a play, and as expected, everyone focused everywhere there was fresh ""potential"".

I mean, I guess you might not call it ""consolidation"" since they still have about the same raw amount (in constant dollars), but the top 20% sure have a lot *more* raw amount now.

2021-06-18 20:22:16,wallstreetbets,"If I filter that chart by removing one group at a time, from richest to poorest, I can see that all other groups were also experiencing similar gains until 2008. Most middle class people lost significant portions of their savings in that crash, primarily because they don't take active roles in their investing. My mother is a primary example: she worked for Walmart for 35 years. She took whatever investments they set up for her automatically, despite my pleas for her to actively manage her retirement accounts.

Her $250,000 401(k) turned into $175,000 in a week in 2008. It's still not fully recovered. The funds running those accounts should be ashamed of themselves for such poor management, but in the end the responsibility lies squarely with her for never doing anything except the default.

So, the chart shows that everyone was getting richer, then 2008 happened, and most people haven't recovered yet while rich people have. I don't think that's enough data to speak to long term trends of wealth consolidation."

And I'm not even bashing that. In fact, a Workhorse squeeze is more likely than literally any of the others. There should definitely be hype around that. 60% of the float is shorted. 115 million float. Read my post. They Should definitely be positive.

You can make these long ass comments all you want, my point still stands. We can read a lot of the comments here and see an obviously faked back and forth conversation.

2021-06-18 22:37:44,wallstreetbets,"If you keep EVs plugged in when you turn them on and warm them up for a couple minutes they get close to the sticker mileage. It‚Äôs not the driving in cold that impacts range as much as heating them up from cold. Since the usps trucks tend to keep running for most of the Route it‚Äôs a low impact easy workaround for a common ev issue. Regarding production, they had bottleneck due to old battery supplier and they‚Äôve been ramping production after bringing on Tesla‚Äôs battery supplier. Lordstown has also said they have half of their plant ready and able to support usps production if needed."

2021-06-18 22:47:29,wallstreetbets,"Lordstown can't even get their vehicle to scale production, how the hell are they going to magically be able to build more in that plant when they don't have enough to turn out their own vehicle at scale."
2021-06-18 22:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Heat and air conditioning running can sap upto 35% of the range of an EV.  Also the workhorse EV trucks do not get over 100 miles per charge.  They are rated for 100 under ideal conditions, unloaded, no climate control.  A rather unrealistic scenario for postal workers that are out in all conditions."
2021-06-18 22:52:46,wallstreetbets,"Again, average Rural Route is less than 50 miles. So even if the wkhs truck gives up 35% of its range, which is a premise I don‚Äôt subscribe to without some corroboration, it still meets the needs of even most of the longer routes. If we consider that congress is asking for 75% EVs for their money, then we can say that the wkhs trucks are mostly needed only for urban and suburban routes for which they have plenty of juice."

Power walls are fuckin expensive.  5k+ each installed, lets multiply that by 100k vehicles. That's not in the budge, and solar charging isn't practical for the vast majority of the nation.  Especially urban centers and northern climates."
2021-06-19 13:38:02,wallstreetbets,"Actually I majored in Electrical Engineering at Chico State.  I have not seen a walking Post person in years, and I doubled the miles driven average just to be safe.  And I said "" Ideally"" with solar and power walls, they are costly but they will pay for themselves over time.  a transformer with a generator back up would be more  reasonable.  Short term it makes no sense, but long term adding another $8k to a vehicle costing $50k+ to make it self sustaining is not unreasonable, and that is the goal of the ""Green New Deal"" Congress."

Thats the risk part and given these stocks barely move compared to other plays ive made which lets act like the last week didnt happen but commodity miners and producers are much more bullish.  Pretty much the same risk though given I took almost a 20% loss on FCX this week but I'm not offloading that till it gets into the 20s.

It makes sense. WSB had a culture that changed, but it changed slowly. It was always growing, but at a slow enough rate to maintain it. Then the new influx came, and most of us hid other places.

'Yes, I am with you‚Äô said Elon, laying Thiel‚Äôs wounded hand gently to his breast. 'And you‚Äôre with me. And the journey‚Äôs finished. But after coming all that way I don‚Äôt want to give up yet. It‚Äôs not like me, somehow, if you understand.‚Äô 

'Maybe not, Elon,‚Äô said Thiel; 'but it‚Äôs like things are in the world. Stocks fall. An end comes. We have only a little time to wait now. We are lost in ruin and downfall, and there is no escape.‚Äô 

'Well we could at least go further from this dangerous place here, from this Growth Crash of Doom, if that‚Äôs its name. Now couldn‚Äôt we? Come, Mr. Thiel, let‚Äôs go down the path at any rate!‚Äô 

'Very well, Elon. If you wish to go, I‚Äôll come,‚Äô said Thiel; and they rose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards the collapsing meme stock mountain‚Äôs quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the Memeath Naur, and the side of the cone was riven open, and a huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side. Incinerating the portfolios of great many ape. 

Peter and Elon could go no further. Their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen hill piled at the Mountain‚Äôs foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was an island now, not long to endure, amid the torment of Portfoliodruin. All about it the earth gaped, and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up swallowing profits. Behind them the Mountain was convulsed. Great rents opened in its side. Slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A rain of hot ash was falling. 

They stood now; and Elon still holding his lover‚Äôs hand caressed it. He sighed. 'What a tale we have been in, Mr. Peter, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äô he said. 'I wish I could hear it told! Do you think they‚Äôll say: Now comes the story of Nine-fingered Peter and the Meme Mountain of Doom? And then everyone will hush, like we did, when in $VALE they told us the tale of Beren One-hand and the Great Jewel. I wish I could hear it! And I wonder how it will go on after our part.‚Äô 

But even while he spoke so, to keep fear away until the very last, his eyes still strayed north, north into the eye of the wind, to where the sky far off was clear, as the cold blast, rising to a gale, drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds. 

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ~ 

And so it was that Jpowaihir saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes, as down the wild wind he came, and daring the great peril of the skies he circled in the air: two small dark figures, forlorn, hand in hand upon a little hill, while the world shook under them, and gasped, and rivers of fire drew near. And even as he espied them and came swooping down, he saw them fall, worn out, or choked with fumes and heat, or stricken down by despair at last, hiding their eyes from death. 

Side by side they lay; and down swept G
Jpowaihir, and down came Landroval and Meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not knowing what fate had befallen them, the wanderers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire. Fed balance sheet expansion operations had resumed."

The strain on the financial system can be measured by the margin used compared to the collateralizing capital supporting.

It is difficult to quantify the current level opulence society has normalized, however today a customer ordered a [16oz Oreo cookie](https://i.imgur.com/YSARuqG.png) during *brunch*, and at some point the body cannot handle any more Oreo.

2021-06-18 23:31:18,wallstreetbets,"Ok I am going to lay out an elaborate story and full disclosure I am fucked up. So feel free to skip or downvote. 

Got a lake cabin off off the beaten path 3 years ago, what the fuck ever. Wife and I went to local Walleye fish fry and it was so windy we decided to stay in and watch a James Bond movie and chill afterward. Well ‚Äúsnook‚Äù my neighbor 3 doors down comes up and says hey Greg has his Ranger make a drink of your choice and let‚Äôs go close the the chicken coops. Tell the wife and off we go. 

Well Snook has a 1/5 of Phillips Blackberry Brandy in a plastic bottle.  I have never seen this before and didn‚Äôt know it existed. So that bottle proceeds to disappear along the journey. 

Snook worked at a liquor distributor and retired last year and has a ponytail. Good cat. Greg owns the farm across the road. Found out his family has owned the 600 acre farmstead since his ancestors homesteaded in 1875. Both are the nicest people you could ever meet. 

So an hour and half tour of everything. Saw 5 different deer, skunks, raccoons, his cattle, horses, and crops along the way. Small lakes I didn‚Äôt know about so close to where we are at. rolling hills, trees, and the views were surreal to say the very least. One beautiful lake getting developed from an IA family as a resort/getaway and stocked w Walleye. Sunset was one for the annals. 

I would like to think I was affable and it made my day, week, and year and made me think on deeper level  of all the things I have aspired to for so long now. 

I feel blessed and I am grateful everyday for the life I have, and the people I have met along the way,

TLDR I have worked my entire life and planned and sacrificed and it is getting time to not only enjoy the journey but create one. Give me the 3-5 month bull run I have been planning for and I am tapping out. I want to enjoy the sunsets every day and the people along the way. And the chickens are doing just fine.

2021-06-18 23:31:22,wallstreetbets,"I am the Diogenes of this and all WallStreet related subs.

Like Diogenes, I come and go as I please, shitposting about everything and everyone till I get bored.

Like Diogenes, I spit in authority's face and I don't give a single fuck about anything. I get invitations to mod wallstreet subs all the time, but I don't accept any of them just as when Alexander the Great visited Diogenes, told him that he was a big fan of his philosophy and will give him anything he wanted, Diogenes simply replied, ""I want you to step aside, you're blocking the sunlight."" Following which Alexander proclaimed, ""If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes."" Diogenes replied, ""If I were not Diogenes, I would also wish to be Diogenes."" showing tell tale signs of sarcasm and narcissism, which are hallmarks of all my comments.

Diogenes was once rummaging through a pile of Bones, Alexander the great inquired what he was doing to which Diogenes replied, ""I'm trying to find the bones of your father but I can't distinguish them from the bones of slaves.""

Just like Diogenes exposed Plato's false description of humans as ""featherless bipeds"" by plucking all the feathers off a chicken, storming one of Plato's lectures at his academy, dropping off the chicken while proclaiming ""Behold, here's Plato's man"", and then walking away, I expose ü§° with absurd takes whenever I can be arsed to make an effort.

Like Diogenes, I always tell people not to worry about things beyond their control, and that happiness lies within ourselves. Seeing people frantically panic about a possible invasion, Diogenes started rolling a barrel up and down a hill shouting ""This is just as useful as whatever you're doing"".

Like Diogenes, I have full control of all my desires, and practice minimalism to the extreme. Diogenes' sole possession was a wooden bowl he used to drink and eat, but on seeing a child drink water with his hands, he threw away the bowl too.

Diogenes was rude to everyone he met, saying ""The only place to spit in a rich person's house is their mouth"" and carried a lantern in broad daylight shouting ""I search for a true human being, but I find none."" which was his way of exposing the hypocrisy, lifelessness, and shallow values of society. Everyone, he claimed, was trapped in a make-believe world which they insisted was reality and, because of this, people were living in a kind of dream state. He rejected the concept of ""manners"" as a lie and advocated complete truthfulness at all times and under any circumstance.

As a result, just like myself, he was unbearable to talk to, always confronting people about their choices, berating them for not thinking for themselves, mocking them for not controlling their desires.

And yet, like myself, people loved having him around and everyone went to him for advice. Even Plato was forced to change his definition of a person to ""featherless biped with broad flat nails"" because of Diogenes' stunt. The citizens of Corinth and Athens greatly admired the philosopher and upon his death buried him in honor by the city gate, erecting a monument over his grave.

This comment is probably too long and no one will read it but like Diogenes, I literally don't care."

2021-06-19 01:55:17,wallstreetbets,"The world's first uranium fission nuclear reactor went critical 1.7 billion years ago, underneath the ground in the Oklo region in Gabon.

The natural nuclear reactor formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a nuclear chain reaction took place. The heat generated from the nuclear fission caused the groundwater to boil away, which slowed or stopped the reaction. After cooling of the mineral deposit, the water returned, and the reaction restarted, completing a full cycle every 3 hours (approximately 30 minutes of criticality followed by 2 hours and 30 minutes of cooling down to complete a 3-hour cycle.) The fission reaction cycles continued for hundreds of thousands of years and ended when the ever-decreasing fissile materials no longer could sustain a chain reaction.

A key factor that made the reaction possible was that, at the time the reactor went critical 1.7 billion years ago, the fissile isotope U235 made up about 3.1% of the natural uranium, which is comparable to the amount used in some of today's reactors. Because U235 has a shorter half-life than U238, and thus decays more rapidly, the current abundance of U235 in natural uranium is about 0.70‚Äì0.72%. A natural nuclear reactor is therefore no longer possible on Earth without heavy water or graphite."

2021-06-19 01:36:04,wallstreetbets,"All meteorites and terrestrial rocks share the same primordial ratios of Lead isotopes and uranium isotopes, but have different fractions of uranium relative to lead because of the process of differentiation. Using this, and the known decay rates of U-235 and U-238, Clair Patterson figured out the age of the earth. In this process, he realized that the age of surface rocks on the earth was incorrect due to lead pollution from automobiles. This led to the modern day ban on lead additives in gasoline."

WISH was the focus of a pump and dump a few days ago.

You bagholders are going to have to wait a month before you pump this shit again.

It's up 4$ based on that pump. Once apes lose interest the price will fall again. I'm not buying and watching it go down 40% over the next two months.

I'd rather put my money in a bankrupt Thailand Airline. At least I'm likely to get a mile high handy for being a shareholder next time I fly.

I‚Äôm in the lowest tax bracket in California I‚Äôm well aware how hard we‚Äôre getting reemed by taxes. I get that you‚Äôre adding on to my opinion but again, if I‚Äôm gonna be taxed 15-25% of my income, making less than 30k a year in CA, then I think I would gladly give 50% or more in taxes when these tendies finally print my millions lol

&#x200B;

Lol 30 grand a year.  Jesus i'm not an elitist by any means or making millions but the fact you are walking around like you are some big baller when your ass is making minimum wage is something else."

2021-06-19 08:50:47,wallstreetbets,I love how you edited out the part where your entire account was 9300 right?  So you started at a grand but then it was up to 8 and now 9300.

2021-06-19 00:09:47,wallstreetbets,"Comparing BABA's multiple with Coca cola felt a little weird, but the point stands. BABA divides its businesses in 4 categories: Core e-commerce platform (Taobao), cloud computing (Ali Cloud), digital media and entertainment business (Youku, Tudou, UC website, etc.), and innovative business and others (including YunOS, AutoNavi Maps, DingTalk, etc.). While it's true that its core e-commerce has had strong competition by the likes of JD, Pingduoduo, and SuNing, BABA's been gradually repositioning themselves to be the leader in cloud sector, of which I'm extremely bullish on. It dwarves Amazon cloud operations by a long shot, and expanding at a rapid rate. I think it being a Chinese company along with the 'chine bad' political overtune has grounds but are more or less red herrings.

That said, if market thinks the way it thinks about BABA, it doesn't matter if i'm right or bullish. BABA as it stands is not an interesting trade, I'm sleeping on some shares. If it breaks out of the current channel, maybe I'll add onto the position.

While we're on the topic, I wouldn't touch JD, Pingduoduo, or if anyone trades Hongkong exchange, Meituan. Personally it's a joke that the latter two are even publicly traded."

I guess i need to go on a beef jerky diet ü§£

Ill just go around a few i remember from yesterdays grocery but i notice it every time. And i had a talk with my dad about it and he says he also see it a lot when printing the tags.

These are in cad $ 
The foot long boxes for the kids went from 1.99 to 2.79.
The juice from .99 to 1.49.
The bread from 2.99 to 3.49.
Most of cans that were in the .99 area are now all 1.29. 
Litter went from 8.99 to 9.99
Some 7.99 ""meat"" (bologna ?! Not sure of the english word) is now at 9.99.
Ground beef did go up too but the uncles a butcher and sells to us at cost price but when i buy at the grocery i get way less than before.
Chicken went up a lot too.
And pork which used to be the cheapest meat is now way more expensive, but i dont eat much of it. 
Hot dog sausages is ridiculous. Its went from 2.99 to 4.99.
Bacon is the same.
Veggies also went up but we started growing our own last year so we aint much impacted by it.

I could prolly go on for a while. I used to go to the cheaper grocerie stores, except for meat where i buy from the uncle or go to best grocerie stores when need on the go. There is 2 major cheaper grocerie stores. One decided to put on a very popular humorist in their ads and it seems they also decided to raise their prices , and since there was only one other cheaper, they were able to raise their prices too. So now you have bery expensive or a bit less expensive options. 

At least we have some hunting meet for the winter and grow our veggies but almost everything really raised √† lot in prices. We talking about √† lot of 20-30% raises , which is crazy to me, having worked in grocery stores for years , i had never seen such a hike in prices at such a fast rate.
