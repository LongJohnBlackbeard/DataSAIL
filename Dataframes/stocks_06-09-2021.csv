It gets more complicated if you bought in at different prices. You’d then want to average the price of your bought shares before using the above ‘price paid for share’"

2021-06-09 18:41:06,stocks,Prefer a name like GSK in this environment. Value + healthy divi + catalysts (thanks Elliot). Seems to check the boxes to navigate the current index wide indigestion.
2021-06-09 18:03:38,stocks,I foresee a drop off after. But we will see! I overbought and am trimming on the way up. I believe in it longterm but weighting appropriate.
2021-06-09 18:14:00,stocks,"I really wanna see it hit $800 before the split, but I don't think it has the legs. Even after the split you're looking at over $175/share which still may be a bit much depending on whether theres a market correction or the economy recovers at a fast enough pace to catch up to the market. Just my opinion. I only hold 4 shares."
2021-06-09 19:44:47,stocks,"I'm a novice at all this, but is there a benefit to buying say 10 shares now at 700 vs 40 at whatever the split price is?  Sorry for the probably dumb question."

2021-06-09 19:06:42,stocks,"This has happened many times since 1900; human nature causes everyone to want to be in the market after it has been going up for a while because they want to make money like others are which causes it to keeping going up until it becomes overvalued and corrects. When the market has been flat people are not interested because the average investor is not making money no one wants to join the flat bandwagon and the market stay flat for a while.  The market is controlled by human nature, not fundamentals, if you are investing based on fundamentals you will make money in every market situation."

2021-06-09 18:28:15,stocks,"You should not return to trading.  If you bought a company you had confidence in and then sold it because the price dropped, you likely need to stick to indexed ETFs or no stocks at all.  A focused investor would have bought more shares if a stock they had confidence in dropped in price.  Temperament is the most important trait for an investor."
2021-06-09 17:16:51,stocks,"At the moment things look okay, but there is a bit of fear looming about inflation and job losses as soon as governments stop covid support for businesses."
2021-06-09 17:57:12,stocks,">job losses as soon as governments stop covid support for businesses.

We're already worried about job losses? We haven't even filled all the open jobs yet."
2021-06-09 18:03:20,stocks,"Here in Europe central banks and economists are warning for it. There were less companies going bankrupt during covid year than not covid years. So as soon these support measuments stop, a lot  will go bankrupt in a short time. But everything depents on what EU/domestic policy will be."
2021-06-09 18:20:54,stocks,"Then those businesses aren't healthy and *should* go out of business. In America, we have employers bitching and moaning about a legit labor supply crunch. Ending unemployment benefits will help a bit, but there's a trend of workers rejecting going back to their shitty jobs of 2019. Companies are having to increase wages and offer more reasonable hours. Those that refuse to are going to suffer."
2021-06-09 18:30:03,stocks,Yeah totally agree that they definitely should go out of business. Problem could just be that its just a lot at the same time. But we'll see about the impact.

2021-06-09 18:00:27,stocks,"Transcript from chairman Ryan Cohen from today's shareholder meeting:

""We ushered in a whole new era of GameStop. On a personal note, I want you to know I’m humbled to be elected to your board and serve as your Chairman. We have a lot of work in front of us, and it will take time. We’re trying to do something that nobody in the retail space has ever done but we believe we’re putting the right pieces in place and we have clear goals: delighting customers and driving shareholder value for the longterm. The management team and refreshed board will remain totally focused on these goals at all times. We know some people want us to lay out a whole detailed plan today, but that’s not gonna happen. You won’t find us talking a big game, making a bunch of lofty promises, or telegraphing our strategy to the competition. That’s the philosophy we adopted at Chewy. Here are a few things we’ve done so far: refresh the board, added technology and retail experience to the leadership team, paid off all our long term debt and strengthened the balance sheet, and begun laying the foundation for long term growth. Moving forward, we want you to judge GameStop based on our actions, not our words. Thank you everyone, and as my dad would say, “buckle up."""""

Thanks for sharing"
2021-06-09 19:22:41,stocks,"I think these earnings show that Gamestop is succesfully transitioning to e-commerce, especially the sales improvement while significantly reducing brick-and-mortar stores. The assignment of the two Amazon people as CEO and CFO is again very bullish. All I want to see is this company turning a profit again.

But let's be honest, it didn't matter what the earnings were: the price was gonna drop after market anyways because of planned moves and bad liquidity. The real question is how the price will move tomorrow at market opening.

However, don't be fooled: there is no fundamental reasoning behind current price levels. The only reason it's there now is because of meme stock season/the short squeeze story. If you buy in now, better 'buckle up' for some heavy volatilty. Better have some diamond hands (and not just for the meme).

For the record, I bought shares early December at around $16 and I've held my shares ever since then so I feel like i'm pretty neutral on this topic. The company turnaround was the reason I bought in, the short squeeze thing just the cherry on top as it seemed improbable to me at the time. To me, the positive factor about the short percentage was just that the price was so low at the time, I could get in fairly cheaply.

Maybe I should have sold in January, but tbh I kind of believe that the shorters must have just delayed the inevitable or done some illegal stuff to not cause the MOASS back then. The stock was rocking at $400 with still an incredible amount of short %, genuinely don't know how they managed to get out of that situation. I think I'll just hold and if the squeeze happens then I'll sell, if it doesn't i'm fine with holding because this is probably the best trade I'll ever do in my life and I just like the stock ;)"

That's an *awful* reason to short something. Fair value very rarely has anything to do with price behavior.

Two things can be true at the same time."

2021-06-09 18:08:10,stocks,"You’re literally struggling to find something that is profitable that they will be at the forefront of. Stick to “we gonna squeeze!” arguments. Before the Reddit hoard attacks me, I own a little GameStop stock and I’m not a shill. 

Esports though? Hardly. There are so many other companies that are light years ahead of them in this regard and even if they get into this field it is very low payoff in the grand scheme of things. 

NFT? What brand differentiator do they have in NFT other than “we said we will do it?” Also, outside of the one off NFT stories is there even a market for this? 

Console expansion? Consoles are expanding into…not in retail. I’m not sure how this helps them even remotely. Most people don’t even buy physical games anymore. It’s a short term boost that is hyper competitive and hyper unprofitable. GameStop has basically forced their consumer to purchase the bundles if they want one which only really works while the consoles are scarce and they are still finding it hard to make a profit. 

Bring on the downvotes boys, but you know I’m right. I buy the short interest arguments; but let’s not kid ourselves, this company is still very shaky long term."

This is truly speculative, and counting your chickens before they hatch.

There are not a lot of people buying at $300 a share based on this speculation.  Your prediction may become correct, but without the squeeze saga, people wouldn’t even be predicting as high as $300 once they are *fully established*. 

Your comment reads like another pumpy informercial with its grandiose, exaggerative wordage.  However, Reddit is an emotional place, especially around stocks, so that it why your comment is so popular.

In a way, GME is literally being kept aloft with **upvotes**.  Whether that’s sustainable is being debated."

2021-06-09 17:57:25,stocks,"Sure, I'll believe it when it happens. So far I see a defunct videogame chain that had to do a firesale of former stores because they couldn't attract customers or keep a viable buisess. Cutting down store lead to profits (short term) but as to how it would in any way or form be a competitior to PSN/Xbox Live/Nintendo Online/Steam/GoG and *all physical and digital stores selling games* is just a unlikely. They're fighting an uphill battle against established big brands with loyal customers and working ecosystems. Heck, even if they sell PC hardware (low profit market) they'd be going up against the pro stores with loyal customers.




Really, what can gamestop do that every other competitior hasn't done? Amazon was *revolutionary* be being a digital Wallmart, they had everything. Gamestop, by comparison, can't even have a supply of funcopop much less games. It'll be fun to see how this ends a year or two from now..."
2021-06-09 18:33:55,stocks,">  This was a phenomenal earnings and the transformation of the company is now a reality. 

Based on what? None of the transformation has taken place. It's all ideas, plans, and nothing at all tangible. They are still losing money other than being able to sell stock at absurdly inflated prices.

> GME is going to be at the forefront of collectible NFTs, Esports, and console expansion.

The forefront? Those things have already passed by. NFTs are over. Esports is an established industry. People order consoles online from whoever has them available and/or cheapest.

GameStop isn't at the forefront of anything, they're trying to catch up from a losing position."

2021-06-09 18:13:28,stocks,"That’s not how a vote count works my guy. They report on whatever vote count they receive from whatever company handles their proxy votes and tabulates them. That company in turn automatically adjusts them so that there’s no over-voting. If GameStop has any issues with that tabulation they hire an auditor, and go through a process to dispute the tabulation for things like over-voting. At the moment we don’t know if such a process has started or will start. The votes could be legit, but they also might not be. 

Given how misleading the rest of your post is, I suspect you know that already and you’re just being disingenuous, but I can’t prove that. You might just be ignorant. 

No skin off my back. If you don’t like the stock, you should definitely short it, or not buy it. For me, It was a buy at 17, it was a buy from at 40, it was a buy at 300, it was a buy again at 40, and at 150, and again at 200, and 250, and 300. They gave me a discount in after hours which was pretty awesome, so I just bought more, which I’m pretty pumped on. I’ll continue to buy it with every paycheck at its current price.

This stock will continue to be a buy from me under 1k without any thought of a squeeze. It’s got the right team in place to set up the first truly successful use case of an NFT in a huge market, with leadership that had expertise in Amazon prime. It’s got room to create an entirely new marketplace for digital games, both in subscription based models and ownership models with its NFT, and the opportunities to expand into things like in game currency is there as well. This is going to transform the digital games marketplace, and if you lack the vision to see that, that’s okay. Not everybody can get rich in the stock market. Somebody has to get left behind or find themselves a bagholder when there are seismic shifts in an industry, and you’re welcome to be that person. 

For somebody oblivious to video games, I could understand a “it’s overvalued” case, but the reality is, I’m incredibly bullish on it. 

And the fact that it’s been demonstrated time and time again to be the most heavily manipulated stock in existence with the largest number of naked shorts making it ripe for a potential squeeze is just icing on the cake. 

I think DFV summed it up pretty well when he said this is the most asymmetric value stock on the market, and that equation hasn’t changed. 

I’m excited to be a part of this turnaround story, and while I’m not in the position to give financial advice, I think if you disagree with me, feel free to short it. One of us can pay the other one for their mistaken predictions."

2021-06-09 18:45:51,stocks,"I’ll chime in on the NFT’s section. There is definitely a market for NFT’s: digital used games. 

One of GameStop’s money makers was their used video game sales (buying your copy for $3.50 and selling it for $20 is great profit). Now with digital downloads becoming the norm, not so much. Our ownership of digital games have been tied to company's login account whether it's Steam, Sony, Microsoft, EA, whatever. For any reason, these games can be removed from the store/launcher preventing you from even accessing the game. If you wanted to sell a game like you would a physical copy, the only way to sell a digital game used would be sell your entire account, login and everything. NFT’s bring ownership back to the customer.

NFT’s associated with digital game ownership sounds groundbreaking to me. It’s definitely still a pipe dream, but doesn’t seem too unreasonable to have these companies link their launchers/stores to an individual’s digital wallet."

Relative to the crazy prices some people paid, sure.  However, the NFT concept/technology is still in it's infancy.  In general, the markets for gaming NFTs do not exist yet.  I think it makes a lot of sense for a company like Gamestop to keep it in mind as a possible future market.

2021-06-09 18:15:32,stocks,"I think you're missing the real value of GameStop's push into NFTs. Its not for collectables, its to trade digital games.

The digital game market has been the biggest threat to GameStop over the years. Their revenue was largely reliant on the used game market. 

Thankfully consoles aren't ready to go all digital yet due to hard drive capacity and limited download speeds in home, and because of that physical games are still popular. But that's going to change over the coming decades.

Plus used games are a threat to publisher revenue since they don't get a cut of resales. 

With NFT Games GameStop gets to keep the used game market going and publishers also stand to get a cut from resales. It's a win/win for both sides of the gaming industry.

Collectables aren't the way to go with NFTs in gaming."

As for the stock split, it would just allow more available shares for HFs to cover with at a lower price IMO. This can be debated as helping/hurting retail. Id say it would hurt retails advantage.

As for the reopening during covid, many people during Q1 around the world were still in lockdown or restricted access to stores.

you need to differentiate this whole meme stock frenzy with actual fundamentals and realize that they dont go hand in hand. Yes, people are taking advantage of the hype around all these meme stocks now but if you look back years from now I dont see gamestop being at the price its at now.

No one knows the future, obv., and we all read the tea leaves differently, but if/as/when one gets a little antsy that things are getting too high, take a little cream off the top, keeping it within the 401K move it over into ""a Money Markey Fund"" (I.e. ""cash""), where mostly your holdings will be preserved. If/as/when things ""correct"", move it back from Money Market Fund to your current holdings.  Maybe each time your holdings go up 10%, move 10% into cash, each time your holdings go down 10% move that saved cash back into stock.

Bonds and stocks are ""historically"" related (as one goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa. )REITs are ""supposed"" to be uncorrelated in that they move independently of stocks or bonds. Cash/Money Market Funds maintain value (unless you bring in time and inflation into the consideration).

Anyway, I share your opinion on correction coming, and I've been slowly moving into cash in my 401K, which I'll move into stocks again if (when?) things correct.  Of course, the ""cost"" of doing this is that the cash position is (at best) missing out on stock gains while it's sitting there waiting (and at worst losing out to inflation).

Institutions don't update their positions in realtime so some of that data is not correct anymore, which can give a distorted number.
Second reason: latest short interest numbers show that around 40% of the float is shorted, which means there is 140% of shares available for people or institutions to own, which makes it possible for institutions to actually hold over 100% of the float of the company.

As for the big jump yesterday, there was an insane amount of volume caused probably by retail traders trying to make a short squeeze happen. Because of the large number held by institutions & insiders combined with the high short interest it's actually a good candidate for a short squeeze because not a lot of float is available so i do believe there is a possibility of making money, but short squeeze are quite risky.

We can forget it's there for a few months and BOOM institutions will pump it, triggering a massive amount of retail buyers thinking ""Nice GME is being pumped again!"" 

CLNE because I think electric cars aren't as good for the environment as people realize, and that other alternative fuels like Natural Gas are going to be in huge demand in the future.

The therapies will likely be expensive because of the highly specific training therapists will be required to have. These therapies are also not one and done for everyone. There are pre screenings, dosing sessions, and post therapy integration sessions. So really I would think of it as a new type of psychotherapy, they're just leveraging psychedelics as tools to enhance its efficacy.

I've heard this argument quite a few times. Sure, people who currently buy from the black market will likely continue to do so. However most people don't want to assume that type of risk. And while some people will start growing their own shrooms after decriminalization, the process is much easier said than done. And once again, they may not be obtaining the full benefits of the medicine without a guide (therapist).

>Can’t see these companies being a good investment other than maybe pump and dump. And to top it all off they are all burning cash like crazy and will most likely undergo massive share dilution before they ever reach positive net income.

In relation to my above sentiments, in my opinon all of the near term revenue will be from clinics. There is already a massive bottleneck in psychedelic trained therapists and the training programs are over enrolled. These clinics are not burning cash because they're not doing clinical trials. I can't name specifically name stocks I'm referring to because they're OTC, but one in particular is already earning millions in revenue from Ketamine therapy, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation and running clinical trials for another big pharma company.

Farther down the line we'll see novel delivery methods and forms of classic psychedelics patented and marketed, and farther along ""psychedelics 2.0"", which entails altogether new psychedelic molecules which should also be completely patentable. Some will shorten trip duration, some aim to reduce physiological effects or mitigate hallucinogenic characteristics.

Hope that was enlightening!"

2021-06-09 19:14:19,stocks,Really glad to hear it's working for you. To be honest I haven't got to hear a ton of personal testimonials for Ketamine therapy. I'll DM you.
2021-06-09 18:28:14,stocks,Interesting take. There are already companies patenting psilocybin biosynthesis using genetically modified E. Coli as a starter. Said company has also said they're formulating a psilocybin + baeocystin + norbaeocystin combo drug. However from what I've heard formulations like this are extremely difficult to get FDA approval on. They like single molecule drugs. There are also other companies going with a yeast started psilocybin synthesis.

2021-06-09 16:04:13,stocks,I mentioned exactly zero OTC tickers here. The only specific stock I referred to is Compass Pathways which is on the NASDAQ.
2021-06-09 18:50:37,stocks,"Ketamine therapy is currently a very niche market. But you say they are earning millions in revenue, do they actually have positive cash flow? 

Cannabis was legalized in Canada 5 years ago and there are still currently no companies that are earning significant positive earnings.

If I bought a psychedelic therapy company today, I’d likely have to wait 3-5 years for wide scale legalization, then another 5-10 years for positive cash flow. That’s a huge opportunity cost, before even considering the loss you’d likely incur due to share dilution.

Like I said, I think psychedelics will revolutionize medicine, and they sound very positive when people talk about the industry as a whole. But when I do the math I just don’t see how they’ll outperform index funds, especially since it’s very speculative and only a select few companies will succeed."

2021-06-09 18:58:36,stocks,">Ketamine therapy is currently a very niche market. But you say they are earning millions in revenue, do they actually have positive cash flow? 

There is only one company I know of right now generating that revenue. No, they are not net positive because they are rapidly expanding, doubling their amount of operating clinics this year alone. And they will likely keep expanding as their demand rises and decriminalization presents business opportunities for other drugs like Psilocybin in Oregon. All of their clinics are currently operating at max capacity and there is currently a 2 week wait time for an appointment."

2021-06-09 15:58:59,stocks,"They have a good product, the trick is probably getting it adopted.    They blew the presentation at my company and were eliminated in the first round over the smaller company offerings.

Once specialized SaaS gets adopted the costs to change are high which would lock in the existing revenue and leave open the possibility of adding future products, and sucking up price increases.    Because, guess what, buying the same companies products is less risky.

EDIT : Your DD sure jibes with my experience and knowledge of the company.   I wonder how they're getting that many big accounts (ours wouldn't hit that 150k threshhold).

>Achieved 48% YOY Growth of Customers with Annual Contract Value Over $150K

Believe it or not I was you about 30 years ago.    I built the financial statements with auto population into Excel from our (multiple) financial systems.    I see where you're going with WDESK and it all sounds great for your career.   FERC is a beast - we modified our ENTIRE SYSTEM just to comply with their ridiculous mandates, which was a total waste of money incidentally.

And products that help accountants in their careers tend to be retained.   I have to put $WK on my list of companies to watch."
2021-06-09 15:34:46,stocks,yeaa no. there's no such thing as a SaaS niche.
2021-06-09 16:08:51,stocks,"Yeah I agree with everything you said.  The adoption of the product is key for them to grow their subscriber base and with the subscriber churn they have I think your take on locking in customers is 100% accurate.  They spend a good amount of money on marketing/events to promote their product to companies too so they know that building up and maintaining that reliable customer base is key.

I'm still skeptical about how any of the major accounting firms would use this software too.  A lot of the big ones develop their own software in house but even 3/4 of the Big 4 partnered so I guess they can find some use for it.  But yes, the subscriber growth and subscriber churn are key metrics here.

EDIT:  At the rate we're going we might be one of those companies that end up tripping that $150K threshold if we haven't already.  Not sure what the rates are with the addition of the FERC model we added to our portfolio.  From the 3 months I spent working on anything/everything FERC related I know this is going to be a monster of a project."
2021-06-09 15:51:00,stocks,"Yeah no shit the business model isn't niche the product/market they operate in is (i.e. niche market in the title).  Its biggest competitors are Blackline, Trintech,  and Oracle but none of them operate a platform for financial reporting processes (if they even have one) like Workiva.

A lot of SaaS companies focus their product around the financial close process (i.e. Oracle, SAP, Blackline) but Workiva operates in the Financial Reporting aspect which is completely different (i.e. it comes after the close process) and there is a lot of room for growth here.  In my post I even talked about how they sync their product with SAP platform to even further automate the financial reporting process.  Hell my company abandoned Blackline all together for Workiva cause it offers more.

You can cherrypick anything in an argument to try and make me sound dumb or misinformed but if you read my post you'll see what i'm talking about.  I've been in the space for 5 years now and seen roughly 20-25 different platforms used for accounting/financial close - none of them are like Workiva."

And arguably their low customer count may be an unexpected tailwind as it means they have a lot of yet-to-be-addressed market.  Lastly (!) I have a sneaking suspicion there are whales out there who want to acquire Fastly.  There was rumored interest at par, so at current levels I wouldn't be surprised if someone is frantically trying to get a deal done.

That's not the shorthand at all.  Shorthand for that is ""conviction"".  Saying you'll blind hold for 10+ years is literally saying the opposite, that you'll hold through whatever events may come until the calendar says."

Overall I remain optimistic even though it hasn't been a great performer for me.

2021-06-09 16:13:17,stocks,"No, the total is rolling, meaning your taxable amount changes as you trade. If you make $10k, then lose it, you will be at breakeven for the year and owe no taxes."
2021-06-09 13:42:43,stocks,Believe the wash rule is if you sell a stock at a lost and then buy it back within 30 days.  You cannot claim the lost as a tax benefit.
2021-06-09 13:48:49,stocks,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp

It's hard to explain so best to read up about it, but say you sold shares in KO at a loss and then within a month bought KO or PEP you don't get to claim the loss.

Edit: read up a bit more about it. KO and PEP seem to be different enough so a bad example, GOOG/GOOGL would probably be similar enough to get you into trouble."

2021-06-09 12:55:29,stocks,Apple stock split last year accounts for the difference.
2021-06-09 12:56:56,stocks,"Apple's stock has split five times since the company went public. The stock split on a 4-for-1 basis on August 28, 2020, a 7-for-1 basis on June 9, 2014, and split on a 2-for-1 basis on February 28, 2005, June 21, 2000, and June 16, 1987."

2021-06-09 12:41:57,stocks,"Dunno about Danimer, but wikipedia has a wealth of info on the subject. Not all of it is as eco freindly as it sounds 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable\_plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradable_plastic)

Recycling plastic in itself is a whole other can of worms and depressing to read about. The only viable way is to reduce and stop using it altogether."
2021-06-09 14:20:39,stocks,"At some point something will disrupt the plastic industry but were not sure what it is yet.  They're even experimenting with a cannabis based plastic type material. I've seen so many different polymers that the question isnt even what company, the question that has to be settled first is what materials will be used to replace it."
2021-06-09 12:42:54,stocks,"I used to have a few shares of DNMR, and I decided to sell them after I read a WSJ article (https://www.wsj.com/articles/plastic-straws-that-quickly-biodegrade-in-the-ocean-not-quite-scientists-say-11616238001) where a scientist disputed their biodegradability claims. 

The price more than halved after that article before recovering some recently, but I do like their ability to form partnerships and secure contracts now whilst PureCycle & Origin Materials are still pre-revenue. For example, the Mars-Wrigley/Skittles partnership is very promising. This stock is one I'm still making my mind up on, but I love the upside of bioplastics."

2021-06-09 13:22:14,stocks,"Im relatively new to trading as well, but aren't using calls early on just too risky? 

Personally I don't feel comfortable with the risk factors in those trades until I've gotten a better sense of my own emotions and risk apatite."
2021-06-09 13:27:51,stocks,Before i started trading i just gambled on sports anyways. I am fine with the risk tbh. Most of this money is the  coronavirus checks. With only 5k in my account value investing just seems like a waste of time. Id rather take a risk with a smaller amount of money now and then by the time i finish my masters program i will take out the money i have with vanguard and invest in a safer way.

2021-06-09 13:52:23,stocks,"Been long and strong XOM, VLO and COP since October. Love them all. XOM is a great play, but if anyone wants to enter, I really suggest waiting for a down day and then writing puts under the current price to hop in. It's run quite a bit. I think oil is going to go through the roof again as more things open up and oil demand out of Asia is going to propel overall crude demand growth for at least another decade, if not two. 

One great thing about Exxon is that in addition to billions of barrels of proved crude reserves, they have something like 37 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves. That is a lot of gas. O&G are highly demand inelastic, capex has been massively curtailed, OPEC+ is hurting from COVID and will fight to keep prices up, the US government hates pipelines which will impair the ability of shale to compete, and the US government is pressuring banks not to lend to shale producers. Not to mention massive money printing. There is a perfect storm for oil to really take off in the next 18 months and ""green"" solutions at the current time are very poor substitutes for O&G for most applications."
2021-06-09 14:00:16,stocks,I have Suncor and Shell.
2021-06-09 12:41:54,stocks,Exxon is starting to break out right now. Broke through resistance around $62.
2021-06-09 14:43:47,stocks,"I own BP, XLE and started a position in OIH too.  The only problem I have is determining if this is a short term trade or a long term hold.  I'll probably make a reassessment next year."
2021-06-09 15:30:14,stocks,"What do you have against the board shakeup? Exxon has done a terrible job of earning a profit and operating efficiently in recent years. Their board hasn’t done much at all positive. The most important addition to the board during this shakeup was Greg Goff. Anybody with knowledge of the industry has massive respect for Greg Goff and his ability to return value to shareholders. Look at what people in the industry have said about him. The Finnish refining exec has been touted as someone that wants to push renewables but if you look at what she’s said, she’s been clear that her primary goal is to earn a profit from existing operations. This board shakeup is primarily about returning value to shareholders, something Exxon’s board has been horrible at in recent years."
2021-06-09 13:54:35,stocks,Very well said. Completely agree with all points. Thank you for the response! Good to see knowledgeable people on stock subs these days!
2021-06-09 14:02:29,stocks,"Shell is fantastic as well, I'm a big fan of them. Shell and BP are a bit ahead of the green energy transition as well, so investor sentiment is likely better than exxon in that regard."
2021-06-09 12:51:38,stocks,"Yessir. I made this post mainly because of that, as well as WTI hitting the $70 mark today. I have thought about this thesis for months now, although I missed big on the gains since 2020. But I made some money on exxon's first climb, and luckily got out near the top. (It was a swing for me.) 

I have always kept an eye on oil prices and sentiment around the company though and I got back in exxon around $52 and have averaged up a bit while also purchasing call options. I prefer ITM options to play swings, but I went a bit out of character and also purchased $65 calls a few weeks ago. It has all worked out well so far. 

Big fan of oil right now, it's just a swing for me, but once I reach my price target and take my profits, I do plan on reevaluating and seeing if I should keep some positions to ride out for the next 5 years. I think sentiment is way ahead of itself in the green energy transition. I also believe solar and wind are not going to be the next thing, I believe in hydrogen energy down the road, (decades) and companies like exxon and chevron, shell and BP, already have a headstart on the massive infrastructure that it would require. This is majorly spec, but if there is a compelling case, I would happily hold long."
2021-06-09 12:47:25,stocks,*I also picked up some mid-July calls
2021-06-09 15:27:08,stocks,"Play it for a potential oil super cycle. If we have one brewing, wait for oil to get to 100 or a little over and sell half, maybe 3/4ths. The problem with an oil super cycle is the last one we had started in 2007 or so and was probably half responsible for cratering the economy and the oil stocks tanked (along with the broader market), so if you can get out even within 20% of the top, you'll get another bite at the apple at a way lower price. I don't think you ever want to hold a material position in oil long term, it's just a matter of when to get out. It stings a lot less paying $5 a gallon for gas when you are clipping huge gains and dividends in oil stocks."
2021-06-09 14:01:59,stocks,"Thanks. People have to remember that stocks like XOM are not get rich quick schemes. They take a long time to move. This slow pace doesn't draw much attention when you have options trades that are raking in 500% in a day. 

I'm not a buyer of oil stocks at these levels because I think they are a business where you want to buy in when there is extreme pessimism, but a substantial percentage of the population has absolutely no freaking clue how critical oil is to global commerce. If all the oil in the world disappeared today, my guess is over 90% of the population would be dead inside of a month. These kids on Reddit think you're a paid shill for big oil if you point out truths like that. It's really remarkable to see how dumb some people are."
2021-06-09 14:07:04,stocks,"That’s why I went with it too. Even if at some point oil starts going away (20-30 years or so), they will still be around as a global energy company. With Shell and Suncor I don’t even pay attention to dips. Of course this recent run has been nice but even long term these companies will be fine. 

And as a US investor, it is nice to get exposure to them as well. I am heavily invested in US index funds so this is just an extra diversifier."
2021-06-09 14:23:24,stocks,"I own a very small position in Shell as well (like 10-20 shares in a diversified dividend portfolio I'm building for retirement income). I do not think Shell or BP are in a good spot relative to the US majors if they continue too heavily down the green path. Shell is divesting great businesses for low prices. 

I am of the opinion that these huge conglomerates are victims of massive diseconomies of scale. GM tried to morph into a conglomerate. Bankrupt. GE tried to be a mortgage and business lender. Nearly bankrupt and utter house of pain for stockholders. AIG tried to play investment banker and almost went bankrupt. There are a lot of examples. 

To me, Shell, BP, Chevron and Exxon should go hard in the paint on O&G. I'm fine with them allocating some portion of R&D to things like carbon capture or even ""green"" energy sources, but to try to pivot a company that large is going to be a problem. Given the sheer number of applications that are going to be hydrocarbon powered for the foreseeable future, staying in the core business is key IMHO. We're gonna need oil to run the ocean liners, tractors, tractor-trailers, mining equipment, trains, airplanes, etc. for a LONG time and actions to cut exploration and capex could portend an ugly future for the US and Europe. The ideal scenario would be to keep the oil majors as actual oil major cash cow businesses and then let investors allocate the return of capital as they see fit. I'm sure CNPC, Lukoil, Rosneft and the House of Saud freaking love these developments by the Western oil majors, though."
2021-06-09 15:36:08,stocks,Thank you for the reply.  I'll keep that in mind.
2021-06-09 14:10:57,stocks,"Agreed. I stated in my post that if you don't already have a good cost basis, I wouldn't recommend starting a new position (should've made it a header, I realized I only made that point regarding Devon Energy.)  At levels like these, I believe averaging up isn't a terrible idea given the circumstances. I would not be starting this position now though. I know a lot of people here are big fans of the oil thesis though and I figured I'd get some like minded people to talk about it at least. 

I think people forget just how much oil is engrained in the economy. And it's common knowledge to most, but oil is used in the plastics they put in EV cars. It's just not going anywhere as fast as people think, making it a decent contrarian play, (less so at the prices,but still has room imo.) 

O&G are also the best forms of scalable energy. It's hard to scale wind and solar in a similar way. I would say nuclear energy is also a sound investment now, but in the same boat, of you didn't get on early, you are in a way riskier place than you could have been 3 months ago. 

I read a quote the other day, ""how many solar panels does it take to make one solar panel?"" I just don't think green energy can sustain the amount of energy the global economy uses currently, and will continue to use in emerging economies."
2021-06-09 14:34:09,stocks,"I agree completely about shell and BP. But what I will say is investor sentiment right now is better because of it, although I know that investing too much in green is going to hurt them long term. 

I think what happened with ExxonMobils board will help them in the short term with investor sentiment, but I also don't think having some new members on the board is going to derail their heavy O&G investments or strategy at all. One of my favorite things about Exxon is their strategy going forward and not investing heavily into green alternatives that they DO NOT have a competitive advantage in, that is where shell and BP are making mistakes. 

Carbon capture for Exxon is lucrative and I believe they will be able to make a business out of it. That is happening in Canada right now with Suncor, CNQ, among a couple others. They want carbon capture infrastructure.  To reduce emissions, and I believe that it is a necessary stepping stone to a greener future. I do NOT believe that solar and wind can ever replace the hydrocarbons we have beneath our feet, at least not yet. It's just unrealistic. 

Exxon and Cheese are my two favorites in this space as well. Chevron has a deal with toyota about providing hydrogen infrastructure and green hydrogen for their cells as well. Natural gas and carbon capture used together is a near net zero way to produce hydrogen and I think that will be the future of energy. Granted, it's decades away imo."
2021-06-09 14:39:03,stocks,"I don't know that investor sentiment on RDS and BP is that good. BP is trading on inflation adjusted levels where it was when they had that massive spill and RDS has been stuck in neutral. Maybe RDS will pop if they bring that dividend back, though. 

There might be a helluva business with carbon capture (assuming the government and end users are actually gonna pay for it) and I assume Exxon will dominate that space. Hell, that could be a massive segment in their 10-K in a decade!"
2021-06-09 14:47:01,stocks,"You are correct, my comments about sentiment on BP and shell were incorrect. I do not follow the companies much, but I am a fan of shell. But I was spewing some nonsense regarding their investor sentiment as since last I checked, shell is down while exxon has been steadily rising. Sorry for that misinformation."
2021-06-09 15:28:41,stocks,"No problem, it's the talking heads. The media puts out completely fake stories about how great it is for ""investor sentiment"" but it's all a fabrication. People in oil stocks want a big dividend and growing earnings."

2021-06-09 13:19:48,stocks,I did TQQQ for a while.  It's a rollercoaster not for the faint of heart
2021-06-09 14:47:12,stocks,"Check out [this](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/tqqq/) blog, I think it gives a pretty good overview of holding TQQQ long term."
2021-06-09 12:22:49,stocks,"If QQQ drops 20% from here, then TQQQ will drop about 60%.


If they both start at 100$ and QQQ falls 20%:

QQQ $100 -> $80, then needs QQQ to gain 25% to get back to breakeven.

TQQQ $100 -> $40, needs QQQ to gain 50% to get back to breakeven.


When we've been in a bull market for a while, it seems like free money to have that leverage, but if QQQ drops or even trades mostly sideways the leverage of TQQQ will hurt you."

2021-06-09 18:30:25,stocks,Given the earlier shock this year to QQQ because of inflation fears I'd be very hesitant to go into TQQQ right now. I'm in the camp that inflation will be transitory but there are plenty of people who think otherwise so I anticipate some panic selloffs when inflation numbers are high and the fed starts talking about talking about tapering. Buy after the dip.
2021-06-09 14:52:26,stocks,"Buy then sell as quickly as possible.  I've made good money on TQQQ, but if you include the number of hours I've spent watching it, I could have made much more per hour doing tax returns with no risk.  It's still below its high near the end of April, so it might still be good buy right now."
2021-06-09 14:57:12,stocks,Did the covid crash followed by the artificial recovery really just restart the 7 year bull run timer?
2021-06-09 14:54:34,stocks,"It's called malpractice.

The company can counter-sue for damages if the lawsuit is spurious or malicious.

However, they rarely are and even good companies have accounting errors and make material statements that can be viewed as manipulative or dishonest (it's called PR).

If the suits didn;t have merit the companies have standing to sue (counter-sue).

Other random attorneys would not have standing to sue another law firm just for being jerks(even if what they were doing was illegal) .

That kind of stuff is handled by the company being sued (counter sue) or by the state bar."
2021-06-09 15:45:52,stocks,"It is a page taken from medical malpractice, they sue not because they have a legitimate case or seeking large wins, they are suing to collect legal fees and pay themselves, all the lawyer need is a few defendants who will just sign their name because they may get some money or at worst loose nothing.

There should be a law against lawyers working on percentages of winning. Because what is happening is that they find a plaintiff, tell them they pay nothing if we don’t win, so people will see that as free money and agree to cooperate. The lawyer then file enough claims to make it very expensive for the defendant to actually challenge the case, so the defendant would just settle, the lawyer get his fees and then a percentage of whatever is left from the settlement that can be given to the defendant, which at the end is usually very little. 

It is a legal form of blackmail. Lawsuits should only be used when they have true merits, but that is easier said than done. The only way I see it happen is that people have to actually pay the lawyers and the lawyer  would get paid a fixed fee. Then the lawyers will do the minimum work required and they would not pursue frivolous shit"
2021-06-09 15:03:56,stocks,"Then why does almost every single company get sued and lose within 2-3 months of an ipo? even fb. always under ‘suing on behalf of shareholders’ for misleading statements. I have rarely found to be misleading enough to have changed my investment strategy, amount or cause even cause 5 more minutes of dd. I would say the news on so and so is suing on behalf dont forget to sign up if you have 100,000 shares or more or want to opt in opt out etc. Worse than spam callers as they font just cost me personally money but money and time (through funds of stocks invested). Just saying the bar should be a lot/significantly higher than whatever it currently is at so its not lawyers making $50M on a ‘The’ or 1,000,000 out of place in a prospectus or something else that 95% if investors dont use to make their investing decision."
2021-06-09 15:07:56,stocks,"becuase the shareholders were misled by some PR tidbit or accounting error and lawyers know this and are greedy.

Any shareholder that lost even a dime is salty and would sign anything they need to in hopes they get some money back (lawyers also know this).

Most companies eventually settle to get rid of the headache (lawyers know this too).

Most of these actually result in little/no money going to the shareholders and the lawyers settle for a small amount that covers the legal fees with very little going to shareholders but the lawyers get paid FIRST in any class-action (lawyers also know this).

  


TL;DR  
People that lose money are pissed and lawyers take advantage of angry suckers to get paid while the bagholder just keeps the bags and the lawyers laugh all the way to the bank.

I've got a small account, under 2k, so obviously PDT rules apply to me. I still have to study those rules a little more because I've seen some places say you can make 4 day trades in a 5 day period, some places say its 3 day trade. I'll just stick with 3 for now just to be safe.

Obviously anything purchased and sold the same day is a day trade, that's pretty self explanatory. I'm curious to how pre market and after hours play into it. More specifically, if I bought stock XYZ after hours, and sold XYZ pre market the next day, is that still considered a day trade? (It's technically the next day, but it hasn't been 24hrs)"

Will likely hit $1 TRILLION in revenue in the next 5 years. And at an ever-increasing level of profitability (despite continual expansion / reinvestment / R&D) as its higher margin businesses continue to become a bigger piece of the pie. Speaking of which it’s at a 10-year low P/E for those that still look at that for AMZN. There is nothing Amazon cannot expand into at this point if they desire, and their unabashed cultural thirst for continued innovation (unlike certain other trillion dollar companies) and dominance is unmatched. 

The most impressive company of all time in my opinion, and getting better. Complain about antitrust / monopoly all you want, as an investor that should be music to your ears.

AWS has some bells and whistles that GC doesnt so depending on what you do, AWS might be better but I would say that if you are just now switching to a cloud host, then GC is the way to go. If you already have stuff running on AWS then just stick with it. The price difference isnt big enough to matter.

The problem I have with AWS is it has become too convoluted. I cant remember all the marketing names for all the stuff they offer and there is so much overlap... for example, lightsail sucks and why Route 67? WTF? Why not just call it a Domain Services?

As for AAPL, they have a different idiosyncracy.  For whatever reason, in the modern era, they have always struggled to go much above a 20x multiple.  I can't give you a guaranteed reason, nor can I say whether that's unfair to them, or fair, or anything else, other than it just is.... AAPL just can seem to go 30x or 40x.  

After trading them since pre-iPhone, I've been out since they cracked 20x.  Been worried when I see flat numbers of iPhone, especially as all of their services are dependent on iPhones.  They also haven't had a new product or significant innovation since Steve Jobs was alive.  That's getting to be a long time of milking the same cows.  I do see iMacs are coming in various fruit themed colors now /s

That's not to say they can't pull levers.  If they're ever forced to go back to economy phones, like their dalliance with C models after the recession, they could supercharge their phone unit sales again.  Or maybe they can find or buy a new product inventor.  For now, they're stealthily dipping into Facebook and Microsoft's milkshake with recent announcements.

Anyway, point is you're looking at Amazon at the low end of its multiple and Apple at it's high end."

Consumer prices are rising quickly as the economy reopens after the pandemic. A closely watched data release on Thursday is expected to show prices rose another 0.4% in May -- pushing annual inflation above April’s 4.2%, already the highest in more than a decade.

Many policy makers and economists see the price spike as temporary –- partly because they haven’t been anticipating much in the way of wage growth, which has been relatively stagnant for years at the lower end of the pay scale.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Shareholders Approve NVIDIA Stock Split Shareholders finally approve NVIDIA stock split. The stock split will be payable in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive an additional three shares of stock for every share held. The shares will be distributed after the market close on July 19, and the newly split shares will begin trading when the market opens on Tuesday, July 20. 

Existing shareholders won't have to do anything to receive the additional shares, which will be deposited directly into their brokerage accounts once the stock split takes effect. It's important to note that investors shouldn't necessarily expect the new shares to appear in their account immediately after the market close on July 19. As internal processes differ from brokerage to brokerage, it may take as many as several days for the new shares to show up in investor accounts.

Finally, investors should remember that a stock split does nothing to change the value of the underlying business, but merely divides it into a great number of ownership portions. As an example, NVIDIA shares have lately been trading for roughly $700. This means instead of having one share worth $700, shareholders would own four shares, each worth $175."

2021-06-09 11:31:17,stocks,I suppose it means higher volatility in the future
2021-06-09 09:44:19,stocks,Very good..It’s quite hard for the ordinary person to buy at a price point of $600 share or even a $3K share  *COUGH* Amazon. This will make it much easier for people to invest.
2021-06-09 12:57:39,stocks,Cramer had called for Amazon and Google to do a stock split after tesla and a few others had theirs

2021-06-09 10:29:20,stocks,"Its up 10 - 30% depends on where you look since the stock split was announced.

A bit late to the party, in other stock splits price dropped after the split.

On top of that NVIDIA is a bit overvalued in comparison to its peers.

Cherry on cake is that its not the best time for tech stocks.

But could go either way, anyones guess."
2021-06-09 17:08:56,stocks,Check what happened during the recent AAPL and TSLA splits.

2021-06-09 19:09:40,stocks,"There has been runups before the split with recent tech splits, which is a good opportunity, but idk if there’s still some left in the NVDA tank considering it ran up $100 in the past few weeks and has bounced off the low 700s for a few days now."
2021-06-09 11:56:04,stocks,Trades under new price July 20.

2021-06-09 13:59:17,stocks,if u have 10 7/30 $600P pre-split you will have 40 7/30 $150P after. at least that's how my positions were managed by my broker during the great AAPL and TSLA splits of last year.

Can’t go wrong with both, really. Stay away from intel. They’re not bad, but don’t seem as aggressively competitive as the other two"
2021-06-09 18:36:28,stocks,Yes.
2021-06-09 16:48:43,stocks,That is the most common way to pay a split.
2021-06-09 17:16:35,stocks,"It’s true.

Your stock gets reduced by 75% and you get compensated three shares."
2021-06-09 18:20:45,stocks,Yes it makes sense. For every share you own you receive 3 additional shares as a dividend by a certain date. Just like if it had been money payed out as dividends.

2021-06-09 14:05:34,stocks,He was shit talking stock splits a few weeks back. But he always changes his stance on things so it’s believable.

2021-06-09 14:06:40,stocks,Make sure you are selling far OTM calls. Nvidia is set to take off. :)
2021-06-09 14:04:06,stocks,(1) Meme investors buying shares would make the stock more valuable. It doesn’t matter if it’s Buffett or DFV purchasing it. (2) Fractional shares can still be purchased (3) it is a coveted stock by institutional investors and analysts and the company is fucking loaded.
2021-06-09 11:10:29,stocks,"Not sure about overvalued it sure feels like a trillion dollar company in the making, if I had to choose I sure would take Nvidia over fang stocks any day."
2021-06-09 14:23:18,stocks,NVDA and GOOG are clear winners in the exploding AI sector. It's not overvalued.
2021-06-09 13:56:00,stocks,The overvalued narrative for NVDA is baffling to me. Don’t use lagging PE for a company like this. At least use PEG. The earnings growth of this company is what justifies its valuation. It’s amazing to me more people don’t see that.
2021-06-09 13:48:48,stocks,"Meaning between now and then if the price goes up to $800, the holders get 4 stocks worth 200 each?"

Otherwise Nvidia is really great."

2021-06-09 12:11:02,stocks,Yeah I didn’t think about that. I buy stocks in my 401k every week so I use fractional buying weekly. I don’t want to have money left over or have to wait to invest the money.

2021-06-09 15:07:14,stocks,"It's becoming more inconsequential with fractional shares. The main reason I like/liked it was because it created an artificial barrier where many retail investors weren't interested and weren't buying in. 

Weren't interested was a benefit because you had less bullshit artists writing DD. It also lowered the probability of Reddit retail impacting corporate voting. 

Weren't buying in was a benefit because it may have lowered the price (admittedly this decrease in price is probably so insignificant it's hardly quantifiable) 

These are both somewhat insignificant reasons so it's not a big deal to me, but my preference would be for most company's to split less aggressively."
2021-06-09 14:38:08,stocks,"Regardless of recent stock behaviour, Netflix is done as a FAANG stock. Realistically it should be FAAG now but that might not be the greatest abbreviation."
2021-06-09 16:08:22,stocks,"Netflix had a great run with people shifting to work at home but I don't think of it in the same light as other tech stocks. It's basically a media production company. I don't see them striving to diversify revenue , going after interesting acquisitions, nor doing lots of R&D like the other companies in FAANG. I sure don't see why it should be trading at a higher P/E over the other megacaps."
2021-06-09 15:42:49,stocks,Half their revenue comes from GPU sales which is highly cyclical. Most people don't need GPU upgrades every year. They can also buy used ones for half price on eBay. Its highly dependent on the gaming industry which is also highly cyclical. That leaves their data center which everyone else is doing. Nvidia at this point is incredibly overvalued. It's going to 20$ in 5 years. Good luck bag holders
2021-06-09 14:27:23,stocks,As you can see [here](https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm) NVDA market cap has grown 5x NFLX and it's currently 2x in total value.
2021-06-09 17:17:16,stocks,"Well then you cant but fractions, you just wont change broker?"
2021-06-09 15:18:02,stocks,I think more expensive stocks have less volatility. There are some dividend stocks I own that are considered (boring) and I like that they don't fluctuate as much. Seems like it could be a double edge sword for Invidia stock.
2021-06-09 15:28:15,stocks,FAAMG - I think Microsoft deserves a seat at the table.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Interactive Brokers Has anyone else experienced issues with IB filling orders on LSE stocks?

I have 3 x brokers at the moment:

Hargreaves Lansdown - For very long term funds / IT's and my ISA (a good tactic having a separate broker for lifetime investing so you don't look at the position every. single. day.)

IG - General share dealing/investments and ETF's

Interactive Brokers - I opened this account primarily to dabble with options and smaller cap US stocks, however it turns out I qualify as a professional (who knew!?) and can trade on margin, so I want to do a bit more through IB. 

However, when I place limit orders, they just sit there for hours. For instance, on IB I placed an order for 5000 @ 22.5 (pence) and its been sitting there for an hour. None filled.

On IB, I enter 5000 and ""quote"" and am immediately offered 22.05.

What am I missing here?"

2021-06-09 08:18:02,stocks,"Thanks - glad it's not just me! It's really annoying! 

There doesn't seem to be one broker that fulfils all my requirements. IB was recommended to me by other Redditors and whilst I like certain features, I find the charting a bit crap and slow, the interface generally very slow, this issue with execution, etc.

IG is really good expect absolutely no P&L info (are they trying to improve my mental arithmetic?), limited US small cap / OTC stuff, no options on stocks (only indices and some futures on equities).

Meh...!"
2021-06-09 10:15:01,stocks,"Yeah I have the IB Pro account for options etc and quite a lot of trading permissions enabled.

I would just love a broker that was a hybrid between IG and IB! Oh well...I can only dream."
2021-06-09 16:00:03,stocks,"I think this is as a result of the market moving too much before it filled, but the point is it would have filled if I placed the order via another broker."

I’m totally new to stocks and trading online but before I jump on a platform I’d like to get some advice on which would be best for my situation.

I’m living in the US after moving from the UK, but planning on moving back to the UK within the next 5 years.

If I start investing in an American company like robinhood, I won’t be able to transfer it to GBP(£) once I move right?

Are there any companies/apps out there that I can open up with, deposit USD($) and then keep using while I move back to the UK?"

I started late last year with my investment journey. This is my point of view of the evolution of the market in this short time (personal opinion).

1. I started reading investment books: The Little Book that Beats the Market, One up on Wall Street, Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits , The University of Berkshire Hathaway...to name a few.
2. This books have open my eyes to value investing and long term goals. So i started investing in stocks and ETFs.
3. I have learn terms P/E ratio, P/B, cash flow, ROI, ROA, ROE....you know what I mean to value stocks.
4. I have being DCA in ETF (my largest holding.
5. Recently I have come across with the movement you all know about.
6. Here I have learned new terms you´ve all have heard of. 
7. This is the only news I hear and it worries me. 

To sum up:

Its being ""the calm before the storm"" for me this last few months in my investment journey.

Lets see how it goes from here.

How is it been for you? I´m worried this hold movement can have a negative effect on the market overall. What are your thoughts"
2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Filling Gaps So I have recently started watching gaps in stocks and looking to use the gaps as indicators to buy or sell for a swing trade. 

My question is, do they always fill? Usually fill? Or rarely fill? I imagine it is different depending on the stock, curious what people think."
2021-06-09 07:04:44,stocks,They do not always fill.
2021-06-09 07:43:17,stocks,"Are you looking at gaps on the 1 minute, 5 minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly? You can find lots of gaps and not all fill."
2021-06-09 07:51:33,stocks,"There are different types of gaps. I suggest to read something on investopedia or some other source. Look at what FSLY did (daily chart) last few days.

2021-06-09 07:11:40,stocks,"And I understand that, but what's the frequency like? I've setup a watch list with a few that have gaps and plan to watch them fill regularly before timing a buy"
2021-06-09 07:58:08,stocks,"Initially I'm looking at swing trades instead of day trades to get the pattern going. My initial look is a 5d graph and seeing gaps between close and open of the day before.

But there's a potential for gamma squeeze, revolving around 6/18 calls in the $13 range, and that's a range it was comfortably trading at a couple months ago until it starting being manipulated downward by IBs. So, part of the run-up is getting back into a 'normal' trading range... and then you've got the WSB apes piling in with the gamma squeeze potential in mind. They could do worse - it's fundamentally an interesting stock that should have a bright future."

They have been claiming to be investing in 3D printing of organs since 2014 when their stock price was pushing $100 per share. They managed to print live tissue and kept it alive for a few days about 6 years ago and I haven't really heard much progress since then."

Right now they own the Mountain Pass mine which has 8% of the world's neodymium oxide reserves but they do not have the processing facilities. They currently process their ores in China and they only make  ~$3/kg in comparison to fully refined Neodymium oxide which can go upwards of $100/kg. However there are plans to finish Stage 2 processing by 2022 Q1 and Stage 3 eventually. Meanwhile it would be nice to load up on some but it won't make much in the short term until at least Stage 2 is complete but the real winner is when Stage 3 is done. Go take a look at their annual report for more information

Possible catalyst is DoD wanting to secure their supply of industrial magnets and accelerate stage 2 and 3 construction and/or banning the import of REO from China

So some people are worried, due to the scarcity of houses, that there will be a crash. The fed is doing a decent job of protecting us of this, but it’s still good to look out. With the scarcity of houses comes a higher demand, meaning more houses built. Therefore I’m curious about how this affects timber, steel, and other material companies."

2021-06-09 15:35:22,stocks,There are always WSB posts on a lot of different stocks. When I say WSB  Found it I mean more than a few users posting about it.
2021-06-09 17:55:45,stocks,"Yeah I didn't buy AMC but I did get into CLOV. I put around $700-800 so not too much but I walked away with +25% profit by the end of the dump so I'm in the green. If you don't mind me asking, why did you choose these two specifically"
2021-06-09 10:33:13,stocks,long enough to not trigger a good faith violation lol
2021-06-09 11:06:20,stocks,"yeah, i hope so! we're only an hour and a half into trading so I'm keeping my fingers crossed"
2021-06-09 14:03:09,stocks,Thanks :)
2021-06-09 19:30:12,stocks,Got ya. I appreciate the clarification. I sucked in economics class back in the day so I’m playing catch up
2021-06-09 11:10:12,stocks,Yeah I just did. Luckily I only put $35 into it. Didn’t want to risk too much
2021-06-09 17:52:09,stocks,"They are scrambling to cover their puts they already have. They are trying very hard to keep the price down so they don't lose money. If we buy and hold, they can't keep shorting the stock and they will have to pay. When that happens there will be a squeeze that pushes the value up as they sell faster and faster to cover."
2021-06-09 19:58:06,stocks,"Some ass, that’s what it was lol."
2021-06-09 15:49:27,stocks,Dude try using the goddamn search function. There was plenitud of DD posted about CLOV over the last 2 months. This isn't new.
2021-06-09 18:02:42,stocks,"Well because AMC has been one of the leading theater companies, even tho it was dwindling prior to covid, covid really took them out. However there’s been a lot of missing theaters regaining the general interest of the public. Combined with yuh know, I just thought I’d give it a try. I don’t really plan on selling even if it tanks substantially. And CLOV was just a shot in the dark and after reading more about the company itself, it’s not a too hard of a gamble. Healthcare companies specifically home companies are on the rise in popularity because of the recent past year. I do have a few other more sound small investments, that I don’t plan on selling couple with good potential for steady increase over the years. I like to think I have a good understanding of socioeconomic patterns and pretty up to date on rising popularity of the public. However the ins and outs of investing not so much at all."
2021-06-09 17:38:46,stocks,I got my first one today due to CLOV.
2021-06-09 12:44:51,stocks,Same here !!! Hope it takes off during peak volumes.
2021-06-09 15:58:12,stocks,No shit. But it wasn't a mainstream meme stock. This argument is stupid and pointless. Quit pretending you don't know what I meant.
2021-06-09 18:05:12,stocks,"Well you're making steps in the right direction! Invest small, learn the ins and outs, and don't lose too much. That's a perfect combination."
2021-06-09 16:28:46,stocks,"The argument is whether WSB found it last week or not. A simple search of the words ""CLOV"" and a little scrolling will show you 2 month old posts and 1 month old posts about CLOV with a lit of attention. You are talking out of your ass and refuse to accept you were wrong."
2021-06-09 17:57:06,stocks,"I'm not *wrong*, you're just interpreting what I said differently from how it was intended."
2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Why is no one talking about Russell reconstitution? Especially since a number of highly valued companies went public last year? Some thoughts:

- Russell allocations are based on market cap

- 9.1T is benchmarked against the Russell 3000

- A lot of companies went public the last year with fairly large valuations. Many of these companies have valuations of $8B+ (See list in PDF near bottom)

- Many of these companies will end up in the Russell 1000 given their market cap

- We can reasonably assume that some of these companies will receive ~0.02% of the fund allocation. Considering both the amount of shares that the fund needs to purchase + the benchmark funds, that could be >$1.5B worth of stock that will be purchased by the end of the month (for each company)

- This also aligns with the technical indicators for all of these companies (high growth), which are breaking out of multi-month downtrend lines one at a time

- So which companies should you be looking at? Here’s the list of preliminary additions to the Russell 3000: https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf

- Plenty of these companies have already had huge run-ups now driven by momentum trading + index front running. Some still haven’t moved yet though

TL;DR - Many companies that went public in the last year have decent-sized market caps and will be added to the Russell 1000. Over $1.5B in stock (each stock) will likely be purchased over the next 3 weeks for some of these companies.

Why isn’t this a front page news story? Passive funds will buy these stocks just to remain equal weight."
2021-06-09 07:28:45,stocks,"Are the 9T actually invested in Russel 3000 companies or what is meant by ""benchmarked against the russel 3000""?

Technically, ""benchmarked"" can mean that I just compare my returns against the Russel 3000 even tho my portfolio is completely different."
2021-06-09 06:15:31,stocks,Many stocks are already up 10-20% because of the inclusion already. Do you really think PLTR and CHPT didn't price it in yet? This is talked about every day on r/pennystocks but is less relevant for larger companies.
2021-06-09 11:24:58,stocks,"Dude you are not the only person to recognize this - I literally have had to do one of these ETF/index constitient's jamjobs for work every so often to give a range of risk-adjusted scenarios re: price uplift if certain tickers are included / excluded. Want to know the conclusion of that analysis?

The markets are pretty good at knowing who's going to be added, and it's already priced in (on a risk adjusted basis)"
2021-06-09 10:47:35,stocks,Probably because its already priced in?
2021-06-09 10:51:36,stocks,No one cares
2021-06-09 14:24:47,stocks,"[https://etfdb.com/index/russell-3000-index/](https://etfdb.com/index/russell-3000-index/)  
   
Looks like more like $13bn is actually invested in russell 3000 ETFs. And it's market cap weighted. So since the 3000 stocks have about an $800Tn combined market cap, the overall investment to tie into a newly minted $2bn stock is.... not a lot.... Looks like the 2 funds combined own about 0.001625% of each stock in the index. Not exactly a deluge of demand."
2021-06-09 14:25:35,stocks,"And the new guys are usually small so they have a smaller impact on the index.  I've followed the Dow Jones index for decades, and while it's always news when they make changes to the index and it does make some change to the index, it is smaller than you think since it is weighted."

2021-06-09 11:28:33,stocks,"I held ""Wish"" before the run-up that happened yesterday, so I'm still way ahead...But, I obviously missed out on the +30% in pre-market. That's the problem with these meme stocks. If you sell early, you might miss out on more huge days, and the chance for a company to pull an AMC/GME type of multi-bagger run, which could be life changing money for many. Oh well."

GEO has had some mentions and noticed love IV and high SI (34%). Bought stock and calls yesterday hopes of a short term vol spike if the stock catches some wind.

You can trade these meme stocks and make some money. Don’t buy options trading at irrational IV levels and following the trend can be your friend if your disciplined and take some profits."

CRSR currently trades at a P/E ratio of 20.61 and a forward P/E of around 17. CRSR has also beat earnings considerably these past few quarters. 

I've been bag holding this for awhile, and I always thought these past few months CRSR was down because of the rotation from tech stocks to COVID recovery plays, but from LOGI and HEAR's massive price jumps, that doesn't seem to be the case. Wallstreet just fucking hates CRSR for some reason."

My advice would be to think of things that you possibly see being huge in a few years. The shorter the time frame, the riskier trades are, in my opinion. Once you think of companies or industries that could boom in years to come, then you research the actual company's earnings, financials, charts, price targets, analysts, etc. I wouldn't jump into individual companies until you find out what you like. ETFs may be safer for you if you long term hold or if you aren't too sure what to buy."

They will raise the interest rate banks must pay them to carry that, so that overnight mutuals are more attractive.  That is going to push the big banks to get that money off their balance sheets, which means it enters the economy.  Right now, that $500B is not priced in in any way.

2021-06-09 16:48:55,stocks,"That second Nasdaq correction actually even started earlier than around the CPI report to boot. I've been thinking that it not correcting at all and the way TNX and reflation has been behaving is weird (because if May CPI was going to be bad, then why would we be seeing this?), but then...

- If ""they"" decide that this CPI report is a problem, the Nasdaq can just simply drop 2.5%+ tomorrow as it's not like that hasn't happened before.

- Although it started out lagging on May 11th, after about 20-30 minutes it very, very quickly flip flopped to the Dow having its worst day since February 25th.

- The way the part of the Nasdaq that has largely driven it after that mid-February to March correction really isn't behaving in an encouraging way right now even though it's leading lately. It's the same case here as well pretty much for me, why hasn't it gone yet if it's going to?

My guess, even if you don't get the revenge of memapalooza to happen in this case, is that the Dow is leading in indicating weakness this time like how it led in late January in indicating it then, and that they're all going to see a fairly large sell very soon. Not a crash, but another pullback similar to what's been seen this year.

I truly do hope I'm wrong."

I think the CPI will be the catalyst for a bad tech sell off along with a cascading meme crash, which god knows how that turns out. I’ve positioned myself accordingly (UVXY, SQQQ, and some puts on high PE tech and some meme stuff). 

It’s as much a spidey-sense thing as sophisticated analysis. I just can’t buy anything because it all seems like a house of cards right now, even though the economy itself is kicking ass. 

PS I am just referencing my “play money”, not my larger IRAs and Vanguard ETFs. I don’t think this is going to be a generational crash, but I think for options traders it’s going to be an absolute bloodbath."

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Senate passes $250 billion bipartisan tech and manufacturing bill aimed at countering China  The Senate on Tuesday passed one of the largest industrial bills in U.S. history in a bipartisan effort to ensure the U.S. remains competitive with China as one of the globe’s technological powerhouses.

The bill, which passed the chamber 68-32, commits roughly $250 billion in funding for scientific research, subsidies for chipmakers and robot makers, and an overhaul of the National Science Foundation.

The scope of the bill, the final product of at least six Senate committees and almost all members of the chamber, reflects the many fronts in the U.S.-China rivalry.

It also likely represents one of the last major bipartisan initiatives of 2021, proof that U.S. lawmakers are broadly in favor of legislation that works to counter Beijing’s economic and military expansion.

Failure to expand the nation’s semiconductor production, or reroute rare earths supply chains, advocates say, could leave the U.S. at a strategic disadvantage in the years ahead.

The largest part of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is a proposal previously known as “Endless Frontier,” written by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind.

Endless Frontier overhauls the National Science Foundation, appropriate tens of billions for the NSF between fiscal 2022 and 2026, and establish a Directorate for Technology and Innovation.

“Passing this bill— now called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act—is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation for another century of American leadership,” Schumer said from the Senate floor Tuesday evening.

“Around the globe, authoritarian governments believe that squabbling democracies like ours can’t unite around national priorities,” he added. “Well, let me tell you something: I believe that they are wrong. I believe that this legislation will enable the United States to out-innovate, out-produce, and out-compete the world in the industries of the future.”

The bill would also fund a grant program managed by the Commerce Department that would match financial incentives offered by states and local governments to chipmakers who improve upon or build new factories.

Specifically, the bill provides $52 billion to fund the semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing initiatives. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group that represents a swath of the nation’s chipmakers, was quick to applaud the Senate’s effort.

“Senate passage of USICA is a pivotal step toward strengthening U.S. semiconductor production and innovation and an indication of the strong, bipartisan support in Washington for ensuring sustained American leadership in science and technology,” said John Neuffer, CEO of the SIA. “Enactment of these investments would help strengthen America’s economy, national security, technology leadership, and global competitiveness for years to come.”

Reflecting the vote count, praise following the bill’s passage through the Senate came from both sides of the political aisle. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., specifically cheered the legislation’s clear goals and added that he would have preferred an even more pointed bill.

“As a China hawk and a fiscal hawk, I would have liked for this bill to take a more focused and aggressive approach to the China threat – but this is a strong start,” he said in a press release. “The Chinese Communist Party is working overtime on cyber, AI, and machine learning so that they can become the world’s preeminent super power. We can’t let our foot off the gas.” 

The bill’s success in the Senate also comes as the White House ramps up its own recommendations on how to secure American supply chains that run through China and counteract Beijing’s geopolitical ambitions.

President Joe Biden applauded the bill’s passage Tuesday evening, saying he was encouraged by the bipartisan effort.

“It is long past time that we invest in American workers and American innovation,” Biden said in a statement. “We are in a competition to win the 21st century, and the starting gun has gone off. As other countries continue to invest in their own research and development, we cannot risk falling behind.”

The White House announced on Friday that it will expand restrictions on American investments in certain Chinese companies with alleged ties to the country’s military and surveillance efforts, adding more firms to a growing U.S. blacklist.

Then, on Tuesday, the White House said that it will look into dramatically expanding U.S. production of lithium batteries, rare earth minerals and semiconductors.

“The USICA affirms a willingness to maintain a sustained focus on the U.S.-China strategic competition through a bipartisan and whole-of-government approach, leading into the upcoming G7 and NATO summits where it is anticipated the U.S. will be looking to work with allies to present a united front towards China,” wrote Mario Mancuso, head of the international trade and national security division of law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

While debate over several amendments prevented the Senate from passing the legislation before the Memorial Day recess, the bipartisan passion for ensuring the U.S. remains competitive is expected to support its case in the House.

The chamber is expected to consider the legislation in the coming weeks, though perhaps at a slower pace as representatives hash out various sections.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Payments processor Marqeta raises $1.23 billion in IPO. (Bloomberg) -- Marqeta Inc., an online card and payment processing company, raised $1.23 billion after pricing its initial public offering above a marketed range.

The Oakland, California-based company sold 45.5 million shares for $27 apiece on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Marqeta had marketed the shares for $20 to $24 each.

Marqeta offers physical and virtual debit, credit and prepaid cards. Its customers include a technology-enabled companies like Uber Technologies Inc., Doordash Inc. and Instacart Inc. Uber is also a backer of the company through the holding of a stock warrant.

At $27 a share, the company has a market value of $14.3 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in its filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Its diluted value, which includes options, restricted stock units and warrants, is at least $15 billion.

Founded in 2010 by PropertyBridge co-founder Jason Gardner, the company reported $108 million in revenue in the first quarter of the year, more than doubled the same period in 2020. Its net loss narrowed to $12.8 million versus $14.5 million last year.

Payments company Square Inc. is Marqeta’s largest customer, accounting for 70% of its net revenue in 2020, according to its filings.

Marqeta’s backers include 83North II, Coatue, Iconiq, Granite Ventures, and Discover Financial services, according to its filings.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, one of the lead underwriters of the offering, uses Marqeta to enable its commercial credit card customers to use their cards on digital wallets such as Apple wallet.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan are leading the share sale. Marqeta’s shares are expected to begin trading Wednesday on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MQ."
2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Tesla Deliveries Fact or Fiction I am just going to post some facts to start.

First fact is Total deliveries each quarter

Q2 2020 Deliveries 90,891
Q3 2020 Deliveries 139,593
Q4 2020 Deliveries 180,570
Q1 2021 Deliveries 184,800

Of those total deliveries 

Q2 29,690 out of China
Q3 34,154 out of China
Q4 64,551 out of China
Q1 78,780 out of China

During Q1 2021 there was no model S or X production. There were about 2,000 deliveries from their remaining inventory from the prior quarter.

So we can extrapolate from this that 106,020 cars were delivered from the US in Q1 2021 with no S and X production.

Here is speculation now but I believe it is safe to say they will atleast match this delivery number from Q1 out of the US. I don't think there would be much argument as now they have model S production and deliveries to account for in Q2 and would likely have had to adjust less for an already on going problem with part shortages affecting the auto industry since its not a new issue anymore.

Let's get back to the facts.

They have delivered 59,313 cars out of China through the first 2 months of Q2.

They delivered 43,302 through the first 2 months of Q1 out of China.

They have already delivered 16,011 more cars out of China just in the first 2 months.

Back to an assumption but if we assume equal deliveries out of the US and they deliver the exact same amount out of China the final month pf the quarter then their delivery numbers for Q2 would be 200,911.

I personally believe this number to still be low. I expect them to deliver more cars  in this final month of the quarter out of China than they did last quarter increasing the gap out of China from last quarter and I also expect them to deliver more cars out of the US than last quarter with less issues arising and having Model S production.

Some more facts which are just food for thought.

Just as recent as 2020 the electric car market in China was 5% of auto there and 2% in the US. That means that with the market being that small Tesla has been able to sell this many cars. When more of the market actually converts to electric which it will Tesla will experience exponential growth with the segment."
2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,Honest thoughts on Prospect Capital (PSEC) So I am starting to diversify more and get into more dividend and value stocks and I see that PSEC is constantly growing on average like 10-13% a month on top of having a high 7.8% dividend paid monthly. I would love to put a good chunk of my profit that I made to just accrue value and grow but before I put a good amount of money in I want to make sure it isn't a to good to be true kind of deal.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Is SRS the best way to ""short"" the housing market if I am expecting a large pullback within the next few years? Maybe it is just confirmation bias as someone who currently has their house under contract, but I feel that the current market, especially here in Florida is very unsustainable. I am planning to rent and wait the market out for a year or two, but outside of shorting the market with literal property, I am hoping to utilize some of the profit from the sale to take advantage of this seeming house of cards.

Home prices have gone up tremendously over the last few months and I am seeing plenty of people buying well above their means. I am also seeing the Facebook posts and similar advertising things such as ""do you have bad credit but rented for 6 months? You can buy a home!""

I by no means am an expert, but I have read The Big Short and so much of this seems to be familiar. Sure, they may not be called ""sub-prime"" anymore but it seems that people are being offered, and accepting, just as junky loans as they were back in 08.

With this in mind, how can a lowly retail investor best take advantage of this hunch? I have read about the inverse etfs and they seem to make the most sense. Then if the main 3 (SRS, REK, DRV) SRS looks to have the most room to pop on a potential ""collapse.""

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Hostess Twinkies ($TWNK) DD Last week I saw Hostess Twinkie ($TWNK) mentioned by someone in the daily thread. The ticker caught my eye and inspired me to do some DD into the company. Here is what I found:

* Hostess was taken public after filing and emerging for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then it has has strong revenue growth over the past 20 quarters
* The company is now highly profitable and it has weathered the pandemic well. Gross profit in the past 12 months has been $371 Million, up 39% compared to two years ago.
* Hostess is funneling much of its profits into its business for future growth. It is also rapidly growing its [market share in the Sweet Baked Goods category](https://www.hostessbrands.com/static-files/e20aeeb6-2880-4278-a362-f222573d81f6)
* The company is in the process of reinventing itself and the products it offers. They have announced plans and capital expenditures to break into the morning convenience food market.
* They have also recently expanded their leadership team and appointed [this absolute stud](https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2021/05/28/hostess-chief-growth-officer-dan-oleary.html) as their new Chief Growth Officer.
* Altogether this puts TWNK is in the much-coveted position of being both a value (think Warren buffett) and growth (thing Bill hwang) type stock. At the moment, there is no dividend as the company is reinvesting cash into its business for future growth, but there are plans for future stock buybacks in 2022 and beyond.
* ANALysts love the stock. The consensus from analysts is Very Bullish (out of the 11 analysts that have covered the stock, 2 TWNK is a strong buy, 6 say its a buy, and 3 say its a hold.

*Now let’s talk shorts*

* Short interest is 20.77% of the float That’s higher than most meme tickers here (comparable to AMC GME, much higher than BB, WEN, etc). Furthermore, short interest has [increased 44%](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TWNK/short-interest/) since the start of January are we’re starting to see a number of pops this spring from [failed to deliver shares](https://sec.report/fails.php?tc=TWNK).
* The stock has very low volume right now (only an average of 1.2M shares traded per day). If a squeeze were to happen, at the current volume it would take shorts a month to cover.
* Additionally, 123.67% of all the float is held by institutions, and very little by retail meaning that any significant volume will send the stock flying.
* If TWNK turns into a crusade against shorty, I could see us squeezing to $69. *Right the stock is only at a 2B market cap so there’s plenty of room to grow*

So this is a brand that sells, let's be frank: Total garbage. And that's fine, there's money to be made there, but their plan going forward is to expand their market in garbage food to younger consumers, breakfast, single-serve, and playing with their existing product's flavors. Problem is per their own data they're already extremely strong in these segments, so any new offerings will compete primarily with *themselves*.      

Look at page 17: They should be expanding sideways into Better-for-you and Savory since that's 68% of the market. That's actually expanding for the future, rather than just keeping on doubling down on what you already do well, while competitors get free rein in the majority of the market.   

Then you tack on the fact they're 40 P/E, and that the Q1 big bump in junk food they're so proud of is the quarter during COVID restrictions and a stressful political season. That strikes me as a cyclical bump, and you're going to be left bag holding if consumers move back to Better-for-you once they want to look attractive again and the stock takes a big hit (from, again, 40 P/E).     

So that's a strong ""pass"" from me as an actual investment. The fact the whole last section is talking about meme-ing this really says what you need to know, get in for meme get out for investment."

Of course, the relative valuation changes with growth prospects. Depending on those prospects, you'll typically see an 8x-16x cash flow multiple. Compare trailing with forward to find a variance and standard deviation. 

Free cash flow yield is also a great measurement tool for relative valuation.

My critique is that per page 17 of their presentation 68% of the market they literally aren't *trying* to compete in now or going forward. That's a lot of money left on the table. Why aren't they? There's clearly some non-overlapping segmentation there per their own data.   

They need a better *growth* story is my point."

2021-06-09 00:35:54,stocks,That's not at all what that means.  That means that out of 100 people 74 people selected sweet and of those same 100 people 69 of them selected better for you.  It wasn't a poll where you could only select 1 option otherwise the percentages would add up to 100. I mean the title of the page pretty much said all it needed to.  People like eating junk food and as people diversify their eating habits they tend to always come back to their junk food.  So as a percentage of people buy both more than likely the healthier food is going to sit on the shelf longer.

Is there any way to profit off the rates going up as a result of inflation and the Fed needing to raise them?

IMessage is getting a boost as well, with new features that make it easier to share web links, photos, Apple Music tracks and Apple News articles with your contacts.

In short, Apple is laying the groundwork for a suite of social features designed to let you do a lot of what you would normally do on Instagram and Facebook, only with more emphasis on privacy.

2021-06-09 00:27:22,stocks,"I was going to make a joke about that apple market cap is to big to take a big jump if it would take facebook market cap is almost one trillion, that's a lot of money for facebook"
2021-06-09 07:59:07,stocks,"- These features are hardware locked (web versions of FaceTime are ""receive only"") and require Apple hardware to properly use

- These new features are inferior to Facebook's ""WhatsApp"" product which has had these features for half a decade or longer. WhatsApp web can do more today than Apple's web product will be able to do tomorrow and next year and probably the year after that. 

- Facebook is built on data and connections, Apple is built on hardware and isolation. 

Apple will never challenge Facebook for the same reason why Apple will never compete with Google in Search.

People use Facebook for the connections. To be connected to something larger than their Contact Book. The average Facebook user does not want a Social Network inside of their Instant Message app. They want to follow Meme pages and share it around and see globalized personalized content. 

It's not in Apple's DNA to compete in this space. Apple would have to give up on Privacy to compete with Facebook. The Facebook product is inherently unprivate. Little gimmicks like pinning notes in an instant message app change literally nothing.

If they want to invent the next ""Google Circles"" or whatever the next failed social network is, good luck, but Apple's special sauce is far from this arena.

From a stock perspective, I would be very worried as a AAPL owner to see them try to take Facebook on in social. They will fail."

2021-06-09 05:30:03,stocks,"Yup. After years of Facebook users using the same services, with ingrained habits, I’m sure these new bleeding edge capabilities will lead them to uproot the workflow for everyone involved in that video chat they had planned.

“Wait, here, let me find the link for a completely different service.”

“Wait, let’s try this whole FaceTime functionality…you do run iOS, right? As far as I remember you had an iPhone…no? Oh, well go to the Play store and let’s spent the next 10 minutes getting you set up with an account for a platform you don’t even use.”

“Hey Grandma, I know you’re just getting used to Zoom, but I hear FaceTime has all these new features.”

>	They will also be able to use a new feature called SharePlay, which lets you hold a FaceTime call and watch a streaming movie, listen to music, or share your screen with your contacts. 

So, not revolutionary in the least, all catch-up to where other services have been for years.

Look, I’m typing this on an iOS device. I hold AAPL. I think they build good products with a solid OS, and they continue to trample Android like they have for years. But this is literally like seeing that the new version of iOS has new emojis for something or other — which might actually literally be more welcome news than “we’re trying to compete in the video collaboration space, right as the dust of COVID is settling!”"

The primary product of Facebook and instagram is the social feed and social wall. iOS15 provides none of that.

The secondary product of Facebook and Instagram (lately) is video stories and reels, which is still just the social feed and wall. Apple has provided none of that as well. Or options for creating or sharing public groups.

I can see this as them going after WhatsApp or maybe Facebook Messenger, but I don't see anyone going ""Oh iOS15 is out, I can delete Facebook now!"" if they weren't doing it before."

Shelf life is almost 100% dictated by how long before they fully monetize and and ads overtake mindless consumption of a dedicated core of users.

Instagram’s curated aspirational social performance has staying power because you’ll never want to delete a photo that was the highlight of a $3,000 vacation or a $700 concert.

Ads neatly fit in as people also drift away from posting their actual life and focus in on a singular topic which they’d like to be known for. 

Stories allow glimpses into the “artists” life but it disappears and doesn’t ruin the aesthetic of a page.

Nothing Apple is introducing will fuck with IG.

Snapchat I believed had staying power because sometimes we want to communicate without the baggage of a lifelong record.

Apple is looking to bring that functionality into iMessage. Which I can’t wait for… especially if you can split a contact into two types of communication somehow. 

I think millions of people are afraid to even sext their husbands and wives because our devices are too linked. A photo of your tits could be simultaneously seen on a TV, a watch, a desktop, a tablet… even in a house without kids that’s just too much digital scrubbing to worry about and make sexy. 

Of course beyond sexting it would be nice to be free from permanent records, but not all the time…

I don’t think it’s useful either to have your only permanent records to be “I love you” and things that need to be remembered like a grocery list.

The other platform that to me makes the most sense for cannibalization is YouTube.

Apple has been the defacto standard for curated paid artists since iTunes. 

YouTube is becoming less and less the place to store a video of your co-worker doing some dumb shit and everyone in your circle and 30k strangers find hilarious. 

Instead it’s professional content producers who provide niche service and information.

Whether it be FloatPlane, Patreon, or Onlyfans people are wanting to cut through bullshit and get that high-grade content, reward creators, and never hear another ad.

Enter Apple. 

They already provide the tools to create and  edit content. Why not provide the infrastructure of AppleTV and change the nature of Apple’s foray into streaming.

I was thinking, even something as simple as the fact that rather than always having to stream every single thing. A creator could make their videos available for download and the consumer now has a video file that’s actually usable, editable, offline, and works in the entire ecosystem of Apple hardware and software. 

For things like Recipes… that would be a game changer."

We need regulation to protect our society from itself. Increased polarization and the empowerment of fringe groups/interests are effects of more powerful targeting and the effectiveness of social networks.

I don’t like Zuck or Bezos as people. They are probably as sociopathic as we think they are. But they are allowed to exist and hurt our society because our lawmakers are slow to react to the pace and ruthless efficiency of innovation.

I’d support a pro-privacy law that prevents hyper-targeted advertising, or legislation for a federal minimum wage. We can’t expect thoughtless, emotionless corporate machines to do anything but take advantage of our regulatory climate. It’s naive to expect anything different."

Also nah, people DONT want ""to get high grade content"" by paying for it. People want quality content for free with the option to support creators without the creator seeming like they are begging for it as well as creators to be allowed to create what THEY WANT to create not what advertisers deem acceptable to make.

some brokers will allow you to specify an 'all or none' (AON) order then all would have to be sold at the same time at the price you specify.

unless the normal volume of the stock was a few hundred for the day putting up 10k at once is not going to matter for anything."
2021-06-08 23:35:54,stocks,"10k is not that large of a transaction.

But, if you placed a limit order it could be filled by several market orders of various sizes, or partially filled and then someone could better your asking price and move the market away from you. But it might move back and fill before you could alter or cancel the remaining offer.

If you placed a market order it would fill at the best bid, and if that didn't cause enough shares to trade it would fill some more at the next-best bid, and so on until you had pushed the bid back and all your shares were gone. If the book was thin you might find some of your shares sold for almost nothing, though.

If you can't see the depth of the book or you can see your trade risking a disastrous ending, always use a limit order, whether it's 10k shares or 10 shares. If your trade is smaller than the size of the best quote and the quotes behind that are at reasonable prices, a market order is less risk than a limit order that sees the price run the other way and fails to fill at all."

The cells of a chicken are being incubated and fed nutrients just like a real bird. But the animal they get the original cells from doesn't even have to die. There are no slaughterhouses filled with disease. There is less deforestation (we grow a massive amount of food to feed livestock). Per oz we can grow it faster than the animal itself. I understand having reservations, and nothing is perfect right away. But if flesh is flesh, what's the difference if the molecular makeup is literally the same? Eggs are already sorted and injected with antibiotics by a machine. It's already a big gross factory. So I'll take the lab."

That's the group you would target first, then once the process is refined, it could be cheaper than real meat, (whereas real meat is only going to become more expensive, perhaps even a luxury product in the next 50+ years) with a much smaller environmental impact. There's a lot to like behind the idea if they can pull off creating molecularly identical lab grown meat."

The problem is that for too long people have been removed from production of their food and take it for granted. That raises the risk for not only food borne illnesses but puts the control in fewer hands.  With everything available at our fingertips, consumers forget (and many don’t care) where the products they buy come from….until there is a problem.  

Sure, we eat meat and the poultry we raise is done so on pasture, encouraged to live like a chicken/turkey (scratch in the dirt, eat bugs, take dust baths, etc. ) and when it’s time for freezer camp, dispatched quickly.  It’s more expensive this way, but I prefer not to participate in mass-market farming."

First, their down about 15% from ath, they trade at a P/E of 10.5 yet their revenues and profit continue to consistently grow, they trade at a price to free cash flow of around 7, their aggressively buying back shares, and have a dividend yield of 2.55%, this is looking extremely undervalued and a fucking steal but when something looks this good I have to question why. Also, their at a 36 billion dollar market cap so it's not like their some giant that can't grow anymore.

Now for their actual business I understand their in the space of printers, computers, and stuff like that therefore I understand there was a large spike this year and the growth may not be sustainable for the next year but it doesn't mean that it should be at this low of a valuation.

It has been a comedy of errors since Carley. 

More over, the list of tech they had in development and failed to execute on is stunning. They were once major leaders in 3D printing, fuel cells and other emerging tech decades ago out of  HP Labs and all of that was squandered by incompetent leadership.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"How to think about analyzing investor demographics for a particular stock? First time posting here, and I don't have a finance background, so apologies if I do something wrong/stupid.

I've recently become fascinated by some core philosophical and psychological ideas around the concept of ""Morality"". Specifically, the idea that people reason, feel, and act about morality differently - but predictably so. A very simple example of this would be how partisan US citizens think about whether the Democrats or Republicans have majority control of the US House of Reps - Democrats think it's ""good"" for Democrats to control it and bad for Republicans to control it. Republicans feel the exact opposite. More importantly though, in this specific case the ""good/bad"" dichotomy correlates to intense feelings of *positive excitement* & optimism for one group, and *negative fear* & despair in another.

This is a huge oversimplification, but I hope it's adequate to get the gist across which is that *people all think about what is good & bad differently, but how they feel about what they determine to be good or bad is very consistent.*

Now - to think about this from the lens of investing, and specifically investing in stocks.

Strong emotions influence our behavior, and I would imagine that certain events - even those that don't have a strong direct tie to someone's stock investment - would influence how people behave about their investments. Meaning I would bet that if someone were able to analyze the average Democrat's investing habits under Joe Biden vs. under Trump, I would expect to see more optimism & risk under their preferred candidate (Joe), and more fear & risk aversion under the other candidate.

I would also think there are stocks in which the group of investors in said stock is so homogenous (e.g. all Democrats), that you could make accurate predictions of how that group thinks and feels about morality, and consequently how they would feel about \_x\_ happening.

I've used the word ""morality"" a couple times, and don't want to get too hung up on it because it's not really important to the post. **I guess I'm curious if there are any schools of investing thought** that explore this idea? Specifically, **that** **look at demographic (and other) data of investor pools in specific assets to predict how its investors will respond to news and consequently to predict movement of the asset itself?**

I understand that investors tend to move somewhat real time with market events, so you still need the ability to predict an event in advance, but **I'm very curious about the study of investor demographics within a specific asset, and how that influences one's investment in such.**

If that doesn't make sense please let me know - happy to clarify and/or edit."
2021-06-08 20:13:26,stocks,"Interesting question but you kinda can't analyze investor demographics. You trade through robinhood or fidelity or td etc. But that brokerage I hope wouldn't know your political prefrance or where you live hopefully, the only thing a brokerage would know about you is what account type you selected and maybe what state you live in. Also most investors are institutional. Retail makes up a small small portion of the market so trying to predict moves solely on this wouldn't be super reliable in my opinion."
2021-06-08 21:00:15,stocks,"Appreciate the response! Makes sense.

Since the majority of shares belong to institutions, it follows that there might be a methodology behind studying an institution instead of an individual? Anything like that exist?

Maybe this is better in a different sub, but lastly - any idea if this would be more relevant in other asset classes, maybe those with a higher degree of visibility into ownership?

Overall I don't think this would be an effective strategy.

2021-06-08 21:31:03,stocks,How can it be making money? The current price for a share of FRX is $10.69. It has a long way to go to get over $15. And what do you mean the .83 is the option contract price? That’s not very much money at all. So he paid .83 for this option contract?
2021-06-08 21:12:08,stocks,Why would the premium go up? Is this some special option? I thought if the stock went up to $16 then he would make $0.40 for each. If it went to $200 then he would be super rich and would definitely exercise it. What am I missing?
2021-06-08 21:53:34,stocks,"When you say 100% of equity. 

You will make money if the stock goes up past the strike price at any time during the option period. 
You will lose money if the stock doesn’t move at all during the option period. 
You will lose money if the stock only goes down during the option period. 
The amount you lose is the cost of the option not the cost of the stock.  
The price listed relates to one share of stock.  So $0.83 is the option cost of one share.  But options are only sold based on 100 shares. So for 100 shares that would be an investment of $83.00 for the right to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price during the option period.  You do not “have” to but the stock!  Your risk is limited to the cost of the options purchased in this case."
2021-06-08 21:31:15,stocks,Why?

2021-06-08 21:56:23,stocks,It says his Avg cost is 0.60 and they are currently going for 0.83 which is the the price in between the ask of 0.85 and the bid of 0.80
2021-06-08 22:21:47,stocks,"Every options contract is for a ""lot"" of 100 shares, so when the price of a call contract says "".83"", it really means $83. You pay .83 for each of the 100 shares bundled into the contract. A call contract gives you the right, but not the obligation, to purchase 100 shares at a specified strike price by the expiration date.

Yes it has a ways to go until $15, but it sounds like you also have some time left on the contracts. That time (and the chance of the stock going up) is worth something.

If the contract is not near $15 near expiry, you will notice the value of the contract falling off more and more rapidly once the expiry date approaches. This is called theta decay, theta represents the time left on the contract. However, if the stock price becomes volatile and jumps significantly at any point, this will increase the implied volatility and generally increase the price of the contract. (Because the stock has demonstrated it can make large moves very quickly.)

If the contracts are held until expiration and the stock price is not above $15 on expiry day, they will become **worthless...** But any somewhat significant jumps in price in the near future (sounds like it had one today) will likely net some decent gains if there is still plenty of time on the contract.

There are some situations where an increase in stock price **will not** increase the price of the call contract. This is generally caused by ""IV(implied volatility) Crush"", meaning although the stock price has increased, it has not increased enough to imply that is has enough volatility to reach it's strike price by expiration. Options contracts have many variables (AKA: ""The Greeks"") that interact with each other and determine their pricing. 

I know investors that have been in the game for 20+ years that have never touched options. It is definitely a bit complicated with elevated risk **and** reward potential.

Pretty sure the only people truly qualified to tell you about options and how the greeks really work are people that went to school for quantitative analysis. Outside of that, you really have to get a little skin in the game and do a lot of research for yourself to get an intuition for it.

2021-06-08 22:33:12,stocks,"All these basics are laid out in the link above. But here: first things first - call options are a wager that on a certain date a stock’s share will be higher than it currently is. In this case, the wager is that FRX, on October 15th, will be higher than $17.50 and $15, respectively. You want this to be true because the call option contract says you have agreed to buy 100 shares of FRX on that date, at those prices. If the shares are $20 on that date, you get them at a bargain price and can sell immediately for profit. If the price isn’t above $15 or $17.50 (the “strike price”) then no shares trade hands, but you are out the cost of the contracts. 

Cost of contracts: The average cost of your contracts are .42 on the 17.5 strike, and .60 cents on the 15 strike. This is a price per share and contracts are lots of 100. He bought 13 contracts at .42 per share. .42x100x13 = $546 and 5 contracts at .60 .60x100x5 = $300. So he paid $846 and will lose that money if the price stays low (and he keeps those contracts until 10/15 - which I’ll talk about next). 

So, you can see that his cost .42 and .60 have moved up to a current price (current value) of .65 and .83 cents. This is because the stock moved up today, and people thought “maybe the stock will move high by October”, so people were willing to pay more today for those contracts than he did yesterday. That’s how he’s made money already. 

These contracts are tradable just like stocks. As the stock price moves up and it looks like the contracts might make money, their value rises as well. Most people don’t hold these contracts through expiration. They wait for their value to move up and the sell them to the next person willing to make the same wager.

But let’s say he does hold and the price does go up. Let’s say it does hit $20 at the end of day 10/15. Using the 5 contracts at $15 strike means he buys (5x100) 500 shares at a total of $7500 when the real value of the shares is $10,000, making a $2500 profit on a $300 wager (.60 price per share call option contract)."
2021-06-08 21:48:47,stocks,"An options premium is determined by its intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic is the amount you would make if you exercised the option and sold the shares at the market rate, while extrinsic is basically how likely the stock price will be above the share price based on time to expiration and the volatility. As the share price rises the likelihood of being above the strike price at expiration increases so the extrinsic value increases, making you some money. 

If the price went to $200 you still wouldn't want to exercise because even though at this price you would have a large intrinsic value, if it isn't at expiration then the option still has extrinsic value. Exercising would net you less than if you sold the contract back because you would forfeit the extrinsic value."
2021-06-08 21:35:55,stocks,It went up 5% today and they are changing ticker from FRX to BODY.There is usually an uptick in the days following a change from SPAC ticker to the new trading ticker. As more institutional investors move in. The merger should complete on 6/24.
2021-06-08 22:10:20,stocks,So he is up 0.23 per contract and he owns  5 contracts? He made a buck and a quarter?
2021-06-08 22:50:08,stocks,Got it!  That makes a lot more sense. Thank you!
2021-06-08 21:54:43,stocks,"I thank you for answering, but it still makes no sense. If the stock hit $200 a share then he will make $185 per stock. He has like 5 options right? That’s 500 shares. 500 x 185 is $92,500. That’s a crap ton of money. How can $0.83 contract make it past $92,500?"
2021-06-08 21:38:27,stocks,He needs it to hit $15 plus the premium price to make money. How can he make money when the stock is trading at 10.60 right now? He is actually in the hole.
2021-06-08 22:12:14,stocks,So far he has an unrealized gain of $115 on that set of contracts
2021-06-08 21:59:35,stocks,Are you sure you aren't the adult child lol...
2021-06-08 22:10:13,stocks,Because the calls have a .83 premium NOW but if the stock price were to go to $200 the premium would be around 187.00. I'm not doing the exact math for you but if there is time left before expiration the premium will ALWAYS be more than the amount you can make by exercising due to the value added by the time/volatility.
2021-06-08 21:53:31,stocks,The expiration date is 10/15… it has 4 months to hit that price plus premium.
2021-06-08 22:20:23,stocks,How is this amount determined?
2021-06-08 22:08:23,stocks,"Nope, lol. This is why I don’t do options. I sorta get them, and then there is a whole other level where it seems like it’s some scam. 

I guess his kid read some stuff on Reddit and his kids buddy told him to buy the options."
2021-06-08 22:14:54,stocks,"Why would the premium increase? I thought the premium was the set money you paid to have exclusive rights to exercising the option. Sort of like an ante in poker. You ante up to get cards dealt. If you don’t want to lose anything more, you fold and just lose your ante. But the ante doest go up mid deal. But here with options they do?"
2021-06-08 22:25:25,stocks,"On this option he paid 0.60 which on an option means $60 right now the mid price between the ask of 0.85 or $85 and the bid of 0.80 or $80 is 0.83 meaning $83. Since he paid $60 apiece and the midpoint price is $83 right now, that’s means a gain of $23 apiece. So $23x5=$115"
2021-06-08 22:23:47,stocks,"A stock is worth $1. I think it will go to $10 by January 2022. You own 100 shares and don't think it will go that high. I say I'll pay you 10 cents per share right now if you agree to sell them to me if they're over $10 by January 2022. You agree.

I pay you $10 for the contract.

Fast forward 1 month. The share price is now $9.

Now, the odds of the share hitting $10 is extremely more likely than it was when I bought the contract. So what I do is sell the contract to someone else, who will pay significantly more for the contract because the odds of it hitting $10 is more likely."
2021-06-08 22:34:54,stocks,"That analogy is true AT EXPIRATION where the contract either is profitable or worthless, but along the way the premium of SIMILAR contracts are changing. The ante doesnt go up for YOU because you already ante'd up, but if anyone wanted to make the same bet as you they'd have to pay more. This is like putting down $5 to play then you get a good hand and show it to your friend who says ""I'll pay $10 if you let me play your hand."" So you sell him your right to play for more than you bought in. I hope this helps a bit."
2021-06-08 22:28:32,stocks,Aha. That’s it. So there are people right now bidding for this contract? They want it for .83?
2021-06-08 22:47:47,stocks,"So technically, he is locked in at .60 for the premium. You said he would never exercise it since the premium would go up. That’s just for other people. There must be some math where a person can see if selling the contract is better than exercising the options or vice versa. If there is never a point to exercise the options then how does the last person make money (if it did go up)? Eventually, the contract expires a s no one will buy it. And if it is in the money then it would be exercised, right?"
2021-06-08 22:32:32,stocks,That’s the difference between the ask of 0.85 and the bid of 0.80 so if he were to put in a sell order at 0.83 he would likely get that. Options however have a thing called time decay since they can expire at a set date and if the price doesn’t go up from there they will lose some value day by day or even go down in value if the stock price does
2021-06-08 23:00:42,stocks,"Exactly you can only lose what you paid if you hold till expiration and it lands out of the money, you can always sell for a controlled loss if the stock price falls and the premium or value of the option goes down.

 Options which are in the money will automatically be exercised by the broker after expiration. The person who buys it last and has it at expiration will either exercise if its profitable or the contract will expire worthless and be removed from your portfolio. 

He should never exercise it before expiration because he would make more by selling the option to someone else because the time remaining adds value to the contract."
2021-06-08 23:01:59,stocks,But the options contract has to have someone to buy it? It’s not like stocks where you just hit trade and you sell for market. Someone actually has to put out a request for it?
2021-06-08 23:06:13,stocks,Who do you think buys the stock when you sell it? Another trader who inputted a buy signal for the price you inputted your sell signal for. It's not going to some pool of unowned shares in the cloud or something.
2021-06-08 23:18:13,stocks,"But there seems to always be a market for shares, just maybe not at a price you want. What I mean is, let’s say this FRX stock hits $13 on 10/14. If I had 1800 shares of it, I could just hit sell and be done with them. But with the 18 options he has, there might not be anyone asking for the contracts any longer, right? And no one wants 1800 shares to exercise for a loss."
2021-06-08 23:21:27,stocks,">But with the 18 options he has, there might not be anyone asking for the contracts any longer, right?

Just the same as there could not be a market for shares if they were worth nothing. 

>And no one wants 1800 shares to exercise for a loss.

No. That's where intresnic and extrensic value comes in.

2021-06-09 07:32:08,stocks,Reddit has a ticker?
2021-06-09 07:57:01,stocks,"Fastly, Akamai, Cloudflare .. all these companies do similar things and if one of them goes down.. a third of the internet goes with them."
2021-06-09 08:02:29,stocks,It just showed how important they are and are a major player now.
2021-06-09 08:03:01,stocks,"This seems like simply a combination of automated trading algorithms tracking media and social media mentions, plus name recognition making people aware of the company."
2021-06-09 08:06:36,stocks,I mean they fixed it pretty qyick
2021-06-09 08:13:56,stocks,Citadel securities upped their stake in fastly
2021-06-09 08:31:55,stocks,"I was looking for the dip also, and did not expect the bump up.  

Fastly did identify and resolve  the problem rapidly and there web site communications were prompt and clear .

This name is still on my buy list when a good entry presents itself."
2021-06-09 08:39:20,stocks,Nobody is surprised that a CDN has an outage sometimes. That's just what happens when you work with so much interconnected technology.
2021-06-09 09:06:09,stocks,What's the moat of fastly? All the major cloud platform provides have same products as fastly.
2021-06-09 09:31:36,stocks,I figured the same. People had no idea it existed and now realize the whole commercial internet seems to be dependent on it in varying degrees. How can a business have that much power? Scary.
2021-06-09 09:58:26,stocks,Isn't it because Ciitadel bought a lot of their stock? I might be wrong though.
2021-06-09 10:12:24,stocks,"A company that’s valued at 6bn is so critical it can crash some of the most trafficked sites on the internet? Maybe that valuation is a smidge conservative? Also, this is the first time they have had this type of outage AND it was resolved quickly and with transparency. Things break. It happens. It’s the company’s response that really matters."
2021-06-09 10:25:07,stocks,So this is just an opinion but their time of recovery is somewhat impressive. To identify the issue and being able to remediate it in a timely fashion is pretty huge
2021-06-09 10:51:04,stocks,I don't know how to feel about that
2021-06-09 11:13:16,stocks,I was surprised because last time I checked their earnings I saw they only have a few hundred customers (albeit big ones) and growing this number very slowly. It sounds like it's not so much about Fastly but about some of the big cloud players using Fastly.
2021-06-09 11:25:20,stocks,"After an outage the companies focus usually changes a bit to improving their infrastructure to avoid outages like this again. Depending on how the company handles their communication and their response to this outage, if it’s a positive response I’d definitely consider using their services"
2021-06-09 11:36:11,stocks,"I think a good indicator is also how quickly they responded to the problem and solved it
Amazon, Google etc All had downtimes it's kind of fisiological in the industry, quality is measured in how you react to it"
2021-06-09 11:55:01,stocks,people actually heard of them
2021-06-09 12:46:24,stocks,"The past few months, I’ve seen great earning rpt and stock down and bad earnings, stock up!  To me and my opinion, is it’s just a sign of how corrupt and mismanaged the market is and will be, until we force change."
2021-06-09 12:47:48,stocks,Just your quarterly reminder that FSLY is not enterprise ready.
2021-06-09 13:12:16,stocks,"Isn't there a certain ""entity"" that owns a decent amount of FSLY that need a lot of money quickly and like to manipulate stocks how they want? Hmmmmm"
2021-06-09 18:03:26,stocks,I remember the same thing happend to cloudflare last summer. I guess when something like this happens people realize what these companies does
2021-06-09 18:19:11,stocks,aapl announced they will be using their services along with cloudflare amd akami for a new feature
2021-06-08 20:18:38,stocks,"Why is fastly riding


Cause this fucking guy is in charge https://youtu.be/H7PJ1oeEyGg



FUCK SHARDING!"

2021-06-09 02:38:23,stocks,Citadel securities recently more than doubled their position in Fastly. They might have made a deal...
2021-06-08 22:13:13,stocks,Looking at the chart for the last year this company has had some WIDE swings and might be on the way up atm. Seems something to grab your gains on though rather than hold.
2021-06-09 03:36:19,stocks,"There are many possibilities why the stock went up instead of down. No one has the right answer, because he would need to know the real reason for each investor who bought or sold the stock today. We can only make an educated guess."
2021-06-09 08:29:37,stocks,Total manipulation
2021-06-09 10:12:36,stocks,Could it have been an insider move to buy a lot of stock without pushing up the price too much?
2021-06-08 21:42:04,stocks,Stonks 📈
2021-06-08 23:04:28,stocks,This. And everybody realizing how much control this one company has over the consumer network traffic.

2021-06-08 23:32:06,stocks,"I’ve heard of them before. They were the same company that was going to buy TikTok and then Trump “banned” TikTok. FSLY went from about $120 to $70 in a day. Over the next 2 months it went back up to $130 and 2 weeks later it was back to $60 again… 


The wild ride continues for them

2 months later it was back over $100, then another crash to $80, then back to $120 in Feb and another massive crash back to $60 a month later. Little run back up to $70, crash back down to $40 and now this little run up to $55. 

[1 year and 2 years graphs](https://imgur.com/a/YnX18Lz/). Wouldn’t be surprised if there was some funky shit going on with their books."

2021-06-09 05:49:20,stocks,Cloudflare went up to. People are realizing how important edge providers are.
2021-06-09 08:24:54,stocks,"Marketing guy here… unethical but makes sense.  If they have NDAs in place with their customers wherein they cannot advertise or use their customer’s names for commercialization purposes, an event like this brings on the investigative journalism and so the press did what Fastly cannot."
2021-06-08 22:37:10,stocks,">I was being somewhat clever

That is a big mistake in this market."
2021-06-08 22:28:44,stocks,"Maybe it went up because it drew attention to an otherwise less well known company. If people, like you, got their first glimpse at just how many companies make use of their servers/networks perhaps they were intrigued and like the business model. Maybe not. Maybe stonks📈"
2021-06-09 00:02:17,stocks,"""what surprised me today was just how many companies make use of their servers/network.""

That's what popped the stock.  The story had always been that Tik-Tok was their biggest customer and if that falls through FSLY is toast.  Now it turns out that they have alot of customers that are big - even if they aren't necessarily big customers.

EDIT: also my brokerage shows the current short interest at 19%."
2021-06-08 22:07:25,stocks,As soon as you think youve got it all figured out..
2021-06-09 02:21:44,stocks,"If the last year or so has taught us anything, it's that the market is pretty much totally divorced from reality at this point."
2021-06-09 00:10:37,stocks,"Ask around on related subreddits if you have questions. Most folk on programming related subreddits would tell you that Fastly is one of the best CDNs (Fastly, Cloudflare, and Amazon CloudFront) out there."
2021-06-09 01:22:55,stocks,"I think the realization of how widely adopted it is prompted upward movement, I think before today didn’t grasp their reach."
2021-06-09 00:59:14,stocks,I went down this rabbit hole recently with tier 2 internet providers. I’m just glad I made it out alive
2021-06-09 02:14:52,stocks,"I was trying to grab some shares too. Hopefully,  I will be able to get in tomorrow.  Get a hundred shares."
2021-06-08 23:53:57,stocks,Another theory I only barely consider - because that was the obvious reaction (that it would drop because of the outage) it was driven up to stop hunt retail shorts/puts
2021-06-09 08:13:46,stocks,Citadel owns fastly and has shown that they can manipulate stock prices for their own gain. The outage went out as all “meme” stocks ripped to attempt to put fear into everyone. Call it a coincidence if you want but I’ve seen way too many of them this year to think that it is.
2021-06-08 23:04:03,stocks,"I had similar thoughts.  If you're Amazon, maybe your partner with Fastly because they can push your content closer to users in some geographic areas.  I'll buy that.  I was working, so I didn't experience the outage, but it's being made to seem like the site was completely unreachable.  Shouldn't it have been down for some groups of users, but not all?"
2021-06-08 23:05:55,stocks,This is what I want to know.
2021-06-09 05:10:47,stocks,"Amazon's CDN is better suited to streaming large data, like video. Whereas Fastly is blazing fast for your normal website and it's images. They might be a competitor but they recognize just how good fastly is. 

During the outage Amazon did fallback to CloudFront and were fine. Until Amazon build  their own fastly I don't see why they wouldn't use it."
2021-06-08 22:40:22,stocks,"Akamai and Cloudflare are also up, I'm guessing that this had a similar effect on publicly traded CDNs, in general."
2021-06-08 22:37:20,stocks,Yep. Plus they were all over thee news
2021-06-08 20:33:22,stocks,This
2021-06-08 22:45:29,stocks,"Exactly, hedge funds who had been pounding this stock into oblivion just realized that was probably the wrong company to pick on."
2021-06-08 21:41:38,stocks,"mind = blown

This could actually be true. Some Warren Buffet level shit right there."
2021-06-09 00:08:37,stocks,Their business that's so great it doesn't make any money?
2021-06-08 22:22:32,stocks,We'll have to wait and see whether Prosus now breaks stackoverflow for good in a rent-seeky cash grab.
2021-06-09 01:43:06,stocks,"Honestly, keeping a text backup of Stack Overflow wouldn’t be a terrible idea, just in case. It’d be a few gigs max and you wouldn’t need to update it very often since all the common questions are years old at this point."
2021-06-08 22:46:29,stocks,This is why I think it was up today.  The outage revealed major customers that may not have been widely publicized due to the competitive nature of this business.
2021-06-09 02:46:24,stocks,Same logic as PLTR
2021-06-09 04:22:15,stocks,I think leaving of key appointment holder added to the drop.
2021-06-09 11:48:50,stocks,"Buy the rumor, sell the news."
2021-06-08 21:44:17,stocks,Decided to go in on LEAPs when they were 40 something and my investments in them from last year were -50% or so.
2021-06-08 21:20:14,stocks,What’s a fundamental?
2021-06-09 00:33:27,stocks,"Yeah I’m down about 35% on this one, but I’m hopeful it’ll recover by year’s end."
2021-06-09 14:39:51,stocks,"I got in at $45 last year and was playing call options every time they plumetted down to the 80's and 90's last fall/winter. After NIO, Fastly was my biggest money maker. Then all that just went to shit from February onward. I'm still holding because I think they're a good investment, but damn, these last few months have been terrible for my brokerage account. At least my 401k and IRA have been steadily going up all this year."
2021-06-09 01:02:18,stocks,We need to WSB this lolol
2021-06-08 21:18:15,stocks,"You might even say they handled it fastly.

(I'll see myself out now.)"
2021-06-08 22:15:06,stocks,I was actually confused at first about expecting it to drop because to me all this demonstrates how widely Fastly is used in the infrastructure of major online companies
2021-06-09 02:41:23,stocks,No they didn’t.
2021-06-09 06:53:17,stocks,"The hedge funds certainly have dirty tactics at play but even this one made me roll my eyes. 

Tin foil hats everyone."
2021-06-08 20:32:13,stocks,"Exactly, outages are a fact of life and if your an internet based company, you expect to have to deal with them from time to time"
2021-06-09 04:06:13,stocks,"Shit always happens, even with the biggest. My company works on Azure (= MS cloud) and we had absolutely NO service (internet, e-mail etc.) for two days, because of a failure in a cluster in Texas."
2021-06-08 22:15:54,stocks,"Then again, if everyone is using it and they're still overvalued, where is the growth supposed to come from?"
2021-06-09 08:37:31,stocks,It shows you don't have a redundant backup to keep operations unaffected. This is just one of the potential issues uncovered by screwing up.
2021-06-09 04:10:19,stocks,What? 😂😂
2021-06-08 22:57:00,stocks,"Amazon runs it's retail website off of fastly, not Amazon's  own cdn"
2021-06-08 21:54:54,stocks,Do you have a source on that? Its highly unlikely their site just coincidentally went down at the same time. A lot of the internet is interconnected and reliant on multiple parties.
2021-06-09 09:11:52,stocks,"Amazon has been using fastly for over a year, they don’t use cloud front, it’s not as capable"
2021-06-09 02:41:57,stocks,You wrong tho
2021-06-09 08:06:18,stocks,"> Google

I mean... Fastly says that Google uses them.

2021-06-09 06:49:39,stocks,"Sure seems to be the case when looking at PLTR anyways! 

Seems to be climbing a little recently though - fingers crossed"
2021-06-09 08:39:33,stocks,You act like it was a choice. Should they have waited 3months to tell you that all they did was ignore it. Or the pressure from huge corps had them freaking out? Your pick.

2021-06-09 09:24:55,stocks,"Totally. Although extremely unlikely, I can see some beancounter doing the math to the SLAs and business fallout and saying “we could get away with this once” and they’d have the advantage of knowing exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.

2021-06-09 01:19:57,stocks,"Amazon (along with almost every big player in the cdn space) uses a mix of cdn tech to avoid outages and to optimize traffic to specific geographies.

Fastly uses BIG hardware in a few locations. Akamai uses commodity hardware around the globe.

Different strengths. Different weaknesses. Both good tech."

2021-06-08 20:29:04,stocks,"I agree that you cant predict day to day price movements on a consistent basis but there are circumstances where you can be reasonably sure what is going to happen with a stock. For example, when covid-19 hit it was pretty safe to say that most stocks were going to go down, or for a more common example, when a company releases a stellar  earnings report it's pretty safe to assume that the price will rise"
2021-06-09 04:22:13,stocks,"Oh yes absolutely. My point is that Fastly is not the only company doing this, but it is the only one which suddenly jumped. So if you are to invest in a CDN, maybe it's best to invest in the ones that people didn't buy just because it made the news"

2021-06-09 09:35:00,stocks,"Exactly. 

When AWS is offline because of your company's fuck up you know it's bad. 

Usually these things have backup systems in place to instantly kick in and stop shit like this from happening to trillion dollar companies. I was quite surprised to see it legit just yeet dozens of the worlds biggest websites offline for an hour."
2021-06-09 15:24:31,stocks,"Maybe a difference in opinion then. 
I don’t see this as a reason investors should leave. 
You’d be surprised the amount of fuck ups that occur in every day large IT shops, either people, software or hardware. 
The outage was detected in less than one minute and resolved in less than 1 hour. 
That’s still over 99.9% availability

Granted they may be operating at the five nines (99.999%) normally, so a hit there- but I don’t see this as cataclysmic. It’s a bit of egg on their face potentially, but recoverable."
2021-06-09 00:24:08,stocks,That..... is just so unlikely.
2021-06-08 22:18:36,stocks,"https://fintel.io/so/us/fsly/citadel-advisors-llc

2021-06-09 01:12:20,stocks,"Speaking as a dev, who worked for a small agency, it always felt like Akamai never really reached out to the low-end market.  They seemed like an enterprisey ""call us for a quote"" style product.  In contrast, CloudFlare showed up with generous free tiers and self-service setup, so we slapped that in front of our 300 pageviews/week sites.

Discalimer: long $NET."
2021-06-09 03:38:13,stocks,Nothing “happened” to Akamai. They are still IMO the leader. They still do much of the heavy lifting on the Internet. Small companies and start ups simply cannot afford them you need to be spending $1000 a month on CDN to even get started with them. So others have stepped in to fill the void and service the smaller companies that Akamai does not want to deal with. They don’t seem interested in participating in the race to the bottom.
2021-06-09 06:57:05,stocks,VCL is still Fastly’s biggest selling point. Configuring Akamai sucks
2021-06-09 05:49:13,stocks,Just lower your cost basis on fastly
2021-06-08 23:32:36,stocks,Lol
2021-06-09 01:16:10,stocks,"Dunno why you’ve been downvoted for this. They pass traffic for between 20-40% of the world’s internet traffic every day…and they don’t pass porn or gambling on their platform.

The government uses them. Google uses them for overflow. Amazon uses them for anything they really care about.

They’re just so big and expensive that new companies (like tik tok) shy away from them.

Long term? Akamai still has a ton of marketshare, but it’s growing through newly acquired product, but not many new customers."
2021-06-09 02:15:18,stocks,what are joke. Cloudflare is. Apple even collaborated with them in a new cloud+ solution
2021-06-09 01:20:14,stocks,"__**Never mind, disregard this whole post, didn’t realize they were also in cloud services as well**__

>! Yes, agreed, I am a developer and am going to explain how it could go down fast though. 

Fastly is a service that host static assets like JavaScript (client), css, images, and other things that are static. 

Although it will take a while for this to happen, a lot of these companies (especially Amazon) will eventually switch to something more uniform with what they already use, like AWS. 

Amazon, reddit, and more already depend on some cloud provider like Google Cloud or AWS. A lot of these companies are also simplifying there “stack”.

A stack is there currently used technologies. 

Although it may be up in the near future, it could go down fast. 



If you want to invest in something like Fastly that has a better future (my opinion), invest in Cloudflare (NASDAQ:NET). I say this because Cloudflare is a DNS manager

DNS is what converts domain names to IP addresses. 
Like: Amazon.com -> xxx.xxx.xx.xx

Although it seems like a minor thing, Cloudflare is only growing and will only grow considering they are so much easier and better than alternatives like Namecheap DNS, or Google DNS.

Redundancy works even in physical ways, and I get to laugh, stress free, about it. So I'll happily let Amazon freak out if it can't sell thousands of items a minute. I rarely buy from them. I burn effort to keep my money from digital or internet sales for this reason."

It was recovered better then most, but it's still just as bad of a error that any other ""lesser"" team/corp/managers would make. Only really shows they had scrambled, for creating the most basic of issues. Putting a huge hit on those that rely on that infrastructure to be handled better. The bug that triggered this is not a new one. I think they doubted that it would ever pop up. Just ignored it away till they couldn't and were ""surprised"" when they didn't do the job right. I haven't been called the ""cool"" boss, ever, for reasons I know already. But I'd hang myself out the whipping sticks if I had been the cause. Everyone would have the same treatment from me, even me. It was as simple as readjusting servers that should have had nothing to do with each other. But, say la vie."

By the way I voted your comment up even though people are going to vote my comment down because they disagree with my opinion And don’t want to admit that the CDN that they chose for their shitty little start up or agency isn’t the best because the best isn’t available to them.

It is true that Akamai is generally unapproachable to smaller Shops there are no pricing plans at less than about $1000 a month minimum.

There is a workaround through IBM and I use that for my own and client sites you only pay for usage and there is no minimum but the ordering is done through IBM cloud and there are some features not available And there’s no handholding and support comes through IBM not directly from Akamai. 

And yes, indeed, they are an enterprise-y call us for a quote operation for Enterprises."

2021-06-09 00:13:45,stocks,"Loling Because you don’t have the thousand dollars a month minimum for Akamai?

Hint you can order an Akamai CDN on IBM cloud for usage cost only but there are precious few other options to buy Akamai services without a high monthly minimum. Keeps out the riffraff."

Most people caring that they offer DNS do not pay cloudflare and never will use cloudflare in a paid capacity. DNS is an easy thing, and cloudflares DNS management is frankly pretty mediocre for anything beyond basic website - and those use cases are the ones not paying cloudlare. They also are the price-sensitive customers that would immediately go back to their registrar for free DNS management if cloudflare started charging.

For the customers that make up 95% of their revenue, they could not give a shit about DNS. For Fastly, adding DNS management is a seriously trivial feature - the reason they don't is only because there is very little demand from it from the market segment they target. For most business customers, having to use cloudflares DNS management is actually a hurdle to adoption. While they also do support a CNAME setup on the highest tier paid plans - it is a manual process you have to contact support about.

tl;dr: DNS management is not a distinguishing feature and does not make sense to consider from an investment perspective.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"$ASTS is the Third Highest Gainer in the Market Today (50+%) - Why This STARLINK Complimentor is the BEST RISK/REWARD Stock Today!   FACTS 

*SITUATION OVERVIEW*


>• ASTS is embarking on an ambitious plan to deploy its patented technology that allows direct-to-device 5G mobile service from its constellation of low-earth-orbit (“LEO”) satellites 

>• With a large global market opportunity, ASTS is positioned as a “tower company in the sky” and benefits from partnerships and investment from customers, device manufacturers, and would-be competitors


*PRODUCT*


>• ASTS is building the first-of-a kind and only space-based cellular broadband network that is direct-to-device; a consumer’s existing handset will work with ASTS’s service in tandem with traditional terrestrial mobile service - ASTS also works with IoT enabled devices 

>• The constellation utilizes low and mid-band frequencies shared with partners on a non-interference basis; ASTS does not use mobile satellite spectrum but instead delivers service over spectrum allocated for terrestrial mobile use 

>• ASTS utilizes high throughput backhaul to terrestrial networks 

>• The service will eliminate coverage gaps, is compatible with all phones, provides broadband data speeds, and is accessible via one-click on a user’s device


*MARKET*


>• ASTS is targeting the large mobile 5G market, specifically in markets where terrestrial infrastructure (e.g. towers) is less developed 

>• ASTS is a beneficiary of the following secular trends: i) falling launch costs, ii) high smartphone penetration, iii) broadband demand iv) 5G IoT proliferation

>• ASTS cites 3.3BN people who are covered but not connected to cellular broadband and another 700MM people who are not covered by existing networks and not connected • Key regional opportunities include India, Africa, and Equatorial regions • The service is well-suited for low/medium density sites as well as for emergency back-up during natural disasters


*MANAGEMENT*


>• CEO Avellan holds 18 patents and was the founder of Emerging Markets Communications (sold for $550MM in 2016) 

>• The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm, NASA, and Maxar 

>• The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom are PhDs 

*COMPETITORS*


>• ASTS competes with high-cost legacy providers, including Iridium 

>• Legacy satellite providers require unique handsets for users to connect 

>• ASTS also competes with the build-out of standard terrestrial 5G mobile equipment 

>• Competitor Lynk advertises a similar product but appears significantly behind both with respect to commercial, financial and technical milestones


*PRIMARY INFO*

>(See link at top)

*OTHER*


>• Investors include Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, and Samsung; all are re-upping in the PIPE 

>• ASTS owns 51% of NanoAvionics 

TIMELINE


>• April 2019 – BW 1 was launched, validating system architecture 

>• 2H 2021E will launch BW3 

>• 2H 2022E/1H 2023E first commercial launches of 20 satellites for Equatorial coverage, with 110 satellites by YE 2023 and 168 satellites by YE 2024


    OPINIONS

*SUMMARY*
>• ASTS is an exciting event-driven story stock with open-ended upside that is cemented in reality by proven entrepreneurs, significant industry backing, and bone fide strategic agreements in place that address key commercial aspects of the business 

>• Management funded the seed capital for the business, highlighting their confidence and ‘skin in the game’ 

>• Targeting mobile 5G is a ‘big idea’ that augments that excitement generated by fixed-broadband players such as Starlink while addressing the cost accessibility issues that are likely to be present in developing markets 

>• The stock benefits from a dynamic where it cannot be disproven, leaving investors free to speculate and discount key assumptions, including service penetration among partner carriers and ARPU 

>• The investment set-up is favorable since a high capital intensity space venture is poorly suited for private markets, yet requires the capital available in the SPAK market – the set-up is not a ‘foist’ by private market investors onto unsuspecting retail investors but instead a legitimate capital raising exercise that harnessed the SPAK market instead of exploiting it 

>• With 1-year lock-ups on existing investors and PIPE investors, there will be limited free float on account of the small trust size ($232MM) coupled with the statement of confidence from pre-deal and PIPE investors that rolled over in what amounted to a “public Series C” financing 

>• Given future CAPEX, Wall Street banks will see a large future banking opportunity and likely initiate favorable coverage on the Company


*RISKS*


>• While the BlueWalker satellite provided proof-of-concept, there are questions around whether ASTS will work at scale when the constellation is deployed 

>• Users might experience significant battery drain on their devices when using the service, reducing appeal for full tower placement 

>• Realized user penetration and ARPU remain uncertain as well as the ability to raise future capital for full system deployment at prices that avoid excessive dilution 

>• ASTS will depend on capital markets to fully fund its growth and is susceptible to potential funding risk


    CHECKLIST

*BUSINESS MODEL*


>• ASTS will receive a 50/50 revenue split with its carrier partners including Vodafone and AT&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide significant operating leverage and cash flow


*GO-TO-MARKET*


>• In-place binding agreements with carriers provide ASTS with access to >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn) 

>• Phase 1 will target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people; subsequent phases expand into Europe and N. America – the total system will require 168 satellites by 2024


*DEFENSIBILITY*


>• ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage 

>• Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market


*CAPITAL*


>• ASTS is capital intensive and subject to capital availability to complete its full system • Once the constellation is complete, the Company benefits from extreme operating leverage and should have extremely high cash flow conversation


*TRACTION*


>• ASTS appears to have extraordinary commercial partnership traction, however, it is yet unclear what end-user uptake the usage will be 

>• Technical traction was ‘proved’ by the April 2019 launch of the Bluewalker 1 test satellite


    FINANCIALS


>• Phase 1 will cost $510MM (20 satellites) while the total global network will cost $1.7BN (168 satellites) 

>• ASTS’s projections are based on having ~375MM subscribers by YE 2027 

>• ASTS has previously raised $128MM 

>• Company projections are in the link at the top

Ford is disturbing the market with its new makers. Next thing to expect is the ford bronco electric… California loves the bronco, they pay $100-$200K for original broncos to drive them to surfing beaches. An electric bronco will kill it in California.

2021-06-08 20:48:06,stocks,"You want to compare it to a Civic? Ok, ok.

Tell me more why you would rather have a Ford Escape over a Honda Civic.

The Maverick is a FWD unibody truck with a 2,000 pound towing capacity. 

It is more in line with competition with the Ridgeline, which beats it out in every single category. 

It's other competitor is the Hyundai Santa Cruz, which can tow 2,500 more pounds and STARTS 10k cheaper.

Lets go back to the Honda Civic, that sports some if the most dependable motors of all time in the K20 and R18 motors in North America. Even the little L15B7 makes **20** more horsepower than the base model Maverick.

The motor package up is an ecoboost at 1k. Still FWD. Add another 2,500 for AWD.

Base model, 2 liter ecoboost and AWD 24,795 with base trim.

4 door Civic mid level trim (EX) 24,400.

Also let me back you up a bit on the type of people that buy old Broncos. They are NOT paying 200k to go surfing. 

I have a 4x4 squarebody Suburban that i take to the desert to drink beer and shoot things. Cost me 500 bucks. I would never own a Maverick, or a Ridgeline or a Santa Cruz when I can get a turbo diesel Colorado ZR2 for roughly 40k and trash on every single one of these ""trucks""

The compact truck grocery getter is not and never will be a major player in American automotive sales.

I think Ford is a great company, I like what they do. But the Maverick is not the reason to invest in them or a catalyst."

Even if it is a small pick up truck, its still a truck that needs a more powerful engine or your gonna be struggling to accelerate on the highway, or worse engine problems. Also, your comparing a small pick up to a compact sedan, two of the most reliable compact sedans I might add. Both Toyota and Honda have a reputation for being the most reliable, fuel efficient cars out there. Ford discontinued their sedans because they knew they couldn't compete and rather focused on their money makers, which are trucks, suvs, and Mustangs. One last thing, this Maverick has a hybrid engine, which are very complicated engines and are a fortune to fix. Ford isn't really known for their reliability, so personally im not sold on this."

It'll also be a hell of a lot easier to park in a city than a Burban... and most truck owners will never see a gravel road or hook up a trailer so the 4k limit shouldn't be too problematic. 

There's a market for the Maverick. More than I can say for the other ""compact"" pickups that are just slightly smaller and less competent full-size pickups,  like the gladiator, ranger and Colorado. Why get any of those over a Tacoma for offroading? Why any of those over their full-sized counterparts for a work vehicle?

Professional investors usually manage large amount of money in funds that aren’t going to be cashed out on a whim to pay rent or buy a boat or whatever. So they can think longer terms than individual investors. They also have a pretty big base for diversification, so they can tolerate taking more risks with each move counting on their other holdings than someone picking a few stocks.

I don’t mind if shorts get squeezed or even screwed, but it’s ridiculous that this is even a discussion.

I have a small handful of Wendy’s I bought way back. Always thought I should just purge it but could never let it go. I never eat fast food, but I do think Wendy’s has a decent formula, and screw it, why not hold?

Well, I’m up 30% over the course of the day. Couldn’t care less, not gonna sell, and was honestly annoyed to see this distract me from real news about my holdings.

These idiots have the attention span of a gnat, so once the “short squeeze lol” is over, it’ll settle down. So just hang on, I guarantee you things will stabilize, and if they don’t, I guessed you missed the boat for bullshit valuations for the lulz, so more like a bullet dodged."

Besides, if algorithms see “Wendy’s” on Reddit threads and then buy shares in response, aren’t they basically just trying to anticipate a *meme* stock?

Honestly, this does propose an interesting idea for someone with decent assets available:

1.	Buy just enough to make a ripple, like 2% aftermarket.
2.	Post a thread with some bullshit DD that will make people feel completely informed, and completely bullish going into next day.
3.	Buy just enough to make upward mountains in the 24h chart.
4.	Post another thread that says something that makes people feel like the clock is ticking on “wen moon,” and this would also be sticking over big bad hedge fund money maker.
5.	Post threads on other subs around things like “WSB talking about short squeeze, might be true.”
6.	Keep sprinkling money in throughout the day(s). Get Bazinga talking about it, CNBC even better.
7.	PROFIT off a company you have no faith in, and neither does anybody else, cause the only reason the company’s name is even in the media’s vernacular is because it skyrocketed on some bullshit.


And if anyone disagrees, we be talking about how “CUM” and “ASS” are at play now? Look, I couldn’t care less if some shorter gets screwed because WSB said “let’s flashmob CUM, tee-hee!” Go for it!

But why the fuck does the antics of what is basically just a fringe troll group, a financial 4chan, force its way into the consciousness of everyone on a daily basis? I don’t give a fuck what you do with your personal wallet, let alone your life. Stop your subway train car flashmob with everyone talking about how they’re gonna short squeeze some stock with a market cap they can actually afford."

2021-06-08 20:07:14,stocks,"great post. i'd just add that i'm more bullish on WEN as opposed to something like clover or blackberry or some of the other current meme stocks, bc similar to gamestop and amc, it's one where the retail investors can also drive significant sales as customers (perhaps even to a greater extent than GME and AMC since pretty much everyone has access to a Wendy's and eats fast food). 

people that invest in meme stocks probably eat a good amount of fast food. get enough retail traders invested in wendy's, all of their fast food purchases shift from some mcd's, some BK, some chick fil a, some wendy's to 100% wendy's, that could drive noticeable uptick in sales volume. also checking your wendy's stock everyday is a pretty good trigger for tastebuds and $ to then go buy wendy's. and then wendy's will be in the news more so it's free advertising.

basically, the memeification of the stock could be a significant driver for wendy's financial success, as long as the meme has some steam. so i am as bullish on it as any of the others, short squeeze be damned."

Wendy’s spicy chicken isn’t a bad sandwich, but compared to the others it’s hella basic. Now, don’t confuse “basic” with simple; the Popeyes sandwich is just special sauce, pickle, and chicken on a bun. And yet the interplay of those flavors is light years ahead of anything Wendy’s has on their menu. 

So feel free to enjoy your Wendy’s, there’s nothing wrong with liking their sandwich. But saying it’s objectively better because pickles are gross proves your opinion is worthless."

2021-06-08 21:19:02,stocks,"What do you mean by ""2% outstanding shares""?

My issue with MRK is I don't know how to value MRK after the OGN spinoff.  I did a quick look but couldn't find the numbers, ie revenue/earnings of OGN portion that was spunoff.  But, it looks like OGN was 10% of MRK and MRK dropped about 10% or so on day of spinoff.

With big pharma, there's so much info that I cannot track, ie patent expirations, pipeline, etc.

Because of that, I use all big pharma as income  trade, ie go long on a dip, close at a profit target.  

MRK does appear undervalued.  2021 expected earnings 6.19 (according to fastgraphs) - which I think is post spin-off.  So, at $72, 11.6 forward looking P/E. With historical ""current P/E"" range of 12-15."

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Deutsche Bank warns of global ‘time bomb’ coming due to rising inflation  Inflation may look like a problem that will go away, but is more likely to persist and lead to a crisis in the years ahead, according to a warning from Deutsche Bank economists.

In a forecast that is well outside the consensus from policymakers and Wall Street, Deutsche issued a dire warning that focusing on stimulus while dismissing inflation fears will prove to be a mistake if not in the near term then in 2023 and beyond.

The analysis especially points the finger at the Federal Reserve and its new framework in which it will tolerate higher inflation for the sake of a full and inclusive recovery. The firm contends that the Fed’s intention not to tighten policy until inflation shows a sustained rise will have dire impacts.

**Deutsche Bank says**

“The consequence of delay will be greater disruption of economic and financial activity than would be otherwise be the case when the Fed does finally act,” Deutsche’s chief economist, David Folkerts-Landau, and others wrote. “In turn, this could create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world, particularly in emerging markets.”

As part of its approach to inflation, the Fed won’t raise interest rates or curtail its asset purchase program until it sees “substantial further progress” toward its inclusive goals. Multiple central bank officials have said they are not near those objectives.

In the meantime, indicators such as the consumer price and personal consumption expenditures price indices are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation goal. Policymakers say the current rise in inflation is temporary and will abate once supply disruptions and base effects from the early months of the coronavirus pandemic crisis wear off.

The Deutsche team disagrees, saying that aggressive stimulus and fundamental economic changes will present inflation ahead that the Fed will be ill-prepared to address.

“It may take a year longer until 2023 but inflation will re-emerge. And while it is admirable that this  
patience is due to the fact that the Fed’s priorities are shifting towards social goals, neglecting inflation leaves global economies sitting on a time bomb,” Folkerts-Landau said. “The effects could be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable in society.”

## To be sure, the Deutsche position is not widely held by economists.

Most on Wall Street agree with the Fed’s view that current inflation pressures are transitory, and they doubt there will be any policy changes soon.

Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said there are “strong reasons” to support the position. One he cites is the likelihood that the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits will send workers back to their jobs in the coming months, easing wage pressures.

On price pressures in general, Hatzius said that much of current spike is being driven by “the unprecedented role of outliers” that will ebb and bring levels back closer to normal.

“All this suggests that Fed officials can stick with their plan to exit only very gradually from the easy current policy stance,” Hatzius wrote.

That will be a mistake, according to the Deutsche view.

Congress has approved more than $5 trillion in pandemic-related stimulus so far, and the Fed has nearly doubled its balance sheet, through monthly asset purchases, to just shy of $8 trillion. The stimulus continues to come through even with an economy that is expected to grow at about a 10% pace in the second quarter and an employment picture that has added an average 478,000 jobs a month in 2021.

“Never before have we seen such coordinated expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. This will continue as output moves above potential,” Folkers-Landau said. “This is why this time is different for inflation.”

The Deutsche team said the coming inflation could resemble the 1970s experience, a decade during which inflation averaged nearly 7% and was well into double digits at various times. Soaring food and energy prices along with the end of price controls helped push that era’s soaring inflation.

Then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker led the effort to squash inflation then, but needed to use dramatic interest rate hikes that triggered a recession. The Deutsche team worries that such a scenario could play out again.

“Already, many sources of rising prices are filtering through into the US economy. Even if they are transitory on paper, they may feed into expectations just as they did in the 1970s,” they said. “The risk then, is that even if they are only embedded for a few months they may be difficult to contain, especially with stimulus so high.”

The firm said interest rate hikes could “cause havoc in a debt-heavy world,” with financial crises likely particularly in emerging economies where growth won’t be able to overcome higher financing costs.

2021-06-08 21:54:40,stocks,I agree with Deutsche Bank. the Fed need to swallow its pride and start doing something otherwise we all be F\*\*ked big time. Inflation is showing every where in the world across all asset class. People are not even spending as they have forecasting. All this pent up demand does not look real to me. everybody is trying to save as much as they can. The subprime that happened 8years ago is still very fresh in many peoples mind.

Also ""the effects will be devastating, particularly for the most vulnerable"" please, it'll only be that way if DB has it's own way. Somehow I think people aren't goign to stand for being thrown under the bus again for banks.

Inflation will rise, it might even become ""high"" but consider this, even in the mid 90s mortgage rates in the US were 10.13% (inflation was 5.5%), the last time inflation topped 10% was 1981 (the fed rate was 18%). Is high inflation is now considered to be about 4-6%?

They are also severley mirespresnting why inflation was so high in the 70s, the end of the gold standard and the oil shock (both 1973) led to massive fluctations in the rate of growth (-0.5% in 1974 to 5.6% in 1976). We are NOT in the same situation, now the chip shortage may contribute to inflation in some way but realistically it won't last more than the next couple of years. One X factor I will throw out in thier defence is the possibility wages will rise, as many industries are now desperately hiring and some growing rapidly we could see wage rises as the primary driver of inflation. Real wages are still lower than in 1973, though bottomed out in 1995. Between 1973 and 2013, productivity grew 74.4% and hourly compensation grew 9.2%

All I can say is buy value, gold and REITs and hedge with tech.  People forget that this was the same story when they were heralding the end of QE 7-8 years ago when the rate began to rise again. We may see at about 0.75% 2022 1.5% 2023, maybe slightly more. But not a transition to double digits in 3-4 years.

2021-06-09 05:25:38,stocks,"I would say the the type of stock (or more generally asset) you hold is relevant. Any unpredicted change in behavior will cause market volatility, since bets will fail. Either investors will loose value through under-hedged bets, or hedge funds will loose money from over-hedged bets. As a consequence of this with the rise of market uncertainty, investing willingness and risk taking, will probably also lower, causing the market to generally slow down. This probably goes into a market decrease, as the overhead of driving the market, might become under-saturated from the decreased velocity of the market.

Additionally the inflation will cause a lot of low-middle class consumers to have less spending power, which will decrease the overall velocity of money, and on average the revenue of the entire consumer based market. 

Demand driven and hyped stocks who's value are based on ""sure they don't produce any money right now, but they will in just a moment"", (confidence based stocks), will probably risk a sharp decline in value, as overall market confidence decreases. 

I'd say the real risk, are companies that are driven very tightly financially, as they risk going over the edge during the instability. Confidence based assets (that aren't driven too tightly), might decrease sharply in value, but will eventually bounce bark as the market recovers, and they continue on realizing their actual value. 

Best approach as I see it, is to follow Warren Buffets strategy of investing in companies that have financial room for instability, and good long term prospects. Additionally keeping a highly liquid 'opportunity fund', in relatively stable assets, enables you to take advantage of the actually great stocks, which will take a temporary hit during a crash of any kind.

I guess if the bet is that USD inflation is going to accelerate, moving to companies based on non (less) USD-bound currencies (as if there really were any), would be the play. I **think** the risk is more based on an unchecked sustained high inflation rate, which I'm not as sure about how to interpret mitigation on. 

Right now, I think it's hard to say which companies will initially be affected by market instability. It's easier to say which companies won't be affected as much by it in the long run. Financially solid companies with an actual value growth plan.

FYI, I've only been investing for 5 months, and don't even know if I'm using the right terms. It's only the explanation/analysis that seems logical to me."

Cloud computing is seen as a key profit driver for Alibaba over the long term and in the past few years, it has been boosting its presence aggressively outside of China.

On Tuesday, Alibaba announced plans to open a new data center in the Philippines by the end of the year and launched a third data center in Indonesia. Expanding data centers allows cloud providers to boost their capacity in certain countries or regions.

Alibaba also launched a cloud-based livestreaming product designed for online shopping. It will allow e-commerce players to launch a live stream shopping feature on their websites or apps that are hosted on Alibaba’s cloud.

Livestream shopping usually involves a host talking about products that customers can buy directly via the live broadcast. It has become very popular in China and is growing in other parts of Asia.

The Chinese e-commerce firm hopes that such a product can help it stand out from U.S. rivals including Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud market.

In the Asia-Pacific region, Alibaba was the biggest public cloud market vendor at the end of 2020 with a 19.2% share, according to IDC, boosted by success in China. Amazon was second with a 10.5% share.

However, in the global market, Alibaba still trails Microsoft, Amazon and Google.

Alibaba’s cloud announcements come after it reported its first net loss as a public company in the January to March quarter. The company was hit with a massive $2.8 billion fine as a result of an anti-monopoly investigation by Chinese authorities.

Maggie Wu, Alibaba’s CFO, said the company would invest “incremental profits and additional capital” in “new businesses and key strategic areas” in its current fiscal year.

In China, Alibaba faces growing competition from other technology giants including Huawei and Tencent which more recently have stepped up their cloud computing investments.

2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,Strategies for dealing with FOMO / ROMO (regret on missing out)? I’m a relatively new investor (as I’m sure the title indicates). I have now been dead on several times about stocks that have gone up 70+% but have been too nervous to actually buy them. I’m feeling enormously frustrated on missing these gains that I knew about and wondering if anyone has any tricks for dealing with this regret.
2021-06-09 00:54:57,stocks,"I bought GME in February for 65 a share.  I held and held it and after it dropped to 140 I told myself if it ever got to 180 I'd sell it. It did.  I sold it. I also sold shares of AMC I picked up for 6 dollars for 11.  I struggle with this myself but when I think about it.  I damn near tripled my money in GME and if I bought my shares back at 180 it would have to go to 540 to make the same return. I almost doubled my money on AMC so I shouldn't be upset.  I had my finger on the buy button at 7 for CLOV but ultimately decided not to and had I done that I would have tripled my money had I sold it today. Moral of the story is that opportunities come along everyday but if you get bogged down in the shoulda woulda coulda you're going to waste time on that and miss the opportunities right in front of you.

If you sold a stock you sold it for a reason.  Delete it from your watchlist and move on.  It's dead to you."

As someone beginning to work in the field, I am impressed by the number of research and great innovations that came out of this company, that seems to gather some of the best talents of machine learning in China and the world. 

However, their stock does not reflect what my personal opinion of its value is, for sure its financials are way weaker than its American counterpart Google (can you really do as good ?) but still it is announcing great news and partnerships and breakthroughs plus the Chinese market is the fastest growing by far with the new middle class forming, so my question is: am I missing something big that makes it not so much of a good move ? What is your opinion ?"
2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Correlation between entertainment media (Netflix, Shows, Movies) and stock growth In 1994 the widely acclaimed Forrest Gump was released in theatres. In it, the lead characters are shown to have invested in apple, making them wealthy. If you were to have invested $1000 into apple when Forest Gump was released in 1994, you would have a value of $419,000 today. I'm not saying all movies are able to predict trends, but I've found that very popular movies and media enable the acceptance of ideals, which can lead to positive growth in companies that fit them. Today, most people see media on similar platforms, and so are exposed to similar ideals. For example take psychedelic stocks. When Netflix began releasing specials about them there was a noticible upward shift in these markets. Have you noticed any similar trends or examples that correlate streaming service media exposure to stock growth?"
2021-06-09 00:00:00,stocks,"Is this a strategy for stock investing? If so is it safe or reasonable? I’m not that informed and knowledgeable in stocking investing or trading as I’m only 18 and just started learning. Although recently I’ve been thinking about a what I confiare shorter term strategy and was wondering if it seems reasonable. Logic tells me that if a stock drops a crazy amount in one day, the chances of it spiking back up within that week/ month are relatively high. I do understand that sometimes the market defys logic and can be extremely unpredictable, but overall can one say that this a common pattern? For example what I’ve been doing is search up the day/week/month/ biggest losers and make my decision based on those stocks that are not doin well but still have relatively good fundamentals."
2021-06-08 22:01:49,stocks,"I would like to stress that you should at the very least check why the stock might have fallen. If there is a reason you have to judge whether it's a good reason or a stupid reason. You can make money of the stupid reasons, but you need to know at least a little about whatever the company is doing to be able to judge that. If there seems to be no reason at all, then it's gambling. If the company is small, some big institution might be messing with the price, but there could be some kind of shady stuff going on as well, or there could be news that are not public yet. Again, it's gambling. 

I think what you are really trying to do is value investing (don't do swing trading, just don't), but for that you should actually check the fundamentals. Because even if a stock drops for seemingly no good reason, it might just have been overpriced. You should get familiar with some basic indicators like P/E, P/CF, P/B, market cap. and so on, because they allow you to judge that to some degree. Especially those ratios give you a basic understanding of how the company is valued atm basically instantly, if you can interpret them right.

If you're not into that kind of stuff, follow the other advice given here and put you money elsewhere, but it you have some kind of special knowledge about basically anything, I'd be looking into investing in that sector. I'm for example really into hardware and semiconductors, so I'm not afraid of investing in this area."

2021-06-09 03:29:01,stocks,"AYTU - started squeezing good today. Was up 60% at one point and came almost all way back down due to shorting. Share price is $5. Was $12 in March leading to merger and Healight study release. Analyst price target avg is $17 without Healight. Only 24mil outstanding shares. 100mil revs. Institutions have been buying like mad since merger/Healight. Blackrock added 400% more shares since March. Seems clear institutions missed first ride up and they brought it down to load the boat and shake retail. 

Second Healight trial, international one, about to start. Healight will be the answer to Covid and future respiratory pandemics. Hospitals and government stockpiles will need the device. Can also be used against pneumonia. It’s the answer to antibiotic resistance issues. Also have approved ADHD meds, consumer health products, and rare disease drug in pipeline."

The need to realize the cash they have sitting around is being de-valuated at a very rapid pace and there is risk of higher interest rates going forward, so maybe it will be wise to chip away at the debt.

I think they will continue the course with the buybacks and they will chip away at the debt a little faster. I dont think the stock price will move much in the next year but I wouldnt be surprised to see a 10-15% bump given relative ""safety"" and fPE assuming it is realized. At the same time, I do think that tech is in a bubble due to speculative stocks and though Apple isnt one of them, if the sector goes down, everything goes with it.

2021-06-08 20:56:29,stocks,"Sure, but you didn't grasp my point.  Apple's P/E has risen because its earnings have fallen to half of what they were.  It's not as profitable.  Coupled with the rise in share price, it's  not as good a purchase as it was 3, 4, 5 years ago.

AMZN has had consistent earnings growth, up by a factor of 10 since 2018.  Its P/E is even higher, but it's also offering different products and services than Apple, so I wouldn't compare them.  

Tesla is pure speculation that I won't touch with a 10 foot stick."

At the same time if CLOV drops to $13 I can probably buy back my calls for $1 and still make $7 per share profit and chose to either hold my shares longer (still breakeven at $6) or just sell at $13 and keep $7 profit"

I would even argue that you may fundamentally not understand this situation, both on the social sentiment side, and on the institutional corruption side. If anything, meme holders should be setting **limit buy orders**, to snag on the dips that inevitably follow instances of manipulation. Not financial advice in the least.

If the stock goes to 110 in after market my stop loss would be triggered and  push a sell order for 119 right?   
It probably won't sell instantly or at all but the stop loss would be triggered and I would need to tend to the order myself if i want it cancelled or sell lower than 119 right?"

Yes you do, and the quicker you realize the better. First of all not all stocks go up, some go down and never recover even former gigants.

And if I really had money to lose? I'd be selling calls where I saw the ""top"" and just covering them if the stock continues to climb to capture a nice pullback but also still manage risk."

Options can be great for short term trading with reduced risk exposure. Short term trading can be great for growing a small account rapidly. 

Short term trading gets progressively more difficult the more risk you are managing, which is why I see a balance between account size and risk exposure.

Sadly it tripped my stop loss so i sold at about $50 a share, which isn't bad considering i paid $34. But had i set it to 15%, it wouldn't have triggered and i would have likely sold at around $60 instead."
2021-06-09 08:28:33,stocks,"It should be triggered, but your broker might sell your share at 15 if the price went instantly from 17 to 15.

Setting a stop loss doesn't necessarily mean that you'll sell at minimum the amount, just that you want your broker to sell ASAP."
2021-06-08 20:38:29,stocks,"Also - there are limits to how valuable AMC will be after a potential sqeeze. My guess is that it will settle anywhere between 15 and 30.Even if movies becomes very popular as rona-fears subside, it's still ""only"" a theatre chain. Meaning it has limited possibilities for increased surplus outside getting more people to visit them on an ongoing basis, without bleeding too much from studios extortion-pricing on popular movies.   
    
GME on the other hand, has more shorts and plenty of growth potential as it both moves online and branches out in it's physical stores."
2021-06-08 22:10:21,stocks,"I think it depends on whether there is actually a bottom-of-the-iceberg quantity of naked shorts on GME.

However, if it's true that ""the shorts haven't covered anything"", then that means GME has reached its current valuation on the assumption that the short interest is real, rather than the underlying price action of shorts covering en masse. If it turns out that GME isn't really shorted well past 100% on naked shorts, then the current valuation is a bubble. I'm waiting to see how the vote count shakes out since more votes than shares would be the most direct evidence of people owning fake shares sold to them by naked short sellers."
2021-06-09 10:33:51,stocks,"Comparing it to other companies with similar market cap, it’s not overvalued. If anything it’s undervalued. Unless all companies are overvalued, which may was well be the case, but then it doesn’t matter."
2021-06-08 20:07:31,stocks,"And after they cover, and the squeeze is over, will the share price really be what it is right now?"
2021-06-08 20:06:00,stocks,"I simply do not think that they have enough of a monopoly on the things they sell, to be as grandiose as you say."
2021-06-09 05:25:33,stocks,"What about Best Buy, Walmart, and Target? All sell the same gaming products as GME with superior online infrastructure. You’re telling me that GME is fundamentally $80 more valuable than Target because it sells only gaming stuff?"
2021-06-09 08:57:05,stocks,"Got it, thanks for the explanation."
2021-06-08 23:10:01,stocks,AMC has no squeeze
2021-06-09 13:21:58,stocks,"Exactly. I bought X shares in January and over the months have accumulated 5X times my initial shares. I do believe that shorts have not covered yet because of many reasons already discussed in details in GME and Superstonk subs.

I also don’t care if it doesn’t moon in next few months. I believe GME itself will prove to be a good investment over coming years and I can wait."
2021-06-08 20:48:15,stocks,"When strangers seems to get emotional about you not selling, it may be a sign that you are on the right track."
2021-06-09 05:45:18,stocks,"Yep. Also because of its low float and market cap. Target has about 500m shares available, GME has 70m. Do you understand fundamentals?

They are also pivoting to online retail hard, they are developing an NFT, and are jumping in to e-sports. A currently untapped market for a behemoth such as GameStop. 

They have one of the best board rooms/executive teams any company could ask for.

BULLISH"
2021-06-08 20:46:02,stocks,This is the way
2021-06-08 20:55:41,stocks,"Right, so the conspiracy narrative is the hedgies want it to die and they're doing all this shady shit but they can't because of the heroic retail traders? Which completely flies in the face of the other conspiracy cultists that say that narrative is completely wrong. Why aren't you guys on the same page??"
2021-06-08 20:57:33,stocks,Have you not been paying attention to the prices lately?
2021-06-09 05:54:04,stocks,"Do you? Gamestop was a $4 stock based on its fundamentals. They probably sell less physical games year after year as more people buy digital/subscribe to services like gamepass. GME can sell consoles I guess which are notorious loss leaders, so not much profit in that. The only thing they sell that probably makes them money is used games and merchandise like tshirts. Those tshirts you can buy online or other stores like Target. So they haved used games and whatever profit sharing they having going on with console makers (is it just xbox that has this deal with them?). And youre telling me that makes them fundamentally worth more then Target? I’m not trying to tell you to not buy GME but think for a second. GME’s price is not based on the fundamentals, and the whole shakeup most people are claiming is going to turn GME around is to enter the competition in online sales? Against Amazon and Walmart? Walmart spent 2 billion just to get people to be aware of their revamp of their online business. Can GME do the same? Or are you gonna be left holding my bag? 😂"

2021-06-08 21:12:40,stocks,Yes I've seen the prices?  What exactly is your point?
2021-06-09 06:00:03,stocks,"Well considering my cost basis is around 13 dollars I’m not really worried about holding a bag. 

They were not trading at 4 dollars due to fundamentals. They were trading at 4 dollars due to illegal naked short selling. Hedge funds wanted to take GME to 0 , have an awesome pay day then, liquidate their assets and increase market share for their longs (Walmart/target/Amazon) 

Check out the DD over in r/superstonk watch the AMA’s with the experts like Dave Lauer, Wes Christian, Dr. Trimbath.. 

Read House of cards parts 1, 2, and 3. I am not wrong.

GameStop is prob one of the most talked about companies in the world right now. They do not need a 2b advertisement campaign. They are getting it all for free."
2021-06-08 21:08:07,stocks,"I've seen so many different narratives! Lol. Omg, they just want to make money. Lol.  Don't even mention AMC has 20% float ""NO they just want to distract you!"" By making money off something not gme? ""Yes!"" So why is gme going up ""ohhhhh it uhhhh its not as much as it could be tho. See, it's the bad guys doing it""."

2021-06-08 21:12:42,stocks,"Your argument makes 0 sense. Whys it going up? Simple bc everyday they short more (albeit a lower overall amount total) and pay interest, meanwhile fomo buying is slightly increasing, and perhaps some smaller shorts are beginning to get out of the way. 

Mainly though as they run out of capital their ability to suppress the price weakens, hence the weaker attacks everytime. 

Listen bro noones telling you to buy it, we're simply sharing our opinions on what we believe to be true. If you believe cnbc that they covered and gme is a fledgling brick and mortar destined for bankruptcy, you're free to short it"

2021-06-09 08:46:06,stocks,They're not interested in gme in terms of bankruptcy anymore. Shorting now is just making money off a volatile stock dipping to it's actual value.  But sure I guess you can believe that narrative they're STILL trying to bankrupt it instead of the other companies no one pays attention to. And AMC is a conspiracy to distract everyone.

2021-06-08 21:12:42,stocks,"Ok look at the FTD cycle and the T-21 + T-35 price jumps. The price action for the last 6 months almost proves that “this is what’s happening here” alone. However there is a lot more that proves it as well. 

Look man I’m not trying to convince you or anyone else to buy GME, just do your DD before you form an opinion. I have had a large position since October 2020. This is the most hyper rational investment I have ever made, and it has paid off in spades so far. It’s difficult to fathom but it’s happening."
2021-06-08 21:21:31,stocks,"Really? So your narrative is despite fraud and this and that and shady....you are winning?

They're so huge and cheating at everything and getting away with it...but in this case they just can't win. They totally aren't getting what they want."
2021-06-08 21:25:59,stocks,"Yes despite the fraud, naked short selling, and rehypothication of shares. GME is growing and shorts are losing. Because I am long on GME I am winning."

2021-06-08 22:03:19,stocks,"They are VERY good at those tactics, and have been very successful using them in the past. However  this is the first time they have ever been caught with there dick in the cookie jar before.

The experts as I mentioned above,  who apparently you refuse to watch say Wall Street  has done this to hundreds of companies over the past decade and it is only ever caught after the fact. 

The goal is to short the company to 0, bankrupt them, liquidate their assets so companies they are long on can take over market share. Think Toys R Us and what Amazon/Walmart/target  (and their investors) stood to gain.

Look man think what you want, but don’t base your opinions on false narratives."
2021-06-08 22:21:28,stocks,"I never said those things didn't happen. There have been very clear examples of them doing it.  Since they were very clear they WERE caught with their dicks in the cookie jar, that's how we know it's been done. I'm not sure how that can be anybody's opinion. It's a fact. 

Gme had quite a high short float. The target was obvious and it was exploited. That's it. 

But it's never it to people. The narrative has to be they're doing this or that and STILL doing this or that bc gme gme gme gme. You say AMC or gme doesnt have high float and they don't care it's ""They"" are simply hiding it. ""They"" short ETFs with a bunch of stocks in their portfolio for one stock. ""They"" have shadow shares and whoiswhatsit star wars sounding shit. This is an awful lot of effort that people's ""opinions"" have proposed.  My opinion is all these opinions about what came after gme exploded are crap. Thus a lot of theories about AMC are crap.  Bunch of false ass narratives."

2021-06-08 23:00:22,stocks,Thank you! I wish you luck
2021-06-08 21:57:53,stocks,It does mean something when their entire post history is pumping a single stock.
2021-06-09 00:02:23,stocks,I wish it was at 55 I would’ve made a fortune
2021-06-09 00:01:34,stocks,It’s at 22.15 rn
2021-06-08 22:34:15,stocks,That would be incredible
2021-06-08 22:34:20,stocks,"What you are seeing is short volume, not short interest %.
Go to Yahoo finance. Under ""statistics "", float is 114.99mm, shares short is 47.54mm. So, 47.55/ 114.99 is about is abt 41%."

2021-06-09 04:15:42,stocks,You citadel bitch!! I will buy more AMC!!!
2021-06-08 22:38:39,stocks,"Yes, I am "" late"" on wkhs,  coz tied up in clov,  where I was on time. But trick is to hold till it gets there.
Today almost sold my clov calls when the share price reached 20s. Then it came back in 16s. 
No reason for clov not to touch 50 at least in next few days. 
So, wkhs will show wild swings like these other meme stonks,  key is to hold till it gets there."
2021-06-09 00:07:37,stocks,"CLOV is projected to surpass AMC and GME numbers, potentially be the squeeze of the year, with long term benefits."
2021-06-08 22:39:30,stocks,I dumped a grand into CLOV today let’s see what happens. I’ll jump in WKHS tomorrow as well 🙏🏼
2021-06-09 00:08:23,stocks,So should I buy into at least 1 stock value? The markets closed rn but I can put in an order to go through when the market opens up
2021-06-08 22:47:21,stocks,"You are gonna be fine. Just know when to exit and take profits. Try buying calls- a little risky,  but big payoff as well."
2021-06-09 00:13:13,stocks,"I think it’s good starting point, we might see some resistance but the projections are very good. Start with one share and keep on eye on the trend. If you like the numbers invest more."
2021-06-08 23:29:42,stocks,You gonna sell at $50?
2021-06-09 00:13:48,stocks,Ok. Now should I go ahead and put 30 down for out exactly enough in for one share?
2021-06-09 07:05:06,stocks,"CLOV or WKHS?
For CLOV, my plan is to sell a third of my calls at $50, a third at $60 and let the balance ride to see how high it can go.
But this is just a plan. In reality when the stock is moving fast, I might end up doing a little different. 
But it's good to have a plan to keep you within track.
Good luck!"
2021-06-09 00:19:01,stocks,"One share is 22.15, the price is going to be around 30 it might open a little lower or higher, so far CLOV has been above every projections since June 3rd. Go with 28.50"
2021-06-09 00:21:01,stocks,Welp we shall see how this goes. Thankfully AMC has been riding well enough that if this does go south I only really lose about 15 dollars
2021-06-09 00:24:31,stocks,"If you make some profit by 1:45pm I would sell and stock up again after hours, if the trend seems sus"
2021-06-09 00:25:56,stocks,That’s what’s I did with AMC. I put 40 down and once the share went up to 80 I sold out 40 so I didn’t lose anything. I’ll do the same here or at least push it to as close as possible
2021-06-09 00:27:32,stocks,"Sounds like a good plan, good luck to us 🤞"
2021-06-09 00:28:01,stocks,It’s all in the name of profit. Best of wishes
2021-06-08 21:58:42,stocks,"Just a bunch of haters mad when they see 400% gains cause it took them 2 years to see 50, end of story, go to WSB and buy some tickers, watch the magic"
2021-06-09 06:21:49,stocks,"There is room for meme stocks or longshot gambles in any portfolio, but it should be a small part of it, not more than 5% imo.

My job requires my full attention 8-12 hours a day. I cannot check my phone every 2 min to see what the meme stock is doing and react accordingly, and in such cases things change extremely fast. Investing long is more preferable for my lifestyle.

Also, every person can decide for themselves their risk tolerance. Personally, I invest in the stock market to raise capital faster so that I can start my own business. And so far it's working, I have almost doubled my money this year. But I still cannot afford to lose money on a gamble, because it would take me months or even years back. 

But once that's out of the way, what I will start doing is to invest 1% of my portfolio on call options of meme stocks."
2021-06-08 22:26:48,stocks,"Hey dude, you don’t need to monitor it minute by minute mr. intense"
2021-06-09 02:55:20,stocks,Solid fundamentals? What? Theyve been shrinking for years and are on the verge of being obsolete due to downloads and possibly even streaming... They are literally where video cassette rentals were before Netflix...
2021-06-09 09:13:33,stocks,"I think that, while.you have a point about the financials, it matters in longer terms, and as we see especially with the meme stocks, price of the stock is often very divorced from the actual value of the company. And here it depends on what you're in the market for - making quick bucks off of the price going up and down and selling... - this disconnect is not a problem if you can ride the wave and have fun doing it. Or if you go for less risky investment for the longer term, you would want to rely more on the fundamentals, so you know that in 10-15 years you're still good.  But a lot of these newcomers (me included) don't see that far in the future, because we expect that crises and the like will fuck us over anyway, and we don't have the kidn of money to invest for that horizon. So a little gamble is pretty ok. The ""snobs"" I've noticed tend to be more well off people, with a different expectation and culture of using money. 

My own opinion is that it's all a sham anyway that operates purely in the benefit of the ultrarich,  and the sooner it comes crashing down, the better for humanity."

That said, I see little downside to buying $40-$50 Jan puts. I might buy a few just for giggles."
2021-06-08 21:22:07,stocks,It was sarcasm you dense ass
2021-06-09 02:37:57,stocks,"Sounds like the creation of a very bad habit imo. Getting lucky once doesnt mean getting lucky again. Of course I also get the fomo as well but making money in the market well and consistently isn't about sticking to your guns it's about studying the technicals, fundamentals and having relatively strict rules imo. At least that's what the richest and most successful traders I see do"
2021-06-08 20:04:02,stocks,I think they’ve already squeezed and I think it’s mass delusion of mostly inexperienced people that lack critical thinking skills that think AMC and GME will go much higher than they are already. I don’t subscribe to GMEAnon

2021-06-09 08:05:33,stocks,I'm up 120% on the year. It wasn't one trade I got lucky on. You're comparing traditional trading to a market that is completely different in the last two years.
2021-06-09 07:23:10,stocks,"Thanks for sharing your well-reasoned opinion, and vin such a respectable manner. However, I hope you don't mind that I'm going to ignore it entirely given that you only started trying to figure out options trading 4 months ago."
2021-06-09 04:58:16,stocks,How could it have already squeezed when it was confirmed during the congressional hearings that no margins calls happened in Jan?
2021-06-09 15:00:42,stocks,"The second someone says a statement like this it becomes clear they have no clues the fundamentals of business. What the fuck does gaming culture have to do with anything?

Everyone may not download but it’s still a significant enough portion that PlayStation is able to make a version of a system that doesn’t come with a disk drive.

GameStop is a business in trouble. You seem to have some strange attitude that “real gamers still buy disk versions of a game” which means jack shit."

2021-06-09 09:26:53,stocks,Actually it makes me sad that there are such weak-minded people in the human race that are capable of basically bringing the entire species down with them.

Look I’m not saying your’re weak-minded, there are intelligent people caught up in the whole GME thing. I just don’t believe that there will be another squeeze."
2021-06-09 10:14:27,stocks,"My dude, you said earlier you bought AMC and GME. The idea that the human race is going to be wiped out by an asteroid (or global warming, for that matter) because a couple of people on the internet sold a stock later than you did is beyond absurd. I have to assume from the change in tone in your last comment that it's beginning to dawn on you, but the one here that sounds like they need to brush up on their critical thinking is you."
2021-06-09 10:30:26,stocks,"I’m not sure what you’re talking about. Either you’re intentionally trying to twist my words or you don’t have the mental capacity to understand them. Over millennia, the likelihood of an extinction-level event for humans is extremely high. It has nothing to do with people selling a stock, but the fact that a good 30% of our society are mouth-breathing idiots who can be led to believe anything. Nothing is dawning on me, in fact I was just trying to wrap this up with a nice comment because this conversation is not very interesting and I’ve got work to do."

2021-06-09 00:54:56,stocks,"Dumb question, but I just wanted clarification on what is considered a Day Trade. I have a Fidelity account and the definition of a Day Trade on Fidelity is: ""Anytime you use your margin account to purchase and sell the same security on the same business day, it qualifies as a day trade.""

Does this mean that if I have a cash account (normal account right?) that I can essentially buy and sell stocks the same day without needing $25,000 dollars in my account? I was always under the assumption that you needed $25,000 to buy and sell stocks same day and I am not sure why. Just want some clarification because I don't plan on opening a margin account and just want to be able to buy and sell some stuff the same day (frankly, I just don't have that kind of money)."

2021-06-09 17:05:28,stocks,"New to stock market; 

curious if any plays the way I do and if you think my plan is dumb.

Every week I dump 500$ into meme stocks and get out mid week usually @ 15% or 18% gme took longer, I then take that money and buy into the worst stuff I can find. I understand memes might not last but it’s working. And I never sell at a loss I’ll hold for life if I have too.

The problem is buying trash stock, anything dropping in price or has law firm posting bs… law suits!  Example eh; I dollar average all the way down. I find them on yahoo and so far they just keep dropping.

I’ve been doing this for 3 months I’m up 1300$ on my portfolio and holding $ah and $eh and a few more way down from my original buy in. 

My plan is they will once again pop in 6 to 10 months and I will pull all into $AC or $TD to pull dividends with the profits I take from averaging down.

Anyways curious if anyone else messes around the way I do and if you think dollar averaging shit stocks with poor management will pay off and get me deeper in the stock I really want.

Once again I have no idea what I’m doing and one day I’m sure I’ll learn from my none sense.

Another big one, that I have a much larger position in, is Cloudflare. Basically both of these companies do CDN but Cloudflare is much bigger and more widely used, as well as being anecdotally more popular among IT people.

I never understood why people were so bearish on these tech infrastructure stocks a few months ago because the virus was getting under control in the States and EU. Complete overreaction.

In my opinion, if you're going to continue using the internet and needing the internet in your life, there's a place for these companies. Especially with the recent high profile cyber security attacks, these companies also make cyber security a huge part of their product offerings.

This isn’t just a qualitative assessment of that business, but also a quantitative analysis that attempts to find the inherent fair value of the company today. 

If you’re not confident that you’ve done that, then you should move your funds over to a diversified index fund or etf like VTI until you’ve finished your research. 

Edit: I’d add that if you are content with your analysis and don’t believe anything has fundamentally changed in the business to justify the decline in price, then just hold or possibly average down. I don’t know anything about BB and whether or not it’s a meme stock."

2021-06-08 20:00:41,stocks,"In this particular case, it's certainly possible, but it only would have been a handful of shares. Looking at the volume chart, the entire minute of 3:04pm EDT had a volume of approximately 22K shares, give or take 5%. I'm a smalltime investor who only put in $3K back in October, and I hold 30K shares and 60K warrants. The price action likely lasted for thousandths of a second and wasn't observable in real time by the naked human eye. Spread out my 30K shares into thousandths of a second, and the math tells me the best I could have hoped for was selling 30 shares at $6. 

In realistic terms, the software that enables my peasant account to execute commission-free trades likely wouldn't have been precise enough or aggressive enough to trigger an order at that instant. Had I had the order set, I likely would have sold zero shares."

Over the next few news cycles Internet security is going to be center of attention so maybe there will be a bit a drawback as people deem it overvalued, BUT internet infrastructure and security is going to be a thing for decades and we’re not even close to done imo. These hacks are only going to get bigger and/or more frequent and Cloudflare is promising to prevent them from even seeing critical hardware. That means the company at the top in the near future is going to see the most upside.... Cloudflare has so much market share for DNS providers, from .12% in 2018 to 14.2% today. That’s insane. it’s basically going to be the Amazon Prime of 1’s and 0’s (if it keeps up what it’s doing).

Going back to the original point, considering the state of US fintech, I can understand why Buffet invested in a Brazillian company when they are developing fast and fintech will be growing there right now, not in 20 years.

2021-06-09 04:31:02,stocks,"I don't think you understand how dividends work. 
The dividends take profit from the company and the stock to return you money, so basically it just returns what you invest."
2021-06-09 06:21:30,stocks,"When I buy a stock, I'm not giving the money directly to the company so I don't see how they can return my investment to me. And the company generates profits from operations (revenue minus costs), not from the money invested in them (costs).

Even if that were all true, dividends still are a floor on stock prices. If a company is guaranteed to pay $2 a share next week, it's impossible for the share to be worth less than $2 today. Then it's just a matter of extrapolation from there by using assumptions on the life of the company, how much their profits will grow, and how quickly the value of the dollar will depreciate in the future (discount rate)."

2021-06-08 20:45:49,stocks,"Apparently you can also get ""stapled securities"" when the price you buy at is only the first payment and you are liable for additional fixed payments:

> Many small time investors in the recently floated company Brisconnections could face financial ruin after discovering the shares they purchased are to be paid for over three instalments. Many investors bought into the company when the share price plummeted from $3 to just a mere tenth of a cent believing they were snapping up a bargain. Now, investors face bills running into millions of dollars when the next dollar per share payment is due in April, a liability they claim was never spelled out to them.

https://www.abc.net.au/7.30/many-brisconnections-shareholders-facing-financial/2676152

2021-06-09 03:47:56,stocks,"Yup, and I think he means picking isn't even the toughest part, it's putting in enough. 

For example, plenty of people have or could have gotten a 10x return on Tesla, Facebook, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft etc even in a short timerame. 

When Lynch talks about ""in your life""? If you bought a stock intending to hold it for 20+ years, you could've reasonably made a 10x return over 25+ years on  something like JNJ, Best Buy, Starbucks, Adobe, Lowes... you don't have to be brilliant at picking stocks. You just have to go ""huh, that Best Buy I pass  on my way to Lowes is always crowded. Then I get my Starbucks, watch the football game, and watch Netflix"" and make an investment decision based on what you observe in your life, or in an area you know well. 

Now all of a sudden depending on when you bought, you suddenly picked up 4 10-baggers just by living life. The hard part is letting the money sit there for 10-15 years, doing nothing like a monk, definitely NOT getting rich overnight. Maybe one of the stocks will take 20-30 years. But honestly look up almost any company whom you feel  ""yeah that's a pretty good company.."" if you had the foresight to pick them up early, you could have netted a 10bagger. 

But unless you were putting a major part of your portfolio (say a 4 stock portfolio with 20-30% each stock) in, it would be difficult for that 10x to do much. Turning $2500 to $25,000 is nice, but turning $50k to $500k can begin to be life-changing money, depending on who you are."

2021-06-09 10:38:01,stocks,"That's the thing, you'd have to drop 10k in 5 different stocks and hope they all 10x. Your average person isn't saving 10k per year, so imagine putting 5 years worth of savings in single companies that could bust or lose significant value.

look at Blackberry, 07 it was rocking the phone market.

Right now it's android versus iOS, where iOS is like 20% versus 80% android. 

The 80% of android is split between 10-15 phone companies. with LG out of the mix now, I don't see why other less competitive brands won't drop out. E.g Sony, Ericcson, etc.
