2021-06-08 19:43:34,stocks,If his adult child can’t explain to him what he bought with his money then he shouldn’t be touching that account
2021-06-08 19:34:36,stocks,That’s the contract price for the options.
2021-06-08 19:33:10,stocks,"No reason to freak out at the moment, everything’s making money. .83 cents is the value of the option contract and different altogether than the stock price.

Have your friend [start studying this. ](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012)"
2021-06-08 19:36:52,stocks,"So he has calls, expiring 10/15, that allow him to purchase 100 shares of FCX for $15. If the stock goes to $15.01, he can buy for $15. If it goes to $200, he can buy for $15. The $0.60 is the price of the option (multiplied by 100 shares, so $60 each), and is the premium he paid to the seller of those options for that right. 

Realistically, he'll never exercise those options. As the stock price goes up, the premium will also go up. If FCX were to hit $16, it would be worth at least $1, since the intrinsic value of $15 plus $1 would equal the $16 stock price. There are other factors that influence price as well, such as time. Usually after a certain point, you'd just sell the options back to the market to pocket your gains or losses.

Your friend needs to first sell these tomorrow, since he doesn't know what he's doing. He can lose 100% of his equity if he doesn't understand them. And then second, he should move to a real broker."
2021-06-08 18:52:36,stocks,Their Alzheimer’s drug was approved by the FDA. First time in decades that an Alzheimer’s drug got approved.
2021-06-08 18:58:01,stocks,They (mostly) got FDA approval of a drug to treat Alzheimers. Still has 1 more phase to go. It's been like 20 years since there has been any helpful Alzheimers drug. I heard about it on a daily market podcast that I listen to called Snacks Daily :)
2021-06-08 18:56:14,stocks,The only way i can explain the big movements is the metamucil ive been taking.
2021-06-08 18:52:52,stocks,"Yeah, I got it from that weird software thingi called google. Amazing stuff, you should totaly check it out."
2021-06-08 19:08:46,stocks,"Train left the station on that one but you can still purchase tickets on the LGVN train. They are also working on an Alzheimers drug and would go ballistic,with only 19 million outstanding shares and a 6.60 price per share, if they release positive study news. Don't say nobody told you."
2021-06-08 18:54:12,stocks,That sounds great. Any way I could invest in that? I've got a few extra dollars.
2021-06-08 19:51:25,stocks,"Some marketing guy at Fastly: “Nobody has even heard of us. Now, hear me out...”"
2021-06-08 18:54:37,stocks,I thought I was being somewhat clever waiting at open for it to crash and then seeing the price shoot up took away my smugness pretty quickly. They had been on my watch list too but what surprised me today was just how many companies make use of their servers/network.
2021-06-08 18:51:56,stocks,When you realise something is more important than previously thought.
2021-06-08 18:45:23,stocks,I think some people just figured out what their business was and want in.
2021-06-08 19:06:49,stocks,"I don't know anything about the stock, but was familiar with the company being a software developer. However, I did not realize they were the DNS for stackoverflow. You want to talk about a pretty good way to kill the productivity of software developers...it's take down that site"
2021-06-08 19:03:53,stocks,FSLY drives me nuts....-30% still hahaha. But fundamentally I still believe so let's hope it keeps going up.
2021-06-08 19:08:49,stocks,Outages happen. But Fastly handled the outage very well
2021-06-08 18:58:26,stocks,"As long as it's not something that happens every month, it was obvious a 5% dip was out of order. FSLY then going up 10% is just how the market is right now."
2021-06-08 18:42:59,stocks,"Sorry, I hit the wrong buttons and pulled the wrong lever."
2021-06-08 18:47:23,stocks,"I'd imagine a site crashing for not even a full business day wouldn't cause enough of a decrease in business for the stock prices to be negatively effected, but that's just my guess with no knowledge of the situation."
2021-06-08 19:11:36,stocks,To be honest I think it showed a lot of people how widespread fastly services are used - I was planning to invest but didn’t hit my buy value.
2021-06-08 19:35:28,stocks,I think your guess is probably correct and we'll see some recovery in this stock finally.
2021-06-08 18:55:21,stocks,Exactly. I was in the very same boat.
2021-06-08 19:08:42,stocks,What initially made me aware of the issue this morning was when I was doing web development work on one of my clients Shopify stores and suddenly the entire Shopify platform went *poof*
2021-06-08 19:33:05,stocks,"It makes perfect sense - people realize how important the company is and will be. Still more bullish on cloudflare, but they are both great choices."
2021-06-08 19:13:27,stocks,"It’s funny that people keep trying to justify the day to day trading. It’s just how it is. If you could accurately predict movement, you’d be a trillionaire"
2021-06-08 19:15:41,stocks,"One time I was working for a company, and the security team decided to blacklist all forums, including stack overflow. That lasted maybe 3 hours when all of the app dev teams basically rioted"
2021-06-08 19:24:41,stocks,Agreed
2021-06-08 19:33:38,stocks,"I'm adding my comment from a similar thread:

I think $ASTS might be one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the market right now. $ASTS went public through the SPAC route ($NPA in particular). They have no debt as a company and are fully funded through phase 1 of their plan to commercialize space based cellular service. They have several amazing strategic partners (American Towers, Rakuten, Vodafone etc.). Price action today (on 6/4) was likely people trying to front run the Russell 2000 inclusion.

2021-06-08 18:13:19,stocks,I like it
2021-06-08 19:23:40,stocks,Any idea how much money will go into it with its inclusion in the Russell 2000?
2021-06-08 18:55:06,stocks,"On my radar for a long time, but not gonna jump in until they launch their first satelite."

2021-06-08 19:36:24,stocks,This thread title comes off like a pump and dump article
2021-06-08 18:56:07,stocks,"I tried to get 5G service from my local cell service provider.  They said that because I live above the 3rd floor of a high rise that I won’t get any service despite being within the service area and a friend of mine on the 2nd floor having the 5G service I want.  If I can’t get it above the 3rd floor from a local tower, how you gonna get it from space?"
2021-06-08 18:18:43,stocks,"The protocols work in lower bands too like 3G, 4G LTE, and apparently is forward compatible with 6G.


But yeah 5G's short length is a concern, but ASTS has said that their satellites are very large that they can pick up those short range 5G signals from lower orbit."
2021-06-08 19:29:28,stocks,That’s only high band. Mid and low work just fine.

I wonder if today's price movement was in response to an expected R2K add..."
2021-06-08 18:58:07,stocks,"That's totally fair, I know some people doing that. The thing is though, that when that risk is taken off the table, the share price will be a lot higher. 


I believe in the telcoms that have heavily invested into ASTS and dillegenced the tech, so I'm trying to get in before the market buys in. Could blow up in my face though."
2021-06-08 19:03:51,stocks,"I've tried posting DD before this when it was down - no one gave a shit lol.


Sadly, people only care once its up by a lot."
2021-06-08 19:39:45,stocks,"Yeah, but I spent a lot of time collecting and formatting this post, so I didn't want it to be lost in the void. So I tried to come up with a clickbait title so people would at least look at what I had to say."
2021-06-08 19:00:04,stocks,"Large satellite with powerful antennae will receive and send the signals to and from the ground. So powerful that they can close this gap apparently.


Even without it, it will work with lower bands such as 3G and 4G LTE."
2021-06-08 19:15:45,stocks,This won't work indoors. They need to focus on serving outdoor devices such as IoT sensors to make a significant impact.
2021-06-08 18:22:31,stocks,"Hopefully they figure it out, it is cool tech."
2021-06-08 19:11:49,stocks,"Bands have nothing to do with 4g/3g which are protocols and specifications that can operate on multiple frequency bands. I think you're referring to them using a lower frequency that can penetrate through obstacles and weather (i.e. 800-900 mhz). Please note that a lower frequency will increase coverage and penetration at the expense of bandwidth. 
That said, I'm highly skeptical that they can accomplish this at mass scale while having enough bandwidth to be attractive as a replacement for ground based stations."
2021-06-08 18:32:22,stocks,It’s only high band 5g that has that issue. Mid & low band are still able to go through objects.
2021-06-08 19:19:21,stocks,"Yeah, my bad with that mixup.


In first-world countries with sufficient infrastructure though, they're not trying to be a replacement. They're targeting developing countries with lacking infrastructure to act as a solution and will price the offering based on the location's price sensitivity (poor countries = 1$ or less, USA = 3$ per month).


In countries with sufficient infrastructure, this is more of a premium option for when you go out of service, such as in the mountains. Also for underdeveloped places in first-world countries (I dunno such as Wyoming? Places that Biden's 5G fund is trying to service) this can act as a high-speed complement to existing cell towers to fill in dead zones.


I agree, it would a significant undertaking to replace the world's cell towers altogether.


You sound more technically minded in this field than me (I admit - I'm an accountant, not an engineer). I'm trusting on the telcoms doing the DD before investing in this speculative tech. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUm3PyiLU0E) from a former satellite engineer turned consultant gave me a lot of confidence in the tech, as him and his team diligenced the tech for over a year."
2021-06-08 18:38:59,stocks,Guess I need to read up on 5g
2021-06-08 19:28:48,stocks,No worries. It’s super confusing haha. I work for a company that has a lot to do with 5G installs and it still took me a couple months to really start to “get” it.
2021-06-08 19:21:47,stocks,You can look up “stock name IPO lock up expiration date”.
2021-06-08 19:25:36,stocks,"I’ve looked at a number of sources on the internet and they don’t exactly line up on the date... So I’ve taken to reading the SEC filing, so this really comes down to a question of practice and custom I’m guessing?"
2021-06-08 19:26:11,stocks,When did the stock in question go public? Most lock up periods can last anywhere between 90-180 days.
2021-06-08 19:28:15,stocks,"SEC filing says 181 days or the second day after the second earnings report, whichever comes sooner - so if the two first earnings reports count, then the 181 days won't matter"
2021-06-08 19:31:41,stocks,"if it's the 181 days, it falls on a Monday, in which case I don't want to get stuck holding it over the weekend preceding it. But I've got a really solid position in it, and wouldn't want to lose that if it ends up being that lock-up date has actually lapsed, meaning potential dilution"
2021-06-08 17:47:04,stocks,"looking at dividned history for 2021, KO has paid out .42 per dividend. (.42 * 4)/current price of 55.65 = ~3% dividend yield. Every 3 months, you would receive .42 per share of KO you have. 

20k of KO would be 359 shares = 150 per 3 months."
2021-06-08 17:49:33,stocks,"You would receive \~360 · $0.4125 = $148.50 each quarter.

Dividend Yield is the rate of return from dividends.

*Dividend Yield* = *Annual dividends per share* ÷ *average share price at time of purchase*."
2021-06-08 18:01:26,stocks,Google lmao. You gotta look up their dividend history!

edit:  JHC!!!!  I just looked at their chart.  So, what is it that makes this a great stock?

edit 2:  JHC on a stick!!!!  They have less than $5 million in cash and debt of $3.5 billion.  Imma need you to sell all your stocks and buy an index ETF first thing tomorrow morning."
2021-06-08 18:09:25,stocks,"I haven't done a significant amount of research into this company, but just from scanning the SEC filings - I'm not seeing the restatement.  Here are the most recent filings from edgar.sec.gov:

10Q (11/9/2020)
10Q (8/10/2020)
10K (6/1/2020)

The question I would ask myself is... if there is a restatement, given that they filed their 10K in the past week, what happened? Auditors should have completed all the necessary work and formed their opinion by the date of the 10K release, and the company should have disclosed all relevant information to the auditors. If there is a restatement on the way, what does that say about the company and/or the auditors that they were able to discover a misstatement within 1 week of audit completion? If that's the case, there's certainly SOMETHING that's off."

2021-06-08 16:53:23,stocks," - Honda @ $21.7K: Lasts ten years without problems.    
 - Ford @ $21K: Lasts five years then problems.    

Apples and oranges. But regardless Ford has had a massive run-up recently:   

 - 107.70% YoY   
 - 26.23% 3 months
 - 33.16% 1 month   
 - 5.11% 1 week   
 
Ford below $11 back in January this year was a great buy IMO. Ford at $15.65 today? Seems too much too soon. It could easily see a pull-back before re-settling at a similar price after positive sales figures from the Lightning/Maverick.   

Just to be clear I'm bullish on Ford, they've been rolling all 6s recently. But I'm not bullish at nearly $16 before a single vehicle that is meant to be expanding their brand has rolled off the production line with chip shortages, general import problems, inflated cost of foreign goods, and many new potentially problematic design changes/new cutting edge technology."

So I was following 4 different treatment plans and still in pain. Last week, I finally got some imaging done and found out it was something totally easy to fix and not at all what the docs had thought. All of them had good reason to diagnose me the way they did, but they were simply wrong. 

DD is not necessary, but it’s a good idea to make informed opinions for anything in life- especially when it involves your money (and ultimately your well being). Experts are sometimes wrong. And even if they’re not, they may have a totally different risk tolerance than you or they may have an approach that fits their investment style (and wallet) but not yours.

2021-06-08 15:14:41,stocks,"This seems unwise. Let me see if I understand this:    

 - Your premed college is essentially free.   
 - You're earning money.   
 - You are planning on going to medical school.   
 - You want to lock this money into a 529 that can *only* be used for a very tiny subset of things because any gains will be tax advantaged.   

Cool... But last time I checked there are many *many* expenses in Medical School that aren't school debt, and 529s have an extremely narrow array of things they can be used on. So unless you are making so much money you can both save a lot in normal savings AND save enough to start paying for med-school tuition, this seems unwise.    

I'm a big fan of 529s in general but this isn't what they're meant for. Not for extremely short duration savings that lock your money down, they're meant for tens of years for children for tuition only (leaving other non-tuition costs on the table)."
2021-06-08 15:03:36,stocks,"If your not planning on using your $ until retirement, I'd suggest a Roth IRA, with just a plain S&P 500 - max that out, after that see if you have employer match, and then it depends on how active you want to manage your investments, but something like VTI would be my suggestion for an easy investment, if you want to be more active with some funds & run the wheel or other strategies on some stocks that aren't your retirement funds then go for it while your young"
2021-06-08 15:21:24,stocks,My risk aversion pops up here.  Keep it in something safer.  You need this money in a relatively short time.  Put it in something that drops dramatically and you don’t have a big window for it to come back before you need it.
2021-06-08 15:58:43,stocks,"Yeah, so you hit those all on the dot.  I guess I was just thinking that I would be forced to pay pretty much all my savings for med school anyway, so a 529 would be a safe tax-free way to invest for the next couple years.  

So if that's a bad idea, what do you think would be the wisest thing to do?"
2021-06-08 16:13:34,stocks,"> So if that's a bad idea, what do you think would be the wisest thing to do?   

Unfortunately just regular [taxed] investment account, ideally leaving each investment in at least 12 months, so it is considered long term investment for tax purposes.   

The retirement accounts do let you withdrawal the underlying but that typically has a delay period measured in years, which is beyond the timescales here, and 529 locks down the money too hard (if you need it for living costs as opposed to tuition).    

This may be worth asking in a specific medical education sub if there is one, since they can get into specific on med school debt and what is trade-offs exist there (e.g. living costs Vs. tuition, when repayment/interest starts, etc)."

2021-06-08 16:31:28,stocks,"Sighhhhhhhhhhhh.......

I know you guys don't want to hear this but......

A while back there was/is a notable ticker (see username) that has been much discussed.  

A thing happened where it was theorized that Media companies wanted to ""see"" what the reddits were talking about and push some ""other"" things like silver and rocket etc.

This got wierd when all of a sudden some random ticker kept getting mentioned. I forget what it was now but it was like SHF or some German company.  People theorized it was bots talking it up because there was so much discussion on Short Hedge Funds (SHF)...   Nobody was actually talking about that ticker.   So one day everyone typed in $CUM and a few others and sure enough that because a ""pushed"" ticker.

At any rate the general hypothesis in the WEN rising is because there are so many comments about ""wen moon"" or ""wen Lambo"" in these subs.

Ofc I could be wrong but it's a viable example at the very least"

Edit: I should clarify when I say it's not a meme stock I don't meme it's a good stock. I'm saying it's not a meme, it's not pushed or talked about on reddit it's literally bots that crawl reddit for tickers picking up on Wendy's jokes and running with it."

2021-06-08 15:43:03,stocks,"Like most fast food joints, it totally depends on the people working and the local managers. The nearby Wendy's was a complete disaster a couple years ago. Dirty, slow, bad quality, rude. A couple of lousy experiences made me swear off going there. 

Then a year ago they bulldozed it and built a completely new Wendy's. I figured when they reopened they would have gotten all new people and would keep standards high to justify the rebuild. Went in a couple weeks after the reopen, what a difference. Super quick service, food was on point, staff was efficient. Since I like Wendy's spicy chicken sammy, I put them back on the list of places to eat. 

By a few months later, it was a mess once again. A lot less staff than right after the reopen. Person on the register seemed annoyed that I wanted to buy food. No chili (what?). Sandwich made wrong. Slow. 

Gave one more try a few weeks after that. Same, but now much dirtier - the counter where they had the napkins/ketchup/utensils was a sloppy mess. Straw wrappers on the floor, food wrappers left on empty tables.  That was the end. Yet I've been to other Wendy's that were quality."

2021-06-08 16:56:18,stocks,"Just to expand - it got some traction and made the rounds on the news, due to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nudcrm/to_the_guy_who_recommended_wendys_stockwen_proper/).

> ""Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in this Social Media 'Beef"" or 'Metapragmatic Roasting' of each other. Their Twitter profiles are actively following each other and going off each others posts,"" the Reddit post explained.
- https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wendys-stock-price-reddit-post-chicken-tendies-meme-stock-rally-2021-6-1030503972

The market rally is driven by people expecting others to rally and it's a chance for short term gains, due to being another plausible meme like AMC or doggy-coin or silver, pretty much. Will it take off? Who even knows anymore - it might just trend enough to do so and actually be an opportunity, but only in the sense of being a genuine candidate for the [Greater Fool Theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp), not because of a change in business model or anything substantial aside from social media hype. 

People here who are calling it some sort of evil mastermind plan to distract from their favorite stock are wrong, in that there is no evidence of that whatsoever, at all. And a market rally is not a pump and dump unless it is specifically coordinated by people to dump their shares.

It's some people hyping it up for fun and also being kind of serious though, but it is not based on anything specifically about the business. The post linked WSB post, which made the news, its primary argument is:

1. They have a cool summer salad option on the menu (not that big of a deal)
2. ""Wendys social media profile is no stranger to memes""
3. ""Both Gamestop and Wendys have been sharing in Social Media 'Beef' roasting each other""
4. Wendies is inherently memeable because of WSB chicken tendies meme, ""Wendys Chicken Tendies. Literally the perfect stock for this sub.""

That's it. They are a meme that people might rally around, so people are rallying around it on the chance that it takes off as another meme stock rally."

2021-06-08 17:15:59,stocks,"You can be adept at math, but it’s meaningless if you have shit assumptions going into it.

First off, the S&P is not the “average of everything”, but rather an index for the largest 500 companies in the US stock exchange. Sure, the biggest companies will be weighed more heavily and make up the majority of the total exchange, but it’s a distinction that I think is still worth taking.

Much more importantly, however, is that people do not necessarily invest and trade like the S&P 500. Emotions can get the best of anybody and cause people to exit after a loss in fear of losing more. This usually happens during a major market crash when people have more invested than they can afford in the event of a personal financial emergency…which can often correlate with a crash. People timing the market is one factor, and there are many more worth considering (buying high or into hype, investing without due diligence, etc). 

You can do your own research and realize that most retail investors, over an extended period of time, are more likely to underperform the market than they will outperform.

You can misuse math or brag about your portfolio size, but it doesn’t make you any more correct."

Stats do not agree with you. The thing you are trying to use to prove your claim disagrees at a fundamental level of how statistics are applied.

Try to draw the bell curve you are describing… you can’t because it breaks every rule of stats

At best following SPY skews you to the right a few percent and practically guarantees you won’t be the worst and guarantees you won’t be the best."
2021-06-08 18:10:51,stocks,First off it has the largest weighting of NAV so what it represents is the average of the largest 500 companies which should eliminate outliers. The entirety of the SP500 is based on states to be exactly average which is great. All of SPY’s methodologies are very basic stats and that’s the beauty clean the data eliminate human emotion you’ll be above the median.

It's no different than Bernanke admitting they saw issues with the housing market as early as 2005, but couldn't say or do anything about it, to both keep public faith up and to stay in step with the Bush administration's policies and outlooks.

It takes a level of understanding of economics to see that Yellen's one month shift from ""there is no inflation,"" to ""OK there's excessive inflation but it's actually good,"" is political nonsense to keep investors from panicking. It's not even a very sophisticated cover."

Best thing that works for me is just setting a target price when you buy, tell yourself ""I will sell when it hits X amount"" or at the very least force yourself to seriously reevaluate if you want to keep holding.  

Also, taking a 30% gain and jumping off may not get you to the moon like all the 42,069% gainz porn people are posting, but it is still a gain which is better than a loss."

2021-06-08 14:08:25,stocks,"I guess I'll be the first to say it. One of the weirdest things I have seen posted here. 

My 2 cents:

Simple correlation between the recent rise in stocks and your thesis. This would be a very bad basis to start investing on. 

As you might already know, we are reaching the climax of this generation's bull market. Everything goes up and with the recent investing mania speculation is through the roof. Psych stocks are another greedy man's speculation on the fun and new thing on the market ( see weed stocks). Missejd one, I'm not gonna miss the 2nd type of thing. 

Netflix could also be fueling the confirmation bias of young speculators to buy in, which drives demand up and with it, the price.

The majority of your portfolio should be sound, fundamental investments. The rest is monopoly money. 

TLDR: Media reach could drive up prices in the short run, but lacking fundamental strength would in the long run give you a bag holder instead of a 100x bagger. Based on this, short run success could be reachable, albeit unlikely and long run failure will be near certain."
2021-06-08 14:45:58,stocks,"Interesting trend but I think the main issue in your thesis is that the stock growth is not caused by the media but rather the media are hopping on a growing industry for example tech or psychedelics. So while movies and media absolutely don't cause stick growth, they do potray industries that are new and exciting that have growth potential."
2021-06-08 15:03:09,stocks,"I think you're thinking of much shorter term than I am and I disagree with your opinion on psychedelic stocks, they are not at all the same as weed stocks. Weed is more similar to alcohol in its framework. The psychedelic industry is so diverse in its aims (depression, ptsd, alcoholism, addiction etc) and we have barely scratched the surface of research after a 4 decade ban. Reseaarch is only just starting up again and you have mescaline, psilocybin, DMT, LSD all with credible scientists working on finding out how they can best help humanity. Psyches have the potential to knock out big pharma, not to mention the thousands of experiential retreats and infrastructure popping up all over the world. I think you're missing my point. I'm not talking simple correlation, more so the impact media has to change public perspective in a philosophical context, over the long term."
2021-06-08 15:32:23,stocks,"I did not say that weed = psychs. I was comparing the type of investment in psychs to be similar to weed. I see them as speculation since their business model is too risky for my taste. A lot of their growth is driven by positive media and hype plus future potential. New field, new players. A lot of them will not make it. I don't invest based on popular perception but this was not my whole argument. 

Media can do as much as the audience lets them. We are seeing a new age of openess fueled by new blood and the last generation slowly dying out. There is a change in perception taking place, yes, but I tend not to attribute it to the influence of mass media and even less to movies and Netflix docs."
2021-06-08 13:29:44,stocks,"That's basically just gambling and not actual investing.

The assumption that a stock will recover isn't sound.  That said, you'll probably make more money doing that then you would in vegas (lol).

My suggestion, save some money for gambling, put the rest into ETFs or long term investments in companies with good fundamentals.  Don't try to time the market."

Let me see. 


No. 


> Logic tells me that if a stock drops a crazy amount in one day, the chances of it spiking back up within that week/ month are relatively high. 


And where did you draw that conclusion from? 


Go look at GPRO, BB, and many others. Stocks don’t always recover or go up. 


> I do understand that sometimes the market defys logic and can be extremely unpredictable, but overall can one say that this a common pattern? For example what I’ve been doing is search up the day/week/month/ biggest losers and make my decision based on those stocks that are not doin well but still have relatively good fundamentals.

It’s idiotic. I don’t think most people realize the movement occurring now can be traced back to knowledgeable people pretending to be stupid. Even worse they fail to realize that the cause has been taken over by people who don’t have to pretend. Telling someone who can’t watch the market regularly to not use limits is some of the absolute dumbest advice I have ever seen.

Hopefully whatever is to come isn’t already priced in. This may be the next opportunity to get out. I’m talking only like a few hundred dollar loss here. I think I’m holding off on selling mainly because I have too much pride to take a loss on a company like Amazon.
2021-06-08 11:37:01,stocks,"I don't really think there's a such thing as ""too much"" realized loss given that you can carry it over to the next year if necessary.

My main line of reasoning, though, even in a tax-advantaged account is:

Say you buy stock XYZ. It falls by 20%. Whether you're in stock XYZ or you realize the loss and buy stock ZYX, it's a 25% increase to recoup the principal either way. If you don't believe in XYZ but you do ZYX, why hold onto XYZ any longer than necessary?"

Not necessarily the most important thing as its one months orders. They have a backlog of orders and are literally making every car they can and selling them. Until that is not the case it doesn't matter.

What is important right now are production and delivery numbers. Those may numbers of 34k are what is important. It's the second highest number out of Shanghai since its inception. The only month higher was the 3rd month of q1 2021. Tesla has eclipsed q1 month 1 and 2 already by like 30% and the 3rd month of q2 should be stronger than the 3rd of q1.

Expect conservatively 205k produced and delivered in q2 overall. Could be significantly higher. I would be shocked if lower."

Dollar Tree is a much more recent addition for me and isn't as proven, but with the ~15% drop in May it finally retraced far enough for me to pull the trigger given Family Dollar operational improvements, as well as the rollout of Dollar Tree Plus and Family Dollar/Dollar Tree combo stores. 7-Eleven on the other hand has been an oasis of steady growth in a desert of volatility this year.

Just don't expect either to significantly outperform the market long-term. They're very well established companies and not sexy enough to get much attention."

Apple is being sued by Epic Games for anticompetitive practices in their app store. Should they lose then their future revenue growth is threatened.

While what happened is terrible it has no relevance to Apple's stock price. But I would recommend folks to not store that kind of stuff on a phone that is sent out. Isn't she better off backing the phone up and then resetting it before send it to technician. 

&#x200B;

EPIC case could have small impact but ultimately Apple users will continue to use apps tore even if 3rd party store is available. Its like android where majority of users use play store and not 3rd party stores. Apple will continue to print money with hardware, software and services. I dont think there is any threat to their business model for now. 

That said no stock can keep going up in a straight arc. Apple did go up big from early 2019 time frame to August last year when it peaked at 140-145 post split. That is almost 4x growth for a huge company. It could now consolidate over next couple of years while its valuation catches up to the stock price. Long term I expect this to beat S&P return if you continue to DRIP. I am in for 4 years now and have no plans of selling the stock."
2021-06-08 14:24:21,stocks,Ok fine. The Epic antitrust suit?

Efficiency of said HVAC systems doubles, then triples, eventually going carbon negative. Eventually, Honeywell thermostats are producing electricity, while at the same time keeping the population sedated via millions of microadjustments to indoor environmental temperatures. Honeywell thermostats merge with autonomous vehicles, providing them with a means to physically move around and eventually providing the human population with delivery and transportation in all cases, before the humans ever knew that they desired such delivery or transportation... and eventually, Honeywell accounts for 100% of the Earth's economic output.

It's kind of like if I said I had the fastest accelerating car in the world when in reality it's just the fastest in going from 60-120. Though again these little pot shots now of who's machine is bigger doesnt really matter, because it's way more about what different companies can build and their methods. For instance honeywell quantum volume is 64, IonQ is building one with a quantum volume of 4000000, but both of these companies might not matter in 10 years if their method proves to not be scalable."

looking at these meme stocks rising everyday i do feel like selling out a portion now and reinvest it in future if red days occur. I am the kind of guy who is happiest person on earth if i got 30% returns per annum. Gosh even if i hold meme stocks, i sell at 30% profit. 

I understand long term wouldn't be impacted if the fundamentals haven't changed but, i feel i am not the same person when the stock goes -40% during the crash and when it is green. Sometimes i would average out more on red days than i can afford to or sometimes i don't have the money to average out and let market take its course. 

Curious to know if you guys do anything on these big green days or any feedback is appreciated"

2021-06-08 14:13:48,stocks,"I've seen too many of my stock holdings over the years have above market gains, just to eventually average out over the long term. With meme stocks, it seems even less likely that above market gains will hold to the long term. So it's a judgment call about when to get out. 

I've ""missed out"" on huge gains from some stocks I've sold, but no regrets. I felt they were good decisions at the time, and they were reinvested, so there was gain elsewhere that needs to be considered. 

That said, this is why I now favor ETFs. Individual stocks are for play."

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Take Emotion Out of Trading Across the many invest/stock subs there is a lot of meme stock posting going around.  I am not against this by itself, as there is money to be made, but be smart, especially those who are new to this.  

We have all been there, bought a stock at $10 it goes up to $20 and you're like, it will never fall, then it goes to $15 and you say, when it is back to $20, then I'll sell.  You end up selling at $7 for a loss.  

When stocks have these crazy runs, just 'stop-loss limit sell orders.  For example, I'm currently in $CLOV, bought in at $11.65.  It's currently trading at $16.10 at the time of post.  I have a 'stop-loss limit' order at $15.  Meaning, if the stock drops to that level, it sells automatically.  

Of course, it could drop to that level, I sell, and then it rockets to $25, but ignore those.  This will guarantee I can ONLY make a profit.  I HIGHLY recommend you use these automatic sell triggers to prevent yourself from believing STONKS can ONLY go up.  Guarantee you make a profit and while you may be sad when you sell a little early, you will love it when you don't take a loss which I guarantee most of these meme stocks will turn out to be in the long run.  

tl:dr Use stop-loss limit orders to not get screwed over when the bubble burst.  Enjoy the ride and I hope you all become super-rich one day (if you're not there already)!"

2021-06-08 10:34:33,stocks,"OP, have you thought about stop-loss orders by percent? For instance you could set the percentage as such that if it dropped to $15 it would sell, but if it instead rises you effectively raise your selling floor.

I will do stop-loss trigger orders like you described when I plan to sell somewhat short notice or within the day, but for my normal protected positions I have % based orders that are nice because i follow more of the price action."
2021-06-08 14:44:15,stocks,You can also take advantage of trailing stop orders. Similar in concept but it automatically raises your stop loss by X percent (you set this value) when it goes up. so if the stock rockets to say $35 it’ll bring your limit order up to $30 or whatever you set the margin between the actual price and your sell price at.

Not everything is about meme stocks, yes if you're deep in them it probably has consumed you but alot of us are just trying to stay as far away from it as possible right now."
2021-06-08 17:56:46,stocks,"Of course a prudent strategy but two limitations worth pointing out just for the discourse.

1). It’s easy to give advice about how to make money on a stock from a position of already being 50% up on it. Different story of “how to take emotion out” when it goes down after you buy it and you don’t have the option to set a profitable stop loss.

2). In these highly manipulated tickers with memestock viral demand, short ladder attacks, squeezes etc, stop losses may help you not lose money but they will also help you miss out on the real profits. The reason being is that these tickers are seeing crazy volatility and stop losses will trigger selling at a dip and then the stock is liable to bounce right back up in the span of 10 minutes or less

It’s a conservative play 100%. I’m not saying there’s inherently wrong with that. Just that it’s a play to chase better chances at smaller gains. Most people looking noir smaller sure if the gains find stocks other than these memestocks appeal to them more. Just make sure your trading/investing plan matches where and how you are putting your money into a market that is evolving rapidly before our very eyes."

I’m a small time retail trader who’s still in his learning curve, trading small amounts. I started trading in February and yeah, this messes with your mind and emotions. 

Truth is, whilst I had an idea of the timing, I have no understanding of why it went up, why it went that high, and for how long it’ll behave that way.

Maybe not with AMC. I do believe it will squeeze. But their addiction is going to hurt someday.

&#x200B;

500k? Everystock 500K? There is not enough money in the world to pay that amount off to every investor. Even if some hit it at 400k its not possible."

The GAME is rigged against you and has been forever. They can see your STOP-losses... I know i sure as hell wouldn't set them on certain tickers, particularly if I really really LIKE the STOCK. Again, thats just me though."

If the stock explodes, I may have limited my gains, but I've still turned a profit in addition to the options sold. If the stock drops, I've solidified a position closer to the $X than if I hadn't sold options. If the stock plummets to near $0.00, I've set a floor on my losses by selling those calls.

Then, if the stock drops to my average buy-in (plus a small percentage which is significantly less than the option sale), use some of the proceeds from the options to buy more stocks. If the stock plummets, well that sucks but I still have some cash from the experience. If the stock climbs, sell more options. If it seems to be stagnant, sell call options with longer terms that more than offset the transaction costs.

2021-06-08 18:14:06,stocks,I see posts like this a lot. And then I see posts like emphasizing holding long. Both make sense. I don't think there is ever a one size fits all scenario with a stock. I'm currently up 30-40% on a few tickers I bought a month ago. Not cashing out because I put the money in with the intention to hold past the one year mark and avoid the tax penalty.

As for stop losses, I'd never tell someone not to use them.

Institutional traders have enough capital to shift the market, trigger your stop losses, and make easy gains on their end. Something to think about."

However, what I cannot stomach is the feeling of realized losses. I know we’re not supposed to “revenge trade” out of emotion, but when I lose,I start planning my revenge trades. Then, little by little, I will have my revenge through my cold, calculated planning until I make those losses back."

Even the ppl who create rallies they have targets.. no regrets i sold my positions before this prices to be reached.

Some stocks (GME for example) has experienced some really hard crashes before bouncing right back up, shaking out a lot of people with stop losses only to return to form minutes later.

And that's not to mention that it completely ignores volume, leaving you highly exposed to coordinated hunts for stop loses which allow institutions with much more money to buy up shares on the cheap.

You have large firms betting on those stop loss triggers so they can scrape extra shares out when they perform intentional price manipulation through counterfeit share dilution.

I absolutely do NOT have any stop loss in place for those positions. That would be a directly liability for a stock being battered around by these unnatural (and highly illegal) market practices.

I got in for a fraction of the current price on both GME and AMC. I'm already up over 300% unrealized profit in the past two months alone. Even if I slept through the squeeze and continued to hold, I'd still likely come out profitable, but that's besides the point.

I'd rather know that I played some tiny, insignificant role in exposing for the whole world how a group of ""self regulated"" organizations, representing almost exclusively foreign investor monies of unknown origins, have been systematically destroying American companies and jobs with flagrantly illegal market practices for BILLIONS in profit for DECADES.

This is true I work as a sales engineer (sell chemicals to manufacturing plants) and we've been taught to phrase things in ""If you don't do X you are missing out/losing on $Y"" instead of ""If you do X then you gain $Y"" because studies have shown that the fear of losing is 3x stronger than the desire to gain.

So instead of ""Switch to our program and our chemical can save you $100K/yr"" it's ""By not swapping to us, you're essentially losing $100K/yr"" . And supposedly the studies have shown that ""You're losing $100K/yr"" has the same influence as ""swap to us and you can save $300K/yr"""

All the meme stocks are correlated with GME for a reason.  They use these alternatives-yes, including movie stock- to hedge against GME.  GameStop’s annual shareholder meeting is tomorrow and we should soon find out how many votes came back vs what should exist.  If not tomorrow then within 2-4 business days afterward.  The realization/confirmation of the shorts will likely cause a pile on which will drive the price up further and potentially trigger the first margin call for the smallest hedge fund involved.

It just feeds into their narrative and further pushes them down this hole of thinking ""hurrr durrr wallstreet bad retail is destroying them.""

I get into arguments on different subs daily whenever I see someone try to explain how the next ""squeeze"" is going to happen. Most of the responses I get are....""you're just jealous that you 'paper handed' and sold early"" 
Which I find hilarious because I bought $15c leaps when GME was around 10 and sold them when it got around $350. So jealousy is not my intention. Lol.

GME is meant to be held until the hedge funds who shorted it cover and it squeezes to who knows where.  Think of Volkswagen back in I think it was 2013.  Damn thing shot up to about $800 in one day-I believe-due to a short squeeze.  This is the same situation for GME, only the hedge funds involved are incredibly skilled in bending the rules in order to hide the magnitude of the problem like the true short interest, number of shorted shares, etc.

Hopefully tomorrow, or at least in 2-4 business days when they file their 8K with the SEC, they will reveal the number of actual votes counted.  If they exceed the total float of 70M, then I expect total mayhem to ensue afterward.  It would prove that the shorts still exist despite the hedge funds telling congress that they had covered and it would prove that they, mostly Citadel-the hedge fund/market maker/authorized participant- have been selling synthetic shares for quite a while.

2021-06-08 13:40:27,stocks,"Edit: too lazy for actually doing math yet but i dont think your stop loss would have even survived what happened before i woke up this morning.

If the short squeeze theory is correct, which people can do their own research on, its something you have to set an alarm for and pay attention to once your alarm price is reached. We know this stock is heavily manipulated, so a stop loss runs a massive risk of getting triggered before you even have a chance to see any heights.

If the short squeeze theory is wrong, a stop loss isnt the worst idea. It does mean that youre likely locking yourself out of all big gains to avoid the risk of pretty minimal losses though, which i dont see as very productive if were supposed to be investing without our emotions. 

Lets say theres a 1% chance of this being huge, and a 99% chance of it going way down. If we go by math and not emotions, why would we care about it at 250 or 300? If those are the odds, mathematically your best bet is to wait for it to go huge and ignore it otherwise. Your expected outcome given those odds is a long way from now.

I see 2 reasons for a stop loss: you are in way over your head and cant afford to lose anything. You shouldnt be here, only invest what you are willing to lose.

You are so scared to lose that you are willing to put all potential upside at risk to minimize downside a bit. This sounds like very emotional investing to me."

Also, I notice I said stop loss, but I meant stop limit. With a stop loss, my 7 day period wouldnt make a lot of sense I believe..."
2021-06-08 12:51:00,stocks,"How do some people get so emotional about other people's positions?

I got in at the peak in January as a result of FOMO and was bagholding to 300 today. Could I have waited a bit longer and sold at profit today? Yes, but if I cared I would be getting emotional about it. 

I feel much more comfortable playing the long game."
2021-06-08 12:16:54,stocks,Either way he's a terrible investor. I don't see how even a boomer investor would close his position in less than 1 trading session. Boomers usually hold their position at least a year. Otherwise that's just gambling.
2021-06-08 16:55:25,stocks,The exit strategy is how you keep your winnings at the casino.

2021-06-08 17:17:02,stocks,Sage words imo
2021-06-08 17:27:11,stocks,"Interesting. What is a high, medium, or low volatility level?"
2021-06-08 18:51:39,stocks,Nortel and Enron would like a word with you.
2021-06-08 15:41:44,stocks,that's what my wife says happened...
2021-06-08 15:03:04,stocks,"It's a little of both. If they can move a stock just enough that it triggers the algos it'll cause a bigger swing. Algos usually look for ""weird things happening in the stats"" which is almost the definition of meme investment."
2021-06-08 15:11:56,stocks,"Just GME, because it had a short % of float of 140. Guy said once in a generation. 

AMC has 20%. It is not the same."
2021-06-08 13:19:31,stocks,TSLA
2021-06-08 14:17:48,stocks,"Large scale brain washing to the point it “literally” moves stocks, yolo level of money being spent, yada yada. 

GME went from $281 to $344 an hour after opening bell. And I’m no expert but I have serious doubts it was due to the reasons you mentioned. Maybe something else is at play, but what do I know, I’m just a brainwashed cult member."
2021-06-08 18:05:46,stocks,"Yea but, as you said, shills are being paid to push the whole ""2nd squeeze"" and ""buy and hold forever"" narrative. So why would GME have any real world potential? Their e-commerce isn't even that good and I can't see how they can compete with the current companies that already exist."
2021-06-08 16:01:45,stocks,"For real, my other theater chain stocks are trading shit. Trading 50 to 60 when it was previously like 10 is ridiculous."
2021-06-08 15:49:33,stocks,"Probably less popular name brand, but I think it will have an upward trajectory as things re-open."
2021-06-08 17:55:05,stocks,"Sure, I get it. The cost is impractical for large families. But I still think people are going to be excited for exterior activities after a long period of being at home. 

I don’t even hold any positions in AMC, I just think that being a meme stock has inflated the value a bit, but not as much as people might expect."
2021-06-08 16:05:54,stocks,I thought the conspiracy cultists WERE saying it was all retail....as if rich companies wouldn't jump on too bc rich companies are the bad guys and don't want you to make money so they wouldnt dare buy the stock too and sell it for massive profits.
2021-06-08 12:39:01,stocks,"I’m not real worried about these goobers being against apes or thinking we’re cultists. They’re utterly wrong, and I have proof. 

What I’m more worried about is that some unsuspecting person will come on here and think their shitty advice is actually good advice and lose their shirt over it. 

If you bought in at the top at 483, there’s been pretty ample opportunity to average down and make a boat load of money. Listening to these clowns is only going to net you losses. 

I couldn’t care less if they think I’m mistaken or if they don’t believe there’s more room for a certain game stock to go up. At the end of the day, I’ll be retiring in my 30s and they won’t be. 

What I’m more concerned about is people losing their life savings by following a garbage strategy that these people are advocating."
2021-06-08 15:44:37,stocks,"Security doesn’t exist, you’re going to die at some point and this existence will outlive you, as it was here before you. Money is just a silly game"
2021-06-08 15:17:22,stocks,"Maybe there are some comments I’ve missed, but I haven’t seen one ape believing the current price is due to the shorts covering.  I’ve seen posts reminding people that a short squeeze is coming, and I’ve seen comments saying it’s currently due to a gamma squeeze or due to demand created by us apes supporting the stock.  I don’t know anyone who believes that AMC or GME are currently trading on fundamentals.  They do have value but that’s not driving the price.  

Even experts screw up exit strategies.  I think apes will help each other with figuring out if/when they want to exit or not, depending on their reason for investing in the first place."
2021-06-08 14:37:45,stocks,So what is actually happening ?
2021-06-08 14:42:50,stocks,"I agree. The shorts haven’t covered anything. They still have 140+ million to go. Right now we’re in the teasing stage where they try to get people to sell by shaking the price violently. 

That’s why this is a strong buy for me, and I’ll continue putting every penny I have in. 

Virtually every significant DD that’s been put together has gone on to be vetted by actual experts with genuine pedigrees. Not people with “I have a finance degree from the internet college of clowns.”

And the cool thing is, it’s not really speculation. You, or I, or anybody can just go look at the options chains and see the married puts. We can look at FTD’s and watch buy cycles on 21 day trading schedules. It’s all verifiable information, there’s no hand waving or “you need to have a finance degree to get it” bullshit from somebody trying to claim expertise. 

Username checks out tho!"
2021-06-08 14:46:10,stocks,Maybe submit some counterpoints to DD then with the REASONS you think SI and synthetic shares aren’t driving the increase and random steep drops.

Aren't y'all the MFs who have crashed the economy multiple times with your greed?"
2021-06-08 14:32:09,stocks,I tried to set stop losses for GME back in January.  They got cleared right away since GME was seeing $100 fluctuations within hours during that squeeze.
2021-06-08 15:13:49,stocks,"Great write-up. I agree. I feel like too many people are jumping in with too much to lose and little to gain. They should be doing their DD long before they commit to the play. 

I put 1.5k into a couple of meme stocks back in January. If they all go bust and I lose virtually all thar cash, oh well. It means ramen noodles for 2 months max to recover that money which I can totally survive. Life goes on. 

But if the squeeze theory is real. I could quite literally afford to quit my job and take a year long vacation.

The pros of the win scenario vastly outweighs the cons of the loss scenario."
2021-06-08 14:12:02,stocks,"Different mentalities... you are a gambler. That is fine, but know that is your mindset.  
Me... I have lost out on a few bigger runs (noted AMC), but I have also saved myself some money by taking profits (FCEL) and moving to the next venture."
2021-06-08 16:16:57,stocks,"And you'd be really naive if you think it's current price is purely because of Reddit hype. The fundementals and prospects of the company are absolutely coming in to play to a degree, but you're right, that's not what's driving the price alone. 

This stock is heavily manipulated and there is significant evidence of a cyclical covering of failures to deliver during a period of consistently decreasing liquidity. Why? because shorts still have not covered."
2021-06-08 18:43:35,stocks,"You are right. The current share price is severely undervalued.

With no debt, a low float,  and an all star cast. Being the only show in town in the retail gaming industry GME is valued much higher on fundamentals alone."
2021-06-08 19:51:31,stocks,"enlighten us then, what is driving the price?"
2021-06-08 16:12:35,stocks,"I mean Ryan Cohen built Chewy from the ground up to be an ecommerce giant for pet supplies, directly rivaling Amazon. It's worth 40-50B now. Why can't he do the same with GameStop?"
2021-06-08 12:47:34,stocks,"He's given very valid reasons for investing in GME, why are you getting upset?"
2021-06-08 13:02:30,stocks,So…. How much did you lose on GME to make you this way?
2021-06-08 14:31:21,stocks,"Will you disprove his argument or will you keep saying crap? Gamestop has a huge potential in growth due to recent changes. For example, do you know what NFT means and it's potential in gaming industry? ""Gain some experience in investing"" said Mr. Smart Money with his 3% yearly returns."
2021-06-08 15:30:51,stocks,Me too
2021-06-08 15:38:09,stocks,"I just never sell at a loss outright LOL. Pretty much im gonna profit or loose everything I invested. When I invest Im prepared to loose everything I put in, or rather, I am very sure it will go up over any given period of time. But yeah same thing. I make a profit goal and do that and that has worked out for me. I also make sure to invest into businesses I genuinely believe in as a business and that I like morally. That usually helps."
2021-06-08 13:02:38,stocks,Investments on reddit have become as polarizing as politics especially with stocks like gme and AMC. They are trying to create an us vs them narrative to help drive fomo
2021-06-08 12:20:19,stocks,Where does he say he closed his position in less than a day?
2021-06-08 18:14:37,stocks,"It also happened because FOMO of missing out on GME and ppl not having the $$ to buy in so high, so AMC started up a second wave. Now, the media is talking about all kinds of meme stocks to divert attention from GME & AMC."
2021-06-08 17:12:17,stocks,Ya even this thing with clov and bb... its almost like clockwork how they're like Look a new shiny object
2021-06-08 17:34:37,stocks,And yet gme has gone up. The hedgies aren't doing very well if they want the opposite so badly.
2021-06-08 18:47:31,stocks,Because GME is all that matters and they don’t want to cover their shorts so now it’s MSM creating “meme stock” hysteria
2021-06-08 19:46:18,stocks,"Even outside of outright scams there are plenty of companies that simply don't last long term, there is a lot of survivorship bias when looking at stocks because you only see companies that are still around, unless you look at historical data"
2021-06-08 17:27:31,stocks,"It is hard to move a stock when the algos can bend the rules and hide inside loopholes to show the world that everything is normal while meanwhile on the inside, everything is burning.

Hopefully once they (the SEC) resubmit rule DTC...005, it will no longer allow these hedge funds to keep rolling their FTD’s and force them to start finding actual shares to settle.

Very excited for tomorrow and in the next few days when GameStop announces their voter count.  If it exceeds 70M we were right the whole time."
2021-06-08 17:28:51,stocks,Ty for saying this.  Unfortunately too many traders are believing the religious fanatical levels of evangelism with the movie theater stock.  It’s very sad.
2021-06-08 15:33:16,stocks,"We were discussing passion and loyalty in moving stock prices, which GME AMC and the other asset all did. Short % is irrelevant here"
2021-06-08 17:33:15,stocks,20% short still ends up costing hedge funds billions! 💎💶
2021-06-08 14:27:29,stocks,"This is the problem. I have people like you who admittedly say they know nothing, but say they are right. Yet I have a finance degree and work in banking, but I’m the clueless one."
2021-06-08 15:56:27,stocks,It was trading well above AMC. (Which was going to go bankrupt before they got a loan a few months back) AMC was just a few days ago warning consumers themselves to be prepared to lose money because it's not trading at all based on fundamentals of the stock.
2021-06-08 16:44:44,stocks,Mainstream news is painting that picture. Retail is exposing the real picture. the 13f filings don't lie. Blackrock and Vanguard are the real players holding more shares than any other institution by a very large margin. Retail is just piggy backing on these massive whales as they take down the smaller whales (citadel for example). Painting retail investors as the reason for all of this is how they create a scapegoat for the big money that is acting as literal financial terrorists.
2021-06-08 19:56:25,stocks,"I bought 3 shares at the peak, have averaged my GME down throughout the first mega crash, I bought more only because I trusted the DD ahead of my emotions"
2021-06-08 14:08:03,stocks,Lose their life savings with take profit orders?
2021-06-08 15:40:34,stocks,"For some reason he wont answer anyone asking whats actually happening, almost like hes wrong😂"
2021-06-08 15:20:47,stocks,"> Right now we’re in the teasing stage where they try to get people to sell by shaking the price violently.

If you look at the price action of meme stocks today, they pretty much all had spikes and valleys simultaneously. If you're long and your goal is to take profits from a variety of meme stocks that you've had a lot of quick gains in, that price action makes sense. If you're short and your goal is to prevent yourself getting margin called, you wouldn't waste money moving all the meme stocks - you'd want to pressure the one close to a margin call as much as possible."
2021-06-08 15:04:54,stocks,I have millions of times lol. This isn’t the place where I did though.

2021-06-08 14:58:39,stocks,so everyone with a finance degree is an evil hedgefund boy?
2021-06-08 14:47:50,stocks,"Im a mathematician, not a gambler. I see gamestop as a very large, likely upwards potential, and i see it as a smaller downwards potential. 

Even if it was only a small chance of it going up, statistically, it is still worth it for me to invest based in what i see the upside and downside being. I may be wrong, but if i due my DD, over the long run, i feel very confident in the numbers strategy.

Add in that the initial investment isnt even large to get potential large upside with minimal potential losses, and i dont really see why anyone wouldnt get a share or 2 *just in case* all the research is right.

.

Do note: its called a meme stock, but its not all a meme or gambling. There is tons of fantastic research and even official research papers dating back decades on this exact scenario, relating to mass shorting and massive shortcomings of the digital systems in place. Now in the end theres always a chance its right and a chance its wrong, and please note that im not trying to appeal to FOMO for this next part. In 08 there was the housing market crash, and people were predicting it and discussing all the info on it for years beforehand. This time, people are predicting another similar crash, and have been giving a lot of info on it. Even people who may not think this is the catalyst are predicting a crash. If you want, i can give you some resources and info for you to look at, and you may decide it is worth it to hedge your current plays. You may also decide not to. Im not saying go all in, im not saying its the only play, but i do see it as a very appealing play with lots of information behind it.

Either way, best of luck to your plays. only time will truly be able to tell what happens"
2021-06-08 15:22:22,stocks,"> Different mentalities... you are a gambler.

That's funny to think. I despise gambling. I hate risks. I'm also uncomfortably intuitive about manipulation and have spent 4-5 hours a day on Reddit for the last 10 years. Why did I get in at the start of February and keep putting all my money into the two main stocks even though people were getting called ""bagholders""? My average cost was around $60 and $6 at that point, and all those ""bagholders"" were getting so much hate, then *extreme* irrational movement and a negative beta for both stocks that ***still*** continues to grow(according to E*Trade information.)"
2021-06-08 12:23:29,stocks,Because only today has a small dip? GME has been going up for 3 days in succession. If he had closed earlier than today he would punch himself not brag about closing at minimal loss.
2021-06-08 18:41:40,stocks,"Exactly  :) we all very clearly know what they want, but finally, they can no longer have it"
2021-06-08 17:54:05,stocks,"I don't believe there is any logical reason that the stock will rise to those heights.

I think there is a decent chance that these circle-jerking idiots will raise the price enough, and get enough news cycles that more people start piling on thinking it might shoot up even MORE.

That's why I put $100 in on it. If I lose, hey, it's $100 bucks. If it makes another 100% irrational jump, hey that's $100 bucks! Wish I had thought of a stop-loss order, I would have put more in on that."
2021-06-08 16:26:16,stocks,"Key word is DID. Goodluck to them trying to artificially replicate some black swan type event by spamming, ""Ape strong"" or ""hold forever"" which seems to be all they do."
2021-06-08 17:34:25,stocks,"Hedge funds win and lose money all day every day, who cares? It’s not gonna put them out of business. They’re probably just doubling down on their shorts so they can still make a profit. I know i would be. Or at least buying puts."
2021-06-08 15:05:15,stocks,"So what is your take on this mentioned situation? 

Question is clear and I believe you might have an answer since you are a banker?"
2021-06-08 15:12:45,stocks,"> Yet I have a finance degree and work in banking, but I’m the clueless one.

Good luck using that, Andy Dufresne."
2021-06-08 16:57:46,stocks,Then short it.

2021-06-08 17:46:02,stocks,"This was a hint to innocent folk that what you see is artificial.  It’s artificial because it was pumped up.  When the HF’s are done with it they will discard it like a used condom.

Sorry but it’s true.  It was never the real threat to them.  This began with GameStop and it will end with GameStop.

2021-06-08 17:51:14,stocks,"Following retail trends isn't a nefarious conspiracy tho and doesn't completely absolve retail traders. I mean yeah, thousands of people buying is nothing but if it grabs the attention of a whale then..."

2021-06-08 15:08:22,stocks,"Fair enough. I also remember the 08 crash and saw the warning signs before (used to work on bank networking).

My approach to the market is more conservative than yours. When I see profits I want to make sure I don't lose it so I usually have a # I would be happy with regardless of if it ""moons"" or not. 

We have a lot more info handy to us than we did even 5 years ago and it is changing the market. I do factor in that info into when I ""YOLO"" or take profits, but sometimes you have to go with your gut. Like I said... I've missed a few, but overall I'm cool with what I have pulled and YMMV."

I'm horrible at math. What do you think of the negative betas? I only go by the info on E*Trade, but it's been consistently irrational and consistently my indication that they're manipulating the stocks to an extreme degree."
2021-06-08 12:25:42,stocks,"Again, he could have bought at the very peak and held until it rose yesterday and sold (at a minimal loss). I suggest you don't get so emotional on a post discussing how to remove emotion from trading."

I only pointed out that his once in a decade exception happened at least 3 times in the past few months. If you have another point to make, make it to him, because while you sound like you’re refuting my comment, it wasn’t really relevant to what I said.  

Also it seems like they might be doing it right now with CLOV. Also GME is still hovering at $250."
2021-06-08 15:58:00,stocks,"It's exactly what news and financial experts say it is. It's the people who don't do this for a living with wild theories and conspiracies and making up a villain to bash as if they are the only ones making money off amc's current run.

2021-06-08 15:35:44,stocks,This sub and other investment subs. There isn’t any DD here so it’s a little asinine for you to expect me to provide specific details when there is different DD almost everyday
2021-06-08 18:04:53,stocks,TBF I never called it DD.
2021-06-08 15:20:53,stocks,"Ah yes, I guess you have alot of experience dealing with people with finance degrees?

2021-06-08 12:35:16,stocks,"Again, even now at the lowest point of the dip it's still higher than yesterday peak. So I don't see how would someone brag about selling at a loss. He's either a liar or a gambler, both are bad."

2021-06-08 15:59:07,stocks,"soooo in other words you have 0 counter dd 🤦🏻‍♂️

asinine for you to consider a request to back your points up as asinine, considering you you're so big on being a 'rational' investor"

2021-06-08 12:38:20,stocks,I don't think he is bragging. I think you are misinterpreting what he is saying. He is stating that he got to emotional about his GME holdings and decided to sell it for a minimal loss and invest into an ETF where he wouldn't need to hyperfocus on his position.

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"What is everyone’s thoughts on the future growth potential of WELL health stock and other tele-health equities? This also includes other current high growth stocks like Teladoc or CloudMD.

I believe that this is a highly under-looked industry with high growth potential. 

There will of course always be a need for physical consultations and medical communications especially for urgent care.. 

but due to the pandemic, the opportunity to experience the many benefits of tele-health, virtual consultations, and the ability to access medical records electronically has shown us that medicine and health care can be just as effective when done electronically and with regard to virtual visits. 

Why drive all the way to the doctors office and waiting in line for simpler, non-invasive check ups and medical consultations when it can be done virtually or online? 

.. why not have your medical records backed in a secure cloud so you can have quick and easy access to your important health care records and with easy visibility. 

I know I wouldn’t mind having easy access to my x-rays and past test results at the comfort of my own home. 

This not only benefits the working age population by not having to take time off work or stress of walk ins but will also greatly help the elderly and newly discharged patients who have more trouble when it comes to mobility whom can be monitored and assessed virtually at home rather than the hassle of back and forth visits to their doctors. 

This will only increase in the future as we are at the cross-road of strong technology and software growth.

If we can leverage technology and AI to benefit the health care industry  as we have done with the banking industry as is shown in the success of online banking and online money management then I see strong growth potential for this industry. 

Although on the contrary, one strong barrier to growth would be the public’s willingness to accept risks related to privacy concerns with regard to having medical records online, virtual visits etc."

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"How brokers with omnibus accounts actually work? Very short introduction, I've been changing brokers in the past few years due to various issues arising. I am in a country where I don't have access to too many services so as of now I am using 3 main brokers. With one I am quite content, it works on a more straightforward basis, no spreads, you pay fees and own any securities you buy, doesn't deal in fractional shares and all that. The one I am not super happy with is etoro. While I know they are using the omnibus account for their customers it always bugs me that I don't fully understand the extent of this decision in a brokerage. 

I know the gist of it and how it works, for both whole securities and fractional ones. But I have some more specific questions:

1. How is self-clearing handled? Do they have to report externally the deals cleared in-house? Will anyone ever know there was a trade for X shares or there can be just an internal, opaque, transfer of ownership?
2. If a certain security is not available, does it hit the market orders instantly or the brokerage can decide to postpone the acquisition of said security for minutes, hours, days? If so, who takes the risk of price changes? ex: I buy AAPL at 125, brokerage delays the buy for 2 hours, the price is now 129, who pays the $4?
3. How do they handle massive, quick, unloads or loads of securities due events? Like, the CEO of a company is found doing some illegal activities, most customers unload considerable amount of shares, how will the brokerage get those out of their book? Is this a risk that is mitigated somehow, like with an insurance or something?
4. How is the brokerage prevented from doing illicit activities with the omnibus account? Do we have some outside institution doing periodical audits and looking at the books to ensure all is good?

I suppose there would be more questions but at least these answers would give me the necessary rope to research further. My main concern is that about 80% of my holdings are for long term (20 years), about 15% are medium term (1 years or so) and 5% is speculative (hours, days). I don't care about the last 20% but I am concerned for the other 80% since I would have to trust the broker to not go bankrupt or do shady stuff with my holdings and then having to rely on insurance payouts (if any) or losing my investments. 20 years is a long period of time, harsher times can affect institutions, market collapses are likely and so on."
2021-06-08 13:11:56,stocks,"Are you buying from the EU or UK?

Omnibus accounts are handled slightly different throughout the world so it would be handy to have geography before starting."
2021-06-08 14:16:03,stocks,Good point! Mostly I am interested for US stocks. For EU I handle it through my other brokers and there I am happy with the option of not using omnibus accounts.
2021-06-08 14:16:52,stocks,No sorry I meant where are you from! As in your location.
2021-06-08 14:19:07,stocks,"Ah, yes, EU (fortunately also part of the European Union too, if that is of any relevance)."
2021-06-08 14:23:18,stocks,"Ok cool!

So most of the brokers you have access to will have to fall under the EUs CSDR regulations. The reason shares are 'pooled' in this way is because it's so much cheaper then buying individual CREST accounts for each user.

So to get away from the Omnibus method you'll need to find a broker that is happy for you to have your own CREST account - in the UK Hargreaves Lansdown is one that springs to mind. The annual fee the last time I checked is about 8k for your own segregated account.

If that doesn't work. Check out CSDR it's a surprisingly easy to understand piece of regulation and will answer a lot of the questions you have about nominee / omnibus accounts."
2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"With the recent drop in price of bitcoin, would that impact Tesla's balance sheet?  

At Fortune, Shawn Tully estimates that Tesla bought about 43,000 Bitcoins for $1.5 billion, about $34,700 per Bitcoin.

In the worst case scenario of a multi-year bear crypto market as we have seen in the past, would this impact the value of Tesla ? How would this be reflected on the balance sheet?"
2021-06-08 07:57:39,stocks,"Yes. Tesla has the Bitcoin listed in the Balance Sheet at cost as digital asset (intangible). If the market price of bitcoin goes down and is below the carrying value in Tesla books, Tesla needs to book an impairment loss affecting the Income Statement. 

The impairment loss can only be reversed when Tesla sells the Bitcoins, and if they are sold above the carrying value in the books, Tesla would be able to book a profit out of the sale."
2021-06-08 07:46:36,stocks,"The only reason in my opinion, why Tesla bought BTC was so Elon Musk would be able to reach his requirements as stipulated in his bonus, unlocking a few billion in bonuses. Now that he has received his bonuses, they most likely have already sold their positions in BTC. Once news breaks out that Tesla has dumped Bitcoin, the market will go lower."
2021-06-08 08:28:19,stocks,yeah. Sell tesla now and get in at 350
2021-06-08 07:43:25,stocks,"In short, yes. It is an asset they hold that has gone down in value.  I don't know enough about their financials to understand how they have presented it on their balance sheet, but as you know, however it is accounted for is likely detached from whatever is going on in the stock price."
2021-06-08 09:22:55,stocks,Didn't they liquidate all the capital they had tied up in bitcoin since it was one motherfuck of a class action lawsuit waiting to happen?
2021-06-08 13:07:05,stocks,Tesla is screwed
2021-06-08 14:02:09,stocks,"No, musk helped precipitate the btc dip by publicly pulling out and criticizing it. He literally pumped and dumped it just like he's doing with doge. Btc will hit gold market cap in 10-15 years. Doge might not even still be around then. 30k is likely the new bottom for btc. I'm betting at least a quarter of my longterm portfolio on it"
2021-06-08 11:31:51,stocks,"I'm curious as to the accounting of crypto. I used to work as a corporate accountant (mainly fixed assets). Curious as to how crypto flows through to the balance sheet? I saw something saying it was accounted for as an intangible asset, does that sound correct? Company I worked for was way too conservative to dip into crypto, so I've never seen what accounting for it looks like in practice."
2021-06-08 14:19:56,stocks,The balance sheet would reflect an impairment loss for the drop in value. The cash flow statement would record the loss under Deferred Tax Impact.
2021-06-08 14:50:33,stocks,I was pretty sure they had liquidated their BTC...did they buy back in?
2021-06-08 08:00:16,stocks,Don't they only need to book the impairment if it's other than temporarily impaired? There are accounting rules for figuring that out but that's specifically built in so companies don't have to book every single price change on investments.

2021-06-08 12:09:35,stocks,"The accounting for crypto is up for much debate. Currently the generally accepted accounting is to record it as an intangible. It meets the definition of a financial asset/cash, if you interpret the accounting definitions a certain way. It’s an accounting minefield.

 But to be honest, it doesn’t really matter. As long as you adequately disclose it, so that informed readers, are able to understand what exactly happened."

2021-06-08 12:07:57,stocks,"Jesus you two. Just read the 10Q accounting policy. Refer to page 14. 

“We determine the fair value of our bitcoin on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on quoted prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is its principal market for bitcoin (Level 1 inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the bitcoin. If the then current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value so determined, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the price determined.

Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is identified. The impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for any subsequent increase in fair value. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other.”"
2021-06-08 12:41:17,stocks,"It sounds like the reason it's not cash & cash equivalents is because price is so volatile. Just looking at the name Deloitte gave me a Pavlovian response.

2021-06-08 14:14:15,stocks,That is what my reply said with fewer lines
2021-06-08 13:04:52,stocks,That seems a bit sketchy - how on earth did they convince their auditors to let them hold what is effectively a listed security at fair value rather than mark-to-market? - although I suppose tbf it’s arguably to their disadvantage as they’ll be booking any losses but no unrealised gains.
2021-06-08 12:41:55,stocks,Hahaha. I’m still here 😅
2021-06-08 13:32:41,stocks,You’ve said it yourself. It’s effectively a listed security. But it’s not. It doesn’t meet the definition of one. That’s why the accounting is so up in the air.
2021-06-08 12:48:15,stocks,"More power to you. Hopefully, you chose to be there. I ended up in accounting with no background whatsoever. Went from working in logistics to managing $300m in fixed assets (same company). When our CFO approached me about it I told him everything I did in college was to ensure I never had to do math again.

LYB is fine as long as we use platics and various chemical processes to produce all kinds of materials. ROK and ABB are significant players in automation and logistics. AWK, GWRS and WTRG are involved in water and gas infrastructures so if you'd like to use water in your house in the future, you might want to look into those... I would also throw in AAPL simply because of their current size and variety of possibly very lucrative future streams of revenue they're developing at all times (e.g., making microchips in-house). I also like BA.L as a defence contractor (ignore this if you think that there will be only peace and love in the world in the following 50 years) - it is on London stock exchange, there might also be ADR... And as for more speculative plays, i like PLTR and genomics stocks such as CRSP, NVTA, BEAM, FATE, DTIL etc. Not all of them will go to the moon but some of them probably will and that will more then make up for the ones that don't. I'm very bullish on genomics because i am involved in medical research myself and the most mysteries, unknowns, potential for new discoveries and treatments is in genomics and protein upregulation/inhibition (e.g., PTEN1 enzyme in relation to atrial fibrillation and other heart conditions, just to give an example)."

If you subscribe to the whole meme influencer thing, I think you can be ok because the fundamentals are there to hold it long term and cash in on the upswing without too much of worry for a downward spiral, like some of the others."

2021-06-08 16:47:27,stocks,Wish still isn’t too bad. They are hurt because China is facing high inflation and covid resurgence on a major city. Delivery is likely delayed and delivery cost is going up for them. They also face many lawsuits accusing them not honest about monthly active users pre ipo. Though with stock price going up some lawsuits will likely be dropped because people could be just angry about losing money before today’s surge. Their monthly active user seems to be down 7% q1 but even using fiscal 2019’s earnings they are still fairly valued at their current price. Their balance sheet is decent and still have some cash left. They are spending it on logistics to try improve delivery time right now. If you believe inflation and covid resurgence in China is temporary then they should have more some upside.

2021-06-08 11:22:08,stocks,"People are really keen on making the connections, while in the truth just because ''1 thing is happening and another thing is happening'' doesn't mean they are linked.

What has been happening with general market ?

Talking about tech and all the biggest stocks, they have enormous cash reserveres - [here is a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/niyift/15_companies_with_the_most_cash_reserves_traded/)

Honeymoon period from last year is over, now we have inflation to worry about, which makes money less valuable, then we have $ weakening like 10% and dread of interest rates rising.

Take an example an Apple or any big company, they have 200 bil in cash reserves, but now with natural market forces how much of those cash reserves, cash in general lose its value ? Its hard to calculate but if we just assume its raw 5% or raw 10% over a year that means Apple is now sitting on theoretical 10 - 20 bil loses. Which is enormous thing to take into account on their next earnings, its not going to show up there, but many people do know it.

Since the tech is so unfavorable, the value stocks and everything else started pumping like mad, like plenty of them are valued more mad than pre covid levels, which generally for many people doesn't make that much sense, economy is arguably worse after covid than it was before.

And there is probably so much more on why market is like it is, but you go on reddit, twitter, youtube and the retail of course is heavily focused only on meme stocks, that whay people start thinking GME and AMC and whatever is directly linked to the general market for some reason, because while general market acts like it does all they hear is meme stocks."

Potential loss is easy to figure out because it can be whatever amount you choose (If the price dips down to $X I will sell no matter what). A good Return to loss ratio is 3:1. Meaning if you put $1,000 in, you think you could gain $300 or lose $100, for example.

Then you run out of fumes and SI actually dropped so its all now how convoluted conspiracy one can make, though don't you dare to open investopedia and to actually verify some of the terms you all are using.

Hedge funds already lost 70 bils, bailouts happened, had dozens of opportunities to cover and SI, FINRA and everywhere you look at indicated everything very well.

Hardly, I'm betting on the success of a company I patronized as a child. Even without the MOASS.  Shorting is betting against the success of a company, and they're doing it in a greasy & fraudulent way (naked shorting).

If they covered **prove it**. They're not hidden trades, they get disclosed at some point.

Trying to paint me and other GME bulls as delusional and stupid is I'm sure very effective. But it's like water off a ducks back.

2021-06-08 17:56:13,stocks,">I'm betting on the success of a company I patronized as a child

Nothing wrong with liking the company, still doesn't make every price increase a short squeeze.

>Shorting is betting against the success of a company

Shorting is simply betting that company won't be succesful or more clearly, betting that the stock price will go down. Nothing to do with betting against success of the company, that depends on the company itself.

>If they covered prove it. They're not hidden trades, they get disclosed at some point.

And now what you talking about again ?

>Why no US Reporting? The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 required the SEC to conduct a study on real-time disclosure of shorting. The study was released in 2014 with recommendations that the costs of real-time short position reporting to the public were not worth the benefits. Instead, only daily aggregate data on short sales is reported to FINRA. This includes all securities - including NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE MKT, NYSE Arca and OTC equity securities. However there is no breakdown of the individual fund managers making up the aggregate short positions.

You are few years too late to know they don't have to disclose shit. We looked at short ratio jumping from 140% to 30%, looked at price action and volume, concluded that everyone had all the opportunity to cover since those cunts killed the GME buying. The shorts that are left ? Might as well be from very high price positions. Might be ever changing day trading even.

I did ask how can you verify that they all doing the ETF darkpool synthetic share hiding through bank repos ?

Now to talk about media, you do know they are writing these articles for the clicks ? More traffic comes to their site, more revenue, you werent born yesterday, were you ? Whatever the fuck gets you to click on it gets them add revenue, interest in their site, eventually subscribtions.

They will write whatever the fuck is going to trend and get them those clicks. Whole media has been in this pathetic state for a long while, not just financial one. 

>many of them specifically mentioning GME in the article for no relevant reason.

That is why they mention it, there are 10 mil dumb enough new potential customers that can click on it. And more you guys click on it, more it will work and generate ''forget this popular thing, here is the real shit''

Seriously were you born yesterday ? None of this is new. Then again your lack of knowledge about January is also concerning.

The delusion is where you start to associate everything with conspiracies, whenever what is happening can easely be explained with incompetence and greed. If r/Superstonk is not doing that, they are going full qanon over r/wallstreetbets though they have not been able to prove a single thing and been even disproven many times.

>Trying to paint me and other GME bulls as delusional and stupid is I'm sure very effective.

Being GME bull doesn't make one delusional. Screeching about short squeezes when there is not one, peeing your pants over a casual pump and thinking the whole world is out to get you is what makes one delusional."
2021-06-08 18:49:29,stocks,"""still doesn't make every price increase a short squeeze.""

I never said that.

""Nothing to do with betting against success of the company, that depends on the company itself.""

That's exactly what it is. You can kick and scream and say it's not all you want, but shorting means for one reason or another, outside of the company's control or not, you're betting the stock price will go down. Healthy companies' stock price tend to go up or remain stable. They don't go down.

""what you talking about again ?""

You've insinuated multiple times the shorts have covered. So prove it. What's so hard to understand? Show me who covered? And when? It's public information at some point.

You yourself say ""they don't have to disclose shit"" so why is it so hard to believe the same applies to SI?

"" you do know they are writing these articles for the clicks ? More traffic comes to their site, more revenue, you werent born yesterday, were you ? Whatever the fuck gets you to click on it gets them add revenue, interest in their site, eventually subscribtions.""

Thanks dude, I'm well aware of how the modern media machine works in conjunction with the internet. I wasn't born yesterday.

You're downplaying the significance of just how many freakin' articles and the frequency they have appeared from the same sources like MarketWatch and MF trying to control the narrative about specifically GME. I have never had such an experience with the media where I'm being pissed on and told it's rain. Forget GME is a catchphrase these days among people who have noticed the narrative being pushed this year.

""Screeching about short squeezes""

What did I say that qualifies as ""screeching about a short squeeze"" I've said even without the MOASS I like this stock.

I also don't think the world is out to get me. I know whales short on GME are out to get me to sell my GME for a pathetic gain; and stop buying it. You keep trying to paint me in a bad light instead of actually engaging me on the fundamentals of the stock.

2021-06-08 08:11:37,stocks,"For me it comes down to not being able to track the market minute-to-minute at my job. My job is intense enough that I need to concentrate for long periods and go a lot of the day without being able to look at my phone. With meme stocks and short-term trading, your profits can disappear very quickly if you are not watching and tracking throughout the day and it is just not worth having my mind distracted by the thought of losing money. 

For this reason, I have found that long-term investing is best for my lifestyle. I buy and hold companies with solid fundamentals for 3-5 years or so, has worked out very well for me thus far. I do most of my research after work hours and on weekends - which is basically just reading business books and articles and reading company reports. 

Call me boring but this suits my lifestyle better than anything else. Nothing against traders and those in meme stocks - there is room in the market for all of us!"
2021-06-08 13:07:30,stocks,"You have to be able to get out at the right time too.  Nothing has changed about Blackberry in this year, yet the stock ran up to $25 and created tons of bagholders as it melted back down to $8 after the winners cashed out.

Now it is popular again and maybe it will $25, but do you know when to sell or are you going to be holding down to $8 again?  I had a CB around 11, sold a bit near the top, but was still happy to turn a 40% loss into profit."
2021-06-08 10:52:03,stocks,A good question I can never find an answer to is what makes something a meme stock?  GME has solid fundamentals and a good long term forecast.  Is it a meme just because people like it and make rocket emojis?
2021-06-08 08:57:10,stocks,"It is more like a game of musical chairs than actual investing.

It can be fun and you can sure make money, just that you just can't afford to be the one standing (bagholding) when the music stops."
2021-06-08 07:41:22,stocks,"I can also double my money in 30 seconds at the blackjack table.

Take higher risk, have the potential for higher returns. That's how it typically works, in most areas of investing and even life."
2021-06-08 06:45:07,stocks,"Basically it comes down to massive uncertainty, GME/AMC are perfect examples atm. They may go up sharply, they may go down sharply, or they may hover for weeks/months. It's the sharp changes that are problematic, and make it risky. AMC is a good example. It's currently about $56/share. down a bit from it's high of 52 week high of 72, but up a ton from it's 52 week low of about $2. AMC has increased by 28X it's low and it's high was 36X it's low. It's up 4X what it was a week ago.

The real issue is it's not clear when it get in or get out, and being wrong will hurt, a lot. If the price goes back up to $72, then that's a decent profit, but what if it drops to $20 instead, that would be a very heavy loss, and you'd really have to consider HODL until it's hopefully goes up a bunch again at some point in the future.

Agree there is some good opportunities though."
2021-06-08 06:11:25,stocks,"Idk about snobbery but a lot of “purist” have been investing for years. Unlike a lot of the new retail traders since Jan. Most of whom don’t even know what a 10k is. Let alone a financial statement and how to read it. The “purist”  has most likely seen a lot. Reverse spilts, stock dilution, buy back, bankruptcy, mergers good earnings bad earnings. I know I’ve held companies in the past four years since I started that went through these scenario’s  listed. The only real constant that determines if a company survives  in all of that is the financials. A business is only profitable if they are producing something worth something. and (and a good management). It’s my opinion that the “purist” see all this and know this is not sustainable. I mean let’s be real is AMC really worth 30 billion?!?!? Well at roughly $ 60 a share that’s what the market cap is about. I believe if you look the “meme” stocks, you will find the financials are terrible. Most are loaded debt and haven’t had a profitable quarter in years. All of that being said I don’t believe it’s snobbery, I believe it’s common sense to some that this will not end well for most. AND with all that being said, I’m with you on the fact that there are some great short term opportunities some of which I have taken advantage of myself, but with much much caution. But that’s just like my opinion man!"
2021-06-08 09:49:21,stocks,"Investing is not the same as speculating or trading. Memes are speculating. Holding shares of companies based on fundamental financial information, including sustained success in earnings and earnings growth, is investing. 

Some people only do the latter. Please don’t yuck their yum."
2021-06-08 07:27:13,stocks,Do you trust yourself to sell the pump before the dump? Things look good now but eventually there will be bag holders.

2021-06-08 14:17:04,stocks,WealthSimple Trade is not great for US securities since it doesn't allow you to carry a USD cash balance. You're getting dinged with exchange fees with each purchase and sale. Consider switching to a different broker.
2021-06-08 14:32:35,stocks,"It’s risk, if you get in early and out on time it’s fine.  But the companies aren’t worth the share price. When you buy VTSAX and SP500 you can count on it being worth more in 20 years.  “Meme stocks” aren’t the same.  Just lucrative in the short term if you have the risk tolerance."
2021-06-08 16:40:15,stocks,"Lower risk tolerance, poor previous experience with meme stocks are my put offs. Also (this might just be me) i think people who complain after poorly timing a meme stock based off next to no information are annoying. Can probably put that down to snobbery (as much as i want to deny it lmao) but the warnings are out there and people continue to make mistakes. Wishing gains to all though!"
2021-06-08 17:57:05,stocks,"Yes and no:  
1. If you are a value investor, trained and skilled at identifying specific signals that a stock is oversold, you have probably not developed the skills and experience needed to trade highly volatile stocks, or ""meme"" stocks. Why would you risk your money trading in a style you are not prepared, or suited, for? That is a recipe for losing money. In the last 100 years of stock trading, and different stock trading systems, how many of those years were spent developing a system for trading ""meme"" stocks? So, realistically, there will be very few people who have focused on developing a trading system for these kind of stocks.  
2. Everyone has different risk tolerance. How many people, regardless of what approach they take to stocks, are comfortable being down 50-90% for days, weeks, months, hoping for a 100% or 500% gain? You have to really believe in the stock to take that much risk, and most people don't have good reasons to believe in ""meme"" stocks.  
3. If you are not good at trading a high-risk, volatile type commodity/equity/hot-potatoe/veneral disease/etc. you should AVOID those at all costs!  
4. Seriously though, heres the main reason. For most people, they aren't spending their time on reddit, or stocktwits or wherever the information comes from on new ""meme"" stocks. So by the time most people hear or learn about a new ""meme"" stock, it has already taken off 100%+, then you have to ask, should I buy at an all time high? Probably not, especially not when you just heard about the stock 24 hours ago, and have no idea what you are buying."
2021-06-08 13:59:35,stocks,"I'm invested in AMC and GME, and I think everyone who isn't is making a mistake, but I understand why they would stay away:

Thing about meme stocks is that they are more obviously a bet than others. The bet in AMC and GME is that they are both shorted significantly and will squeeze as a result. This is basically a hostage negotiation, investors don't care about fundamentals because it isn't about fundamentals, it's about short sellers being obligated to buy your shares.

The issue there is that whether these companies are in fact shorted to the levels needed for a squeeze is a matter of a lot of speculation, with basically all media outlets insisting that it is not the case. So in order to take this bet, you have to wager that the powers that be are lying about the market conditions. If that is the case, then ""fundamentals"" become almost meaningless. Fundamentals would represent at best the justification for why a certain company is selected to be manipulated up or down, but not an actual predictor of a stock's performance.

You can see why anyone invested in/accustomed to fundamental analysis would have a hard time swallowing that proposition."
2021-06-08 10:08:29,stocks,"I like the sentiment about long-term investing in companies that have solid growth and certainly have value. But, I don't know what to say about the people who say ""I like the stock"". They are not wrong, but, I don't think they are right either."
2021-06-08 14:14:33,stocks,"Meme stocks made me more money than my entire traditional investment account has to date. I am up 1776% on my GME! As long as you recognize that it is VOLATILE, SHORT TERM and must be watched CONSISTENTLY... it's a smart move. Let the purists be purists while we make money."
2021-06-08 12:34:14,stocks,"Because meme stocks are casino. Some people avoid going into casinos at all costs, some can get in, play a few rounds, and get out."
2021-06-08 09:30:23,stocks,"I mean, it has nothing to do with being an investing ""purist"", I think you're bringing in too much of a human element into investing. Why would I worry about trying to time the market when I can just dump a portion of my paychecks into indexes and forget about it - just checked my brokerage statement for the first time all year and I'm up 12%.

That way I can spend the rest of the time focusing on getting better at my job (which is in M&A/cap markets, so tangentially related) and building out my own technical skillset or vocational equity of sorts. 

Best cash yielding asset I can invest in is between my ears."
2021-06-08 07:37:53,stocks,cause it's not investing. it's pure gamble. i would never get close to it at least within 100km radius. i'd rather have a small gain than losing everything.
2021-06-08 08:40:17,stocks,"Why do you care ? Like why do people constantly come and recruit at r/stocks for pumps and dumps when we literally have like 10 sub reddits for meme stocks.

r/stocks reaction to memes is more like stfu rather than purism."
2021-06-08 08:44:50,stocks,"Meme stocks are all about luck, there is a tiny amount of technicals involved but most of them are pump and dumps. Its great if you exit near the top or don’t enter near the top— but how do you know where that is?"
2021-06-08 09:26:51,stocks,"It's not snobbery, it's experience.  We've all been there and learned expensive lessons.  Keep chasing memes and you'll learn those same lessons."
2021-06-08 09:03:22,stocks,"The problem with meme stocks isn't the way up. It's when the party stops and everyone's heading for the door. Do you trust yourself to be able to call it quits? Because people ""invested"" in meme stocks aren't investors. They are gamblers. And gamblers never know when to stop.

The only guys winning on meme stocks are the brokers, thetagangers and day traders."
2021-06-08 07:55:26,stocks,Hindsight is 20/20
2021-06-08 09:10:03,stocks,"Well, I think meme stocks can be fine cashcows if you know how to make that ""gain"" indicator into cash. I think it's important for new investors to see prices as temporary and thereby gains not equal to more money, unless you sell.

With several HODL'ers there seem to be no other exitplan than the fantasy of infinite money (which, if we are real, how realistic is it to make several million billionaires over night, even a fortnight from one single stock?). Which raises several questions for me. Are you gonna hold your life-savings-worth of investment in a stock that doesn't deliver after all? Are you never gonna sell and just donate your money to the void? How about taking losses on your savings for no apparent reason? What if you're not sticking it to the man (the hfs), but just doing nothing with your money?

I respect that it all comes down to belief in these cases. I mostly believe in gravity and such, and know that gravity can weigh pretty hard on you under certain circumstances...

Disclaimer: I invest in and hold memestocks, but I don't believe in the whole beliefsystem that exists around them"

Because of that loss I won't play with memes again even though some people can make a lot, a lot of people lose a lot too.  Fortunately for me it was a wash, made some on gme and lost it on BB haha.

2021-06-08 11:19:19,stocks,"Mostly the fact that the recommendation is coming from Redditors vs. Motley Fool or other mainstream.  Fact that retail has been in 'accumulation' phase instead of the institutions, so retail will gain the most, doesn't fit with the short hedge funds' narrative. Anyone who has really researched and followed this knows the fundamentals and outlook for GME is incredible, as well as probably many of the other ""meme stocks"" -- that's why, at least for GME, it was discovered in the first place by DFV, Burry, Cohen et al and why it's not going away.  The joke is that retail is just a bunch of dumb apes, but there are some brilliant minds on board.  The more I learn about what GameStop is doing within the company, the more I buy to hold for long term.  MOASS will be a bonus, but I wouldn't have 90% of all my investments there rn just for that."
2021-06-08 18:37:04,stocks,"I honestly don’t know what company’s fundamentals you were looking at but it’s not GME. Not only is it still struggling turn a profit, sales have been decreasing for 5 straight years and investment spending is largely nonexistent. And before anyone says, “well they’re trying to pivot the business, of course sales are low”, I’m excited to see how exactly they manage to do that without investing in the business and only having 500 million in cash and 1 billion in rapidly-depreciating, hard-to-liquidate PPE assets (which have already lost have of their book value). Oh and the debt to equity ratio is almost 1 so attracting investors (who aren’t redditors) is near impossible."
2021-06-08 14:32:38,stocks,"I’m all for the memes right now, but if I am being honest with myself, I have zero faith in GME. They might prove me wrong, but the e-commerce market is a fucking battlefield right now."

2021-06-08 08:15:00,stocks,"This. It’s not just meme stocks but penny stocks as well. A significant number of people pump such stocks by posting positive sentiment submissions or D&D. The ironic thing is that even without looking at their financials, their market cap is more than enough to tell you how overvalued these companies are. When you dive down their financial statements, it gets even better."
2021-06-08 07:23:27,stocks,Had me at the dude reference
2021-06-08 08:01:02,stocks,I bag held AMC after the initial 20 rise but only because I felt the shorts have not bought back their borrowed shares. The level of manipulation has blown my mind though!

2021-06-08 17:08:43,stocks,"just want to apologise for the word “snobbery” - perhaps I should just have said purists? Anyway, no offence meant. Interesting comments - thanks!"
2021-06-08 18:57:53,stocks,Sure if you’re getting in early. Buying AMC at $55 is nuts and a recipe for disaster. I guess I just don’t believe all this shit about it going to $1000+. Although I bought AMC puts and that’s looking like it’s going to be a mistake. I just don’t fuck with meme stonks anymore. I made 250% on GameStop but it was stressful. They are effectively gambling. At least with investing I have a good idea of value and I feel like I can put the odds somewhat in my favor with a thorough DD
2021-06-08 09:24:34,stocks,"Management risk isn't losing everything lol. You missed out on a lot of profit by not taking medium risk.

2021-06-08 16:09:05,stocks,"Not correct at all. You may like the long term outlook in GAmeStop and AMC but their market cap nowhere near matches it’s worth as a company.

I’m holding some AMC and it’s made me a lot of money so far, but I’m not putting it on my resume as proof I know what I’m doing as an investor"
2021-06-08 09:21:54,stocks,Take manageable risk. I doubled my money in the last year but wouldn't have been down more than 25% if everything crapped the bed. Yes it's uncertain but so are a lot of things in life. Opportunities like the current market don't occur very often. Yes it's much more risky but if you try to keep your emotions out of it and set goals and stick to your guns you can make a lot of money.
2021-06-08 07:47:56,stocks,"Quite. You could try buying a put option instead, but again what if it goes up or what if it doesn't go down? You could sell a covered call, but that's only slightly less bad then having stock, if it tanks.

Spreads are also an option, but the high IV makes it impractical for debit spreads. Though it might be viable for credit spreads give how high it is.

There is also *technically* the option of naked calls, but that is quite possibly the worst possible thing one could ever do with meme stocks is a good way to get your account wiped out as others have found out if they go up massively and quickly. Do not sell naked calls on meme stocks, or worst, a bunch of them."
2021-06-08 19:07:24,stocks,"At the end of the day the bet is a squeeze.  It has nothing to do with fundamentals,  but everything to do with liquidity.   It's a giant game of chicken with billions at stake."

2021-06-08 16:16:33,stocks,"It's easy to manipulate a larger unorganized group of people than a fellow hedge fund, and it makes it easy peasy when there's an information gap. Like for instance that they only have to disclose short interest twice a month.

2021-06-08 18:26:03,stocks,"TSLA, AAPL, AMD, PLTR have all been considered ""meme"" stocks. People just throw out the term like they do ""millennial"" with no real context or relevancy."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2021-06-08 08:28:30,stocks,"Why is no one talking about Russell reconstitution? Especially since a number of highly valued companies went public via SPAC last year?

Some thoughts:

- Russell allocations are based on market cap
- $9.1T is benchmarked against the Russell 3000
- A lot of companies went public the last year via SPAC, with fairly large valuations. Many of the bigger SPAC merger companies have valuations of $8B+
- Many of these companies will end up in the Russell 1000 given their market cap
- We can reasonably assume that some of these companies will receive ~0.02% of the fund allocation. Considering both the amount of shares that the fund needs to purchase + the benchmark funds, that could be >$1.5B worth of stock that will be purchased by the end of the month (for each company
- This also aligns with the technical indicators for all of these former SPACs, which are breaking out of multi-month downtrend lines one at a time
- So which companies should you be looking at? Here’s the list of preliminary additions to the Russell 3000: https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf

TL;DR - Many companies that went public in the last year have decent-sized market caps and will be added to the Russell 1000. Over $1.5B in stock (each stock) will likely be purchased over the next 3 weeks for some of these companies.

Why isn’t this a front page news story?"

2021-06-08 11:48:58,stocks,"My reports (friends lol) from Arizona, SoCal and Texas, over the weekend tell me that Topo Chico Hard Seltzer has been absolutely stripped clean from supermarket shelves, leaving only a [trail of White Claw remnants.](https://www.washingtonian.com/2021/06/07/a-50-year-old-veteran-bartender-on-whats-next-for-the-industry-as-it-reopens/) Right now, half of all cold alcoholic beverage space in refrigerator aisles are devoted to hard seltzer, up from a couple years ago, when they were a niche item.

Which indicates a few things:

1. COVID is over
2. Horny girl summer is alive and well
3. Hard seltzer is still super hot and growing wildly.
4. [Demand for Topo Chico Hard Seltzer is real](https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines/2021/4/22/topo-chico-hard-seltzer-shows-theres-room-for-more-seltzer)
5. Not enough shelf space or supply for Topo thus far has been made, leaving shortages
6. Molson Coors is set to benefit if they can increase production and shelf space to meet unserviced demand. Look for incremental sales growth to add a SAM-like multiple to their current valuation.
7. Topo Chico, using Coca Cola's distribution and marketing might, [will be the first hard seltzer to enter the Chinese market.](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202106/04/WS60b9823ba31024ad0bac38e4.html)
8. If after proof of concepts, Topo can be the first hard seltzer to come out with a bottled version, leveraging the tremendous name equity and look of their Topo Chico mineral water line, they could have a massive on-premise and hospitality hit on their hands. No one is ordering White Claw cans at a hotel bar, restaurant or club. Save that for the pool, beach and frat house. They could also break into the previously untapped older, well traveled Millenial/GenX category, who wouldn't be caught dead holding a White Claw can. A Topo seltzer with lime, a la Corona, looks so much better. I could see this eating away at Corona sales, especially right now when Corona sales are weak.
9. Long TAP. I have Jan 2023 calls at a 45 average strike, leaving me two Topo Chica summers to run.

\*\*Bonus: I see demand for Coors Banquet and Yuengling increasing for TAP due to the social influence of two hit shows--Netflix's Cobra Kai and HBO's Mare of Easttown."

2021-06-08 10:40:04,stocks,"Just gonna toss this out there - Latham Group (Ticker: SWIM).

  
No, it's not heavily shorted. It's also not heavily traded (Since IPO 4/23 average volume is at 369,000)

  
Here's the gist: their projected net annual sales growth for 2021 is 44-54%, which is after already tripling their sales in 2020 from 2019. For reference, in 2020, they did about $403, and for 2021 they're projecting north of $580.

  
This is a traditional ""Wall Street Bets"" proposition. I'm not suggesting it because it's heavily shorted, or shorted at all (although that could happen if WSB piled in), but more because it's a good company, with good fundamentals, an established global presence with offices on several continents, and strong future growth.

I am trying to figure out if a stock has already exited lock-up period post IPO. In the SEC filing, it states shares will exit lock-up after either second day post second earnings report or after the 'N'th day post IPO. My question is then: if the first earnings period ended the same month the stock IPOd, does it count into those two earnings reports included in the lock-up period? Or would that first earnings report be tied somehow to the IPO intrinsically, and the third factual earnings report be the ""second earnings report"" according to the SEC filing?  
I'm just trying to figure out if the lock-up period for a particular stock I hold has already ended.  
Any help is very much appreciated!!! :)"

This follows a mixed but muted Monday. Small caps had a good day, with the Russell up 1.4%. Tech rallied a bit as well (Nasdaq +0.5%). Large caps were off a bit, with the S&P and Dow down 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.

Meme stocks are where the action is. AMC and Blackberry both popped by double digits. Peloton was up 7% but not sure if that’s a meme stock. Biopharmas rallied, led by Biogen (up 38% on approval of its Alzheimer’s treatment).

Looks like investors are still waiting out Thursday’s inflation report. We do get JOLTS job openings (that’s redundant, btw. JOLTS stands for Jobs Opening and Labor Turnover Survey) at 1000. Expectations are for 8.3 million new jobs, an improvement from March’s 8.1 million, which was itself a post-pandemic high. Yes these are April numbers so not sure it will be widely watched, much less move markets.

In the meantime, enjoy the meme party. AMC up another 3% in the premarket. Blackberry 1% higher. Is 1847 Goedeker (NYSE: GOED) a meme stock? It’s up 18% in the pre-market. Space company Holicity (NASDAQ: HOLUW) is up 29%. Look to biotechs as well: AYTU up 32%,, DAWN down 19%, ATXI down 11%. Lots of movement there."

I said the only thing that was going to make me pay attention was a January 25th-esque day...and well...we sort of did have a mini-January 25th today. 

Reasons it's similar (it's not exact, but it's similar):

- The Nasdaq looked great in the first few minutes while the Dow was struggling.
- The meme stocks were going crazy at the same time.
- At just after 11, the memes got hammered and all of the major averages fell to their session lows swiftly at the same time.
- Recovery after that, almost like nothing happened.

You may want to say that this was coincidental but this IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED. It was more extreme on January 25th (the S&P fell to being down a percent and I'm pretty sure the Dow fell 400 points when this was at its peak), but it's similar.

2021-06-08 10:31:13,stocks,"I don't know if this kind of stuff is really organized or not (#conspiracy), but, for a while, it looks like big players in the market were pushing these inflation fears in the media and on TV, and rotation towards value stocks. That made a number of growth stocks go down and down.

Now the trend is reversing. This could either be organic, a short squeeze, or it could be that this was the plan all along. They tell you in the media that you should sell your tech and buy growth, but while that's happening, they're doing the opposite, and buying tech while it's low. Once they have enough of a position in tech and growth, they let the trend reverse.

I'm not a betting person, but my intuition would be that now, tech and growth stocks are headed towards new all-time highs. The inflation fears will magically subside. The morale of the story, as always, is that if you have companies you truly believe in, you should buy them when they are down, even when Jim Cramer and the other pundits suggests the end of the world is coming."

I think the whole banking infrastructure in the US is miles behind, no uptake on contactless technology, no instant payments. Both of those things have been standard around the world for the last 20years+.

Cashapp and Venmo are the alternatives, but they aren't banks, so you're money is not insured (I think), and they don't have physical cards afaik, no ability to take credit, and they don't offer savings accounts/interest. SQ is doing well I agree, but they have a lot of parts to their business. At one point their POS systems were the biggest part of the business, if it wasn't for cashapp I think it might still be.

I really don't know why this is the way it is, but the US is so backwards when it comes to payments and money. Still signing for payments is mental.

I've been paying on tap at my fucking farmers' market for three years now. But even in San Francisco I was still signing for my visa three years ago. 15 years ago Canada had the chip and pin, for the last five it has been tap. Lots of places *only* take tap in my neighbourhood. No cash, no tapless debit.

The US is way, way behind on fintech adoption. I can't even imagine what it's like in flyover country if SF and NYC are still back in the 90s. A lot of this pay infrastructure is codependent with fiber outlay too, which people don't seem to talk about much. Also America doesn't have a financialized economy (ie: the banks don't run the show), not in the way that Europe or Canada has, so there's significantly less monopoly power."

It's just a fact, I'm not betting on the future of the US fintech market in either direction. It just baffles me how far behind they are. It's also an interesting discussion because at least when it comes to the stock market, the US markets are the ones to invest in by far, EU markets are shit, but when it comes to fintech, the infrastructure in the EU is ahead by a big margin.

I know contactless exists, that's why I said there has been no uptake. If the country can't get it sorted out in 20 years, what makes you think that all they need to do is update some devices in shops and it will be good to go? The US of all countries too! There has clearly been a massive failing somewhere. From what I remember Europe did the transition in around 5 years. For reference Apple pay came out 6 years ago and still can't be used everywhere in the US. So something is definitely wrong. I realise now that in the US Apple pay must have sounded like this new amazing tech innovation that will help everyone, when in Europe, most people were thinking it was going to be completely pointless because we had everything it offers already. Just seemed like another way for Apple to get your data.

I don't know anything about sofi so won't comment, literally nothing. Maybe they'll be the kick the US needs. Venmo and cashapp seem like stop gaps. For reference Monzo first started out exactly the same way in 2015. It was a prepaid debit card that you topped up, and then you could use it however you like, but they have an amazing app, and sending money to friends is piss easy. Sounds very similar. Anyway after 2 years they registered to become a bank and grew from there. It just seems like venmo/cashapp haven't done that yet when they really should. Instant transfers are a thing every bank in Europe has anyway, so there's no need for a cashapp/venmo here. You can send money via phone numbers too. If cashapp/vemo did that, they could be one of the biggest banks in the US, and can increase revenue by offering credit cards/loans/mortgages and savings accounts, all from the same easy to use app. The newer generation would love it, it's a big reason why challenger banks have done so well in Europe.

>But I wouldn't for a second think that us fintech will not catch on and never catch-up. That's just ridiculous. Venmo, cash app, and sofi + others are the leaders here and are growing at astounding rates.

I don't think they'll never catch up, but it's going to take a lot more time, maybe 20 more years at this rate. It *feels* like it's never going to happen, but obviously it will at some point. It's interesting that you say venmo/cashapp are leaders in the US, but doesn't that show that traditional banks are failing? I feel like traditional banks should have all the same features as venmo/cashapp like Europe does. Maybe this is getting into politics a bit because the reason it worked in EU is because directives were established basically forcing all banks to update and get with the times. Maybe the US needs to do the same? In EU open banking is the new hot thing, god knows how long that will take in the US."

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Why does earnings growth cause share price to appreciate? 
Why would a company's earnings growth cause it's shares to become more valuable and consequently demand a higher price to acquire?

I mean how does earnings growth translate into more rewards for the investor and consequently drive up the value of each share?

Is the reward an ever increasing dividend over the years as a company does better and has more money to give out to incentivise investing? What if a company doesn't pay a dividend? For example, Amazon?

What is causing everyone to want to acquire shares of Amazon and consequently drive up its share value if there's no dividend payout?

Am I just buying into Amazon because I know others will rush to buy it and cause it's shares to appreciate and earn me more money when I sell some day?

Are we all just assuming that and that's causing us to buy shares?

Why is it automatically assumed that earnings growth would translate into some tangible reward for an investor and cause the share value to appreciate?

I mean other than share value appreciation, what reward do investors receive by owning a share of a company?

Are we just investing because we agreed upon beforehand that earnings growth will cause a share to appreciate in value?

What about if a company kept growing earnings at a good rate for 10 years but the share price just stayed the same?  

Would anyone have any incentive to invest in that company if it didn't pay out a dividend?

Why would I invest let's say $10k into that company that had no appreciation of its share price and paid no dividend?"
2021-06-08 03:06:53,stocks,"A share is a part ownership of the company. If a company is valued at $100 and only 100 shares exist, one share is 1% of the company and is worth $1. If the value of the company increases to $150, that same 1% of the company is now $1.5, so a company making more money than a previous year is a sign of growth that would indicate an increase in share price. It's ultimately beneficial because the sale of shares is a form of funding for that company that they can use to improve the business."
2021-06-08 03:46:50,stocks,"This question gets asked almost daily and it’s usually due to a misunderstanding of what stocks actually are. They’re ownership in the company. When I buy amazon I’m buying the right to that company’s profit. 

Profit is either directly paid out to investors as a dividend (in which case the share price decreases) or it is reinvested in the company (in which case the share price increases). Alternatively a company could also buyback shares which will also increase share price. All 3 methods give the shareholder the identical amount of value.

The idea you’re holding a stock solely to sucker someone else into buying it for more money in a few years doesn’t make much sense in this regard. As an investor you’re holding a stock because the company will ideally be more profitable in a few years and therefore worth more. Share price is dictated by the value of the company, not the other way round"

 Isn't share price determined by what a buyer is willing to pay for that share rather than merely dividing the total shares by the companies monetary value?"
2021-06-08 03:14:45,stocks,"Meaning investors are buying shares as a bet that the price goes up and the shareholder turns a profit when they sell. Another scenario is a person buying shares of a really old company that has had really stable growth over many years and using that collection of shares as a retirement fund that can grow fast enough to beat the rate of inflation, such a situation is also a tax benefit because it's taxed at a lower rate than short term profits."

2021-06-08 09:40:40,stocks,"> So share price is determined by what the buyer thinks is fair value? 

Buyer and seller. It’s both parties agreeing which sets the price. And correct, you are buying stocks to allow your money to work for you. You’re taking on risk which comes with the reward of profit over time.

If you’re still confused I’d recommend reading a few books or internet resources on what investing is and the fundamentals behind why it works. Seems like you’re trying to equate investing with gambling which is usually a dangerous way to look at it."

A company has value even if its profit is not being actively liquidated and distributed to investors. 

If you buy an investment house and never rent it out or live in it, it can still appreciate in value due to market conditions, supply and demand, and you can sell it for more later. Think of it similar to that type of situation.

It may seem like some kind of scheme “buying just hoping someone else will pay more” but these are real assets with real value that can change over time (for better or worse)."
2021-06-08 05:10:12,stocks,"But what is it about that earnings growth rate that would cause people to value the company more?

However, the market is built upon this trust. Would you buy a penthouse apartment in nyc for $100k right now, even if you are not allowed to rent it out/live in it for the life of ownership, I definitely would, because I know the market will value it in the millions.

In short, a DCF estimates the present value of future cash flows plus terminal remainder value. One of the inputs is revenue growth rate. If a company grows earnings more quickly, it will have more revenue in later years of the DCF than a company that grows more slowly. In other words, All other things being equal, a higher growth rate means a higher DCF value, meaning investors will pay more."

A giant step forward for sports betting in Canada, and the stepping stone for many outfits to take a legitimate stake in the Canada betting market. Need more info? Please feel free to read the below:

[https://www.mondaq.com/canada/gaming/1038772/bill-c-218-passed-by-house-of-commons-setting-up-canada-for-a-big-score](https://www.mondaq.com/canada/gaming/1038772/bill-c-218-passed-by-house-of-commons-setting-up-canada-for-a-big-score)

We're heading into the final stages of approval for this bill. Please note that the following dates are likely, but can adjust:

June 07 2021: Bill will be tabled to the Canadian Senate without amendments.

June 09 2021: Bill will be debated within the Senate for the third time. The team has worked through this in committee, so there will be a likely debate, but they have considered most previously-stated objections in the process. There will be concern from a match fixing angle, but they've identified that existing legislation covers this. Second, there will be complaints in regards to existing online purveyors of betting from one First Nation, but it has been considered as not a concern at the committee level.

June 15 2021: Final discussions and likely final vote.

Once voted, the bill will head to Royal Assent and become law. Sports betting purveyors will negotiate with provincial bodies to get their access up and running, in hopes for a Fall start. With this approval and accompanying revenue, shares of companies, like SCR, will finally turn from speculative to real. Current PTs are in the 40-dollar range."

Like i'm going to be kicking myself when the big one happens and everything tumbles down.

The covid ""Crash"" was a joke looking back and I'm glad I didn't pull out.

I have cousins, aunts, uncles, everyone all talking about stocks now like it's suddenly mainstream.

Is there any reason why it only goes up? If you look at the S&P history, the last few crashes were good 7 year long drops before recovery. From the 2008 crash onward though it has been straight up nonstop. It's almost freaky to look at with how much of a rise it has seen.

There is no reason to believe that economic growth has a cap on it. Humanity is far more efficient, productive and intelligent than it ever has been. 

Just think about farming alone. 300 years ago you're looking about 90% of the population were farmers, in 1900 it was about 40%, now it's about 1.3% of the American population and America is a net exporter of food. Someone working minimum wage can afford to feed themselves for a day with about 1-2 hours of work. That boost to human productivity is massive. So even though you might be mopping floors in Mcdonalds, you're still massively more productive than you would have been 100 years ago when putting food on the table took the majority of your working time. 

This progress of productivity is felt everywhere. Including with companies and their margins. They can produce more for less and you can consume more for less. The more consumption and gdp the more room for total gross profit.

Think about how insane it is that the internet age is only about 25 years old and the massive leap in productivity and utility that has added. Maybe the markets are still catching up to that leap forward. Now think about 1900, when cars weren't even mainstream. 

Of course the market has gone up for 100 years. And of course it's up as the widespread adoption of the computer has taken hold. 

These companies aren't fake (at least most of them aren't). Aapl really did produce $100B operation cash flow last year. Amzn really did have $420B in revenue. They did that by offering goods/services where one party agreed that their money was worth less utility than the product/service they were selling. It's none-zero sum game"

2021-06-08 09:07:41,stocks,"I'd say the current market is driven by three large factors, unprecedented Federal reserve actions, exponential technology growth and industry consolidation, and the growth of international wealth and investing.

As most people are aware of, since the 2008 crash the Federal reserve has basically kept interest rates near zero and printed pretty much unlimited amounts of cash. In previous periods this did not happen, after a crisis was over the Fed would normalize interest rates and decrease the cash supply. I realized QE would never end around 2011 because whatever administration ended it would have a crashed economy, and neither political party was willing to do that even if it was healthy in the long term.

Next, you have the rise of the tech giants and consolidation of most industries due to the internet and economies of scale. In the 20th century most industries were much more fragmented and you had more competition between small firms. Today, most industries are dominated by the largest players, from Apple to Disney to Google, most industries seem to be run by large oligopolies now.

Then, you have the rise of international wealth and sovereign wealth funds, which increases the amount of money that are flowing into these oligopolies.

All of these factors are driving what we're seeing today, who knows how long it can go on."

I don't know exactly how many people hate their landlords and are giving them as little as possible during these tying times. But people who make almost $100,000 or 200,000 jointly in a year are under protection act.

To me that's a lot of money to be considered in need of government assistance. I would guess $60,000 or $120,000 jointly would be plenty. But I guess not.

One day, within 4 years those protection extensions will end and there will be a lot of people looking for a new place to live. IDK how the housing market will react to that. Maybe rising prices because they saved enough money to buy their own homes. Or maybe because the landlords raise rent due to the loss of income over the last X amount of time.

I'm not particularly thrilled with the average redditors analysis either, but the commonly understood idea they are referring to is that there are limitations, be they technological, energetic, resource-based, etc that will/do put real physical limits on economic capacity.

>There is no reason to believe that economic growth has a cap on it. Humanity is far more efficient, productive and intelligent than it ever has been. 

Humanity is more productive, even on a per capita basis, however, one cursory glance at the physical world indicates that how we are achieving this productivity has costs that are externalities from our economic system that will pay dividends both now and in the future.

The oceans are an absolute disaster.

I won't keep going, but I will just state that everything we do from mining to deicing the roads has massive consequences and very few of those are ever being taken seriously.  We are very much building towards a world that is largely uninhabitable and will limit population growth and/or require massive investment just to hold on.  We can replace our Aquifers and the the Colorado River in CA by building desal plants, but then we need to build massive solar and wind resources just to power those and then huge pipeline systems to carry that water to all the places and farms that require it, all of which needs pumps because the sea is lower.  We could build skyscraper indoor farms that produce more food with less inputs, but we would need nearly four hundred 100 storey buildings with a 1 acre base just to feed NYC.  Currently there are only 24 buildings in the world 100 storeys or taller, just to put the scope in perspective.  

We need more solutions than we have and in order to implement even the ones we have, we need a much larger and better educated workforce. 

>Just think about farming alone. 300 years ago you're looking about 90% of the population were farmers, in 1900 it was about 40%, now it's about 1.3% of the American population and America is a net exporter of food. 

And how has that been achieved?  3 things have made that possible, in my opinion.

1.  Genetically modified crops (which is a good thing, I'm 100% for GMOs.  Tomatoes aren't a naturally occurring plant, they have been genetically modified using Mendelian techniques)

2. Fossil fuels.  The labor to till, seed, plant, irrigate etc have been replaced by fossil fuels.  This cannot continue forever

3.  Large scale chemical manufacturing and dispersal.  Nearly everything put on plants from fertilizers to herbicides to pesticides to preservatives.  This is largely unsustainable, has nasty effects on soil, water, insect populations and ecosystems.  This is before you factor in that some if these are petrochemicals or made from natural gas.

The point is that we have reduced labor and increased productivity in ways that cannot continue forever.  Your point that this is somehow indicative of forever rising economic outlooks doesn't imagine the massive problems in this space.  Nobody knows what the horizon on decreased agricultural output is, but it's not a super rosey picture.

>Someone working minimum wage can afford to feed themselves for a day with about 1-2 hours of work. 

If they eat complete garbage, yeah.  A person making 7.25 takes home maybe 5.40 an hour, probably less.  Two hours barely covers one meal at Chipotle with a drink.  It could cover a chicken and some small additional items at a grocer, but who are we kidding?  They don't have an apartment at minimum wage anywhere in the country.

>That boost to human productivity is massive. So even though you might be mopping floors in Mcdonalds, you're still massively more productive than you would have been 100 years ago when putting food on the table took the majority of your working time. 

What? No.  Productivity gains by sector are wildly different.  When aggregated, it looks like everyone is more productive, but when disaggregated it tells a very different story.  Slinging a mop in 2021 is the same as slinging a mop in 1980.  Maybe the floor detergent is a little better, but I doubt it's that impactful.

>This progress of productivity is felt everywhere. Including with companies and their margins. They can produce more for less and you can consume more for less. The more consumption and gdp the more room for total gross profit.

While productivity has increased in most industries, margins have increased largely by paying people less.  The decoupling of productivity gains and wage increases tells the story of bottom lines as well as anything else.  Labor has been a decreasing cost per unit of output since 1970, when it peaked.

>Think about how insane it is that the internet age is only about 25 years old and the massive leap in productivity and utility that has added. 

Technological revolutions tend to do that.

>Maybe the markets are still catching up to that leap forward. Now think about 1900, when cars weren't even mainstream. 

Look at the average PE of a cloud computing company or software company and make the case that the market is ""catching up"".

>Of course the market has gone up for 100 years. And of course it's up as the widespread adoption of the computer has taken hold. 


Past performance is not an indicator of future performance.  The last 100 years have been environmentally stable and the last 80 have been extremely politically stable when compared against the whole of human history.  Your chance of dying in war in 2021 is the lowest it has ever been.  All it would take to change that are mass migrations from climate change or other environmental disasters, sufficiently rising prices, aggression between China and the US, or Russia and the EU, or even just the sum of environmental issues and the late response to them.  

I'm not saying any of this will happen this year, or even that it will happen at all.  Your point is that the economy can grow forever and it really can't.  

You know that bullshit line that when the govt runs a deficit you are ""mortgaging your children's future""?

If we wanted a real sustainable economy we would encourage tighter regulation enforcement with a powerful, well funded agency that treats crimes against the economy like the war on drugs.

- unrestricted capitalism which punishes poor people, allows giant tech companies to go near-unregulated/become too big to fail, and funnels wealth to investors + the already wealthy. This isn't a critique of the system, just a statement of fact.

As long as these things continue, stocks will continue to rocket up. But there isn't any scientific law that these features need to remain. Stocks are just a representation of companies, not something that has to go up. 

Here are some plausible risks:

- Maybe China manages to undermine American companies and globalisation is undermined by nationalist economics in a range of countries?
- Maybe interest rates rise at some point?
- Maybe the growing mass of people not participating in this orgy of wealth creation manage to elect someone who is hostile to the current system?

This isn't to mention things like climate change which may change the endless consumption model of capitalism or the eventual ageing (and shrinking) of the global population

Just as easily as you can say ""it has gone up a lot in recent times - this means it will go up forever"", equally it could be said ""it has gone up a lot in recent times for certain reasons that aren't guaranteed to go on forever - we are overdue to revert to the mean"""

Humanity has an interesting way of naturally solving the problem. People were very worried about oil running out, they even taught “peak oil” in California curriculum. What actually happened? Oil prices rose, incentivizing new technologies leading to less scarcity. There are now more known and reachable oil reserves than ever in history and the world consumes more oil than ever. As the price rises (especially above $70 a barrel) the more financially advantageous it is to extract oil from more expensive reserves. As the price rises, the better tesla and nuclear looks, lowering oil demand. The problem solves itself in a weird supply-demand dance.

I think this is true with most resources. It's hard for me to think of an exception."

At the same time that real wage increases have failed to keep up with inflation, people can see share buybacks continuing in their companies.

Point u/msnebjsnsbek5786 is making is a meta argument. It's not whether or not one solution is realistic over another. They're talking about the framework where those decisions are made, and when you introduce another dimension to the problem (of time) then the cost benefit analysis changes over time.

i.e. The rationality of the people that you invoke in your argument can change given the circumstances. If things get bad enough, all of a sudden, relying on another country for food starts to make a little more sense, and if they start over charging or the supply is just too unreliable, then self sufficiency at high costs are justified, etc. But the important point is that there will be food one way or another."

I think the main question is what would happen to the stock market. The price of SPY is secondary. What is a safe speed to unload SPY & co and can it actually be managed if people just want to take everything out immediately."
2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Skyworks absurdly undervalued considering the sector it’s in? Tech sector has been and always probably will be overvalued, but even while Skyworks is overvalued on its 12 month price to earnings ratio which is about 25. However the average PE ratio for Tech as a whole is 37+. 

It’s currently trading at 169 and some change, but it could be valued at 229$ given their insane growth in a sector they will dominate for many years to come."
2021-06-08 05:22:28,stocks,Skyworks produces 5G modems. They made a lot of cash from AAPL AFAIK - but AAPL is said to make its own 5G silicon soon. So who really knows if the growth can go on like this?
2021-06-08 09:17:47,stocks,what is your target price of 229 based on? where is the 'insane growth'?
2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"How do you DCA? If I want to DCA, is there any specific interval or amount? Like can I do 10% of my total every 1 hour so in 10 hours I invested all my cash? Or could I invest 25% of my total money every 2 weeks so after 8 weeks I invested all my money. Is there an optimal way to do this? I’d guess that the smaller amount but more frequently would be better but I have no idea. What percent of my total should I invest and over what period of time is what I’m asking. Thanks"
2021-06-07 23:21:56,stocks,Depends how much you have and how cautious you are. Can be different for anything just whatever makes you comfortable
2021-06-08 02:05:56,stocks,I think if you invest all your cash in 10 hours that’s basically lump sum
2021-06-08 10:31:10,stocks,"The faster you put the money in, the higher your expected return AND the more risk of loss you incur. The slower you put the money in, the lower your expected return AND the lower your risk of loss."
2021-06-07 23:39:39,stocks,Dca if you have a lump sum that you’re investing would depend on the size of the lump if it’s 12k I’d do 1k a month for a year.  If it’s a lump sum of 250k I’d do 5k a month for 4 years.  If it’s an income stream I’d do a % of that income either monthly or each pay period.
2021-06-07 23:39:46,stocks,"
 - Time in the market beats timing the market.    
 - Therefore sitting on the capital for DCA instead of investing lump sum on average *loses money*.    
 - If you are investing new money each paycheck: That isn't what DCA is. DCA implies sitting on capital you already have and investing it slowly over a scheduled period; new money is new money, DCA is a strategy on *already acquired* money (people often confuse scheduled new investment with DCA, apples and oranges).       
 - You should set your risk tolerance/entry & exit plan/story of the stock before you invest, enter and exit in accordance to *that*.    
 - DCA's ability to mitigate volatility is vastly overstated, since sometimes it exposes you to greater IV and other times lesser IV, which averages to similar IV to lump sum.    
 - DCA could perform better or worse, nobody knows the future but statistically the default assumption is it performance worse."
2021-06-08 10:41:17,stocks,"If you have a significant amount of money to put into the market, I read that it is recommended to DCA over the course of 36 months to weather off important downtrends of the market. 

Im personally investing 4% of what I currently have saved up per month, so that in ~2 years I’ll have a strong base within the ETFs and long term dividend stocks I chose.

I count on getting a job after these two years of studying so will probably continue to do this but with more important amounts."
2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about selling within long position I’m new at this so I’m still learning. I bought into a stock at a bad price, started averaging down and then the stock tanked so I was in the red for a while. I held the whole time never selling for a loss. I’m still in the red but  I figured I’d start buying and selling the same stock since I understood how the price was fluctuating and could make money on it now. So say my position was 1.5 and the stock price was 1.2. I bought 100 shares at 1.2 and sold 100 shares at 1.25. Now my app is saying I lost money on the transaction. Is that true?"

2021-06-07 23:26:29,stocks,"It could simply be the accounting method you have selected if I’m understanding you correctly.  You can change your accounting method selection to one that reflects FIFO, LIFO, lowest price out first, highest price out first.  This will change how your app computes the cost basis."
2021-06-07 23:24:14,stocks,The average price of the stock you hold as compared to the price you sell will give you your basis.
2021-06-07 23:18:30,stocks,"I’m not really sure what you’re asking. Are you saying your average cost is 1.5?

But you’re buying a lot for 1.2 then selling it for 1.25 and the app would register a loss because the average cost is still 1.5?"
2021-06-07 23:25:12,stocks,"Do you exit your initial position? Your post is a little hard to follow, can you please try to clear up the confusion. It sounds like it is taking into account the loss from your first purchase  but it's hard to say without some clarification"
2021-06-08 06:51:36,stocks,"That's cost basis tracking (Tax lots). The method you are trying to use just used is ""LIFO"" (Last In First Out) works rather well for tracking trading profits. However, that method increases your tax bill. Remember showing trading profits means tax liability, as you owe taxes on all your profits unless they are offset by losses.

It's for this reason that I use tax lot method that maximizes my paper losses (basically highest cost, so it always uses the highest cost, while using LIFO (separately calculated outside of the broker) to keep track of gains. Paper losses just become wash sales until they end up profitable. This minimize the amount I pay for taxes as long as the stock isn't well above my cost basis."

2021-06-07 23:29:52,stocks,So no matter what it’s going to base it off the average. Even if I buy and sell the same amount of shares? I guess I don’t quite understand why that would be the case.
2021-06-07 23:24:19,stocks,"Right, my realized p&L is saying I’m in the negative."
2021-06-07 23:35:31,stocks,"I know, I’m confused myself so I’m trying to explain it with numbers. Here’s the best I can do

I bought 100 shares at 2$. The price dropped to 1$ and I averaged my position down to 1.5 without selling anything. 

Then I bought 10 shares at 1$ and sold 10 shares at $1.3. So technically I made $3. But my app must be basing it off the average so it’s saying my realized p&l is $-2.

Does that make sense?"
2021-06-08 07:47:34,stocks,"Thank you, that makes much more sense."
2021-06-07 23:33:13,stocks,"Because the value of the shares you hold depends upon the price for which you purchased them. If you bought 100 at 1 and 100 at 2, you have 200 shares with a value to you of 1.5. Now when you buy more shares, the value of the shares you already hold gets figured in to accurately reflect the amount you have invested."
2021-06-08 00:13:34,stocks,"That would make sense especially since you’re trying to make it out of that red hole you are in when you started this strategy. It’s saying you’re in the negative because you’re still in the negative from wherever you started. Your goal is to get back to positive, so as long as that average keeps lessening and getting closer to 0 then you’re on the right path. If it works ultimately that number will put you into the positive. That’s all assuming you’re selling at a higher price than you’re buying. You can keep averaging up basically. It’s just showing you the average of your total since your initial investment cost."
2021-06-07 23:50:41,stocks,"Ya, its basing it off the average price, sorry I was confused about if you had sold the initial position or not, clearly you held"
2021-06-07 23:44:14,stocks,It’s first in first out (FIFO) usually
2021-06-08 07:49:57,stocks,"No problem, note I clarified above that I track LIFI cost basis outside of my broker (as typically they will only track one cost basis for you, so if you want to use multiple, you need to track them separately)."

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Does anyone else feel that volume charts are useless? I've spent an entire 3 hours trying to go over this shitty chart and feel like I wasted all my time. The problem with the volume chart is that the information is always too late. And on most ocassions the information has no significance with the price. 

* If you see a steep rise and then see the volume supporting it then it means ""the price is going to remain up"" except when it's followed by a price drop + lots of red volume.
* You can make out whether a price would increase by checking the volume. If there's a lot of green volume and the price hasn't increased then it will increase soon. - Never saw this materializing in the charts.

Just curious. Does anyone use voume charts or are they truly completely useless? If you do use, how are you using them?"
2021-06-07 21:58:16,stocks,"In my opinion:

1: Volume = Liquidity. Liquidity is good for getting in and out of a position.

2: Volume = confirmation of price movement. 

Down 5% on 1/10th volume? Who cares. 

Up 10% on +300% daily volume, then probably something to it.

Otherwise, you're right, it doesn't really matter, anything can and will happen, so good luck."
2021-06-07 22:08:30,stocks,"I never bother with volume. I just look at 200 and 50 SMA, and RSI, all on the 1-year/daily chart, with heiken-ashi."
2021-06-07 22:37:11,stocks,"Information is not meant to be viewed on an island, nor in 2D (visuals). Add 4D (time) and a pattern will emerge.  

Charts help validate what happened after the fact; when other known factors are added, a pattern can emerge that helps predict future movement. Depending on your skill of determining ranges and metrics, this can be used to weight your hedges, spreads, etc. My chart skills are shit so I rely on others for those; instead, I rely on my DD in sectors to decide what I’m bullish on and if volatile, I will look for their ranges to decide bullish puts that allow me to add to my core position."
2021-06-07 22:41:16,stocks," 1 min volume goes up n down alot in that min, that's the black lines. For me, It really only tells you how ""active"" the stock is being traded. I like to watch the MACD to see if it's going up or down. Nothing can tell the future but it show how it's trending."
2021-06-07 22:09:03,stocks,"No.

In 1929, they were a clue about sentiment and direction. The market went dramatically up, than down... Several times, always with sustaining volume.

What it shows: uncertainty reaching a peak.  It crashed within the week.

BTW, same thing happened in 1987.  But that was caused by a lack of circuit breakers and an increase in program trading. Still, volume + direction could be used to bail out before the crash.. I know, I bailed.

To take your side: it's far less useful with lower trading costs and higher day trade volume.  Nobody can truly segregate day trades from true investments. You can only make an educated guess."

I put 5k in one stock (edit: CLOV) this morning and got a $500 gain. Now what do people do? Do they sell in the morning and get that $500 gain and then use that $5,500 to invest again, or simply hold for a long period like a year? Thanks"
2021-06-07 20:51:45,stocks,Your choice.
2021-06-07 20:52:40,stocks,"Depends on the stock. If it’s a long hold or not. My longs are companies like Disney, Facebook apple. My shorts are some airlines, and other entertainment companies. If I made $500 in one day on a short I’d sell and probably reinvest the original 5K but keep the $500. If I made it on a long I may not touch it, but sometimes will take out $200 gain on a big one day gain like that. Do you mind me asking what stock it is? Sounds like a good one."
2021-06-07 20:50:44,stocks,So before you enter into a trade you should have calculated how much you expect to make from that trade. Cash out when you get there and don’t look back.
2021-06-07 20:58:22,stocks,"You called it a gamble. If there's not much more about the company you understand, cash out. 

I have a gamble play that I expect to move 5-10 percent in either direction on any given day. 

I also have a gamble play that I expect to more or less stay flat over the course of the next year and a half, but at some point that I can't predict, I expect it to go up significantly. 

In neither of these cases would I cash out after a 10% day in the green, but that's because I've done lots of homework on both and I have a strategy for them. If you can't say the same for the play you made, take your win and run."
2021-06-07 21:09:06,stocks,"If you can afford to stare at the screen all day, jump into a trade and jump out with a quick profit and don’t look back. Then rinse and repeat on another symbol. Don’t worry about “I sold too soon” A win is a win. If that stock goes down and you begin losing more than you can afford, cut your losses quickly. 
I’ll stay in a single trade for 5 minutes or all day... depending on its pattern, it’s volume, it’s news catalyst, etc. 
sometimes I’ll follow a pump and dump just for a quick win."
2021-06-07 22:43:44,stocks,You're going about it wrong.  Buy an etf like VTI or QQQ and keep adding money every week until you retire.
2021-06-07 22:08:48,stocks,"Think in % instead of $

You put $5k and it's up 10%. Is 10% enough for you to close your position? Do you think it can go more than 10% or is 10% more than what you expected?

IMO 10% gain is not enough."
2021-06-07 21:01:43,stocks,"I am fluid with things for the most part, some I buy to hold and build on and collect the dividend.

2021-06-07 21:23:13,stocks,Stocks like that may go up and down like that multiple times. You might be able to jump in and out. That one is mentioned quite a bit right now on Wallstreetbets. Strong momentum. I would hold for 50% or more. Go check out what their saying. Might help. Don't get caught holding that bag.

2021-06-08 08:19:06,stocks,So many choices. It's really up to you. Some would take their 5k out and leave the 500 with a stop loss at entry price. They keep doing this over and over to accumulate holdings. Another option would be to set a stop loss so that it sells if it drops. Either way it's up to you
2021-06-07 21:06:49,stocks,CLOV. Yeah it's a nice gain but I also wouldn't mind holding and seeing where it ends up in a couple months or year.

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Are market trends intrinsic or are they a result of buying/selling patterns created by people? I’ve started to get into charting and such, and I was wondering wether trends/patterns are intrinsic (they just happen because they happen) or if they are only there because people know about them and make decisions based on the particular pattern. 

For example, bull or bear flags. When a stock breaks through the bottom/top is it only doing so as a result of a large amount of people buying/selling because they have identified that pattern and anticipate it moving one way or the other? Or does the stock break through merely because that is the path it takes?

I’m not sure if this makes sense or not, any insight would be much appreciated."
2021-06-07 23:59:21,stocks,"On the long term, like over the course of quarters or years, it's almost all about the fundamental value of the company. Over the short term, like hours to weeks, there's a lot of psychology at play. I would suggest ignoring all but the most basic forms of technical analysis (support and resistance) in favor of learning about fundamentals and how to value a company. When technical analysis works it's either luck or a self fulfilling prophecy because other people are assuming it will work and buying and selling accordingly."

Technical analysis gives PEOPLE UNDERSTANDS IT and USE IT WELL a statistical advantage. No more, no less.

Yes it is self fulfilling for psychological reasons but that's.definitely not a small features. Look at CRSR and tell me the 30ish area is not a strong support.
Look at AAPL and tell me there's not a strong trend line that acted as support since April 2020.

True, many people focus on short term but we can definitely see many patterns lasting decades, and that also applies for indexes.

Wedges/Flags also have their meaning, minor impact in my.opinion but still many example of them working well in the right conditions.

I personally only use supports/resistances/trend lines, Fibonacci retracement levels, RSI and Volumes for confirmation.

Yes there are examples of people completely ignoring fundamentals on a large scale, but most of those will correct over the long term by falling harder than defensive stocks in crashes. Fundamental analysis is more correct than technical analysis just as inside information is more correct than fundamental analysis. TA isn’t completely useless, but there are very very few papers showing any actual advantage. I really don’t care how many people claim it works if there’s virtually no academic proof. The reason support and resistance lines have some merit is because people use them without knowing about them. Someone who just picked up robinhood can look at prices and think “well it went back up after reaching this price last time”. Fundamental analysis clearly doesn’t always work either or the people who use it would be beyond rich, the reality is that it’s absurdly hard to beat the market in the long term but fundamental analysis is your best bet to do so."
2021-06-08 01:37:38,stocks,Intrinsic value suggests that something is actually worth something. The difference between the absolute highest and absolute lowest price you would pay for the Apple building is the proof you need to validate the fact that intrinsic value does not exist.

But absolutely nothing at all is worth anything intrinsically. Everything is fleeting and constantly experiencing rapid decay and new growth. Life as we know it is a constant state of flux.

Value is a fictitious concept that is created and ascribed by human beings. It is inconsequential and relatively meaningless.

Basically, I have been following stocks for a few months now, and I would really like to get into the game, so to say. The biggest barrier for me is how to do that. I have some friends who use apps that allow for buying/selling stocks without a fee (Wealthsimple, for example) and I have others who do it straight through their bank (however this comes with a fee for every buy/sell). I am curious about which route you folks would recommend for a beginning investor, and what the differences really are?  
  
I do not intend to make overly big purchases starting out, as I like to play things safe (especially being brand new to it all outside of reading about it). So it feels like the free-trade apps like WS would be the smarter route for me. However, I feel a bit concerned giving a third party sensitive banking information, and I feel like there has to be some net positive to the pay-to-trade method, otherwise nobody would do it?  
  
So, in short, I would like to know the best method to actually start getting into the stock market, and I would greatly appreciate any help there. I also apologize again if this isn't the place to ask, but it seems like the best place to do so."

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Peter Lynch's 10 mistakes every investor makes ""It can't go any lower."" Never make such an assumption. A bad company can and will go lower.

""How much higher can it go?"" Selling too early just because a stock goes up.

""They always come back"" Don't assume a stock price will rebound, look at the fundamentals not the price.

""How much can I lose?"" A cheap stock price doesn't = a good value. You can lose % at any price.

""It's always darkest before dawn."" It's a terrible business but it's down 80%! Buy at a discount? no, it still has room to drop.

""I will sell after rebound"" Buy at $10, it falls to $6, and you think ""If it goes back to $10 I'll sell. Well if you think that you should buy more! A key to remember, the stock doesn't know you own it. It may never get to $10 again as well. Don't take it personal. Make decisions based on fundamentals.

""Don't worry, I own conservative stocks"" (utilities...)

""Look at the money I lost because I didn't buy"" FOMO? Hundreds of stocks go up double digits. Don't worry about other stocks. Focus on ones you know. You can't lose money on a stock you don't own.

""Stock is up I must be right / Stock is down I must be wrong."" Stocks go up and down a lot each year. The ups and downs don't mean much in the short term.

Avoid longshots. Investing based on rumors, comments, anything other than sound financial analysis and valuation.

Now ultimately you have to make a decision, and you can be confident in your decision.  When the story changes, adapt, and adjust.  If it was wrong, learn and move onward.

  Chances are if you are investing in a wonderful company that you are knowledgeable about, it will be a winning investment.  When you listen to anonymous chatter and toss your money into something you dont know, well you might have more fun in vegas because they at least serve free drinks.  It is a long game, as Peter Lynch says you only need to hit once or twice.  Dont use leverage, dont borrow and keep yourself in the game as long as possible.  Meaning dont whipe out on crazy odd bet.  Take profits when the price seems lofty but I would not exit completely unless you have lost all faith in the company.

But volatility is also a real thing and if you are buying in a valley of a normal price fluctuation then you're usually going to make money.

More importantly, know your time horizon. Because some do come back but you have to know if you can afford to wait with your money tied up for that long.

OTOH there are many stocks or funds/ETFs that you can be fairly sure not to take a loss on if you hold them long enough after a market downturn. VOO is a good example.

2021-06-08 01:57:50,stocks,"Any advise on how to counter the above thoughts?

So far I can think of are;

1) look at the fundamentals. If it's out of whack, like amc.  Sell immediately or don't play the game. Never get sucked into the hype or fomo. That's how you buy high and sell low in absolute despair..

2) put in stop losses. Dont go down to 10% and your cut losses if the stock drops too much. I think it gets harder to make up for the loss as the stock drops further and further, so don't believe in the idea that it will rebound. Because that's never a given.

3) Don't be greedy and take your wins as and when you can. Likewise, if you still believe that the fundamentals are in order, keep your money in the stock. But again, refer to point no.2 which is to put in stop losses so you don't go into red territory.  You can always buy back in when prices drop. 

4) look for bargains and try to buy into a stock at a good price. Study historical price and trends over the past few months and quarters. Look for reasons why the stock is due for rebounds. Maybe it's better quarterly targets, more streamlined business, & etc.

5) Try to make more long term plays. Day trading doesnt always work out."

  Well..found SPACS I February..right before the crash.  Road it down.  Bought ""safe"" ITM options.  Bought every dip.  Literally through rules and good sense out the window.  In a week I was down over 40%.  The next couple months compounded the issue.  Also for caught up with everyone else holding and hearing that it will bounce back...this is a great deal. Lmao.  Never would have thought I would have made that mistake.  If I was looking just at charts I would have been out after a day.  Allowed reddit chatter and opinions to influence my trades.  Have to cut emotion out completely..like SPOCK 🖖... Or the TERMINATOR."

2021-06-07 23:39:40,stocks,But unlike most people who know these things but don't invest that way he both knew them and acted on that knowledge. That's the hard part. The average investor in Magellan made low single digits during that time because they bought in and sold out in fear and greed.
2021-06-08 10:06:28,stocks,"why would they have?

when you buy a stock you buy part of a company

if the company has solid fundamentals, is it going to lose money? (The answer is no, otherwise it wouldn't have solid fundamentals)

invest in good companies with good products and good management, then just wait. bail out only if the things that made it a good company change and make it no longer a good company.

stock prices are not rational, but eventually, undervalued stocks will catch up with reality and you'll win if you have hung on for the ride."

I very rarely go to a full position all at once. I buy in 2 or 3 times. It helps. I'm not really a Peter Lynch long term investor though. If I was doing that I would spread it out even more. 

Sometimes I buy for the long term. These days shorter term trading is (was) working better for me. I recently sold everything and taking the summer off for some r&r."

2021-06-07 22:09:07,stocks,"I'm pondering this business idea of mine, as I have the same impact on the market.

I will start notifying the company that I intend to invest in before I do it and explain the simple facts that IF I were to take a position, their market cap will immediately decrease 10%, maybe more. For every day I hold, it will continue to decrease. If I hold for long enough, they will likely go out of business, and so will I. This is not good for anyone.

So, they can save themselves and me a fair amount of money and agony by just sending me a check for 10%-15% of my principal, and I will not invest in them. 10%-15% on a $100K is nothing for them compared to seeing the value of the entire company drop. 

Who would say no to that?"

2021-06-08 13:03:47,stocks,"I can’t tell if this thread is sincere or not, but either way I’m going to translate this advice.


Don’t make your investment choices based on emotional sentiment, if a stock goes up (or down) a lot theres going to be an emotional response and instead focus on the fundamentals.

Your other comment, if you have a consistent source of income this should never be a problem, if you can only afford $50 per week (or even month) to invest that’s great, he never said you had to invest a 1k every month, just that you’re consistent. If you have a problem doing this, I would sincerely suggest you start a budget…"

However it requires a holistic view with help from the big movie studies.      
Eg: providing discounts for the blue ray edition if you watch it in the theatre.      
Free movie tickets with your Disney plus subscription.       
Catch-up shows where you can pay a little extra for your ticket in advance so that you watch the previous part of the movie.      
Maybe live sports inside the theatre with food and drinks.

If it's not then I'm basically just flipping a coin. And if I'm flipping coins, the likelihood that I'm willing to panic sell to mitigate a loss is really high.

2021-06-08 03:18:38,stocks,"Simply knowing an industry is a huge leg-up.  I'm in IT, so I'm reasonably current on what's going on in the semiconductor world and tech stocks.  It's not like a magic panacea, but it's easier to have convictions about a company when you're familiar with them, their products, public sentiment about them, etc.  My oldest holding (outside 401k stuff) is Google.  They've about doubled annualized market returns since I bought.

Another one is just being a step ahead of the market...  There's a meta-game there, where you're predicting where money is going to go in the short term and getting there first.  

For example:  When the market took a dump because Covid in March 2020, you can sit down, think what companies might flourish in this new scenario.  

* Online shopping?  Amazon doubled in 5 months

* Meal delivery? Grubhub doubled in like 5 months

* Online meetings?  Zoom was like 5x in 7 months. (bought at $131, sold at $487 six months later)

* Delivery services?  FedEx almost tripled in six months.  UPS wasn't quite as meteoric, but still almost doubled in 5 months. (Bought FDX and $117, sold half at $240 about 10 months later, still have the rest)

* Online document signing?  Docusign over doubled in 5 months.  

* At the time, there was serious panic about airlines -- I assumed the government isn't going to let the entire industry go bankrupt, bought UA at $21 and sold at $31 in 11 days.  

In that six month timeframe, you'd have done just fine with the S&P too, with upwards of 50% gains... But I'll take 5x over 1.5x any day.

Covid was obviously a pretty rare scenario, but similar opportunities present themselves if you pay attention.  

* When oil futures went negative during the covid crisis, USL dropped to $10/share, and is currently back at $24/share.  (I bought at $10 and got out at $16 or so 4 months later)

* Able to predict materials shortage and stuff?  Bought CMC at $20, sold at $32 six months later.

* When Peleton announced their recall a month ago, their stock dropped to $80/share.  Peleton owners are cult-like in their devotion.  Currently back to $110 or so.  (I bought at 80.49 and got out at $96 11 days later because it still looked overvalued at $80 to me)

* I ate at a Chipotle in the early days, when they weren't all that common, and I even had the thought ""I should totally buy stock in Chipotle"".  14 years later, I still kick myself for not throwing money at it back then. (like 1500% gains)

Caveats:

Obviously there's risk with any of this -- sometimes you might jump the wrong way.  I've lost a bundle on oil stocks pre-covid, underperformed the market with Verisign during Covid, losing money relative to the market with AMZN stock right now, I have some super-boring stock like MRK which is underperforming, etc.  I thought BRK was going to explode since they were sitting on piles of cash and could pick up companies on the cheap during the pandemic, but I underestimated just how fast the market would bounce back.  I still own those shares and they've even beaten the market with them, but man, if I'd only thrown more money at ZM instead...  Then you'll just completely miss things, like I assumed the housing market would be *dead* during the pandemic.  Stupid...

I always take at least rudimentary looks at financials.  I think it's important to look at a risk/reward scenario even if I'm not trying to do my own DCF models.  That's why I'm a scaredy cat with stuff like PTON and UA, both held under 2 weeks.  I know I'm playing with fire.

But I think riding indexes until you see an opportunity and jumping on it is not a bad way to fly.  And honestly, over half my play money was riding in index funds the whole time."

2021-06-07 22:06:13,stocks,"They're already there. These are moves that should have been made or at least already in the works. I'm watching gamestop completely transform while all I hear about amc is potential. What have they done to try and prove that potential? Have they made moves towards any of the things you've mentioned? Thats a genuine question as I don't follow amc like I do a few other companies. 

From my view, anything amc can offer me, I'd much rather have in the comfort of my own home. To drink and smoke as I please with friends who can get as loud as they want. 

This paired with going to movies is just so damn expensive. How are you gonna compete when I can get ESPN, HBO, Hulu, disney+ AND Netflix for $50 a month. You'd have to give me free access for a month for less than $50 just to get me to consider it. Even then it wouldn't replace my home entertainment. Not by a long shot. 

I agree with you that it could be done. But I also agree that it would take the right kind of management to make it happen. That's not something I think they have. Get a new CEO, shake things up, and maybe I'll change my opinion. Until then I just see a dying company. It's a shame too cause they could have prevented this with a little bit of proaction. It's not like Hulu and Netflix sprung up out of nowhere last March. AMC has known its competition for years and has done nothing to change its business model to continue to compete. 

Why they havent even started their own streaming service is beyond me. Literally anyone with content has a platform now. AMC has content that people want to see. Give it to them."
2021-06-08 01:51:13,stocks,"I wouldn't call it unparalleled. I have a dedicated tv room where I get better sound and picture.

My seats are more comfortable too. And I can pause to go to the bathroom whenever I want. And the snacks are better and much cheaper."

It's probably hundreds of millions) For some reason you think all that buying pressure will leave us all holding bags? Do you care to elaborate cause that's just illogical.

2021-06-08 00:11:25,stocks,"IMO I think movie theaters will not go away because of the experience and large screen. However, AMC (paper handed too early lol, but was in at $2) was an obvious momentum/reopening TRADE. What I think many of these investors are forgetting is AMC fucked the share holders the first squeeze by dilution. Idk about the other movie theaters like regal, or otc theater stocks though. AMC appears to be some sort of Bain capital/ toys r us thing with the dilution and massive acquisitions. IMAX is probably the most likely to succeed of the publicly traded companies. Cinemark is also a gamble, but is long term more likely to succeed than amc."
2021-06-08 02:26:22,stocks,"XXX AMC holder here. Let's get the obvious out the way first. AMC holders are not in it because of the market value of the company or fundamentals. I can tell you right now as an xxx AMC holder, I don't give a shit. 

AMC holders are in it for the squeeze. Once the shorts are finished. Most folks are gonna bounce. Simple as that. 

Now as for the actual company itself and its future. Movie theatres are indeed dying. But they're not gonna just evaporate overnight like some folks seem to think. This is a $40 billion industry. It's gonna be a slow process that'll take a few years. And with some smart decisions, they can delay that process further at the very least before their inevitable end. 

AMC as a company was already on a slow decline to bankruptcy. But the pandemic unnaturally sped that process up exponentially and put them in crippling debt. However, they were also *extremely* lucky  to ride the memestock short squeeze frenzy and secure enough liquid capital to keep them running for a few good years. Will they be able to potentially turn things around with some new innovative ideas? I don't know. Doesn't really matter either way, cause that's not why most of us are holding AMC. 

As far as the squeeze movement is concerned, AMC being liquid/sustainable for a bit longer is good because it keeps the pressure up and price floor higher, we don't need years we just need a few months. After the squeeze is over, it's whatever."

You’re making it out to be a very black and white scenario in which there is a strict segregation between good companies and bad companies.

This is why there are growth and momentum cycles and why certain numbers mean more than others. 

Your theory also assumes that this is an efficient market, which is never truly the case in practice. The subtle variations in each market participant are what make the markets move. X thinks this, Y thinks that, etc.

2021-06-08 09:52:17,stocks,"ive been at this for 15 years now.

the last few years is what id consider an anomaly. Its a massive bull run.  so id take your returns with a grain of salt and not allow it to lead to larger bets that can set your returns back.

ive held stocks that turned out to be ten x or more, but the thing is, youd never know until it hit that.

some examples, amd @3.50, nvda @12, mal @1.80, 
other mulit baggers, wmt, fb, td etc.

I get lynches style. Its the invest in 10 stocks with the hopes of the following:

1- doing 10x
2- doing a double
4- staying flat
2- losing 50%
1 - going bust.

total invested: $10k

Total return: $9,000. 90% roc

expect 5 years to play out: 18% roc.

You are hoping, that eventually itll all work out to the upside based on probability. This is a buy and hold strategy that normally youd have to hold for years to see it come to fruition....IF it comes true.

Its fine if you want to trade that way, but i think the probability of success would be much less than above. one way to check is to take all the stocks on the sp500 and see what % became 10 baggers.

the issue is, we had a 10 year bull market, so unless youre expecting another 10 years, i dont think you can expect the same performance.

Ive been on the other side many occurrences of 15-30% return per trade. easily in the 1000s. high win rate. my issue is, my sizing was off , so the returns were shit. Will that continue, who knows.

After having been at this for a long time, ive since moved to only trading the xsp.to with 10% of the portfolio holding individual tickers."

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"First Psychedelic Med ETF: PSY Anyone else feeling bullish on PSY?

The first psychedelic medicine ETF to be listed in the US. Top holdings include medical psychedelics, ketamine, and cannabis stocks. I’d been wanting to invest in Charlottes Web but it wasn’t available on my platforms and PSY holds it! 

Investor Place article shared details to know about it: 

PSY is the first psychedelic stocks ETF.
While it’s the first, it hasn’t been around for long.
The ETF was only just set up at the end of May.
PSY’s focus is on investing in psychedelic stocks that can be used to treat mental illnesses.
That includes depression, which it points out is a growing problem.
That comes from claims that as many as 30% of depression patients aren’t responding to current treatments.
It also says that research budgets for psychiatric medicine have declined by 70% at large companies.
PSY believes that this presents an opportunity for new treatments making use of psychedelic treatments to meet growing demand.
These treatments could potentially be used for those suffering from “anxiety, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, depression” and more.
The ETF says that it looks to track the BITA Medical Psychedelics, Cannabis, and Ketamine Index.
It mentions that companies in the index must have a market cap of at least $75 million.
They must also be connected to the medical psychedelics, medical cannabis, or ketamine industries in some way.
Its top holdings include Charlottes Web (OTCMKTS:CWBHF), Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB), Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON), Corbus Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:CRBP), and Supreme Cannabis.

Edit: added thats it’s the first one to be listed in the US (not the first globally)."

2021-06-08 17:22:16,stocks,"Saw this on investing and this was my reply...

As someone who works in behavioral health I have been looking at the use of psychedelics for the treatment of mental health issues for a long time. While I haven't seen it in my own clinical experience, from the research it seems very promising. The ketamine industry specifically is booming, although there is uncertainty such as how the treatment requires maintenance dosing for most patients and long term ketamine use in recreational users develops bladder/urinary issues, will we see that in patients in a few years? So we will have to see how that plays out.  
  
That aside, the 3 biggest holdings of this company, CWEB, ACB and CRON aren't even psychedelic companies. They are in the marijuana business to varying degrees, which is nothing like ketamine, MDMA, psilocybin and so forth.  
  
So while I can't speak to how this ETF will perform, I would say that it's ticker symbol and name is more or less just a gimmick."

Probably the nibble approach is best put a little $ in every so often and see how it goes. My sense is like the struggles at the state and federal levels for acceptance of such alternative healing methods it will take the markets time to accept as well.

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Young investor ETF portfolio advice Hey everyone,

I am 18yo and I want to build my portfolio around ETFs and hold them 10+ years minimum.

What do you think of this portfolio:

* VTI
* QCLN
* ARKG
* ESPO

I want to invest in ETFs that does not overlap with for example VT etf.

Should I invest in something different, did I made good choices for long term?

Thanks!"
2021-06-08 00:07:24,stocks,"A few general thoughts:

\- It is OK for ETFs to overlap. Technically, VTI will overlap with many things. The trick is to be conscious of the overlap and realize what you're doing. Embrace it, but know it.

Common Situation:  50% of a portfolio is SPY or VOO (S&P 500 ETF), 10% is QQQ (NASDAQ-100 index) (40% other)

80% of the companies in the NASDAQ 100 are also in the S&P 500. They are both indexes of the largest companies. The NASDAQ 100 has out-competed the S&P 500, but it has also proven to be more volatile.  The way I see it is I'm starting with my main asset, the S&P 500. SPY is my main base ETF and has a heavy weight in my portfolio.

 I'm saying I want to add a little more risk/reward and increase my exposure to growing tech stocks by a limited margin. Therefore, I own 10% QQQ to increase that exposure. Note that I am not investing in SPY and QQQ as equals. I'm using QQQ just to weight that part of the market a little bit more heavily. I can vary the risk by choosing 5% QQQ or increase to 15% QQQ. 

I also do the same things with DIA, Dow Jones Industrial Average, sometimes.  It only chooses established prominent companies, rather than indexing the whole market, so it has more established and Value oriented on average and the companies are not as new/growth focused. There are higher dividends.

You can also use SPYG and SPYV. These are both all the stocks that make up SPY, but divided between Growth and Value. I can add 10% SPYG to have a larger growth portfolio or 10% SPYV to have a heavier Value portfolio.

\- You're getting into some niche ETF products. To only have a limited portfolio and to be choosing some ETFs that are riskier, I would use some caution. I would also be careful how much you weight your portfolio. 

\- Any ARK fund is going to be volatile. In a bad market, it will more likely go down more than the overall market. The investments are more speculative as to what will become the next big companies, so a dip in the overall economy can be more risky for those stock holdings.

\- QCLN - It has been more volatile, but it should be noted it has under-performed  the S&P 500 for all but one year. This is a risky niche ETF of a very small part of the market. The weighting of it needs to be kept low in the portfolio to limit risk.

\- ESPO - Video gaming and Esports. Same comment.

You need to decide how to position your risk and consider the weightings in your portfolio carefully. You have a total market fund and then a list of funds that carry more risk. It isn't that these are bad funds, I'm just pointing out they are very niche and will be more volatile to the overall economy."

2021-06-07 23:51:29,stocks,Usually there is a lockup period (usually 6 months after IPO). After that you can move them to your brokerage. Depending on your relationship with your brokerage they will buy the shares for you in good faith when they can see they are real. They will show up in your account as a short position till the shares are transferred in to cover. That way you can sell without being subjected to a price swing while they transfer.

When I was playing only in options I stuck to a strategy that I never had more than about 20% of my cash invested at a time. That’s because with options you can lose “everything”.

For meme or momentum stock plays, consider buying leaps instead of shares. If not leaps, then long calls (many months out).

I think it’s best to stick to what your wanting to put time into or keep your mind on, keep more momentum based plays to fewer holdings so you don’t have to watch multiple charts constantly hoping to see the move you wanted. 

I started with picking a lot of stocks I was keeping up with and hit some really great ones, the problems were being to spread out to where the cash gain isn’t as significant as the percentage would make you believe.

2021-06-07 22:47:07,stocks,"A lot of Amazons history has been spent building out extremely expensive distribution networks and gaining a massive economies of scale in with AWS segment. 

They created a very strong lead in e-commerce, AWS has already hit economies of scale, 200M people are paying for prime, international expansion is continuing 

they own twitch, whole foods, MGM, zappoes, audible, imdb etc 

My belief is that at some point Amazon will stop having clear growth areas and it's capital expenditures will become less effienct than returning it back to the shareholders. At this point, I think Amazon could easily start maximizing cash flow and prioritizing dividends and buybacks. 

The current price isn't cheap, but I think the price is justified. There's a reasonable chance this is a stock you can buy and hold for multiple decades. We are still in growth phase but as the company enters cashflow and dividends, I would expect to price to become a lot more expensive and dividends and buybacks to be huge. This will take another 10-20 years though imo"

Honestly if you can find a better paying job that you like, I wouldn’t hold out for the stock. Because you will just keep sticking around longer and longer to get more shares. Those 6 shares are really only going to end up being 3 and while that’s ok, you could probably find a better paying job that gives yearly bonuses. Plus right now it’s a great time to be a job seeker in this market."
2021-06-07 22:39:53,stocks,I agree with him. Unless you have a plan for that money that involves having a higher probability of earning a higher yield on the money than it would bring staying vested in AMZN... I'd say let it ride and let the AMZN team work for you. Good luck.

2021-06-07 23:02:44,stocks,"Yes and no and it depends. I'll break them down:

Yes, there is that possibility of a split up and it could tank the share price and potential future earnings

No, what mega-cap companies have actually been forced to split up? I would imagine AMZNs lobbying team is pretty damn good and can fight most political battles, it's worked so far. And it's not like Amazon is in a monopolistic position or even needs one. 

Depends, a split-up might not hurt shareholders. Let's say the government splits it up into 5 different companies, you'd still likely get shares in all five. The government doesn't have a great motive to fuck shareholders and damage retirement funds. Look at Standard Oil, they were spilt up into multiple different companies, many of those companies later became the largest companies in the world and Rockefellers made shit tons of money. Weirdly, the splitting of Standard Oil was the best thing that ever happened the net worth of the Rockefellers."

'U.S. tech giants could benefit from the agreement of the Group of Seven rich countries' agreement to create a global minimum 15% corporate tax rate if the final deal also scraps increasingly popular digital services taxes, according to industry lobbyists.

The deal, reached Saturday, was designed to reduce companies' incentives to shift profits to low-tax offshore havens and could bring hundreds of billions of dollars into government coffers. 

The statement on the U.S. Treasury Department website touting the deal also discusses the ""removal of all Digital Services Taxes, and other relevant similar measures, on all companies.""

Facebook Inc (FB.O) was quick to praise the deal, and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google followed suit: ""We strongly support the work being done to update international tax rules. We hope countries continue to work together to ensure a balanced and durable agreement will be finalized soon,"" said spokesman Jose Castaneda.

The industry wants levies like France's 3% tax on certain online revenues removed. In 2019, France applied a 3% levy on digital services revenue earned in France by companies with revenues of more than 25 million euros there and 750 million euros worldwide. It suspended collection in early 2020 while negotiations were underway on international tax rules.'

2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Is it better to rebalance with newer or older shares? Some older are now long term. I realize it's ""not good to time the market"", but I figure in case we correct after summer or whatever it may be smart to sell a little of my profits into cash. 

Right now I'm in about 100% equity besides my savings. I have about 30% portfolio in my IRA so I could go to cash in there pretty much whenever.

Ideally I like to have 20% cash besides my 1 year emergency fund in my savings. It may be conservative but I get nervous on market downturns.

My ""cash like"" investments are MSFT and AAPL, which I kind of think of as either a bond or cash holding really.

So if I were to go to cash in my taxable I would be taxed at 0 on my long term gains. I would most likely trim my MSFT and or AAPL to about 5% each.  Right now combined they're about 20% of portfolio.

I'm not sure now is a good time to trim them since I see at least MSFT maybe going higher this summer. But I feel pretty confident holding both. I feel that even if they did correct with the market they'd eventually at least get back to where they are now.

But what I'm wondering is that if and when I trim MSFT and or AAPL is it better to sell the long term shares, that for me are at 0,  or sell off the higher cost basis shares at short term gain and average down if there's a future correction? I'd be paying my income tax rate on short term shares though.

I would think it would make more sense to trim the long term shares.  Fidelity let's you select what lots you sell.

Thanks."

OP just roll them forward. You can probably still get a bit of premium and you'll keep your shares. So roll expiry forward and strike upwards."
2021-06-07 22:37:05,stocks,What rolling forward mean? I’m selling covered calls but I don’t know how to roll forward an option.
2021-06-08 00:07:00,stocks,"Every broker may have a different set up but when you select your covered call and it gives you some options on what to do with it, one option should be to roll. 

Rolling an option forward literally means buying to close the current covered call and selling to open a new covered call at whatever date and strike you choose. Etrade will do this process automatically when you select to roll and I imagine other brokers are the same. 

You would roll an option forward when you want to get more premium because you intend to keep selling covered calls and you're at or near expiry or you want to protect your shares from getting called away. Some considerations should be made when rolling forward but it is risk free as long as your motivation it to be long on the stock. 

So as basic as it can be stated. Rolling a covered call means closing the current covered call and opening a new one in a single step. 

If you're deep in the ""red"" on a covered call because the strikes been blown past and you want to keep your shares you'd likely need to choose an expiration several weeks and potentially months in the future depending on the new strike price you choose in order for the premium to offset the current covered call. 

Not sure if that helps at all."

The fact you don’t even know that losing payment for order flow is good for you tells me all I need to know about you. Idiot. Go read a book.

You got on Reddit in February, you’re a FOMO idiot."

My 1st dabblings in the market was in 1978 through a traditional broker. Quit because the fees were too high and the advice was terrible.  Was that you by any chance?

I was on reddit in 2007 but lost interest when I found it to be full of jackasses.

You know, had you not attacked my grammar, I would have rated your information as valuable.

Go  back to kindergarten, you have evidently forgot the basic rules of social interaction.  IF you graduate you can begin working on getting your wife and kids talking to you again.  But, good luck with that as they know you to well.

But,  thanks for taking the time to respond to my question and opinion.  You didn't have to but you didn't have to attack me either.  Only an elitist snob lacking self esteem would have started a conversation that way."

I used to work in finance and I had an annoyingly long list of companies I couldn’t invest in. Every quarter I had to answer a question that said: “Do you have any reportable securities to report?” or something like that. And if I said “yes” I had to report the entire portfolio regardless if they were prohibited or not. So I used to never never ever trade any individual stocks.

I am hired at a startup company which is planning go public within 2 years. They offered 7000 ISO at $3.50. Within 3 years I'll have vested all 7000 (I understand I can't buy all of them if I quit early). My question is, assuming they do reach their goal of $200+ per share after going public in 5 years, does that mean I can sell my 7000 and make 1.4 million? Or is there a catch I am missing? I can't help but think for people working 8 years at Zoom for example can sell their shares and be very rich now. It just feels too good to be true.


PS. I know most startups fail and I shouldn't have my hopes up. But I am asking hypothetically if it does succeed."

The second company, I hit the lottery and their stock did very well and I was very fortunate to have received several options grants during my time at the company.  I left earlier this year because I was fully vested and sold all of my options as our stock reached its 2021 high (so far).  I stuck around the last year, Almost exclusively because of the money involved and i can say that it took a toll on my mental health — I didn’t want to be there but the payday was too good to walk away from.  

The TLDR - it can happen, my situation wasn’t a Facebook or Snapchat situation either, but the odds are still crazy long and I’ve been granted 100x more stock than ever wound up being worth anything."

How do you lot manage your stop limits? Do you have them on every stock? To protect profit base or just original investment? I keep placing mine too close so that short term volatility sells before gains accrue. Do you do it on a percentage basis? 

Holding too many bags that although I believe in would rather have sold and bought lower.

2021-06-08 10:47:13,stocks,"It takes a different type of discipline but logically for me it just makes more sense. If you are putting money into a financial instrument - risking your hard earned cash - you should have a thesis. To me no thesis should be broken by ""if the price drops"" to any value other than $0. If I'm buying on the belief that a stock will go up, it's because I think the current or future valuation supports it and the market is still catching up.

Obviously momentum and day traders this is absolutely NOT true and you should cut losses based on volatility early. But I'm a swing trader/investor (depending on the company) and have little to no understanding of that world."
2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"""transferring"" by selling and rebuying. I know that I can put in a transfer request from 1 brokerage to another. but from my understanding, that results in a small period of ""limbo"" where its not invested. which means, after this timeframe, at whatever price it lands before the cash gets transferred over, is what you ""bought"" back in (with no recourse on taxes).

to avoid this, i was wondering if its a bad idea to do a manual transfer yourself. the only downside i can think of is short term tax vs long term. but these shares in question are already long term capital gains.

so is there anything ""bad"" about simply fully closing my position at brokerage A, and simply ""rebuying"" the same amount at brokerage B?"
2021-06-08 19:36:53,stocks,Pretty sure you would trigger a wash sale when you rebuy in the new account. Unless you wait 21 days beyond the sale date.
2021-06-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Confused about options So an option is 100 shares right. Say I want to buy a put for something which currently sits at 300$ at a strike price of 200$. So I would sell to open or buy to open? The initial cost of that is around 10 bucks x 100 which is 1000.  So if I sell to open at 3000 then when I buy to close at 2,000 I make 10,000 profit. So buying a put means sell to open and buy to close right? Selling a call would be buying to open and selling to close? What's the difference between selling a call option vs just buying 100 of the stock?  Somebody help my brain is exploding. Also what does the word ""exercise"" mean?"
2021-06-07 20:35:23,stocks,"When you are creating a new option position, you are ""opening"" a position, no matter what you are doing (buy or sell). When you close out that position you are ""closing"" a position, regardless of if it is a buy or sell.

&#x200B;

FYI roughly 98% of all options go unexercised. People who have profits simply sell the options before expiration, and take the money and run.

&#x200B;

If you want to gamble with an option, let's say a call option (betting the stock will go up), you would 'buy to open'. You would be buying the call, and opening a new position. Later when you sell it, you 'sell to close'. If the option expires (worthless or not), the position closes all by itself.

&#x200B;

If you owned the stock instead and wanted to write calls to generate some extra $$ for yourself, you would 'sell to open'. You would write the call (sell) and create a new position (open). Later if you buy it back, you 'buy to close'. If the option expires, the position gets closed by default."

The questions you are asking are very fundamental: you should have no issue with any of this before you are risking real money on a trade. Options are nuclear weapons: they can win you are war or ruin you like nothing else. 
Do not start trading options until you are able to understand how to interpret a trade and can use at least the first-level Greeks (delta, theta and vega) to enter, hedge and exit a position or you will pay your live training with thousands of dollars in losses."

I'm complaining as a prospective investor, not just a customer.

I love their food when the grill person knows what they're doing. But their refusal to invest in those who control the consistency of their food quality is screwing them.

Steak comes in sous vide now so it ""cooks"" (Sears marinade and reheats more accurately) much faster. Easy to overcook if you don't know what you're doing."

Imagine you approve a drug that doesn't have sufficient evidence that it works and people die earlier because of the treatment? Who has blood on their hands then? The combo of known safety issues and the lack of clear evidence that aducanumab improves patient outcomes, means that for all we know, the drug does more harm than good in the aggregate. Don't get me wrong, I don't believe the people working on this have bad intentions. However, the FDA's own independent advisory board advised against approving the drug. An independent think tank advised against approving the drug. The FDA's own statistician said the clinical trial did not provide sufficient evidence to approve the drug. I understand how debilitating AD is and how frustrating the lack of treatment options is - but to get back to your Futurama reference - the expert in statistics said that there is not sufficient evidence that the treatment works. I don't think a company should be allowed to take the risk of harming people with a treatment if they can't prove it helps. But I'm just a scientist posting on reddit, what do I know."

2021-06-07 23:29:40,stocks,"I'm long on DIS but I bought mid pandemic and have a decent cost basis.

Here's my bullish thesis: 

1. DIS owns and develops the most valuable IP in the world. IP is infinitely monetizable against the wealth and population of the world which is growing rapidly. Put differently, it doesn't significantly cost more for each marginal viewer of an avengers movie. You only need to pay the fixed cost production, it's similar to tech in a sense. 

2. Disney+ is a homerun. It's such a no-brainer subscription for families and it's grown like a beast. It's amazing scrolling through it seeing just how powerful their IP truly is, and how much nostalgia is built into it.

3. IP has been undervalued for years. AMZN didn't overpay buying MGM at $9.5B, they underpaid. People don't realise this now, but they will. 

4. Parks are cash cows and many families view them as a “coming of age” must for their children.

5. Merchandising is a cash cow and scales with the distribution of IP

6. Disney is very good at international markets, especially china. They are specializing in monetizing their population which is likely to become much more wealthy in the next decade. 

7. Disney owns a ton companies that have synergies. Too many to list

8. Great mgmt."

When you browse websites, those banners and visuals ads you see are called ‘display’ ads. 
Let’s say you go on Yahoo finance. There’s a space for an advert to be served to you.

Advertisers bid against each other automatically using computers to decide which advertiser will get to pay and show you their ad. Depending on how well you fit their criteria (Male, 20s, interested in tech for example) they will be willing to pay more or less.

This automatic platform does the bidding on your behalf and takes your requirements into account to find the most optimal places to advertise, across lots of different websites. The automated platform can be Google’s product, but it will be able to bid on websites and advertising spaces that are not owned by Google, it can bid on any website to find the best one(s).

Let’s say you’re the advertiser now trying to sell your tech to that young male, and the best place for your advert to go is on the Yahoo finance site.
Now imagine that computer programme you’re paying for picks a different site, which is a Google service, because it makes Google more money, but your advert then consequently performs worse than it could have.

These meme stocks have made me question the microstructure of the market. Let’s say you want to buy 10m shares of a company and the average daily volume is 20m shares.

You can choose to purchase all your shares at one time in a market order and cause a huge price spike or choose to buy small blocks at a time to avoid having less of an impact. 

My question is: does that first scenario of a gigantic buy at once have an enduring impact at inflating the price compared to the second scenario? EMH would say the price would end up in the same spot but we all know EMH isn’t worth much these days.

Is this ultimately what explains how these stocks have been able to keep their elevated prices?"

AMC had a better than expected turnout after reopening and the stock was still cheap I expected a solid swing but it flew. GME AMC and BB hype swing together. So with GME earnings coming up they all make sense even if they make no sense. BB and PLTR do make sense though, hype or not they’re not going anywhere. I’m in on DKNG pre football.

2021-06-08 04:30:55,stocks,"I've got a position in Corsair at around 36.5 average.  I think they're a really good long term hold, especially with an sub 32 entry.

Fundamentally, they've got good profit margins in an industry that is growing.  They need to figure out how to maintain or expand market share because I believe that their margins could shrink a bit over time.  I don't think they have a great MOAT but they've got a pretty good brand.  There is some FUD surrounding continued growth of high-end gaming gear but the company is pretty bullish on the sector.  I think they're going to have to 'prove' that their growth is sustainable which could take another 3-4 earnings.  They don't pay a dividend and their balance sheet is ok at best, but has improved over the last year (and should continue to improve as they have decent FCF).  If they fail to sustain it by this time next year I could easily see them in the 25 range.  If they continue to grow and expand market share through Q2 2022 then they could be above 45.

Technically for the short term, they've got really strong resistance at 35 and really strong support around 31.  If you're thinking of starting a position then this could be a pretty good spot at <32.  I personally expect them to remain in this channel for while as there is a lot of selling pressure around the 34-35 mark, and I think the market sees fair value at more than 30.  I won't be surprised if it breaks below 30, but I also wouldn't be surprised if it hovers there for a while.  I will personally not add any more unless it hits ~28 as I'm happy with my current exposure to it and the current price is too close to my average for me to want to average down again.

Obviously make decisions based on your own research, and I think they are far from a sure thing, but if you like the company and industry then I think they're at a decent entry point."

When you lose all of his money, careful he does not straight up kill you.

As for AMC, its the most gambliest stock possible that already risen 500% last month. At this point if the value of the money is so low that you could literally take it, wipe your ass with it, flush it down the toilet and literally forget about it 5 sec after, yeah you can put it in AMC. If its friends money, it would look something like him being a multi millionaire, and giving you 50$ that were rotting in his pocket for past few weeks.

On top of that imagine if you trusted someone with your money, and then later he just straight up tells you he lost it all. I can't imagine a scenario which wouldn't produce doubts, suspicions, talking behind the back, with more crazier gamblers even assault on you, with douchier more bully like people demanding that money back. I have seen even rich people have 1 beer too much and go like wild pack of dogs over few hundred bucks that means nothing to them.

Off chance AMC goes full maniac upside and you come to your friend and reward him with more money. He is going to want to do it again, milk you from every penny there is. You are a money maker now, imagine all the money you could make for him, the sky is the limit. Of course reproducing that success would be statistically impossible, we got a lot of stories about that, one is at the start of this video - [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiLZSTBIjO8&ab_channel=JakeTran)

And now after you bought him sweet reward of money, you would come one day to him either refuse to do it next time or lose the money next time, suspicion would fall on you instantly, they would say about you that the guy probably wants to keep all his success or my money to himself, how could he win that much before and now lose it ?"

2021-06-07 20:02:44,stocks,"I really wish you the best but if your strategy is to live off only 4 rental properties, you may want to reconsider.

If you plan on plugging yourself off and let someone manage your properties for a monthly fee, you forget that property managers have no incentive to maintain your unit in good shape, it's additional work for no additional fee. In every community I've invested in and been a board member of, the units with the lowest rent and in the worst shape are the one run by a property manager. Most of the time, they barely set foot in your property. Tenant leaves, casual walkthrough if any, new tenant comes in. Sure, property managers will handle plumbing leaks and AC maintenance, but it comes at a total cost that you seem to underestimate.

Now let's say your property manager is good and trustworthy, but you have to evict a tenant. Lawyer fees if every goes smoothly in court is about $3K. That doesn't include missed rent. You usually have to renovate your entire property when that happens. One property cost me about $15-18K in repairs after an eviction. Everything was damaged, roaches everywhere, the whole package. That's 1-2 years in net profit from your rent. This is usually rare, but if it happens to you while you just retired thinking you'd live off those 4 rental units, you're going to be eating nothing but potatoes for quite a few years. 

Also, you own another condo somewhere else. Building fails 40-year recertification. Owners now bear the cost to bring it up to code with a special assessment of $3-8K each. It can be anything: new parking lot, termite treatment, paint job... You can buy houses only to avoid special assessments, but profitability is lower. Where I'm from, a house costs about as much as 3-4 condos, for only 2-2.5 times the rent. And you're responsible for your own property insurance, roof repairs, etc.

In other words, yes, it can be profitable, but it's work and it's quite depressing. Secondly, if you think it's risk-free, it's probably because you lack experience."

let me add another massive problem SPOT has, they don't wear the pants in the relationship, the IP holders do. This is exactly the problem Netflix identified years ago and has spent boatloads of money trying to fix. If Netflix doesn't own The Office (their most streamed IP) then nothing will stop the IP holder from being the one with the negotiating power. So where will the margin actually come from? If there's any excess margins, the artists and labels will raise prices and swallow the margins themselves.

2021-06-07 23:20:14,stocks,"My opinion is for you to figure out a basic strategy to achieve your goals. If you have $10k and want to turn it into $100k in a year as a goal, that requires a wildly different strategy than having $10k that you want to turn into $100k for retirement in 30 years as a goal. There’s a lot to consider and everyone has different circumstances. 

For example, I’ve been making well over $100k for a decade now and put max $19000 in my 401k and max in IRA every year. I also saved like crazy and invested along the way in low index funds. Now I’m 35 and have a little over a million bucks. Given my position, I’m a bit more comfortable throwing $15k at GME or BB or Peloton or whatever for short term gains. However, 85% of my portfolio is in VTSAX, 5% cash, and 10% hand picked stocks. 

So truth is you don’t have to do anything sexy, just do what you’re comfortable with and make sure you have a goal. My goal is to have $25m by the time I’m 65 and live on the beach 🙏"

2021-06-08 00:02:38,stocks,"Metals arent safe at all. Younger gens from X and forward do not value metals like older generations and their value is 95% speculation and not reflective of productive demand nor ""scarcity."" To make matters worse, historically, they never actually kept up with inflation unless you get in at the right time. If you buy when its already up, then you can just as easily lose. I am not saying it will just collapse overnight, but metals arent safe nor provide inflation protection any more than stocks. Thats just a old person fallacy because thats what people advertised to them back in the old days. Its false.

Real estate is good but you are also buying into a severe inventory shortage though, I suppose, that is beside the point. Long term RE is the best bet not just to fight inflation, but also to make some money on the side. 

Art (collectables) is very complex but works if you know what you are doing. Generally dont recommend this to people because you really need to be an expert and there is always risk involved in storage and protection. Storage is not free nor is insurance against accidents or theft."
2021-06-08 00:28:31,stocks,"The valuations are wonky this time around. For example, many blue chips really arent very inflated at all, even the growth varieties like MSFT or KDP arent that high. Thats the difference between now and tech bubble.

The indices are high, but its almost entirely due to speculative stuff with little to no earnings rather than established big names. So in some ways it is like the .com bubble where there are a lot of new companies that will likely fail and they are insanely valuated but in many ways it isnt since established stuff really isnt inflated much even if they are rapidly growing.

For instance. During the .com bubble, LOW had PE of over 50 while today its 20 (this is a low growth company). MSFT was well over 70 PE in the .com but today its about 35 (high growth). LMT was over 50 back then, today its around 15 (good growth).

See what I mean?

We definitely have a bubble but its not in the blue chips and its regardless of their performance. I think its obvious whats going on. We have a new generation of young impressionable investors who are making a lot of mistakes. They bought into the millionaire overnight stuff and are swinging for the fences. They view established companies as unworthy because they cant double every year like small and med cap startups and such....

I feel bad for younger gens (im Gen-X) because we all know how this is going to end and we know why they are so desperate. Our economy is in shambles and has been going down the toilet since Reagan. Buying power keeps going down making it harder for them (and my gen) to buy important things that previous generation got with a lot less effort. They look at homes and then think about raising a family and there is no way they can afford them without a very high paying job or two incomes... they are getting desperate and gambling more."
2021-06-08 08:37:40,stocks,"In a socialist enviroment, metals do offer some protection as inflation will not devaluation metals to Zero. The value may go down in a flat market but it will not be zero and will always have a trade value which provides protection for investor capital. And 1 once of gold can be traded by weight for product of similar value and is particularly valuable on the black market if one needs to avoid being taxed to death. Eventually if you can hang on long enough you can buy stable currency with it and restore purchasing power after a inflationary period almost at the same value. I can recall times in the 70’s when gold went from $250.00 and ounce to $1000 then back down to $250.00 but it always had a base metal value. Today silver and gold is used in electronics and although not used for jewellery it’s definitely has commercial value in TV’s,electronics, computers and solar panels. That’s one of the problems of the clean technology not enough of the base elements to build the sustaining energy we need to go 100% renewable. So yeah there is a value to metal no one can ever manipulate. It’s a scarce commodity."
2021-06-08 18:32:16,stocks,"Dont know what the point about socialist environment means... The US has always been about 75% socialist. That talking point is nothing but a joke except to folks who dont know what it means. You cant have a government without socialism. It doesnt exist. The only question is how far do you take it. The US is easily at least 75% socialist but we draw the line (which we have crossed many times, more so by modern Republicans ironically) at interference with business via government influence.

You described the age old fallacy... There is absolutely no shortage in these metals in any practical sense. The word scarce is misunderstood. Its a relative measure. Lithium is scarcer than carbon or nitrogen. That doesnt mean we will ever have a shortage of lithium. It just means there is less of it than the other two.

Gold, Silver and Platinum are plentiful. Their intrinsic value for use in manufacturing is incredibly low with exception perhaps to platinum due to its incredible lack of reactivity. Gold is no more valuable than copper in 99% of application because in most cases corrosion is not an issue and even if it was, we find cheap ways to fix it (like wrapping it in plastic). Thats is literally the only reason to use gold over copper otherwise copper is a better conductor.

And thats what I am trying to say. The age old arguments are going away. The internet and ability to look up factual information have poked a lot of holes in the old beliefs and the younger generations simply do not trust older generations.

The good news is that outside of developed nations, these metals still carry favor. Basically the lower the education the higher their view of precious metals is.

As for something never going to $0... thats just nonsense. If all stocks go to $0, then you no longer have a country. Gold will be the least of your worries. I am from Iraq. When the country ""fell"" due to war, the only things that mattered were water, food and land/homes. A 24c gold necklace (yes middle east jewelry is made that way even if its a bad idea) wasnt even worth a carton of eggs when things hit the fan. Thats how fast food inflated. Land is interesting. Though transactions halted for a while, when they came back, land was actually more valuable than it was before the war. This was a special case because we had a lot of buyers from Iran, Syria and Turkey but it was strange to see nonetheless. Just glad my family got out..."

2021-06-08 01:34:27,stocks,"I honestly dont think so. We already have games and such for it and its barely selling. The problem with these VR devices is the same as Kinect, PS Move and all the other VG gimmicks, people stop using it after a while. A game is not better because its in VR just like a movie is not better because its in 3D. Its neat... the 1st time you see it. Then its still neat for about 10 minutes but then you just stop caring and prefer to relax without glasses and just watch (or play). Thats the problem.

Disclaimer: I worked on VR for several years and my brother is still working on them today so I get all the latest gadgets and games including many unreleased betas and such.

They are fun, dont get me wrong, but they are not the future of VR. There is far more potential in enterprise use for meetings and schooling than there is in games but we havent achieved a good way to do that yet. You need to a real time scanning tech to make this happen which is not easy."
2021-06-08 01:27:35,stocks,"1st, the stuff happening with FB isnt that its a monopoly, its a fight between what FB is. Is it a news agency or just social media company. News agencies are liable for the the news they report while companies like FB avoid any responsibility by passing it on the people and companies who post. But the monkey wrench is FB is indeed curating posts so where does that put them? The answer is obvious.. They are like old tv stations or radio stations. They curated stuff too and made rules for anything that ran on their chan. Thats where this will end court wise. Politically, its popular for politicans to rag on FB for votes but it will be toothless.

I think folks underappreciated the real power of US constitution and laws... Trump, while president, underestimated them too and he got spanked left and right by the constitution and laws. Even a president cant do what they want here in the USA. Thats the power of our checks and balances. 

The USA government >> CANT << force corporate breakups just because they dont like something except in the rare case where said business is a monopoly. FB is not a monopoly and not just that, but the barrier of entry to compete is very low unlike old telecoms where literally no one could compete due to government contracts.

Another thing people dont seem to appreciate is that a ""spin off"" isnt loss of ownership. A spin off just means a different board and execs but in cases where company A owns all of company B, it will retain enormous control via voting rights. In other words, even if they spun off instagram (people still use this?) then it would still pick the board of directors and probably the execs indirectly via closed doors."

Had I held every last one and sold at the absolute top it would have been just shy of a million. But the chances of me doing that exact thing are one in a mill. My thinking now is that about the best I could have done was selling all (or most) at the $252 would have gotten me exactly double what I sold for, which was $325,000. But I'm 60, and the profit after I pay taxes has pushed my retirement dollars saved up by a significant amount.

2021-06-08 10:39:44,stocks,"One thing that would worry me about a heavy NVDA position right now is the crypto selloff tends to affect NVDA. Once mining becomes unprofitable and GPU sales drop off, it happened last cycle 2018 that there was an effect on the shares. However that's a small part of their business and they're great long term. My suggestion is trim NVDA to make space for something else because it's so heavily weighted and you don't have much else. So many industries and opportunities you could be in."
2021-06-08 03:39:00,stocks,"Thanks for the response!

AMC indeed is a swing trade in order to make some quick cash.

GME however is, at least i think it is, a different story. It's current busisness model indeed is outdated, a brick and mortar store is not really 21st century-proof (excuse my englisch, i'm a native dutch speaker). They're working on some big things, such as an NFT platform where you can buy and sell your games, which is something no other platform (such as steam, origin, etc.) provides. This could, in the long run, be worthwhile. This could mean that in the future, let's say 3-5 years, GME could be worth about 250-300/share. For now it's all short-squeze related, which is what i'm basing my ""gamble"" on, which it indeed is. I truly do believe this gamble will pay off short-term and i do not see GME as a long-term investment. 

At this point classic TA does not apply to GME, given the things happening behind the scenes, with the blatant market manipulation and agressive shorting of the stock. Then again, i'm not 100% sure this is true at this point, but all the evidence points towards some narly things happening. What's your take on this?"
2021-06-08 04:04:04,stocks,"I appreciate your response and understand your perspective a bit better now. 

The drama behind GME and the other meme stocks is beyond my knowledge and understanding. However, I also believe that most retail investors do not fully understand what’s going on either and are overestimating themselves in this battle - whatever it is that’s going on. As retail investors, we are tiny fish swimming in an ocean where those with significantly more capital can alter the outcome of this unique situation. Ultimately, I don’t want my money to get swept up in that mess because I believe in my process and am averse to the risk behind investing in memes. 

With regard to GME’s actual business, your guess is as good as mine as to what happens in the future. Withholding my previous reservations about GME, I’m skeptical on how likely their plan is to succeed. Even if their NFT strategy begins to show promise, who’s stopping other companies with significantly more resources to copy them and offer more incentives to customers to use their platform instead? 

Now let’s assume that GME’s future plans are both successful and long lasting. How are you able to explain the math behind why their share price “could be worth about 250-300”? What if I thought it could be 500? Or 50? Without any evidence or even the company forecasting its sales based on this plan, deriving a fair value for the stock is purely conjecture.

It’s not about what’s possible, but rather what’s probable. Again, this is just my opinion, but that’s how I try to approach stocks."
2021-06-08 04:22:08,stocks,"Thanks a lot for this, this kind of convo is exactly what i was looking for here.

I'll try to give a short intro to what i believe happened with GME. Hedgefund tried to do the same with GME as they did with Toys'r'us, short them into oblivion and make them go bankrupt. GME has been doing shit the past years, stock was worth about $2 i believe. Then one bright mind saw how high the (reported) short interest was, which was at a whopping 140% (the absolute max it is allowed to be on FINRA). That means that some shares where shorted twice. If a company goes bankrupt, shorts do not have to cover. If the price of the stock rises, keeping shorts costs a lot of money and eventually the shorts do have to cover. Hegdefunds say they did, DD's show they did not, the price also shows they did not. Which means that the shorts still need to cover, at a price of over 250 now. Thats about 248/shorted share. This is where the short squeze theory comes into play and we'll see what the future holds.

We might be tiny fish on our own, but there are a lot more tiny fish in the ocean than there are whales. If retail comes together, we could make some things move here, at least i think we can. 

For the actual businessplan looking into the future; [Ryan Cohen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen). He turned Chewy into a multi-billion$ company in 7 years, owns about 9% of GME and is most likely to become the new CEO of GME on the shareholder meeting, which is held tomorrow. I believe he could really turn things around. 

Looking at the future, i'm not sure what's gonna happen, no one knows, but then again, i dont see GME as a long term play."
2021-06-08 03:45:05,stocks,"I'll try and be as carefull as i can. Then again, i'm using money i've kind of accepted to lose at this point. 

WSB, for me at least, is not my source anymore. Seeing how the mods there have acted since the first squeze. From then on superstonk has been getting my attention, where some really good DD's have been posted (HOC 1, 2 and 3 for example). I believe the mods there are truly good guys, they have gotten some big names on the board and hosted some awesome AMA's. The actual reason i got in was the shady illegal action going on in the background. The moment the SEC starts doing it's job (if it ever will) this will all come falling down. If the thesis is correct, this would mean there would be another, massive and unstoppable, short squeze coming. 

Also, it's not all big money that is playing here, at this point i believe retail is holding a massive amount of cards and could take over the game."
2021-06-08 09:26:30,stocks,"I don't disagree with anything you said, but IMO - for every retail investor holding shares, there are 10 who bought in and panic sold. 

I have a buddy who bought $2,500 worth of G M E in premarket, and panic sold before the market even opened. There are too many people who thought they'd take a gamble, and dipped out as soon as they learned how volatile it is. 

That doesn't mean it won't happen, though. I'm still holding one share, just in case."
