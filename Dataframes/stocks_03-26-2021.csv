03/26/2021,stocks,"Naked Short call - unlimited downside - make money by theta decay (the decay of the option price as 1 day passes) or if the stock price goes down (bearish/neutral trade) and if the option expires in the money then you now owe the buyer 100 stock per contract (could be a huge pay out) to avoid, buy the option back before expiry, roll the option, or start the option as a covered call (already own the underlying)

Similar with short put but if it expires In the money then you have to buy 100 shares per contract at the strike price"

You still have the shares so you can do this again,  but with a lower premium price. 

Then again the next month. 

Eventually you've lost a bunch on the stock and aren't making much on the premiums,  when suddenly the VIX explodes higher.   You don't get much upside though because your covered shares are called away at the strike price.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Covered calls are great, until the stock runs above the strike price, or drops like a rock. You can make a decent return on CCs, but at the same time you're betting against your own shares.  Assuming the price doesn't rise above your strike, you can continue to collect premiums.  If you're wrong, however, you'll have to rollover the into a later date, or just let your shares go. 

There really isn't any ""trick"" going on here.  You're betting against your own stock rising above the price that you sold your option at.  
Betting that the stock you bought into is going to stay between your cost basis and the strike price.  CCs allow you to lock in profits by selling strikes above your CB, but at the same time your potential profit is locked at the ceiling of your option's strike price, so if it rises above that you won't see the profit beyond your CC, unless you buy to close (at a loss for that period)."

03/26/2021,stocks,"You cannot count losses from a wash sale against your gains.

This post seems like the guy day traded gains and loses in stocks routinely - never waiting 30 days between selling at a loss and buying again.

Therefore - any loss they cannot count against their gains.

He thought he had 1.4 million in gains a (for the sake of numbers call it) 1.3 million in loses. But all of the loses were nullified as a result of a wash sale.

So he has 1.4 million in gains he needs to pay taxes on."

I prepare taxes for a living, wash sale losses are 100% disallowed. The wash sale losses do not carry forward, that deduction is gone. I don't know how that person ended up with such a high tax bill, but I suppose it would be possible if you were constantly in and out of the same stocks. Trading apps need to do a better job of educating new investors about these issues."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Still, I can't understand how he ended up in the situation. Let's say I bought a stock and sold it at a loss and immediately bought it again. If I kept doing this, my losses will be added to the subsequent purchase, right? So, I would ""realize"" losses when I sell it.

I am looking for a concrete example on how he ended up in that situation."
03/26/2021,stocks,Well that’s bullcrap. I still lost money selling it and then rebuying it at a lower cost then it went back up make up for the losses or more. The government just hate retail investors
03/26/2021,stocks,"Can you explain me with a small example? Let's say I bought 100 MSFT at 240 and sold at 220. I now have a loss of $2000. Let's say I buy 100 MSFT at 230 the next day. The cost basis would actually be 250 because the previous loss is now added to my stock purchase. Now if I sell at 240. My loss would be $1000.

Let's say I buy 10 AMZN at 3000 and sell at 3100. I profited $1000.

Will I have to pay tax for $1000 or $0 if these are the only trades I did this year?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Not 100% sure - outside of I know you cannot have a loss for tax purposes as a result of a wash sale.
03/26/2021,stocks,"It’s to prevent loop holes in taxes.

12/31 can’t sell something for a $3,000 loss - get the tax write off - and buy it back on 1/1."
03/26/2021,stocks,"In your example, you would pay taxes on the $1000 gain. 

I'll give my own example:

6/1: Buy 100 MSFT at $240.
6/2: Sell 100 MSFT at $220. $2000 capital loss. 
6/30: Buy 100 MSFT at $230. That $2000 capital loss just became nondeductible. Your tax basis is $230, the previous loss is not added to your stock purchase. If you sell MSFT at a gain later, you cannot use the $2000 loss to offset it for tax purposes. 

Now, let's say you buy AMZN on 6/30 instead of MSFT, your loss is still deductible because wash sale rules only apply when you are selling and buying the same stock. 

The IRS does this to prevent people from selling losses at the end of the year for tax purposes and then buying back in at a similar price in January. If you wait 31 days after realizing the loss and buying back in, your loss is not subject to wash sale rules."

Tesla has another 10 years before they go the way of Saturn."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The market share argument would make a lot more sense in a stagnant EV market, but EV is a rapidly growing section of the total auto market. They are still competing for market share with ICE’s more than with other EV’s for the time being. 

That’s leaving aside arguments about Tesla’s advantages in automation, head start on mass production methods for EV’s, home and municipal power storage, and goals to develop ridesharing as part of their business model. 

Many of the competitors selling EV’s are selling them at a loss and subsidizing them with ICE sales. Tesla is closer to selling EV’s profitably. 

I have no shares in Tesla so no dog in the game, but the bear cases for Tesla are getting over stated IMO. And, if their share price drops a little more I’ll pick up some shares. Elon Musk may be an asshole but he has a much more aggressive vision for technology development than you’ll find at established players in the auto market. That vision could pay off big time like Ark thinks it will, or it could get outcompeted. That’s the risk reward scenario. 

Most of the arguments I’ve seen against Tesla are overly reliant on generalist heuristics and don’t take much effort to see if the heuristics apply. Tesla’s share price is taking a beating right now, but that really doesn’t impact anything the company is doing right now. After this price correction runs it’s course, we’ll see more growth from Tesla."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Tesla wisely aimed for the luxury car market, so they don't compete with the market for mass produced daily drivers.  Companies like VW, Ford, GM, etc will eventually outsell them, but Tesla is still making more profit per unit.  Tesla does need to keep an eye on the likes of Lexus, BMW, and the other luxury brands.



Tesla vs VW\Ford\whoever is like Apple vs Android.  There are more Android phones than Apple phones.  But Apple has the luxury\status symbol section of the market.  So profit per unit sold is in the favor of Tesla & Apple, while other companies have to compete with each other for the lower profit section of the market."
03/26/2021,stocks,I would stop looking at Tesla as just an EV. Look at it as a  autonomous car with the plus side of it being electrical. No other companies have data close to what Tesla has to feed to the AI.
03/26/2021,stocks,"based on non-bull estimates of fair value, from a wide variety of sources, I think Tesla has a fair value in the $350 range and will settle there.

edit -- lol I love the down votes with no commentary. lots of butthurt Tesla cultists have brainwashed themselves."

03/26/2021,stocks,"The question here is whether the market will collectively wake up suddenly and drop stock price by 80% over a span of a couple of weeks or whether true believers will melt away slowly and drop the price by 80% in six months.  Even if there is not a sudden realization, the reckoning is coming.   There is basically a hard stop that will occur sometime in the next six quarters.  Over that time frame traditional auto makers will flood the market with their own EVs.  Tesla will quickly lose market share in all markets, not just Europe.  The idea of Tesla holding onto an outsized percentage of the EV market will require stock holders with more and more credulity.  At some point even the most delusional of investors will have to admit what is obvious."
03/26/2021,stocks,Just to point it out although your argument still stands is that  android is just the OS and their said market shares are fragmented into different companies.
03/26/2021,stocks,Their valuation is not based on them playing the niche market but having a dominant position in all segments. If what you are saying is true tesla is a bomb.

How many batteries can they produce? Tesla is aiming for 20 million cars a year by 2030-35. & they're producing their own batteries. You can build a prototype but it's your ability to scale that will differentiate the winners from the losers in the EV race IMO. & it's pretty evident, to me anyways, that tesla is in the lead in that respect."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Wait, hold on,  what kind of options did you buy that you could afford to cover?   A little more detail would help give you an actual answer.   Options can be very dangerous so if you don't understand what the risk is you should leave them mostly alone.   Sure,  buy one (calls? Puts?) to see what it does (maybe) but don't do much more until you understand.   The idea of unlimited downside means you can lose more than your initial investment,  more than your trading account,  and more than your net worth."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, I'm realizing that part. My question from a risk/strategy perspective: is it better to still limit the number of options you hold to what you could theoretically cover or close to that? Since the option prices can be super volatile, especially if they are longer term and/or the strike price is far from the current stock price. I can see my portfolio going up and down 20%+ in a day if it were filled with options."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The ones I bought were in case of whole market crash. So for example, I bought one AAPL $80 strike price put expiring 9/17. I'm pretty sure I could only lose the price I paid for it ($70 total, I think), in case it expires worthless. But I made sure I had $6000 cash, and my plan if there was a big crash was to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $60 and exercise the option to make $2000 profit. Now theoretically if I have $6000 cash, I could afford 85 of those options...but that seems like it would be quite volatile and probably unwise. Does that sound right?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Do you know the greeks? Do you know the strategies? If not, stay away from options"
03/26/2021,stocks,"the number of options you hold is up to you

options are can be extreme volatile if you want

if your expiration is 1 month, yes itll swing violently

if you hold leaps, it can be similar to holding shares on margin

utimately, it's up to you what you want with them"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Also,  that's a heck of a market crash needed before those would pay off.  Worldwide pandemics are (thankfully) rare, so are world wars.   Those are the types of things that will make big profitable companies lose half their value in six months.   Peak to trough in the great recession 12 years ago was right about 50%.

In that case the option isn't gaining you anything.   If AAPL is at $80 you break even on your option.  You could just buy the shares at $80 without the option.  If it's below $80 as in your example $60, you could buy the shares at $60 and use the option to sell them at $80 for a gain of $20 x 100 (shares per contract) = $2000. .

So assuming a 50% crash every 10 years,  and you're buying six month options (20 contracts over ten years) at $70 each,  you spent $1400 to make $2000 for a total gain of $600 over 10 years. If a major 50% drop doesn't happen for 20 years,  you've spent $2800 to gain $2000 for a $800 loss over 20 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ok. Yes, you are correct,  if you buy a put the most you can lose is your premium.  

Most of the time the market (and most of the stock in it) don't move very far or very quickly, so  buying puts sometimes gain a little a sometimes lose the premium,  but if you want to spend the money as an insurance policy,  fine.  Just expect to lose money on that for years,  and eventually someday it will pay off some.  I'm guessing over an entire business cycle you'd break even on those so it's not an awful idea.   

However if you plan on buying in bulk (not insurance against your long positions) you aren't going to be happy losing all your premiums."
03/26/2021,stocks,I've heard a few option strategies. Looking up Greeks now. I'm not looking to actively trade options any time soon. But might learn about it and do it later. This was a one-time thing due to current weird market conditions. Basically I bought a small number of low strike price puts in case the market crashes.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, I'm definitely not doing this every 6 months... Probably a one time thing. Maybe a second time if things look similar to today in 6 months. I think there are very unique market conditions right now. I was doing fine investing normally till last month. It seemed like that stopped working.

Would I be happy if it went up to $400/share?  Heck yes.  Would I be shocked if it fell another $10-$20/share before continuing a more reasonable growth pattern? Not at all."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agree completely. 

I’m new to Reddit, how do you quote specific portions of the post in your comment like that? Is it possible on mobile?"
03/26/2021,stocks,">You believe CRM is ""100 percent"" undervalued and that their P/E should be 100? Wtf. 

I believe with their current PE at 20 something and it's 5 year average at 40 something is 100 percent discounted. Read better.

>You've said your positions, not your beliefs, and then made some pie-in-the-sky projections baselessly.

I didn't say I was going to list my beliefs or reasons why? I asked about the subreddits crm thoughts, based on their own info. 

See you at 340 in October"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Current p/e is like 26 . 5 year avg is like 43. I can get into acquisitions and free cash flow / eps vs peers but was looking for broad interpretations of what this forums thoughts were on crm over the next 12 months. Didn't think this forum would think my original post was meant as DD or anything remotely similar. 

That being said, see you at 340 in October."
03/26/2021,stocks,"By no definition in the universe is this a ""DD"" of any kind.   

DD means due *diligence*. That means assessing the best, middle, and **worse** case scenarios using facts, fundamentals, and paper testing your goals/aims.   

The OP isn't even good *cheerleading*, since they state no even tenuous facts to support their ideas, it certainly isn't a freaking DD."
03/26/2021,stocks,"> how do you quote specific portions 

Like this:   

\> how do you quote specific portions"
03/26/2021,stocks,99% of DD on reddit = I like the stock + a couple numbers pulled out of thin air.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You and one other guy got so butt hurt over this post lol. I never claimed my post was dd or anything remotely close.  It was a super general outline of my current position and one minor catalyst that, if corrected, could shoot the stock up around $400/ share by end of year and then a request for ppl to give their input. Not dd or cheerleading"

03/26/2021,stocks,"> Like this: 

Oh ok, I see. Thank you!"
03/26/2021,stocks,I think this is good because now CP has a rail route extending Canada US and Mexico. However they still have Union Pacific and BNSF as their competitors. One downside to this is that this rail is a north to south rail as opposed to east and west. I personally think the rails that go from coast to coast in the US have it better. This is all just my opinion though not financial advice
03/26/2021,stocks,"What I've read indicates that

* This is the only major remaining rail merger that has *any* chance of being approved. If it's rejected, then we're not gonna see any merger activity for the foreseeable future in this sector.

* Analysts seem to think it's more likely than not that it will be approved. Points working in favor include: KCS's exemption from the current STB rules, the fact that the new CPKC will still be the smallest Class 1 railroad, and the fact that CP and KCS have no crossover in their existing routes.

* I don't think there's a huge amount of upside in trying to play guess-the-STB-result by entering $KSU. It's trading only about 5% below the implied offer price at the moment, and the offer won't go through for another few months yet (so including time value of money, very small gain). This also implies that the market thinks there's a pretty good chance the deal will happen.

* As for $CP (and eventually $CPKC), less sure. We'll have to see what the leverage profile looks like and get a better sense of how shippers are reacting to the possibility of synergies post-acquisition."
03/26/2021,stocks,I heard all the prior times a Canadian company tried to acquire an American rail they blocked the acquisition
03/26/2021,stocks,My sense is that it is positive as well.  I had read that one aspect could be more efficient trade of mexican made cars and car parts to the US and Canada as well as oil by rail for Canada to the gulf coast.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I believe that you are correct, that either they were not approved or that the merger was abandoned.  In this case, from what I am reading, they are saying that there is no overlap between the service areas - so no loss of competition, and these are the 2 smallest majors.  Now if that makes a difference, I don't know.  

Do you think it won't pan out?"
03/26/2021,stocks,True that’s a good point
03/26/2021,stocks,It already ripped. I still have it on my watchlist waiting for a dip.
03/26/2021,stocks,"When you make a market order you are immediately executing on the the opposite side of the spread. (E.g. if I buy at market, I pay the best available ask price)

It’s best practice to use limit orders for this reason. You can get hurt pretty bad if liquidity has dried up and thus the spread widens."
03/26/2021,stocks,No one should ever use market orders
03/26/2021,stocks,"Only risky with huge spreads. Say you have a set of rules, and one by one they are checked off... and this set of rules has been back tested... hell yeah I would do a market order for entry."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Wrong. If you are taking a long position for a true undervalued company and you believe the stock is going to increase your investment,  market orders are fine.  Why miss a buy if it doesn't hit your limit? If your truly worried about a few pennies of cost basis,  you must not be confident in your buy."
03/26/2021,stocks,The risk associated with getting a bad fill with a market order is not worth it in any scenario. That is my opinion and we can agree to disagree though.
03/26/2021,stocks,"There's no risk associated unless your buying into a stock experiencing extreme volatility,  or your setting a market order ""on the open,  or in the close."" When I was new to this,  I felt the way you do.  I realized most of my limit orders were catching falling knives as the limit is generally set lower than the ask. For years I've used market orders when I am ready to buy and never regret it.  If i was too nervous to do it,  I probably shouldn't be buying the stock.  If your holding a stock that you expect to go up,  are you really worried whether you saved a few cents on your buy?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Like I said buddy, agree to disagree."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Just educating you.  You can agree to disagree that you like limit orders.  But your comment was that no one should use market orders ever, which is factually incorrect.  Not an opinion of being incorrect,  but fact.  If you only use limit orders you can miss buys and pay even higher. So if one person ever missed their buy by not using a market order,  it makes your statement wrong."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I am licensed broker currently working closely with order routing and filling.Your argument is basically ""so what if I get a poor fill, im holding for a long time"" which is fine if that is your mindset but you should care more about order fill quality. I have seen plenty of unfavorable fills due to market orders being placed which could have been avoided by placing a marketable limit order. Market orders allow the broker more flexibility to route your order to a potentially less favorable exchange. I suppose this all also depends on the size of your trades and the liquidity of a given security as well. A bad fill on a $1,000,000 trade is more significant than on a $100 trade - but the logic behind it still stands."
03/26/2021,stocks,His argument boils down to if i like the stock im volunteering to get fucked today for no reason.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you're going to market order, you should have the ability to push to x exchange imo"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Silicon Valley isn't a big fan of Palantir and vice versa. Karp is outspoken about his dislike of big social media companies.

The reality is, tech companies like making tech, think it's cool to have their own tools, and resist outside engineers encroaching on their ""turf"". Non-tech companies like ROI and cutting costs and could care less about this or that software, so long as it's the best option for their bottom line. It's an easier sell and long standing companies as clients looks *fantastic* for marketing in the business world.

Bear case? They've been around for a while though, which is weird for a tech company. Going public might be a cash grab for a company who hasn't been able to give their long-term employees the same incentives that other tech companies can. Social justice types don't like them and spread bad publicity far and wide whenever their government ties and western-centric focus comes up.

I like the stock tho..."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Palantir is a company that usually gets on the news for one of three reasons:

* Its close alignment with national security / CIA / counter-intelligence operations. In other words, this is a company with strong government and defense ties, in an industry that is dominated by consumer and business software companies. 
* Racial discrimination allegations, especially against Asians, which fall within the same theme of the company being tied to US counter intelligence, whose main opponent is, of course, China but also, to a lesser degree, all other foreign powers.
* Its participation in controversial Trump-era projects, like ICE detention, which indicate a conservative / nationalist bent that, if you combine it with the above two factors and founder Peter Thiel's political beliefs, almost makes it seem like a industry equivalent of the Homeland Security Department.

For these reasons, Silicon Valley doesn't like Palantir and vice versa, because they are two different breeds. Silicon Valley is deeply liberal, Democratic leaning, and globalist. Palantir comes across as the opposite."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm the opposite, I keep getting more bullish.

Dilution sucks and I'm not going to take away from that, but their boomer contracts are a good thing and not a bad thing imo. I don't want them partnered with some shitty tech company with massive debt, no revenue, and no guarantee to exist in 5 years. Sure if they can truly help them and improve the company its a win win, but I'm not worried about growth companies not being their focus. Plus if they can get old ""boomer"" companies to use their software, they'll have no problem helping younger more computer and tech literate people/companies transition. Think of them starting on hard mode.

My favorite point is they're damn near a defense company with arms into everything else (Oil/Green Energy/Automotive/Healthcare/Mining/etc) and I like that, defense is the best performing part of my portfolio besides Apple. So perhaps I'm biased because of that, but its a well diversified company with cool tech. Their revenue is increasing in all aspects, more customers yoy, more revenue from said customers yoy. I wish I could see more in depth real world use of the technology and I'll need to go over their 10k again, but I've slowly been increasing my position in my retirement account, although its still pretty small (50 shares)

The outstanding options you mention will need to meet certain criteria to be exercised as noted below. I've got to run, but finding out what requirements are needed for them to be exercised under the equity compensation plans would be semi important.

>As of December 31, 2020, there were 1,542,057,292 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding, 249,077,252 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding  and 1,005,000 shares of our Class F common stock  outstanding.  Substantially  all  of these  shares  may be  immediately  sold.  Moreover,non-affiliates who have beneficially owned our Class A common stock for at least six months may rely on Rule 144 to sell their shares of Class A common stock, and our directors, executive officers, and other affiliates (including our Founders and their affiliates) who have beneficially owned our Class A common stock for at least six months are entitled to sell their shares of our Class A common stock subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Further, as of December 31, 2020, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 253,744,515 shares of our Class A common stock and 282,021,988 shares of our Class B common stock, 124,870,238 shares of our Class A common stock and 60,000,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to RSUs and 1,470,781 shares of our Class A common stock subject to growth units. All shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans have been registered for public resale under the Securities Act. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and compliance by affiliates with Rule 144, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSUs and growth units will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.

Edit; Went and looked quickly for what I could find

***2020 Equity Incentive Plan***

>In September 2020, prior to the Direct Listing, the Company’s Board of  Directors approved the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”). The  2020 Plan provides for the grant of ISOs, NSOs, restricted stock, RSUs,  SARs, and performance awards to the Company’s employees, directors, and consultants. A total  of 150,000,000 shares Palantir Technologies Inc.  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)  of the Company’s Class A common stock are reserved for issuance pursuant  to the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of Class A common  stock reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan includes the number of shares of Class A common stock or  Class B common stock subject to awards under the Company’s Amended 2010  Equity Incentive Plan and Executive Equity Plan. Shares of Class B  common stock added to the 2020 Plan from the 2010 Plan or Executive Equity Plan are reserved  for issuance under the Company’s 2020 Plan as Class A common stock. The  number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under  the 2020 Plan will also include an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year  beginning on January 1, 2022, equal to the least of:

* 250,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock;
* Five percent (5%) of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year; or
* such other amount as the administrator of the 2020 Plan determines.

>Under  the 2020 Plan, the exercise price of options granted is generally at  least equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Class A common stock on the date of grant. The term of an ISO generally  may not exceed ten years. Additionally, the exercise price of any ISO  granted to a 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the  estimated fair value of the common stock on the date of grant, and the term of such option grant shall not  exceed five years. Options and other equity awards become vested and, if  applicable, exercisable based on terms determined by the Board of  Directors or an other plan administrator on the date of grant, which is typically five years for  new employees and varies for subsequent grants.

Options

>During  the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Company modified  37,451,458 fully vested and outstanding options that were approaching expiration. The extension of the original options was  recorded as a stock option modification whereby the incremental fair  value of each option was determined at the date of the modification and  $9.4 million was immediately recognized related to vested options. The weighted average extended term  for the modified options was approximately 0.46 years.  
>  
>In June 2020, the Company repriced 235,885,337 stock options. As part of the  repricing, the original options were canceled and new options were  granted with an exercise price of $4.72 per share and a remaining  contractual term of ten years. The new options were generally subject to the same service-based vesting schedule as the  original options. The repricing was recorded as a stock option  modification whereby the incremental fair value of each option was  determined at the date of the modification and $74.0 million was immediately recognized related to vested options in  June 2020 and an additional $4.5 million was recognized during the three  months ended September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, there was  remaining incremental fair value of $27.0 million which will be recognized over  the remaining requisite service period.

***RSUs***

>The following table summarizes the RSU activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2020: Unvested and outstanding at September 30, 2020 - 199,655,233  $ 6.69 The performance-based vesting condition for all RSUs was satisfied upon the  Company’s Direct Listing, September 30, 2020. Upon such satisfaction, 68,149,214 RSUs, for which  the service-based vesting condition was met as of such date, vested and  converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock.  As a result, the Company recognized $769.5 million in cumulative stock-based compensation expense  using the accelerated attribution method from the grant date. **As of  September 30, 2020, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the RSUs outstanding was $1.0 billion, which the Company expects to recognize  over 3.13 years.**

Don't have time to really follow up or make sense of this atm, so here's the [prospectus](https://www.bamsec.com/filing/119312520292188?cik=1321655). Seems like they're going to be paying out a lot of shares continued for the next few years. Wasn't the 769.5million stock base compensation noted in their 10k bringing them from profitable to way negative? I remember people mentioning that, and that number sounds right."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Them focusing on ""boomer companies "" is all the bullish info you need"
03/26/2021,stocks,Curious about what others think about share dilution as well. Seems like the stock price will be noticeably affected by this over time
03/26/2021,stocks,I would compare Palantir with Salesforce and will eat Salesforce lunch at some point.
03/26/2021,stocks,"My largest concern is that no one knows exactly how much useful Palantir products are.

For example, I worked with a product which was advertised ""Enables enterprise users to maximize productive collaboration while enhancing digital well-being"". Sounds cool, huh? But that's corporate bullshit, in fact it was just a browser extension, you could hover your coworker's email and the extension would show in a popup if that person is on vacation right now or is actually in the office. That's it.

We have the same load of bullshit about Palantir, it's written on their website, it was shown us on the demo day. So they presumably can automatically load all company's data, build an ontology and then use the AI to answer complex questions and power real-time decisions, bla-bla-bla. The question is, how much of that is true. If they indeed can load all data automatically and immediately say ""adjust that particular workflow and your company will save XX millions"", then the product is awesome and is totally worth hundreds of billions. The more likely scenario is that it's just a fancy dashboard, and the real decision is done by a smart person, who looks at that dashboard. The problem in that case is that the smart person doesn't really need a slick dashboard, they probably can come up with the same decision by looking at excel sheets. In that case the product is not worth a lot, and the company is overvalued even right now.

I'm an IT engineer, and my experience says that the probability of the second scenario is much higher, so fundamentally I'm bearish. On the other hand, I hold a large position in Palantir and will add more to it in the future, because I do not trust that an average Joe will understand the problem - I think the majority of people will easily get fooled by words like AI and ML and cool demos. The actual misconception will not be uncovered in next few years at least, because I'm pretty sure that Palantir clients sign an NDA. And in general, no company will easily admit that they've spent several millions on a fancy dashboard. But due all of that, and due to this aura of secrecy, the stock will feel great and will keep rising"
03/26/2021,stocks,Nobody is smart in the market. You are overthinking. I would say the hype is too big about the Palantir. It is not the right time to buy.
03/26/2021,stocks,PLTR hasn't turned a profit in 20 years. that's enough for me to stay away.
03/26/2021,stocks,"since when is being targeted in which enterprise companies you sell to a bad thing? that's the issue with a lot of companies, trying to serve SMB and ent and not doing either well - don't have the implementation teams, support, and security for enterprise, not cheap enough or plug & play for SMB...sometimes you pick a segment and serve them well."
03/26/2021,stocks,Makes sense for them to sell shares again since they sold at 9 and geniuses rushed to buy some months later at 40... either way indeed a lot of “new” companies do it at least once after their IPO
03/26/2021,stocks,"i like to think they went public for free publicity as if they hit the milestones they wanted (hinted with apollo and new versions for Foundry and Gotham).

As for the engineers ""turf"", I agree that's the case but that's essentially the biggest competition they have and they'll need to beat this at one point for the biggest market share. Your argument makes sense but I still think they need to face the issue since currently, the whole data analytics infra scene is a wild west with no real standard right now. Foundry could easily become one judging from how it handles everything end to end."
03/26/2021,stocks,"They definitely have a political story that differs from Silicon Valley but typically company's interests lie on profits. If such political stories are in their way of growth, I'd consider it a pretty bearish signal"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m no expert, but it looks like they plan to either grow fast or stagnate their stock. Karp says he’s focused on the long term, but that does look aggressive."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Focusing on those companies is still important but my point was why avoid their own circle? their peers are the number one validator. Boomers are literally adopting AWS because they see tech companies treating it as a golden standard. I'm not saying only work with techies, but rather I think it's a low hanging fruit. I'm confused on their stubbornness, as if they aren't confident in earning their validation or philosophical stubbornness out of disagreeing with Silicon Valley which are both weird"
03/26/2021,stocks,i agree that their Foundry easily could replicate if not more of what Salesforce does
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm going to have to disagree with this. The website does throw buzzwords around with no substance but their Foundry demos actually show very in-depth usages of the product (enough to infer what/why they are useful) so I highly recommend rewatching them and compare them to what engineers would have to do without. 

As a SWE, I basically do what Foundry is capable of manually for our team's data scientists (manage database acls, then query specific data on behalf, or create dashboard) on top of my higher priority feature work. and the data scientists also manually have to upload the queried data to their ML models, look through the dataset, and write one-off scripts to manipulate the data. Imagine all the precious eng hours of manual work that could be saved... it looks like Foundry that makes all this doable via no code very quickly. Not to mention this experience was at FANG where we did have some internal tooling to automate some part but got deprecated in a year or two. Without a doubt, Palantir's products have immense value and is not a fraud like you described.

I guess my point was that I'm confused why they are so exclusive with their products since they are very useful and could really be the standard of the data analytics infrastructure for all companies out there in my opinion. It's almost like wasted opportunity from what I can tell"
03/26/2021,stocks,I guess they were investing aggressively I themselves and their products.
03/26/2021,stocks,"they have been building software that companies will need in the future, not in the present 20 years ago"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well they don't just focus on enterprise companies. They focus on specifically old, large ones. Because of this focus, it's a fact that they are inevitably consultancy-like (they still mostly hire FDEs, not SWEs). It's definitely a concern despite how SaaS-like they become (which I think they should become)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"If they can deliver for big companies, it won’t matter if tech is reluctant. Unless a company is trying to compete directly, boards will see the results and make a push for reducing cost of in-house development and improving efficiency, etc.

I’d be more concerned with their ability to deliver consistent results for cases like manufacturing giants right now, rather than upcoming big data competition. They need to establish themselves immediately in the corporate world or they won’t even be a part of it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Once Salesforce is in an organization, it is near impossible to replacement.  I was part of team  10 years ago selecting the new CRM - I did not like the system, but their sales team was outstanding in convincing management telling them what they needed.  More services were added on over the years.   Thus, this allows me to understand why I read Palantir customer acquisition cost is extremely high as they cannot displace incumbents easily."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The current threat is the overall market popping and there’s an overall drawdown of prices across the board.

Recent price actions are exciting sure but it just mean we are hyped. Sure, Apes are jumping up and down screaming back and forth. Party on.

Palantir to me has monopolistic tendency and has capabilities more than what meets the eyes in what they can do. And so, it’s a buy n’ hodl. 

There are some points in share dilutions, etc. my argument is that those metrics might not applies. Why? When was the last time wallstreet value tech correctly. The growth and dominance of tech pretty much rules the world. In tech, our default scale is exponential. The affect on society is the same."
03/26/2021,stocks,Maybe the modularity of the software is a problem? Some modular software is harder to integrate with a new client then others. This could explain them focussing on big sluggish boomer company clients who are sure to stick around.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Have a look at this article. Short is long

[https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short\_is\_long.pdf](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/download/pdf/short_is_long.pdf)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Because the price went up on that sale, short sales look the same as any other transaction."
03/26/2021,stocks,Goooo JeeeeeEmmmmEeeeeee!!!
03/26/2021,stocks,"But there is still a risk of the deal not going through, right?. I vaguely remember some cases where deals thrown out at the last minute for one reason or another. So maybe there is still a big IF about the deal going through, and probably the reason why the big banks/HFs have not acquired it completely."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Wait so what is happening exactly, I read the article but I'm still a bit confused. Just because a stock was trading at a higher price before doesn't mean that it will go back up to that same price."
03/26/2021,stocks,There has to be a catch here. The market seems to be pricing in that shareholders / regulators won't accept it because they don't want to sell this to china for strategic reasons.
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks for posting this just withdrew all my bags I’ve been holding hoping to come back bc I’m relatively new and learned a lot in this experience.. will be more patient and smart I. Future and this will be a forsure gain. Appreciate it my friend
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is awesome. Thank you for sharing.

TL;DR: Buy now, get $29/share later due to company going private."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Do you have any info on when the buy out will happen?

Edit. Seen the link sorry."
03/26/2021,stocks,Why did I read this only now. Seriously I'm always late on every decent news.
03/26/2021,stocks,I’m shocked that this hasn’t been bought up already by the big banks. This is arbitrage and usually they buy that up almost immediately
03/26/2021,stocks,Just got in at $26.18.
03/26/2021,stocks,What happens to your stocks when it does go private?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, you run the risk of shareholders voting against the offer of 50% above yesterdays closing share price, but this deal was speculated to be on the tables for a while, and was passed unanimously by the board of directors"
03/26/2021,stocks,They are being bought out. It means that you get $29 per share if you're willing to wait out the time for the aquisition to be complete. This one surprised me because its trading so far below that number. There's about a 10-14% gap. Only a matter of time before whales jump at the opportunity to buy up shares selling far below what they should be
03/26/2021,stocks,Well the risk is that the shareholders do not accept the buyout of 50% above the stock price before the over was made. The vote was unanimous by the Board of Directors.
03/26/2021,stocks,"No problem. Obviously there isn't unlimited shares to go around, but anything under 29 will be profitable."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, that's pretty much how it works. You can obviously sell earlier, whales will look to buy for anything under 29 usually. I'm just surprised that it isn't at 29 already. Clearly a lot of people felt the need to sell early/didn't see the news."
03/26/2021,stocks,"They say the 2nd half of 2021. The price will probably move towards 29 much earlier than that though, it just seems like there wasn't enough momentum at the start of the day to send it to 29. I'm fine with waiting if it means I'm guaranteed 10% though"
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's sitting at about 26.15 after hours, but you did miss out on that 25.50 steal. Anything under 29 is good though, you just won't be profiting as much as the guy that bought at 25.50."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Shareholders have to vote on the decision, but the vote amongst board of directors was unanimously in favour. I think it didn't catch momentum due to the movement of the market, but by Monday/Tuesday, it'll probably be sitting around 28.50 if I had to guess"
03/26/2021,stocks,aaaaand it dropped.
03/26/2021,stocks,Right I read through the first part again and your comment and I get it now. Happy to be early for once although its already gone up to about 26.
03/26/2021,stocks,Why would the stock be at 29 now? Who in their right mind would pay 29 to get 29 in return in the future. The price of 25 right now makes sense.
03/26/2021,stocks,Ya that’s what I’m kinda of thinking.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Is it guaranteed to complete?

I bet in after hours / pre it hits 29. That rally end of the day was great for everything!"
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol this always happens 😂 unlucky brother. Still better than nothing though so don't sweat it :))
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's trading for about 25.47 right now. It should go to 29 soon enough. Whales love guaranteed money, they'll buy up as many shares as they can get if the shareholders vote for the proposed buyout"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I didn't mean 29 exactly, but usually they sell for about 20-50c below (or sometimes above) that offering number. If you look at the likes of GLUU, the price floats around 12.50, the buyout price, but occasionally it goes below that. If you were offered a guaranteed 10%,would you take  it over a possible 10% on a stock you've seen others talk about?"
03/26/2021,stocks,They still have to go through various lawyers groups who will attempt to sue them because they are not getting the best deal for the stock holders.  Following that countries have to approve the merger.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks for posting this. 

Never experienced a buyout before. What happens to the stock in my portfolio, it just disappears and money replaces it?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah fairs. Just bought in at 24.46 for 100 shares. Don't have much more to put in right now unfortunately but better than nothing ;))

Also 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: bought in at 25.46 not 24.46
Edit 2: more 🚀🚀🚀"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sure I would but I am too much of a gambler with the current insane volatility of the market to shy away with dumping all my free cash into it. Plus, remember you will take short term capital gains tax on it, so some long term investments might be better for the tax break. Honestly, I appreciate the heads up because I will stick some of my money into it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This. Nothing is done until it's done. You're betting on things going smoothly, which they probably will, but if they don't it's game over.

I bought Fitbit at a buck under purchase price when Google announced, and jumped ship at 50 cents under purchase price at some point because Google was getting greater scrutiny and I was worried the deal would get nuked by regulators. I wound up being wrong, but this is the sort of stuff you're betting on."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, a lot like an option expiring;
Last time I had a buyout happen (was with Schwab at the time) it showed up as a ""Stock Merger"" in my transactions the day after it was finalized."

It never even hit that price today dude, you on a darkpool? lmao 🚀🚀🚀"

I honestly don’t think the majority of people in GME think they control the price - it’s clearly bigger players than us fighting it out at this point. 

As for 1 million a share - up front I don’t believe it’ll ever get that high, but they’re not saying EVERYONE will get that. If they (the shorts covering) have to fulfil orders at a rapid pace when they finally concede, is there a chance some people with ridiculously high sell limits will win big? Absolutely.

The question of whether it can get to $1 million or w/e, of course not at least in the short term, once people are up 10x then there is going to be a lot of selling. It may be able to get there long term but the chance of more shares being issues increases the longer the price stays up."
03/26/2021,stocks,You’re completely missing the point that short sellers will be forced to buy back at the price rises and they are margin called during the squeeze
03/26/2021,stocks,The people who are YOLO'ing on this don't care.  Those who want to be long-term holders want them to take advantage of free capital.  It reduces their risk and lets them indirectly capture the craze without selling.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Currently nothing is stopping GME from trying to tap their at-the-market program.  Company transformations are expensive and the more free money you have the better.

Also issuing shares doesn't hurt the so-called ""squeeze"" since the investor riding this train doesn't even think ahead enough about things like this."
03/26/2021,stocks,"But this is completely unfounded conspiracy theory.  No one has the complete picture but none of the actual snapshots of share availability (iborrow, fidelity, FINRA, etc.) indicate the extraordinary short interest that existed in Jan / Feb.

They often conflict and are impartial views at best.  If anything when one is high, often the others are low or vice versa.  In any case the only reasonable conclusion is that this thing is way bigger than one single monolith Illuminati.  There are whales on both sides and average joes on both sides.  Some days shorts get screwed, some days longs get screwed.  Simple as that.

Hell I was short Monday and closed out Wednesday morning, now I have a small long position.  There isn't some magic man with the keys to ""shorting shares"" castle.  Anyone can do it cheaply and get in / out."
03/26/2021,stocks,"With respect this is just wrong. ""Long term holders want them to take advantage of free capital""

You're literally saying that investors are happy with losing hundreds of thousands of dollars when the price tanks on an offering.

If GameStop screws over retail investors and saves hedge funds by doing an offering, then they will go out of business quickly as they will lose support of most retail investors (Myself will be one of them)"
03/26/2021,stocks,I don’t think either of us can comment on what every individual believes or wants. Though I would hazard a guess and say 99.999% of investors are looking forward to a squeeze
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ok. Kidding aside. Here's a snap of my spreadsheet showing my latest sell limit. Feel free to check my math.

[https://imgur.com/a/jkgAt50](https://imgur.com/a/jkgAt50)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I agree. I’ve seen so much rubbish spoken about it because it has become cult-like. There is no genuine discussion on the business or the stock anymore. My view is that it is a failing business, places like Amazon, the move to cloud gaming from Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Sony will come. Cloud computing will also hurt them. That is the direction of travel and cannot be denied. 

You cannot get away with shorting a stock so much and is likely now within Hedge funds risk models to not go so far. It’s hard to get a read on this stock now. It would seem HF still short it because it will absolutely tank, and Retail will continue to pump the stock. This could go on for a good while yet."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The only solids are the artificial price drops on 1/28 and 3/10. According to Bloomberg terminal updates by several people, institutions hold over 100% of shares and retail ownership keeps increasing. Those drops are fake and no one is selling."
03/26/2021,stocks," I would imagine issuing a million new shares wouldn’t put much of a dent in the squeeze. From what I’ve seen, it looks like institutions are reporting somewhere around 120-140 million owned shares, on an available float of 50ish million."
03/26/2021,stocks,I am more concerned at this point that the pro-GME arguments are now being pushed by *gasp...* hedge funds!  We know HFs were all over WSB pages going back to February 2020 when Bloomberg Businessweek had WSB on the cover. Do people not think that hedge funds reversed course and starting betting with the stock?
03/26/2021,stocks,Alright well you can write it off as a conspiracy but there are countless individuals doing solid research and dd  everyday and it’s very obvious the short levels are obscenely high and misrepresented. I don’t think your opinion is going to change based on what I can say at this point so we’ll just have to wait and see what happens.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You're misinterpreting what I am saying.  First off, they already announced that they are looking further into their ATM program.

Of course they would not issue if the public were that sensitive to a change.  They would only issue up to a point that they wouldn't get crucified.  But if the GME cartel pipe dream comes true (again it won't because this cartel has zero enforcement mechanism), and they succeed in ever driving the price upward with zero sensitivity to fundamentals, then there is no reason NOT to issue new shares.

Why not pay huge bonuses and offer lush comp packages to new hires or really build out new divisions?  Plus unwinding at least a portion of their physical presence (which average a lease term of about 2-3 years) is going to cost money.

Some institutional holders are fine issuing new capital.  Some are holders due to other existing relationships with their Ibanking arm or some other reason.  If every share dilution was terrible, then it would never happen but it routinely does.  Sometimes it's just smart win-win for everyone.  This is especially true when shares are high but you also ""like the stock"" so to speak."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well that's thing though.  There isn't actually a squeeze.  Zero evidence of one at least.  No one has the complete picture but various snapshots of share availability fluctuate daily (some are up when others are down and vice versa) across various platforms.  It's a huge game of many players.  Every day new people (plus big whales) jump in and some people jump off.  About what you'd expect.

When the price goes up this is just HODL and cartel building.  The problem is that there is no enforcement mechanism to discipline people from being greedy and taking safe gains."
03/26/2021,stocks,"To add onto my other point.  There is a bit of misinformation out there about the whole ""short squeeze"" thing as well.  Anyone can enter a short position and close it.  Hell I did it Monday later in the day and closed it Wednesday morning.  Today I got a small long position.

There isn't one Magic Man / Illuminati holding the keys to ""short shares"" castle."
03/26/2021,stocks,I would say a ton of hedge funds are also looking forward to the squeeze since they always troll reddit for retail sentiment. How do you know they are not behind the DD on the GME page?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I keep hearing this ""bloomberg terminal"" proof, can you link me to it please?"
03/26/2021,stocks,It could start at a million.  But say you issue a million and it doesn't affect price.  Then you just keep going and printing free money.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Of course they are, or at least a lot of them are.  It's an illusion of ""us"" vs ""them"".

Blackrock, susquehanna, Morgan Stanley own a quarter of the company together and there are 100s of HFs out there."
03/26/2021,stocks,"How do you know it is not the hedge funds themselves pushing some of this DD? They have been all over reddit pages dating back to early 2020 and late 2019 when they were tracking retail sentiment. It has been documented that many funds got behind the GME run in January, why is it so hard to believe that they are in on it now?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"There is absolutely nothing solid about it.  A house cobbled together with graham crackers and honey by a 4yo is more solid.  Did you verify their claims yourself?  Point me to one single solid piece of evidence that shorts are > 100% of float.

This is a huge game played by many different players.  New people are jumping on and off everyday on both sides of this."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I appreciate your clarification. 

Share dilutions are terrible but necessary for companies to raise money. GameStop in their 10K said they have enough funds for 12 months. I also hope with their increased sales they can hold off on doing any offerings until hedge funds pay back their borrowed shares."
03/26/2021,stocks,"All I know is if it goes back to where it was at in Jan I can do wonderful life changing things with my money. If it goes higher (whether with hype, hodl, short or gamma squeeze, or whatever the hell else is happening) then I can probably buy my house outright at 30 years old. Yes please!"
03/26/2021,stocks,I know this :) I swear I am a sane woman I swear haha I do not have a tin foil hat. There are a lot of fishy things going on with this stock. Even if 10% of them are true it’s worth seeing how it all turns out.
03/26/2021,stocks,I don’t care who is behind anything at this point - I’m too intrigued to see how it all ends!

03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes they have enough for existing funding.  There were some legitimate concerns about liquidity.  Honestly 12 months of funding isn't whole lot for normal on-going concerns.

Also, there is zero evidence that ""HFs"" are holding onto shares.  As I mentioned in my other post, there is no magic man with the keys to ""shorting shares"" castle.  Just this past Monday, I opened a short position and closed it Wednesday morning.  There is nothing special about it at all, anyone can do it.  There is no shortage.

No one has the complete picture but various snapshots of share loan availability such as iborrow, Fidelity, FINRA, etc. show healthy fluctuating availability.  Sometimes one is up and others are down or vice versa.  This is way beyond Shitadel, with big players on both sides.  Some days shorts get fucked, some day longs get fucked, simple as that.  It isn't a conspiracy and there is no reason to believe that SI is anywhere close to what it was Jan / Feb."

03/26/2021,stocks,I would just say be careful- this seems like a situation that could go bad. A stock trading way above a normal valuation that is being manipulated in both directions- doesn’t seem like a trade that will end with a bunch of retail millionaires. But that’s just my opinion I guess
03/26/2021,stocks,"What am I looking at.  This is a picture of share ownership which is already public knowledge. Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, Susquahanna... own 25% of the company combined.  They are LONG GME.

This is a high stakes game with MANY big players on both sides.  Doesn't say shit about Melvin / Illuminati holding all the magic short shares."

03/26/2021,stocks,So if that was 2020 filing why are they still manipulating the price downwards
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is a non sequitur.  No one is manipulating the price and there is zero evidence to believe otherwise.  Large number of whales bought yesterday, some people even posted $1M going into it @$180.  These people have money to spare, I doubt that's their entire life savings.

It's a volatile stock and everyday new people jump in and old people jump out.  A LOT of traders profiting off volatility.  If anyone is ""manipulating"", if you can even call stock movement that, it's the long positions.  Even the most optimistic analysis of fundamentals leads to $33-$40 price tag.  With transformations... maybe more like $80 who knows.  But this $300-$1k-$10k is pure delusion."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Trading above 100k won't last just until the shorts cover which could take a few days, and if you think that what happened on those two days isn't price manipulation then I'm not gonna argue"

03/26/2021,stocks,"Because the shorts haven't covered
We wouldn't see this much volatility from people just buying and holding a stock"

Roku did see a huge stock price gain in 2020 & early 2021, and some of that was overbuying.  So it's normal for the stock to correct a bit.  But now the stock is getting oversold and looks to be a strong buy.


And we have not seen any news from Roku about 5G products.  If they can come up with a TV running Roku that has built in 5G, then they'll have a truly massive opportunity to get a subscription service into millions of homes.  I think we may be hearing about cord cutters ditching cable for Roku 5G TV's within a year or two.  



Imagine if Roku continues to be competitive in the smart TV market and then comes up with a 5G TV that requires a subscription.  In a few years people will be spending more on Roku then they are on cable or internet now.  This could catapult Roku into Microsoft or AT&T levels of market dominance.



On a side note, it's Netflix that I'm worried about.  There are too many free movie options out there now.  Netflix has a tone of competitors and they own movie offerings are okay, but not great."

No shit it didn’t do as well as expected people can’t seem to evaluate streaming services there already to many options and people aren’t going to pay for yet another subscription on top of their Hulu, Netflix, Amazon prime and whatever else people have.

03/26/2021,stocks,"If you do 4 within 5 Trading days you will be flagged as a Pattern Trader.

You have to wait 5 trading days before the day trade is removed from your record.

Robinhood automatically stops you at 3 not sure if the other brokers do too. Nothing is stopping you from buying stock a on Monday and selling it Tuesday morning."
03/26/2021,stocks,There are two different things in play.  The pattern day trade rule is indeed the round trips in a day and only 4 in 5 business days (not a physical week).  That rule applies only to margin accounts.  If you have a cash account there is what is called a good faith violation and that is when you sell a security bought with unsettled funds.  Most stocks have a T+2 settlement meaning when you sell something on Monday the funds aren't actually settled until Wed.  Think of it as waiting for a check to clear.  You are allowed to use those unsettled funds to buy something else but if you sell that something else before Wed then you have a good faith violation.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Avoid the rule, try UStockTrade, cash account, T-0, you make a trade and sell, the money is immediately in your account. Very fast transfers.
Only downside is there's no options or margin. But it works great for day trading.
The interface is really easy, and allows you to get in and out of trades fast.
 I like it, my friend used it for years but just switched to a new brokerage. Personally, I like having a couple of brokers and use TDA and UST..

I trade a lot, so the PDT rule really screwed me.
Also, a cash account on TDA is T-3 I believe, it it takes 3 days for my funds to be available to me. The rules they place on us little fish is annoying. You need practice and you can't do that with the PDT rule. Dunno if there's another T-0 brokerage in the US.

Worth checking out."
03/26/2021,stocks,Not sure if you bought those 5 hypothetical shares together or not. I’m not a stock whiz or anything but from my understanding if you buy twice and sell it all once that is two day trades(could be wrong) and if you make that trade Wednesday it’ll be off your acc by next Wednesday.
03/26/2021,stocks,"TDA doesn't stop you but after you have 5, it gives you a warning. If you do it anyways and get flagged, they give you one more chance after talking to support. Then on the 5th, they will let you open it but will not let you close it until the next day regardless"

03/26/2021,stocks,"Interesting question, who's money are those reinvested unsettled funds? Yours or broker's?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sorry I realized I have another question. How do these GFVs accumulate exactly? If I buy shares on Monday, sell them Tuesday, use that buying power in my account to buy 10 shares of something else the same day, is selling those shares individually (within the T+2 window) going to count as a GFV for each?"
03/26/2021,stocks,">Interesting question, who's money are those reinvested unsettled funds? Yours or broker's?

I heard options settle sooner?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"It would be your broker's money backed by the unsettled funds that they know you are owed.

Edit.  I guess it is still your money because your buy isn't settled for two days.  Basically you are waiting two days to actually pay the person you bought it from so the proceeds from your sale would be settled by then.  That is probably where the good faith violation has occurred because you have sold something you haven't actually paid for yet."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes.  The sale of shares that were purchased with unsettled funds is the violation.
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes options are T+1 settlement.  That is because there is no transfer of stock certificates (which really aren't' normally physically transferred anymore but was the reason for giving the extra day for settlement).  Part of the GME/Robinhood fallout was Robinhood asking regulators to reduce stock settlement to T+1 so that they don't have all this unsettled money floating around that they have to cover since it is all electronic now.
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's insane, I must be super lucky with my timing to not have my account restricted yet. Thanks for educating me"

03/26/2021,stocks,You may have a margin account and just not know it.  For instance Robinhood Instant (which is the default for all new users) is actually a margin account although they won't issue you actual margin loans unless you upgrade to Gold.  Part of that is so you can trade instantly and take away a lot of these headaches that most people don't understand.  It also allows them to loan out any of your shares to short sellers.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Holy shit, my SoFi account is by default a margin account, that isn't allowed to do margin trading. Thanks a ton for this comment specifically"
03/26/2021,stocks,"A dollar cost averaging strategy ignores changes in prices entirely. You set your interval and dollar amount ahead of time and put the money in at each interval whether price goes up, goes down, or stays the same.

Suppose I have a Roth IRA and can put $6,000.00 in each year and I want to dollar cost average it in all on VTI throughout the year. I can choose an interval. My interval will be monthly. With an investment of $6,000.00 for the year, that's $500.00 per month. On the first business day of each month, I put $500.00 on VTI regardless of the price. 

In the short term, you may get lucky and get in right before a fluctuation upward or you may get unlucky and get in at the top before a dip a few times in a row, but in the long term, your outcome should revert to the mean, meaning you're more likely to capture the average long term price action by doing this than you would be if you invested a large lump sum. 

The whole point of DCA is to avoid timing the market. It's a product of the ""time in the market beats timing the market"" philosophy. You can try to average down by only buying the dip when technical indicators are pointing to oversold, and it may well be profitable, but it's not dollar cost averaging anymore.

Not financial advice. Plz don't sue."
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, you just put X amount of dollars in every Y amount of time. The number of shares you buy  changes, but the dollar amount stays the same."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure if ""wait for it to dip"" is a great idea.
I'll tell you what I did personally. I bought my first VTI at $198 during the March correction. Then day before yesterday I bought it again at $204. My average went up but I believe in VTI and $204 was still lower than it's all time high so I thought it's a good time to increase percentage of VTI in my portfolio."
03/26/2021,stocks,"No Worries, whatever you do will be wrong. Buy up, it'll go down. Don't buy up and it'll keep going, At least if you're as savvy an investor as me."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Just sit, I’m no advisor but depending on if you see your portfolio going way up in the future you could cost up but I would only cost down, buying dips, if u don’t see it dramatically increasing at some point"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ah I see, I was mistaken with what DCA was. I literally thought it was buy the dip. For example i pretty much been buying apple constantly since my initial investment at 133."

03/26/2021,stocks,"It is because it is the best play for the huge Chinese EV market.

There is 1.4 billion people in China, they are getting rich and more tech savvy by the day, and the Chinese government is very aggressively pushing for EVs and other electric renewables because China itself isn’t a major oil producer, but they can certainly generate their own electricity from solar, wind, nuclear, etc. 

That and the Chinese government is not shy about putting tariffs on their foreign competition as well as giving out local industry subsidies. Moreover the younger Chinese customers are trending more toward buying domestic. They are less likely to view the domestic product as inferior to western imports and they like supporting their own industry. 

All that applies to Chinese EVs in general but NIO have a couple things going on for it

A) a cool battery swab technology 
B) a cult following that rivals that of Tesla with the company promoting an entire lifestyle around the vehicle and clubs for the owners, etc 

On the other hand, we have no reason to believe Ford is going to get any additional market share, they are big, but they aren’t necessarily getting bigger, and they seem to be lagging behind in electrification to GM. Nothing about Ford really stands out"
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's the business model plan for me...

Right now all legacy car manufacturers revenue  is mainly focused on manufacturing, sales/financing and service. Ford had already signaled that they want to move out of the dealership and financing business and move into just 3rd party manufacturing. For years they've been figuring out how to cut corners in the manufacturing process to increase profit margins to the point that they stopped producing sedans. To me it signals that they lost interest in innovation. Combine this history with the declining sales and massive debt and they just look like a company that is not ready for the future. 

NIO has the manufacturing, sales/financing, NIO Service, NIO Power, NIO Life, NIO AI and they're aggressively working on autonomous driving. This company offers these all as a monthly service which shows more revenue opportunity in a country that is aggressively phasing out ICE vehicles. The NIO Power is not just the battery swap stations but includes chargers, power home and mobile charging station. During my initial research they looked like a EV parts manufacturer to me since they have their own battery, power train and motor factories. Soon they'll have their own car manufacturing facility. This doesn't include the partnerships that NIO has with VW and SINOPEC. Also, NIO and XPENG have both been dropping hints about a partnership, which combined would make them the top dog in China."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Nio trades higher due to mainly hype, many people assume nio can't go lower, but it can go so much lower, it can go back to single digits and still be valued quite richly, its a very small car company that is bad in debt and is not established, it absolutely could it be successful in the future sure but short term I wouldn't touch it. Ford has the diffrent problem of that it is well established and has lots of sales and is huge, but Fords main problem is its debt which is massive, this is also true for gm and some of the other legacys that have debt left over from the great recession. And fords leadership is definitely far from my favorite. In my opinion I wouldn't want to own any peice of the ev or auto market right now, I think there are better opertunities with much less risk elsewhere."
03/26/2021,stocks,Why not Volkswagen
03/26/2021,stocks,Ford fundamentals aren't the greatest. They are loosing more and more of the market share and haven't seen growth in vehicle sales in the last 4 years
03/26/2021,stocks,"Legacy automakers have been trying to move into EVs for YEARS before Nio even started. They face a plethora of hurdles and challenges related to unions and their current business models. In this case, it's way more expensive for LAMs to convert their businesses than it is to start from scratch. It's like converting some piece of software into another piece of software - 9 times out of 10, its 10x easier to just build from scratch than it would be to try and convert existing software to what you want.The same applies to branding IMO. If I'm buying a luxury EV, I want to buy a company that only makes EVs so that when I tell my friends I own a Nio/Tesla, they know I have an EV and I'm richer than they are - it may be materialistic, but that's the way the world works. When you buy a Gucci belt, you want people to know its a Gucci belt. If I buy a Ford, most people are just going to assume I drive a Mustang/Focus/etc. - silly as it may seem to some people, it's the same reason a Lambo is 10x more expensive than a Ford."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I've been accumulating Ford for a while myself, and made decent returns on them, through selling CCs and watching the price rise over the past year ... so I may be a bit biased on Ford's EV play.

Until COVID hit, they've been buying back stock at a fairly consistent rate of ~100M a year, and had been paying a $0.15 dividend (also until COVID).  I don't miss the dividend much, and am actually hoping they don't turn it back on, instead using it to reduce their debt and continue buying back shares.  I'd rather see the bump in LTCG from stock buyback, than a qualified dividend myself.  I like Ford's EV play, and think that they are the best position to capitalize on an emerging truck EV market (F series are the best selling vehicles in the US).

The EV play for Ford is not a sure thing, by any stretch of the imagination. Ford's debt is quite large, but their current ratio is 1.2, so it's not like they're drowning either.  But for all it's faults, they are US based, and are held to US standards for bookkeeping, while NIO ... well, it's not, and I've been burned by in the past by the Chinese market's bookkeeping."

Ford cars are looked down upon. Now, that may be because I run with a circle of crowd full of stem graduates I don't know. They're not seen as cool like a Tesla or an Audi. They're not seen as reliable and cost efficient like brands like Toyota or Honda. They're not seen as luxury like BMW or Mercedes.

I know their pickup trucks sell but that's a specific skew of vehicle catering to a specific audience who wants a bigass pickup truck.

Here's some facts for you:

  
Ford - Over 100 years old

NIO - Few year old startup

It could be a larger problem for their EV play that Ford drivers are either blue collar and can't afford an EV at the current prices or based outside cities and want something beefy and ""good ol' gas"" or whatever. From my experience Fords are cheap sure, but that means cheap to buy and cheap to fix,  even better if you do it yourself.

My opinion is that straight up between NIO and Ford sales in the U.S Ford would crush them, not because Ford make better cars but because most Americans would rather buy American cars."

03/26/2021,stocks,"TA may have value for short term swings and day trading,  but to look at a broad segment like mid caps, unless your playing an ETF or index, you might as well do fundamental research on the individual company."
03/26/2021,stocks,Happy to see it working for you :).
03/26/2021,stocks,"And I think that is the point of my post. Small and mid caps have taken a hit, the ETFs I mentioned are broader plays on those types of companies, and show a *potential* pattern where buyers and sellers have moved the ETFs. I have exposure to individual small and mid caps, I'm thinking that the way to protect against any further downside is to pick up short exposure on those markets."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Working... so far. :) I'm fully aware that I'm only as good as my discipline allows, and I'm prepared to get my ass kicked from time to time.

Hence the reason why I was asking about the broader market and possible ways to profit on the short side in the event of a deeper decline"

Thing is though, investors were cautious about CRSR for a while due to their lockup expiration. Well, the lockup ended last week (I think, possibly earlier this week). What happened? Nothing, no dip, nada. That's pretty bullish. What's more, the company is well under its price targets right now, like, WAY under. Their aggregate minimum price target is like $36. Maximum? Fifty something dollars.

I dunno, I just got a great feeling about these guys for the year. And I don't have that same feeling for any other company right now so I'm just going to park money in CRSR so long as its under, say, 32 and sit on it."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Take out any calculator:

Total cost/total shares.

2021-03-26 19:41:36,stocks,"Rookie Mistake, left with a question. So I misunderstood RobinHood’s day trading warning, I took it as this is your 3rd day trade this week, unless you have $25,000 in your account one more trade after this you will be labeled a pattern day trader and penalized. 

Apparently it meant this is my 4th day trade for the week and now I’m waiting for A representative to ask for my kneecaps. 

From my understanding, I could be subject to needing a $25,000 amount in my account by next week or else I’ll be a labeled pattern Day trader and banned from day trading for 90 days. 

Is there anything I can do? I’m assuming I can’t just switch platforms to TD Ameritrade or something like that? 

TLDR:I’m an idiot and thought I was playing by the 3 weekly day trading rule but there was an additional small buy/sell I made on Monday, is there anything I should do?

Thank you, I’m sorry for such a rookie question, this was an honest mistake, I was aware of the 3 day trade rule but I didn’t keep close enough track of all my orders, cause I’m an idiot. 

Have a great day, good luck on trading!

Edit:this community is great, thank you all."
03/26/2021,stocks,I think they will just restrict you from trading until the cash has settled in your account. You dont have to put in more money.
03/26/2021,stocks,">So I misunderstood RobinHood’s day trading warning,.......

You should quit using Roninhood. You could do an all cash account but that would require waiting for funds to clear before you trade again."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You won’t have to pay $25k, you just won’t be able to day trade for 90 days (meaning buying/selling the same stock 4x in a 5 day period)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"FINRA sets the day trading rule. You can probably have accounts open at different brokerages, but if you were to do the same day trading thing at those brokerages it would give you the same restriction."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Take the ban, open a different brokerage account, wait and transfer over position in RH to your new brokerage account?"
03/26/2021,stocks,That happened to me. Still have some shares sitting on RH but opened an account at etrade and Fidelity.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You could essentially open another brokerage account some place else, but you’ll have to make sure you don’t make the same mistake again. RH will probably restrict you from making any trades for 90 days. Not the end of the world and it’s a lesson learned. Good Luck!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Or you could switch to a cash account. That means you can only use the cash balance in your account and will have to wait T plus 2 days until that cash from that trade is settled. You cannot be flagged as a day trader by trading in a cash account. Ameritrade and WeBull allow you to do this.

Here’s an example:

You deposit 5,000 dollars and it clears on a Monday. You execute two day trades on Monday for 1,000 dollars (buy and sell the same security.) On Tuesday, you execute two new trades for 2,000 dollars for the same security. On Wednesday you execute two new trades for 2,000 of the same security. On Thursday morning, you should have 1,000 available from your trade on Monday (settled cash.) some brokerages are able to do this faster than the T+2, such as Ameritrade. Let me know if you need more info. I’m not a financial advisor but I’d be happy to help someone avoid the mistakes I’ve made."

03/26/2021,stocks,"So I just wanna make sure I’m understanding you right, if I switched to Webull for example, the ban wouldn’t follow me, but if I violated the rule again Webull would put a ban on me? But Webull wouldn’t start with a ban on me?"

03/26/2021,stocks,"you can still trade, just not day trade."
03/26/2021,stocks,Oh really? So I could still day trade on Webull regardless of a ban on Robin Hood? I just assumed it was tied to SSN.

03/26/2021,stocks,Yes
03/26/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t think so. If that was a case it should be disclosed or easily answered from other users who were banned.  I would try and open a new one. Worst case scenario they don’t let you open an account.
03/26/2021,stocks,No the ban doesn't follow. I have been able to trade on these platforms. Etrade has the same policy though so this time I have been more careful LOL
03/26/2021,stocks,Wherever you end up you’ll still be restricted to 3 day  trades In a 5 day period.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Also, just remember if you’re trying transfer your portfolio to another brokerage from Robinhood, the transfer takes longer than you’d hope. Days or a week or even longer according to comments I’ve read. So, if you’re trying to jump on something today via a day trade with stocks you already own, it’s not going to be possible."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes you are correct as the trades have to be done using cash
03/26/2021,stocks,"You will need $25,000 everywhere else to, or the same thing will happen. Trading with under 25,000 is extremely restrictive. I would recommend just learning to swing trade until you have the capital. Chart patterns and things are the same, you can build your skills that way"

03/26/2021,stocks,"No you’ll be good, just don’t make it a habit."
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, you will not be banned if you went to another brokerage. This current ban exists only in your Robinhood acct. They are just saying that this applies to every brokerage, as in if you did it again through another brokerage, you’d get banned again."
03/26/2021,stocks,How would one platform know that you broke PDT rules on another separate platform?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sorry, I was just talking about trading in general. 

You will just be suspended by the brokerage you are using now, not other brokerages. If you do it again, however, they will terminate your brokerage account. TD Ameritrade pardon's users the first time that it happens (If you talk to support). Others may as well, you just have to ask support."

There is some money to be made but my thesis is the worlds shipping lines will see inflated freight contract prices in the short term if these ships have to start sailing around the Cape of Good Hope (that is the southern tip of Africa).

03/26/2021,stocks,"If the ship is still stuck on Monday, you could see some interesting trading action next week.

During the negative oil price fiasco last year, $NAT shot from under $3/share to $9/share in a very short period. Will we see something similar this time? Nobody knows.

Either way, those type of gains are likely to be short lived."
03/26/2021,stocks,This is an extremely short term trade on my part.  I'll probably close half on Monday

2021-03-26 19:00:41,stocks,"IBKR Restricting/Preventing Trading of US Exchange Traded Funds to UK/EU Investors, citing 'EU Regulations' IBKR is now explicity preventing access to all US based/domestic ETFs based on EU PRIIPs financial regulations. Prior to depositing yesterday, I was able to trade all US-based securities, including SPY, MSOS etc. Now after depositing, my account has suddenly been restricted from trading due to the following:

https://ibkr.info/article/3324

UK Investors on the IBKR platform are now unable to invest in US domestic ETFs if they don't meet the MiFID classifications, which are listed in the following document:

https://ibkr.info/article/3298

So in order to actually trade an ETF from the UK, you must meet the following ""qualifications"":

> IBUK will consider re-categorising Retail Clients to Professional Clients in two instances:
> 
> 1. Per Se Professional Clients can notify IBUK that they consider that they should have been categorised as Per Se Professionals under the FCA rules, because at least one of the following conditions applies:
> 
> (i) authorised or regulated to operate in the financial markets; or
> 
> (ii) a large undertaking meeting two of the following size requirements on a company basis:
> 
> (a) balance sheet total of EUR 20,000,000;
> (b) net turnover of EUR 40,000,000;
> (c) own funds of EUR 2,000,000;
> 
> (iii) an institutional investor whose main activity is to invest in financial instruments. This includes entities dedicated to the securitisation of assets or other financing transactions.
> 2. IBUK may treat Clients as Elective Professional Clients if, based on an assessment of the Client’s expertise, experience, and knowledge, IBUK is reasonably assured that, in light of the nature of the transactions or services envisaged, the Client is capable of making its own investment decisions and understand the risks involved. Clients who do not meet the requirements to be categorised as Per Se Professional Clients can still request to be categorised as Elective Professional Clients.
> 
> To obtain such re-categorisation, Retail Clients must provide evidence that they satisfy at least two (2) of the following criteria:
> 
> 1. Over the last four (4) quarters, the Client conducted trades in financial instruments in significant size at an average frequency of ten (10) per quarter.
> 
> To determine the significant size IBUK considers the following:
> 
> a. During the last four quarters, there were at least forty (40) trades; and
> b. During each of the last four (4) quarters, there was at least one (1) trade; and
> c. The total notional value of the top forty (40) trades of the last four (4) quarters is greater than EUR 200,000; and
> d. The account has a net asset value greater than EUR 50,000.
> 
> Trades in Spot FX and Unallocated OTC Metals are not considered for the purpose of this calculation.
> 
> 2. The Client holds a portfolio of financial instruments (including cash) that exceeds EUR 500,000 (or equivalent);
> 
> 3. The Client is an individual accountholder or a trader of an organisation account who works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position which requires knowledge of products it trades in.

This is absolutely absurd. Restricting access to something not inherently complex due to the above is absolutely insane. So beware anyone attempting to invest from the EU/UK, IBKR is an interesting platform for sure.

If anyone has an alternative brokerage that will ACTUALLY allow for the trading of US ETFs, that would be great.

I can't believe they restrict access to this, but not options and CFDs for individual securities 🤡🤡 You can be eligible to trade 100x leveraged instruments VIA options, but not invest in ETFs 🤡🤡🤡🤡

03/26/2021,stocks,"You can thank the EU beurocrats for this, it's not IBKR's fault. That said, IBKR's messaging and explanations are awful as usual."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agree it's shambles that you can't trade US ETFs, but you can trade their options, but what I would like to point out is that a lot of large US ETFs have EU compatible UCITS variants, for example instead of SPY, you can buy SPY5, which is listed in London (so London trading hours apply), and theoretically does the same thing. Sadly it's usually slightly higher fees/spreads than the higher volume originals. justetfs.com is a pretty good resource to find equivalents, so are the fund websites. Sadly some interesting funds have no UCITS versions available though, like the ARK funds..."

I have heard that Degiro is good for etf's and on eToro you can trade US Etf's on CFD, but with no fees on 1x long, you could get into ARK ETF's but YMMV

Currently I have accounts with Trading212 and E Toro."

03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks for the info and pointers! Will check out the UCITS variants and the website is great resource (:
03/26/2021,stocks,>Nice resource [justetf.com](https://justetf.com) will look into that in more detail
03/26/2021,stocks,"I have used T212 before and appreciated the nice interface, but yes agreed on the IBKR platform being a great platform for that collated information and was gladly ready to completely switch. Hopefully if support engage with me properly I can become approved again, if not I guess I'll have to pivot career choices and apply to become MiFID certified 😂 Will have a look into Degiro for ETFs, thanks for the pointer."
03/26/2021,stocks,"WOW, unbelievable, I can't believe this hahaha. I can do exactly the same in my IBKR. I am sure that being assigned would certainly grant 100 shares. I can't believe this loophole hahahaha. I can also purchase LEAPs for these ETFs. Again, wow.

E: Ofc this does require enough capital up front I suppose"
03/26/2021,stocks,Which ETFs were you able to previously trade?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Indeed it requires you purchase a minimum 100 shares... BTW IBKR also offers CFDs which I don't currently have my account set up with permissions, but I bet they would let you buy CFDs as well... With the CFD (or leaps) you of course don't get the dividends so best to pick accumulating ETFs if you must..."
03/26/2021,stocks,"SPY, VTI, MSOS, etc.

Able to trade 100x leveraged financial derivatives, but not ETFs unless you're MiFID 2 certified. Doesn't make sense at all."
03/26/2021,stocks,"True, thanks for the pointer and tip there re: ITM CSP. I think I'll just look further into becoming classified appropriately by IBKR for their trading requirements. Thanks and take care!"
03/26/2021,stocks,You shouldn't be able to trade SPY or VTI in the EU because EU lawmakers require ETF's to provide PRIIP forms and most US ETFs don't include PRIIP forms.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ah okay, but that is also incredibly frustrating to know. Thank-you for the clarification. I was wondering why I was unable to fill out PRIIP KIDs on SPY etc. I'll have to research more, but it is frustrating none the less, especially because IBKR telephone support would not offer any explanation beyond 'We're sorry we can't do anything it's the EU'. Thanks again!"

“The KeepTruckin Smart Load Board is the first and only ELD-based freight marketplace that automatically matches loads based on a deep understanding of a carrier’s needs and preferences,” said Shoaib Makani, CEO of KeepTruckin. “We’re proud to collaborate with a renowned industry leader like J.B. Hunt to move freight faster than ever before by providing access to capacity at scale and real-time visibility. Our load matching algorithms ingest billions of data points each day to ensure the right load gets in front of the right carrier.”

 

KeepTruckin launched the Smart Load Board in October 2020. This free freight marketplace aggregates thousands of loads from trusted brokers like J.B. Hunt and surfaces them directly in KeepTruckin’s web and mobile platforms for carriers to intuitively book. Brokers can connect with both existing and new carrier capacity via the Smart Load Board to efficiently communicate load availability to over 85,000 KeepTruckin carriers.

My ex wanted us to buy a house. I was hesitant. Wasn't sure if I was ready. Especially since most of my gains were from this insane bullmarket and I was still on short-term gains. And I was always per-occupied with stock trading and investing. She started cheating and left me for another man.

Anyone else have similar stories of your SO getting disgruntled because you were addicted to stocks/investing?

Sometimes I miss being in a relationship. But at the same time, I'm scared of getting involved with somebody else because I'm being cheap and don't want to kill my financial future. Buying a house, having kids, would basically have me live day-to-day which I am not used to.  (I only make 45k a year)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Balance brother, all things in moderation. I understand if you have specific financial goals in mind but if the entire goal is just to make more money I fear you’ll be left with a ton of regret. 

For example I was a private security contractor for 2010-2015, made great money around 140k a year but 9 months out of the year was spent in Iraq or Afghanistan. I was essentially trading my life away for more money. I make less money now but am able to enjoy my family at the end of the day."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You could legit get taken out by a bus at 34 bro. Start enjoying your life. Have fun. My dad got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer at 58. My wifes grandmother died of cancer at 57, three teammates from my high school football team are Already dead before they made it to 30. Anything can happen any day. You've got a baller start, You've got to learn to balance life and retirement. You can choose to be a bachelor and not have kids so you can retire young...But that life sounds super sad to me.   


This is going to sound mean. So I appologize ahead of time and if you are someone who is overly sensitive to criticism and advice I might just not bother reading it.   


You have no savings/cash but you've got 150k in your retirement? Where the fuck is your emergency fund? 6 months minimum. Still living with mom and dad keeps your costs down but you're eating theirs. Get out of your damn parents house, you're being selfish. Here's how I would play it if I were you, Before you change your life and start enjoying being alive.  


step 1: Half your contributions. Maybe even only invest a quarter of what you are currently putting into the market.  


Step 2: Save up 5-6k, out of what you would have contributed to the market. Make that your current emergency fund. (Just incase medical expenses, car expenses, You don't have to have a ton because you don't have adult problems right now you're still living like a kid)  


Step 3: What's the cost for a house in the area you want to live? Step 3 is probably make more money running side hustles while you have free time by not having a wife and kid and save up 20% of a downpayment on some type of house, even if all you can afford is a condo you need to get out of mummy and daddy's house. if you live in an area where 44k is chump change You need more money or to find a significant other and team up on investing on buying a house. If you live where 44k is plenty of money then I would still do the side hustles to speed up the process at which you can save 20% so you get out of mom and dads house sooner, because you're a grown ass man with 150k invested living with mom and dad. I can't stress that enough. You could have bought most of a house in a shitty state by now instead of invest.   


Step 4: If you want to stay the bachelor life and all that find a nice small pad to live in and buy that once you have the money saved up. Get one that isn't going to make you house poor. 25% of your net income. This is why if you're making shit money a significant other could be financially beneficial. Because one person making shit money probably can't buy a house. two people making shit money can buy a house. You would team up on an ""investment"" that you currently can't afford. If you live in an area with a high cost of living this step might be where you consider moving to a cheaper area.   


Step 5 increase retirement contributions to a respectable affordable amount that still give you enough money to go do stuff and have fun.   


Step 6 go live your life. Investing is supposed to help you turn your money into more money with minimal effort, with the effort it sounds like you are putting into investing you could have made way more than you did by just getting a second job and investing twice as much in VOO. You aren't an investor if you are letting it ruin your life. You're a gambling addict. Go get help."

You say you are scared of ruining your financial future. what future? what IS your future? you are 28 and live with your parents. what exactly are you planning to do, what are you building towards?

If you are addicted to investing, I fail to understand how you are so opposed to owning a house? home equity is the #1 source of major asset for the overwhelming majority of Americans. If you want to talk about having a secure financial future, a paid off mortgage and a home as an asset is a really darn good way to go about doing it for most people. 

You also seem to act like getting in a relationship means you are the breadwinner? Like, you know your spouse can work too, and then you have dual incomes and then when you pay your mortgage you are not living day to day...

Not trying to pile on, but this all reads bizarrely irrational."

A house is a great investment, so I'm guessing you didn't want to buy a house *for her.* Now , I don't know how long that relationship was, but in all my romantic relationships there came a point where it was time to put up or shut up. Whether that was 'let's buy a house', 'let's have a kid', 'let's get married', or whatever. This will happen again.

If you're not feeling it, there's a reason. I'd suggest evaluating why, and trying to figure out what do want before you dive too deep into the next. GL, man!"
03/26/2021,stocks,If you are interested in investing why not buy a house? I’ve never understood anyone who “isn’t ready” to buy a house. Buy a double and your mortgage is covered. When you move into a family home you have income property. Sounds to me like you should take 50k out of your investment account... buy an double home on your own.. move in and rent the other side.

The fact that you don't see a house as an investment, and that somehow stocks are more important than a place to live would indicate that you've done very little consideration for your actual future.   Start doing the math and figuring out what is enough for you, and working out an exit strategy."
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, because I don't talk about trading, since people around me don't care about it.

Btw her cheating was her choice and can't be justified with your intense investments. Actually you can be glad to not buy that house together."
03/26/2021,stocks,Sounds like kinda a terrible person to handle it that way regardless of what happened.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, just yes."
03/26/2021,stocks,"There's nothing wrong with being alone. There's nothing wrong with being in a relationship. Do what your gut tells you and you won't be wrong. Don't depend on the advice of internet strangers (ohh the irony, I know)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’ve never had any relationship trouble because of it but I kind of understand where you’re coming from. I think you need to consider what your goals are, e.g. being financially secure, retiring early, having x amount. I hate when people tell me this but you could die tomorrow, you have to live a little. Also, could you improve your salary? I found that when my salary increased substantially that I cared a lot less about saving x% of my salary and more about x dollar amount based on projections of what I wanted to have by a certain age."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Unrelated to OP but holy hell do people have a chip on their shoulders for full-time job-working folks that still live at home with their parents. The main reason why I haven't moved out yet is because I have no idea what I want to do with my life, specifically how long I want to stick with my current job or look for something else. I want to move out sometime in the next few years, or at least make a decision in the next year or so. So for the time being I'll just continue to save up more money."
03/26/2021,stocks,"COVID has messed with mine, more than the stock market."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You can get a house for as little as 3.5% down plus closing costs. I would think of the property as an investment and a good one, depending on where you live. Renting is throwing your money away. Own and you’re paying yourself, at least with part of your monthly payment."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is a lot of great advice that was just put out there for OP and anyone else who needs it to look at and evaluate where they are and what they want out of life.  

Don't let trading take over your life, chances are, if you are like most people you're not going to beat the index funds when it comes to return over time.  For me, personally, I set aside a portion of my income for trading/investing, because I think it's fun.  I rarely beat my 401k and Roth IRA returns over the longterm ... but yet I continue to consume news, read books and try out new strategies.  

Why would you do that, if you're not beating the market?  Well, I view it as a hobby, and I look at it as personal enrichment.  I've learned so much about how the market functions, how to trade options (99% CCs at this point for me), I've begun following additional sources of news and information, and it's been a great deal of fun, and I've enriched my analysis skills at the same time (which has helped to pick winning strategies in my 401k and Roth IRAs).  But of course, there's also always that thrill of the thought that if I really nail my predictions, I can make a decent amount of money off of it for my next family vacation.  

Having said that, if trading is consuming your every waking moment, and causing you to sacrifice your relationships for it ... take the above advice and really look at where you are, and why you're doing what you're doing."

I’m a woman and if someone was like “i still live with my parents” I’d ask them why and make sure they are doing it to save money/invest/etc and not just living with their parents because they dont work etc"

03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm gonna be brutally honest here but... what present right now???

What's this man going to be living it up doing right now? Staring at walls? Staring at a tv? Playing video games? Maybe the occasional hike or jog around to keep yourself fit? All of that is relatively free. Going out and doing lots of expensive life experience-y things is kinda not on the table right now at best and outright immoral at worst. Hell people are putting off weddings because of this.

We're still in a global pandemic and still have a ways to go to hit safe and sustainable vaccination levels. If there's any time to plug a shit ton of money into retirement and savings without sacrificing a ton of opportunity cost on life it's right now.

EDIT: Downvoters, feel free to prove me wrong on this one lmfao. Just being honest if y'all are out partying and going to large events right now or within the last 6 months-1 year that's kinda fucked and a huge contributing factor to why this mess keeps getting worse and prolonged. Keep it up buds."
03/26/2021,stocks,"There are definitely women interested in investing and saving, but saying, “hey, I don’t have any of my own furniture or my own place but I do have 4x my annual salary in retirement accounts and I’m not even 30,” probably just isn’t a great pick-up line.

OP sounds like a fervently zealous saver, which is great for his early retirement but tends to be less great for one’s love life."

And yes, I do help them with rent and bills."
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's a fair point, I was jumping the gun a bit on living with his parents. If you've got 150k invested and you are still living with your parents because You are helping Them with rent/grocery/whatever then it's probably not the end of the world...You will get into a situation where you're still in the same boat of move the F out. If your parents need help 
 for an extended period of time get them someone to help them with their finances so they can live within their means and don't rely on their child for their way of life. 

But if its anything other than ""well, dad lost his job and now they need my income to pay the mortgage and if I weren't there they'd lose the house."" And it's only been going on for a short period (under 6 months) But no, I change my mind there's plenty of time in my steps between now and you having an emergency fund and a downpayment saved up for my recommendation to stick with get the F out of your parents house.  If your parents havent figured out their finances in the two to three years its gonna take you to have that downpayment ready then you cannot be their crutch. They are adults to. Get them the financial advisor they need and don't ruin your life to help them. 

Don't ruin your life to help your parents and don't let them ruin theirs to help you (for an extended period of time, months? help each other, you're family for christ sake. Years? It's time for everyone involved to be an adult) You can get them the help they need but not if it ruins your life."
03/26/2021,stocks,And if they are living with their parents to save money up for a down payment in the short term that's fine...if it's to build their own retirement that's just selfish. Go get a better job. Stop bumming off your parents because you can't afford a mortgage payment and an unhealthy relationship with the stock market.
03/26/2021,stocks,Well whoever said that was a moron because the housing bubble popped four years prior to that.
03/26/2021,stocks,I think you’re missing the point. I don’t think the comment was saying “go out and party in a pandemic”.  I think it’s more so referring to the OP saying his SO left him because he sounds like he’s actually addicted to his savings/ investing for retirement. Saving up 150k on a 45k salary isn’t something that started last year during the pandemic.
03/26/2021,stocks,OP said nothing of going out or being bored. OP has an addiction that was the precursor to a break up of a relationship that they seemingly didn’t want to happen.
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's where I'm at now. If I buy a house, I feel like I am only buying one so I can prove my ex wrong or attract another female lol.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Absolutely, it's going to be extremely difficult to find a partner with the same line of thinking. Imagine 2 people working tirelessly and selfishly to save every penny? Imagine the arguments about choosing internet speed? ha.

&#x200B;

For real though, OP may need to work on LIFE balance.  Being singular focused on retirement without living in the now and appreciating ones SO, is a recipe for failure.  In fact, living at home for the sole purpose of saving, is already a turn-off by 30."
03/26/2021,stocks,"OP just needs to look in places where this type of girl may be. Going to a conference to discuss stocks and socializing with friendly like-minded people, with the goal of learning can accidently lead to meeting his dream girl. Just needs to be in the environment she would be in, cause she's probably living with her parents too and saving money thinking, ""I wish I knew a guy who was this dedicated lol""."
03/26/2021,stocks,"yeah agreed just meet a frugal/investor type and you're good to go. Everyone seems to assume there are only men here, btw, but lots of us are women we just don't talk about it much."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm getting called a pig on here for not meeting one. But it's the truth. I honestly have friends on reddit and discord I chat with. People I know personally that talk stocks. All guys.

Not saying women don't invest. but I think it's rare (at least where I am)."
03/26/2021,stocks,"As a woman, on Reddit, who loves trading... we are here."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Probably related to why you're currently alone and living with your folks, chief. Sounds like its time to put the securities investing on autopilot/robobroker for awhile and invest in your social skills. It looks like you're missing important sectors from your personal portfolio."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Haha. I think everyone assumes so but plenty of people that are into it not on here! 

My girlfriend was only passively investing through a family financial advisor, and he sucked, and when we met I told her how easy and better it is to do on her own. She took to it really fast and loves it and it’s something we get to share now and talk about regularly. So even if someone doesn’t know about it at first, you never know. But I would say, maybe the buying house thing had to do with you living with your parents. If you already have this much money in your portfolio, I’m assuming you could probably start saving up or already make enough to move out. Something to consider. 

Good luck and don’t lose hope."
03/26/2021,stocks,"And I’m sure you love when women assume all guys who still live with their parents are lazy and incapable of being self-sufficient.

Generalizing people isn’t cool dude. Maybe the reason she left wasn’t what you think it was."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Uhhh, no buddy."

If you really do enjoy what you're doing, turn it into a career, if you can. That way you can learn on someone else's dime, and improve your skills along the way."
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's fine, and I don't know their financial situation...but if it's anything more than temporary you need to get them financial help, not help them financially. Now obviousely there is more to the story then I know. But my suggestion of moving out in the long run hasn't changed, with my steps its going to take you Years to have a downpayment and an emergency fund. That's plenty of time for your parents to learn to live without your financial assistance. You gotta get out on your own and your parents need to live within their means. Parent and child should lift eachother up not pull eachother down. If they wont listen to strangers advice then learn how to design a budget yourself and teach it to them. Or just do their budget for them. I'm not trying to be mean to either you or your parents. I'm just being honest and this is how I see it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Just a little background. Mostly everyone in my family who isn't engaged or married still lives with their parents. We have a couple that got kicked out, but that was mostly because they weren't carrying their own weight and doing other things (not looking for a job, partying too much, drugs/drinking)."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It really depends on the parents. Mine for example would LOVE for me to stay with them for as long as they are alive and pay for anything because they are just that way. I mean I havent because I prefer having my own place and with my boyfriend but they are always telling me I can come back to live there rent free and save as much as I want to and Im like “I’ll be fine”

If OPs parents are like that too and he chooses to stay with them that’s completely fine. Some people prefer spending more time with their kids than having more money

I’m just saying everyone has their own different situations. And I know of 40,50 year olds still living with their parents because they are dirtbags who dont want to work and just abuse and get by with the little money their parents have- thats whats messed up"
03/26/2021,stocks,"And the way the economy’s been for the past decade, with rates so low, money flowing endlessly in constant stimulus packages, cheap housing prices anywhere that’s not major city centers and certain states, and literally no indication to believe there’s some “bubble to pop”.... 

You’re probably going to be waiting another 10+ years and at best, housing prices will probably end up being 120-150% of current value at the bottom at such a pop, if you’re lucky. Even since the bubble popped in 2008, housing prices in major city centers and dense population concentrations are pretty much anywhere between 2-3x their value since. Real estate’s one of the hottest asset markets as populations grow and renting becomes increasingly less appealing and costly. 

I assume you’re going to be renting in the meantime. You should consider weighing the opportunity and pros and cons of getting your own home now, because if you’re into investing in stocks and have a portfolio now, there’s really no reason you should be against owning a home that builds equity and additional value with monthly payments rather than renting."
03/26/2021,stocks,"> Saving up 150k on a 45k salary isn’t something that started last year during the pandemic.

He invested during one of the biggest bull runs of 2020 and lives at home though(High SR+Record returns is a perfect storm for wealth building) so it's honestly very possible depending on what he invested in.

EDIT: Also want to point out that even if we assume he's been doing this for years since he lives at home a higher SR is not at all abnormal in fact it would be pretty dumb to save the avg 7-15% while living at home. May as well take advantage of 0-low living costs while you can. I was saving about 50% at my first decent job I got at home pre pandemic and living pretty well and experiencing loads only spending 9kish per year including multiple trips to San Fran, a party or two and trips to a few inexpensive but fun festivals.

I'm 24 and am in the same boat as OP, made 40k last year and boosted my savings to 23k from like 5k. I didn't invest much in the market outside of indexes till EOY but had I invest I easily could have been sitting on 100k+. I have a higher salary now at 60-70k and am currently sitting at 40k only months later and given my savings rates and investment returns this year I have good shots at hitting 100k by EOY, or at least being very close to it.

>OP saying his SO left him because he sounds like he’s actually addicted to his savings/ investing for retirement.

More specifically because she wanted to *buy a house* with his net worth being at 150k and only making 40k/year salary.

That would have gutted him depending on where he lives and there's high odds he wouldn't be able to afford the mortgage in 2-3 years. They would probably be living hand-to-mouth best case for a while. Even without being addicted to savings there's **A LOT** of reasons why this  would have been a bad idea. Not to mention, she went out and literally cheated on him due to this decision instead of being an actual adult and discussing the issues so I don't see a lot of downside to OP's decision making right now. Seems like he lost a shitty person who would have been a terrible person to try and have a long lasting relationship with which is a net positive in my eyes."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I mean I'm not contending that he may have an addiction and he openly admits he has relational issues(Although given the nature of last year I think we need to know more before deciding he has an addiction. **EVERYONE'S** savings rates went through the roof through the pandemic and there were loads of explosive returns on investment).

Just contending that if there's any time to save a shit ton of money it's now. You're not exactly missing out on a lot by hunkering down and saving 50-75% if you have the ability to do it. Not a lot to go out and do right now.

Also putting out there but that chick wasn't a peach either and OP is better off without her. Chick wanted him to gut his savings for a house when his income definitely wasn't there to support it long term(Depending on his COL area though of course), and then turned around and cheated on him after he said no instead of discussing the issues or just making a clean break. IMO he's way better off without her and she seems like an immature asshole. Should sort out his issues and find someone better."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Do you man. You're doing great and seem to have great self reflection into what your current shortcomings are and where you need to work on yourself.

Do us all a favor though and avoid bars for now unless you're vaccinated otherwise by all means knock yourself out. A lot of us really want the world to return to normal and the more of us that hunker down the fast we can get that.

Reading up on what you're doing you seem to be making sound financial decisions and are doing amazing for your age(I hope to at least be where you're at by the time I'm your age)but I'd advocate pulling 15-20k out of the market and into banking. You're already well **well** ahead of your age bracket and 15-20k won't limit your relative growth much at all and is a nice cushion in case of emergency. Afterwards I'd set a monthly budget between contributions-what you want to spend each month. Be kind to yourself and let yourself live a little as things get better in the world but definitely keep up the high savings rate while you can.

If you really feel like investing is taking over your life than maybe shift a good portion your portfolio over to indexes for a while while you take a break to work on other aspects of your life. Again you're doing very very well for your age bracket so taking a break and not doing anything high risk for a bit isn't going to kill you."

03/26/2021,stocks,Tbh I just started learning about it and getting really into it (28 years old) and I’ve never heard people I know talk about stocks until I started bringing it up and then its like “oh you invest too?” Both men and women. It’s just not been much of a conversation thing I guess
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, we’re here! My husband isn’t into trading, but he loves what I do and encourages it. I am also respectful that this is our money and involve him in any big decisions. And I know when to shut up about my stocks so I don’t drive him crazy. And we have made our financial goals together, so he knows I’m not just building a dragon’s horde, but a future where we will actually use any funds gained."
03/26/2021,stocks,He did find a woman who was interested I trading -- she traded him in for another one.
03/26/2021,stocks,Also woman here! Love finance and investing. Not everyone on this sub is a dude lol
03/26/2021,stocks,"Didn't mean it like that. But honestly, all the reddit and discord stock friends I made have all been guys. And all the people I talk stocks with personally have all been men as well. 

I didn't mean that women aren't capable of trading stocks lol."
03/26/2021,stocks,My culture is the same. I don’t encourage you to move out but you could rent out a two family home which is a good asset.
03/26/2021,stocks,"My brother might say something.

Truth be told, I don't have friends anymore and don't really spend much time with family"
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's fine then, I mean nobody said you had to take my advice...except the cash thing, you need an emergency fund. But at the end of the day I would not be able to live under my parents roof at 28. I'm not old as shit either I'm 30, and I've got a PHENOMENAL relationship with my parents. I talk to my mom multiple times a week and we visit them weekly. If you're fine with it...and they're fine with it...then who am I to judge? I just know it wouldn't be for me and I would strongly recommend to save for that down payment just incase one day they decide maybe they aren't so stoked to have their 30-31-33 year old kid living at the house. My steps were multi year steps. I expect it will not be a quick process to both invest in your retirement and save up an emergency fund of over 5 grand as well as save up 30-120 grand for a downpayment on a house (depending on the type and cost of housing in your desired area) I would add an extra step that I just thought of, save up an additional 5-10k for furniture and appliances. Kind of forgot that you probably don't have anything to furnish a house with."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I guess, I'd just feel guilty. I know they can Afford to take care of me. I have pride in my ability to survive on my own. And I'm not rolling in it by any means...but I guess I'm not struggling either. Meh, to each their own I guess. I just feel like it would be detrimental to your self confidence if you couldn't provide for yourself. Even in potentially unnoticed ways. When I do something to make my house better I get a sense of pride. A ""I did that...thats mine..."" Same way when I make noticeable advancements in different basic life nicessities like skills in self defense and bettering my mental health. Or providing my own food by growth or hunting. I think there are many basic life skills that many of todays young adults are missing out on and it's causing them to live more like children then grown adults. 

But I do know I have faults in that same department. I am also unwilling to accept aid until absolutely necessary. When my father in law tries to give us money for the kid, my ego kicks in and says ""I don't need YOUR money to provide for MY child"" I've learned to fight it down. I still can't get myself to use the money for stuff I as the father and provider should have for my child. But I do put it into his college fund. If grandpa wants to give him money I'll make sure it grows over the next 18 years. That's an unhealthy relationship and I am working on that...but just as an example of how I also have massive growth I need to make in order to be a better man/father/husband/son etc. All we can do is attempt to grow every day and in every way possible. I have an infinite supply of faults. But if we don't admit they exist and attack them head on...what are we doing with our life?"
03/26/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/26/2021,stocks,"I do want to say I don’t condone what his SO did. She really should have been an adult and communicated with him that things got that bad. OP is better off without someone who is willing to cheat. I haven’t read the thread and don’t know all the details of the home buying but I had assumed he would contribute some of the down payment and that the mortgage is something that he would be able to sustain at 45k a year wherever he was living.

Sorry if my last post seemed combative, it was not my intention. You are correct that he could have saved that money up much faster than I had assumed. I was thinking that they had been dating for some time if they were discussing purchasing a home together. I assumed that he had been more preoccupied with savings/investing than the relationship for a few years at least.   
OP seems clearly upset and even said that he is addicted to stocks and investing. There is a much healthier middle ground where he can save for his future and still enjoy the money he earns. IMO I think OP at 35 would be happier being in a relationship and living with that person than being a millionaire living with his parents.

The ""you"" that's like this now doesn't magically change or get better because you find yourself in different circumstances. I say this after making several radical life changes over the span of my 20s. You can change yourself, but it takes effort and making the choice to do that.

2021-03-26 17:34:28,stocks,"Remember, it doesn't matter how much a stock goes up, what matters is how much more it goes up than the index I've seen a lot of comments along the lines of ""tech stocks are down, but they'll go back up, there's no reason not to buy them"" but that line of thinking is flawed. Of course tech stocks will go back up, but what's important to your returns is if you think they will rise faster than whatever index you choose to compare them too. Because if they don't, you could have just bought that index fund, had less risk, less work, and better returns. You should always be thinking about your stock purchases in the context of ""Do I think this will beat the index?"" *not* ""Do I think this will go up in the future?""

Edit: this post is not to advocate for index funds, it is to educate about how to measure stocks returns. This is stocks 101,  how well a stock has performed is measured in reference to an index, the difference in returns between the two is called Alpha. Honestly if this concept is new to you then you need to do a lot more research before you try to start picking stocks."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is so important to keep in mind. And I totally get what you mean when you say you’re not necessarily advocating for indexing, but are rather just reminding people of how to benchmark and analyze their gains. It’s really just opportunity cost, which far too often is unmentioned and unrecognized on here. The idea of “I never need to sell because eventually it’ll go back up” is in general wise because it keeps people from actively trading, which research shows decreases performance in the long-term, but it’s an unfortunate adage because if it takes your equities a year to bounce back, you did not necessarily benefit from keeping them, in the same way that you didn’t make the right choice to hold something that bounced back 10% when the NASDAQ is up 20%, for example. It’s also tied in with people somehow thinking a stock is inherently more likely to go up 10% if it’s recently dipped, when in reality, the likelihood that a stock that just dipped from $40 to $30 goes back to $40 is the same as the likelihood that the stock goes from $40 to $53. Both are 33% increases. 

Basically — the fact that your favorite stock dipped 20-30% does *not* mean it’s much more likely to go back up 20-40%. The market is pricing in a *lot* more information, and billions more dollars, than the average investor, and if it were as simple as “a stock that dipped is super likely to go back up even quicker than another one”, then hedge funds would just adopt that ridiculously simple strategy: investing in hot momentum stocks when they dip 25%, then selling when they “quickly recover” for a 25-35% gain. It can’t be that simple. We just want it to be because we hate realizing that yes, getting back to where you used to be after your stocks dip 25-30% means you need to make a 30-35% return."
03/26/2021,stocks,"And this is why I'm keeping my distance from companies that, while I think are definitely promising (like TSLA), I have little doubt are unsustainably overpriced, at least in the 5-10 year timeframe. Like, let's say for that case that you posit TSLA will beat the going rate for the S&P long-term assumed conservatively to be about 9%/yr (one could easily say it's actually 12% or higher, though), and itself give you 12% yearly return on average. That means, *ipso facto*, you expect TSLA will be priced at about $1.87 trillion (~$2000 a share assuming no splits or w/e) within 10 years. Assuming its automotive competitors grow at a similar rate (which again, would beat the market at a conservative estimate), that would make it bigger than Toyota, Volkswagen, GM, Ford, and Daimler **combined** in 10 years (remember that's assuming they're **growing too**, which the TSLA bullish side would argue should actually be the opposite, making TSLA even more massive by comparison). And I ask myself, do I think that will indeed be the case in 10 years? From the context my answer is obviously ""no,"" but you yourself should only bother to invest in it if you surely think ""yes"" (and of course my opinion is irrelevant if you forecast strongly otherwise---I can't predict the future any better than you can).

Edit: Meant 10 years, not 5. I'm a dumb."

If you have other investment goals that may not apply though. For instance if you want to see reduced volatility compared to the index, but still have more potential upside than what you'd get from bonds or other relatively safe investments.

I also like being able to invest in companies with a story and unwind them as that story plays out (or doesn't) without feeling too much FOMO about foregone gains. That's a difficult thing to do when you're exposed to the entire index."

Large, old companies have a hard time changing course. How many of them are making an honest effort to make a complete switch to EV. How many are going to actually be good at it. Many countries already plan to ban ICE cars by 2035.

My point is that you can't assume all the legacy autos will continue to grow. Going EV and even more difficult, going self driving isn't as easy as flicking a switch. It's a completely different mindset.

When they transition, their EV cars will cannibalize the profits of their ICE cars. They'll have to make sweeping change from the ground up to make these cars as cheap as Tesla can. That will probably be costly and take some time. They are way behind."

But even so, I'm far from **confident** in that idea, so to invest on that alone is quite risky. What would justify investment in that case is the potential for sufficiently large capital gains that make up for the large risk. But TSLA is already worth 3 Toyotas on the market, and I figure that in 15 years that could well be justified. But how much bigger could TSLA possibly get if it's already 3x as big as Toyota in market value? Could it reasonably grow enough to be another 3x larger in 5 years? And even bigger in 2035? How many people are even going to **need** a TSLA vehicle in 2035? What if a sexier competitor arisea either in an existing prospect like VW or a newcomer? 15 years is a long time, and I just don't see TSLA as a worthwhile **investment** right now (speculating is a totally different story, though; you could well make good $ in the short term if you're lucky)."

But I'll add. Toyota is a car manufacturer, yes they do make other machines, but those are not for the mass market. Tesla is in more spaces than that. Solar, battery, and charging, the big ticket item will hopefully be robo taxis ~~if~~ when that comes to fruition, semi trucks. I can't imagine what else they can bring to market, but do you think they are done innovating?

Amazon isn't just a book store, Google isn't just a search engine. Tesla won't just stop at making cars, but even if they only made cars, self driving cars would be the biggest innovation in our lifetime. They can always license that technology.

Right now TSLA is a bet. Don't buy if you want stability in your life."

03/26/2021,stocks,"> self driving cars would be the biggest innovation in our lifetime

Personally I think the internet and cell phones are bigger innovations than a self driving car, and both those have happened in my lifetime.  Or if we want to stick with Elon inventions I'd argue SpaceX reusuable rockets seem like a bigger innovation as well.   

With that said, even if it were the biggest innovation of our time, I'm not sure why people think Tesla is the only one with self driving technology."

03/26/2021,stocks,"and again, you should really watch that video. Dividend paying stocks do tend to outperform the market, but not because they pay dividends, it's because they tend to have more exposure to the value premium which gives returns in excess of the market, but paying dividends doesn't automatically mean you get that premium, and you don't have to pay dividends to get that premium. You'll get similar results with less risk by investing in a value stock index fund.

Buying dividend stocks because they get excess returns is like fishing in any old body of water, including puddles and pools, because bodies of water tend to have more fish than land. But if you actually looked into *why* the fish are in certain bodies of water you could say ""oh, I don't have to try and fish in this persons pool, there's no fish here. I only have to fish in lakes, rivers, and oceans to get fish""

03/26/2021,stocks,"I swear some of these people on these boards ""invest"" money like its monopoly money.

I get your position man. I was there myself. Planned to hold all ARKs for 20 years thought i had this whole investing thing figured out... pretty easy to figure it out when you only go up. 

Reality sunk in and i realized how risky all the ARKs are and i realized how easily they hemorrhage money and there is NO guarantee theyll recover. Sure you could hold it let it go down more (the nasdaq is still 300 points from a correction) and then hope it bounces back hard af. 

Or you can take this as a lesson. Accept you over extended, Played to risky, and bought the wrong position for YOUR GOALS. People will say what an idiot buying high selling low. Thats not your plan. Sometimes we hit our limits and we cut losses. Take time to gather ourselves. Research more. And come up with a more safer and less risky investment plan. 

If you are okay with the risk and dont wanna sell till its recovered. Close your app. Go enjoy life ajd check back in the fall (thats the only way you are going to find comfort). Otherwise cut the loses before they get deeper (knowing you very well could cut loses as the market turns green the next day). Only you can make that decision. 

For me taking a few hundred dollar loss to reinvest my hard earned money into safer (think VTI) positions which are already building me money back and will only build it faster once the markets done with its fuckery was the right move for me. I just wish i would done it earlier. You have to devices what's best for you and your future"

I 100% agree stick to the plan. There is a difference between people who got in 2 years ago and are sticking to a plan and then people who got in the last year and bought the top...

These IPO shares have historically been set aside for Wall Street’s institutional investors or high-net worth individuals. Retail traders don’t have a way to buy into newly listed companies until those shares begin actually trading on the exchange. By that time, the price has often gapped higher.

“Main Street will have access to investing in a way they wouldn’t have before,” SoFi CEO Anthony Noto said in a phone interview. “It gives more differentiation, and more access so people can build diversified portfolios.

 SoFi itself will be an underwriter in these deals, meaning it works with companies to determine a share price, buys securities from the issuer then sells them back to certain investors. It’s common for brokerage firms to get a portion of IPO shares in that process. But they don’t typically offer them to the everyday investor.

But if alot of that retail hype has access to the same pre-IPO prices, there isn’t going to be as much of a rush the next morning. A successful IPOs would in theory be a lot more about actually holding gains, rather than dumping to retail idiots 24-48 hours later and running off with profits"

The market will just shift. Private placements will still occur outside of IPOs to secure great share prices, that they can then still sell at IPO open. What I'm saying is IPOs have a recent history of spiking after offering BECAUSE OF RETAIL. So what happens when we can all get in early? So the spike is already bought.

Second is, a move to give these euphoric, DDadverse, FOMOing sheep the ability to buy into a company that has no trading history, and has only the (PR) information available online. 

So IPOs could be pretty euphoric right? Crazy volumes, prices 4-5x what they will eventually settle at... And a whole raft of sheep using a single APP that gives them access to a select bunch of these IPOs before they IPO?! What could possibly go wrong.

I am all for access to IPOs, I'd always think how amazing it would be to get in at those prices.... Well now that it's offered on a silver plate with all the stuffing.... I am starting to think it may be too good to be true. 

I expect we will see exactly what you say; a load of companies that were never gona make it, getting bought up by retail because it's one of the 20 buttons available on the app... And you gotta put money in somewhere rite?! RITE?!

Ongoing efforts with it include backwards compatibility and offering those games to current Gamepass subscribers and leveraging MSFT web services for the purpose of cloud based rendering / processing. What's more, there is no legitimate competition to the product MSFT is creating (others are either walled gardens available only  to existing customer base or, by design, limited in their offerings).

Gaming as a whole is a 3 billion player market (console, pc, and mobile) with expected growth in mature markets and larger growth in developing markets.

To those saying $250 per share is too expensive, how do you justify that evaluation based on comparison to Netflix ($500 per share)....a company that the Gamepass product is attempting to emulate.  Then add in MSFT is more highly diversified and pays dividends (ie all indicators of lower risk premium). 

I'm not saying MSFT shall go up, but when I asked myself (at $125 per share) why MSFT wasn't a $1000 per share company when so many others were, I just simply couldn't find a reasonable explanation.

Full disclosure, I own ~500 shares at ~125 per share cost basis so I am obviously biased, but many of the same arguments I'm hearing now (it's too expensive) were being used against MSFT when I bought that initial exposure. Since then they've only made good business decisions and experienced positives in almost every conceivable way.

03/26/2021,stocks,Halo and gears wasn't enough?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, this is the reason I bought the stock this week. I was already thinking about buying for months, then I heard they bought Bethesda. I love Elder Scrolls by the way. Hope this works out."
03/26/2021,stocks,Man I get a feeling we might end up having to own both ps5 and Xbox  with all those exclusive titles.
03/26/2021,stocks,Maybe there will be a new IP to compete with Fallout now
03/26/2021,stocks,"Got the ps5 and a Pc so this is gonna be great, let the competition begin"
03/26/2021,stocks,Microsoft is going in the right direction but it's still a long way ahead.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not that Bethesda has had a good record of late, but this just puts the nail in the coffin that tes6 is going to be the most simplified focus grouped, micro transaction filled garbage we have gotten."
03/26/2021,stocks,I never understood when it comes to creative talent why companies like microsoft don't just poach the talent for insane money.  Does the existing IP matter that much to them? (perhaps it pays for a good chunk of acq. costs over long run?)

03/26/2021,stocks,"Microsoft is a solid long-term play, but I'm not sure the gaming part of things is really going to increase their value *that* much. I'd argue there's a bigger potential ROI for Sony, not only because they're *still* killing it in the gaming space, but because they're slowly snatching up all the western distribution rights for Anime."
03/26/2021,stocks,"As a MSFT shareholder I was happy about this acquisition. It's a sound strategy. Playstation and XBox will always go head-to-head from a hardware perspective, so IP is the path forward, ala Nintendo. 

As a die-hard Playstation fan though, this sucks. I'll definitely have to switch to Xbox if Elder Scrolls VI is an exclusive."
03/26/2021,stocks,Any good news is good news! I feel like the market is going to let Microsoft hit the 2 trillion and fairly quickly at that. This will help Apple as it keeps being held down to that 2 trillion market cap. It’s very similar to what it did before the 1 trillion when analysts were basing it saying 1 trillion was too high.
03/26/2021,stocks,Wait until Microsoft ruins the studio lol
03/26/2021,stocks,Is game pass superior to Playstation now?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't want to own Bethesda if they paid me to.

03/26/2021,stocks,Does Xbox even make a blip in the share price. I feel like it’s such a small part of the company.  Like does the stock go up that much when they announce major console or first party exclusive
03/26/2021,stocks,"&#x200B;

People purchased the Xbox because of the existing friends-list, and not the games... which is a problem."
03/26/2021,stocks,too late for fallout.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If anything, it will do the opposite. Bethesda leadership has been greedy; rushing out games and not finishing them. Microsoft, in terms of Xbox, are very user-friendly and will not rush out games that turn into fallout 76s. This was made evident by the fact that they delayed Halo Infinite a whole year due to fan criticism. As a lifelong Bethesda and Elder Scrolls fan, I am hopeful that Microsoft can give Bethesda the time and resources to produce amazing games again. Additionally, Microsoft owns Obsidian, which means that a sequel to Fallout New Vegas is possible."
03/26/2021,stocks,"MSFT has seriously destroyed some beloved game franchises in the past.   


Freelancer comes to mind as a personal irritation along with many other games (many years ago).   


However, that was some time ago and MSFT has a totally new attitude towards game development due to their GAMEPASS push.   


They used to try to juice profits from the individual game (early buggy releases etc) now instead of pressure to cash in every penny from a game launch; they want GREAT, attractive games to draw people into the highly profitable gamepass ecosystem.   


Its a totally different outlook from a business perspective (We want to make the most money on sales TODAY Vs we just want people to be excited abouy the game).   


MSFT has done a really good job transitioning into the modern game market with their new attitude on console sales (sell consoles to sell Gamepass ecosystem, not individual games) and game sales (games are an advertisement for gamepass as well as an individual profit center).   


They have every incentive to make GOOD games as they have extra revenue on the tail end of sales (in addition to DLC sales etc they have a long term GAMEPASS revenue stream)"
03/26/2021,stocks,Can't really fuck up Fallout in its current state.
03/26/2021,stocks,It's a stupid good deal to me. Played so many games that I wouldn't have the money or desire to try otherwise.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agree 100%. I believe $MSFT is working towards putting Gamepass onto every device they can to give users access to the service. Including Playstation. And eventually where the games can't run on the device, they'll stream them."
03/26/2021,stocks,"> Bethesda taking on Sony lol even with Microsoft behind them no way they compete but I do own Sony shares so take that bias

as someone who got an xbox before xbl existed, and got an x360 and x1 on their respective day ones, i'm inclined to agree.

the x1 was a massive disappointment and i'm not seeing any improvement with the xsx. all the power in the world doesn't mean anything if the best games are playstation exclusive."
03/26/2021,stocks,I think Microsoft cares more about selling Gamepass than Xbox consoles these days
03/26/2021,stocks,PC is just as much Microsoft's domain as Xbox is. Unless you're not gaming on Windows
03/26/2021,stocks,"> I think what microsoft doesn't understand is: I own a playstation because I also own a high end PC. They won't be selling more xboxes by creating scarcity in certain video game universes I enjoy.

i think they do understand this and intend to give xbox the zune treatment over the next decade. if they can get pc gamers subscribing to gamepass, they won't care about consoles at all. they're already seeing the xbl subscription numbers plummet."

03/26/2021,stocks,"> A lot gamers own both a console and a gaming PC,

No they don't. I'd argue most gamers dont own a console and PC, with the majority often owning one or the other. I would bet its a very small amount of people who own a console and a pc.

And the way graphics cards have been in the last year, anyone trying to get into pc gaming can't unless they want to sell their newborn for a graphics card."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agreed, consoles aren’t the end goal for Phil Spencer and Xbox. They care more about Game Pass, to be able to bring in consistent revenue month after month is huge"
03/26/2021,stocks,"MSFT is not trying to sell consoles for money, they sell consoles for Gamepass subscriptions.   


You are looking at it all wrong.   


Boomers: Consoles don't make much money   
MSFT: Gamepass does though ;)"
03/26/2021,stocks,You don't think the next elder scrolls being excluded from PlayStation will sell some Microsoft stuff?
03/26/2021,stocks,Bethesda didn’t even make new Vegas
03/26/2021,stocks,"Idk I think Skyrim was pretty good, especially for its time and the modding community has kept it alive for over a decade now"
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is not an unpopular opinion, this statement is circlejerked to high hell on r/Fallout.

The fact is Bethesda still owns IP that generates money. Generally a good sign for any investor."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Skyrim, Fallout 4, Dishonored, Doom Eternal, The evil within.

I get that FNV was maybe the peak for the Fallout series but Bethesda is still able to produce great titles.

Obsidian did great with the amount of time they had for FNV and personally FNV is my favorite but Bethesda as a game studio is still great and able to produce titles that fans and newcomers will always pick up.

Now that MSFT has acquired both Bethesda as a whole along with Obsidian, I’m sure we’ll see some great titles from the both of them and since Sony will be unable to work with either (unless a deal is made), MSFT has a nice roster to produce single player games and expand on those studios universes.

MSFT is being aggressive once again and their 
game-pass system is truly a problem for both Steam and Sony.

If MSFT were to make a deal with both UBISOFT and EA, Sony will be in a corner working with indie devs which isn’t bad but triple AAA studios always deliver great numbers especially with their given business models surrounding MTX and Seasons passes."
03/26/2021,stocks, Unpopular opinion — Fallout New Vegas is overrated 🤭
03/26/2021,stocks,The last good game Bethesda made was Morrowind IMO.
03/26/2021,stocks,Um certainly unpopular opinion. Doom??
03/26/2021,stocks,"The Outer Worlds was pretty damn good. Short, but good. Wish they had released the 2 dlcs as part of the base game though"
03/26/2021,stocks,Not an unpopular opinion but a dumb one.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't think so. Microsoft is pretty hands off with developers these days so I expect not much to change for Bethesda. Microsoft is also big on PC gaming, so even if their games won't be on PS5 they will still be on PC and Xbox. 

Sony has a few games on PC, but most of their big hitters are locked to Playstation. Nintendo has nothing on PC. Of the 3 big companies Microsoft is definitely the most consumer friendly. They aren't the same company they were under Steve Ballmer."
03/26/2021,stocks,Have you played Sea of Thieves? Microsoft has learned their lesson and taken Rare off it's kinect leash
03/26/2021,stocks,"I would think similarly but Bethesda games never ran natively on GNU/Linux or Mac anyway. I also recall that Morrowind ran only on Xbox, not sure about more recent titles."
03/26/2021,stocks,There is a new elder scrolls and a space based game coming out soon
03/26/2021,stocks,You're comparing MSFT's price to Netflix when MSFT's market cap is already 8x bigger?
03/26/2021,stocks,Why does it seem that so many people think share price is meaningful? Market cap is way more important than share price
03/26/2021,stocks,The Elder Scrolls was already dead under Bethesda. So dead it has become a literal meme. But you think Microsoft just payed 7.5 billion USD for some of the biggest IPs in the gaming world in order to do nothing with them?
03/26/2021,stocks,$250 please
03/26/2021,stocks,It hasn't been for awhile now
03/26/2021,stocks,**Profitable** trash studio....
03/26/2021,stocks,Depending on the year it can be 10-15% of there total revenue not an insignificant amount but not a ton either.
03/26/2021,stocks,Not much and I think that's why they bought Bethesda
03/26/2021,stocks,X box live alone has 90 million subscriptions. That’s $60 per subscription. That’s 5.4 billion in revenue just in subscriptions.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I would assume it's twofold. It hopefully increases xbox position and revenue directly, and also their gamepass, which is obviously a nice subscription basis, but also goes towards their cloud infrastructure.

I think the impact of cloud is going to be so massive even compared to what it already is."
03/26/2021,stocks,I still have faith 🥲
03/26/2021,stocks,yea 4 was super meh and 76 was a travesty
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ehhh, Fallout 76 was just one game made by their B team. It's a great series. I think they'll be OK."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Exactly. I can’t confirm 100% but I’m sure it’s just as sticky at retaining subscribers as Netflix is. I don’t even have an Xbox or the service, but I genuinely think analysts are underestimating the true potential of Game Pass."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Got a three month subscription for a single Euro. A stupid good deal can't describe it, i would thought that it is a scam if it wasn't an official offer from Microsoft"
03/26/2021,stocks,Does game pass have Windows games or is is only for Xbox?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Youre probably right, ROI from XBOX R&D likely comes from monthly sub services."
03/26/2021,stocks,It's more of a poke at the cost of research and development that goes into XBOX

03/26/2021,stocks,"> Fallout NV sold over 12M copies.

and wasn't made by bethesda so...

also fallout 4 was not nearly as beloved and successful as 3 was, I'd be interested to see how many were put off of the franchise because of 4's mehness"
03/26/2021,stocks,"The fact that you included Fallout NV in response to ""hasn't made anything good since Skyrim"" is a testament to the weakness of your argument. New Vegas predated Skyrim."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Doom Eternal was developed by id Software, Bethesda was just the publisher."
03/26/2021,stocks,"> Is this a media crit sub? They're popular, that's all we care about in this context.

is it though? when a franchise is clearly on the decline in the public eye, that's a red flag. look at bioware for comparison. they WERE the super popular company that could do no wrong, but then mass effect 3 got a mixed reception, mass effect andromeda was a massive flop to the point they canceled the dlc and abandoned the game, and anthem was also a flop.

bethesda could be heading down that same path if the next elderscrolls game doesn't hit it way out of the park, because the company brand name isn't what it was a decade ago when skyrim came out."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Fallout 4 and Vault 76 were quite disappointing, tbh."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It just fully failed to be a role playing game.  It fully transitioned into first person loot shooter.

As somebody who considers Fallout 2 my favorite game of all time, I was super sad."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I finally bought it last year and spent so much more time modding it than I did playing it. Just felt so clunky and boring. Granted I couldnt get a UI mod to work so the item menus were pissing me off.

Years ago I tried Oblivion as well and got bored so fast too. I played and modded the shit out of New Vegas on PC, and Fallout 4 on ps4. Maybe it's the setting that I dont really like with ES"
03/26/2021,stocks,I just wish I could turn off v-sync without breaking the physics. The weird v-sync makes me motion sick 😕
03/26/2021,stocks,That's Id not bethesda
03/26/2021,stocks,The stock has been trading sideways since last July so be patient dips and corrections happen all the time. You can find a better entry point especially since there are fears of rising inflation.
03/26/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/26/2021,stocks,"Indeed. I don't even own a PC besides my work laptop. I can do most things on my iPad, phone, or my wife's laptop if I really need it. 

My PS5, though, I use just about everyday."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agreed.

Anecdotally, between myself and say ~15 friends/family that play games, I think maybe 2 have a gaming PC, the rest exclusively play console games.

That's people in their 30s who could all afford a gaming PC too, but choose not to."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah. People get to reading reddit thinking it's close to the general population demographics and opinions but it's not. Very few percentage of total gamers have a gaming pc and a console
03/26/2021,stocks,"Right, but even with Bethesda MS still has an uphill battle against Sony and Nintendo. Those two not only create *successful IPs selling millions* like Horizon or TLOU they also focus on genres most of the market neglects (SP for Sony, co-op for Nintendo).



I can openly admit I was a MS fanboy back in the xbox 360 days thanks to Bungie and Epic, Halo and Gears. The rest of MS lineup did nothing for me and when those studios left I also switched (haha) after seeing Sony deliver great new IPs and games through a whole generation (Ps3) unlike MS. Heck, when I played Halo 4 I didn't even have fun and Gears: Judgement was also a big miss. With the two ""must have"" IPs losing attraction I switched and I'm not looking back. There's simply no reason for me to ever get an Xbox, not for as long as Sony/Nintendo keep innovating and producing good IPs"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Can confirm.

Have built gaming PCs in the past. Still have one in my closet that just needs a new hard drive to get it running again.

Choose to only game on my PlayStation.

Besides, I doubt MS will destroy Bethesda’s profitability by completely ignoring the consol brand with the largest installed player base.

Exclusive to Xbox is probably going to mean that Xbox and PC get new editions for a year before they get ported and Bethesda can take in extra revenue."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I actually don't have a gaming PC. I know we're out there. 

But how many of those people would buy another console? I guess I should have said that most gamers who would be willing to buy an xbox on top of a PlayStation already have a gaming PC.

I look at my circle of gaming friends and I'm the only one who doesn't have a gaming PC. They all have a Switch, a PC, and an Xbox or Playstation."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Game pass is inevitable given how big game catalogues are becoming. When there is a glut of content the best way to stop prices collapsing is convenience: i.e. subscription service. Going the same way Netflix / DVD industry went.

And yes I know about Geforce Now / Stadia. I don't think either will last much more than another year or two, and they will certainly never become popular. It is financially unprofitable to Stream games with a good quality and latency."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Apparently you missed the part where I said

> Of course, Microsoft is banking on their gaming service more than consoles anyway and Bethesda games will be a big addition to that library.

Thank you for explaining something to me I already understood and referenced. I really appreciate your contribution.

Selling consoles is still important, since they aren't selling Gamepass to Playstation users. Whether they make money on the consoles themselves (no one has claimed this) or Gamepass, they need to sell consoles and whether the Bethesda deal accomplishes that is a relevant question."
03/26/2021,stocks,"By the time that game comes out, people will have already chosen either PS or Xbox for this generation and I don't think many people who already own a PS will buy an xbox, especially when they won't need to if they already have a gaming PC. And with how many exclusives PS has it'll take a lot more than once exclusive to make someone swap."
03/26/2021,stocks, Obsidian did.....which Microsoft now also owns.

03/26/2021,stocks,"This. I think Xbox Live and Xbox Game Pass are going to be game-changing down the line, especially if they start adding more big name companies like Bethesda as exclusive constituents of Xbox down the line.

Microsoft already said Xbox Game Pass subscribers play more, spend more and are just more involved in general."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's still dwarfed by something like O365, though gaming has steadily grown to being one of the biggest entertainment industries. They have great management, Nadella knowing that everything needs to feed into Azure, and Phil Spencer is well respected. I think it'll continue growing long term.

As for O365 numbers, they have something like 200M users and some of the most basic licenses are still like $5 a month.

We'll see how Gamepass does. If their Project xcloud does well they could eat Stadia's lunch while still competing with Sony, and they already have PC in the bag."

If they get discord as well as a few other game devs they will be set to capture massive growth in online gaming.   


They also have a second tailwind after the GAMEPASS revenue tailwind of gaming cloud services. Every Dev and gaming-related media company they buy is also a new customer/feather-in-hat for the Azure cloud (which is a larger focus and future profit center far greater than XBox and/ or Gamepass).

03/26/2021,stocks,That makes sense 😂
03/26/2021,stocks,"Fallout 4 didn't live up to its name but was still comfortably an above average game, it was quite good. Fallout 76 was a steaming pile of shit. I'd really like to see Bethesda pull an Obsidian and churn out something like Fallout New Vegas. That shit was a masterpiece."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Fallout 4 was awesome. I mean... Fallout has made such a name for itself that the bar is set incredibly high, Fallout 4 didn't hit this bar but was better than most games around that time."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is how I am. I really enjoy Fallout, but cannot get into dragons and magic, etc."
03/26/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/26/2021,stocks,How? It looks like on the chart it hasn't been down to 200 since Nov 1
03/26/2021,stocks,My point is that MSFT most likely will slowly continue to rise and hasn't peaked so there's no point in waiting for a better entry price.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Do you know how much Skyrim sold? Elders scrolls is easily bigger than any IP Sony has produced. 

There is so many developers Microsoft have bought and will continue to buy. It would be unwise to put them out the race. Besides they not really competing with Sony and Nintendo anymore and focusing on Xbox as a platform. This is good for the Xbox platform in the long run."
03/26/2021,stocks,Stadia is dead already. Google sold off their developers.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Consoles are important as an aspect of the game pass ecosystem, agreed.    


I never said they wern't relevant.   


But it doesn't really matter and you are not really worth a response.   


The only good part of my convo with you is it being the last one I have to tolerate."
03/26/2021,stocks,Fallout New Vegas 2?
03/26/2021,stocks,Where they went to die you mean. Let’s not act like Microsoft isn’t one of the small developer graveyards. The Bethesda of old has been dead a while now though so here’s hoping for a renovation
03/26/2021,stocks,"Only the future will tell. When Microsoft acquired Minecraft, I thought that was the end of Minecraft, but they made it much better imo"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not if you like building stupid buildings to store crap in. I didn't, but some people did."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ugh, I’m replaying it now because it’s one of the free titles on my PS5. Sure it runs smooth and the mod support gives it a *little* more life, but it’s def not the strongest outing."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Bethesda game studios made fo4, skyrim, etc bethesda softworks studios arkane, Id and tango made those three games. Microsoft owns all of those studios now because of the bethesda softworks deal"
03/26/2021,stocks,"It wasn't that bad, compared to NV yeah it sucked but by itself it was pretty decent."
03/26/2021,stocks,Well I'm a gamer and if I won't buy skyrim 6 times that matters.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think it's actually less than it used to be because more games are on PC and consoles. I think all Microsoft exclusives will be on both PC and Xbox, even the big ones like Halo. Halo  3, Reach, and 4 were never release on PC until last summer. Hopefully Sony follows suit. I know Nintendo won't."
03/26/2021,stocks,"There already was an online multiplayer perfect dark game developed by Rare and made for the 360. I know because I had it and played it a ton in highschool. It's called Perfect Dark Zero. 

Sea of Thieves is an incredible game. It really has a beautiful look and feel. It's on game pass if you ever want to check it out."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Don't worry, half life 3 is almost here lmao"
03/26/2021,stocks,By new he means up and down cycled yester dlc exclusive content now it bees and 35x the detail
03/26/2021,stocks,"You might be on to something. I think eventually they'll make one. Halo infinite mp will be free to play, which afaik is a first for a major aaa game. Since micrpsoft is okay with that, they could be okay with gears going free to play too"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I was skeptical about Game Pass but after having it for a while I'll never go back to the standard XBox Live subscription.  It's so much nicer to have a selection of new games to play without having to buy them individually.  Sure, a lot of them suck, but you get enough gems to make it worthwhile"
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you think those subs to games pass generate Microsoft profit you’re going to be in for a shock.

Basically no streaming services run at a profit and offering a stupid amount of games that cost millions if not tens of millions of dollars to make at a monthly sub price of between $1 and $10 certainly isn’t going to be putting them in the black instead of the red.

It’s just fun money for Microsoft really. Do you think Microsoft would prefer to have 10 million people buy Halo Infinite at $60 or 20 million people subscribe to games pass for $10 a month if they could choose between them?"
03/26/2021,stocks,They're still making some of the greedy mistakes they made with the Xbox One though. Most recently they doubled the price of Xbox gold before reversing their decision following massive outcry on Twitter. There's not way they didn't lose a lot of trust pulling shady shit like that (they tried to be discrete about it as well which is the worst part).
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's not a bug, it's a feature... xD"
03/26/2021,stocks,Honestly I enjoyed Fallout 76 more than Fallout 4. All the settlement crap in Fallout 4 kind of ruined it for me. And I never really experienced the bugs people talked about with 76.
03/26/2021,stocks,it's good now
03/26/2021,stocks,"I looked it up, seems it extends to pc too, or there is a pc variant at least.

https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-games?&ef_id=Cj0KCQjwjPaCBhDkARIsAISZN7Sd7JbLCDlqG8AONntPKwUxRIlDMYpEChy57FZcpv3gWNPtX2OFe9EaAq0rEALw_wcB:G:s&OCID=AID2100895_SEM_Cj0KCQjwjPaCBhDkARIsAISZN7Sd7JbLCDlqG8AONntPKwUxRIlDMYpEChy57FZcpv3gWNPtX2OFe9EaAq0rEALw_wcB:G:s

But, it's not clear if the Xbox app requires an Xbox to play games from, or if the Xbox app can download and play pc versions of the offered games."
03/26/2021,stocks,"outerworlds was pretty shit, unfortunately"
03/26/2021,stocks,Acquisition are only as good as the vision behind them. They better have  a good plan to integrate these into the MSFT Eco system and use them as revenue generation plays.  A lot of these large corporations do acquisitions and 3-4 year down the line no one cares as nothing major comes from them. I believe in MSFT leadership team as they have made good decisions in the past 4-5 years . Let’s see how this plays out . Long since 2015
03/26/2021,stocks,"The point was that FONV was prior to Skyrim. The statement, they haven't made anything good since Skyrim, should not mention NV at all.

So yeah, feelings are immaterial, but your facts are wrong."
03/26/2021,stocks,"??? Skyrim 30+ mil copies sold. 

You are just confirming his point, bethesda hasnt made anything good since skyrim. Fallout 4 and 76 had the same mechanics, graphics and even worse performance then skyrim.

Bethesda is a failing game company, getting less and less sales in a rapidly growing industry, this was not a good move by MSFT."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I get what you're saying.  


But at the same time quality of the games is relevant, especially since figures can be skewed by an overall increase in the video game market over the last 10 years.  


It's important to take note of whether these companies are still making good games, as that will impact future sales."
03/26/2021,stocks,"FO4 on release was pretty terrible tbh.  
Buggy as hell.  


Like, sure, it was a huge world.  
But it was an empty huge world.  


Now it's a good game, but it still lacks the depth of other games."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's Id game. No need for additional confusion saying it's bethesda game.

That's like saying battlefield was made by dice and ea, when it's just dice and maybe another studio or two.

Edit: lol"
03/26/2021,stocks,I recommend you only buy on big drops but that's me
03/26/2021,stocks,sounds good. last word.
03/26/2021,stocks,Hell even a remastered version would be cool.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Man I never got past the first bit if I’m honest I like it desolate and that, but it was just sooo bleak and boring.. new Vegas was great 4 sucked.
People who like doing that are sad af"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well I'm a redditor and if I won't read this one time and understand what you mean, that matters."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah. Maybe you are right. I might have to do some more research about it
03/26/2021,stocks,"I hated pdzero I still have the metal case, it was all wrong vs the original in my opinion I will check sea of thieves thanks"
03/26/2021,stocks,"You bring up some good points but here are some counterpoints: say these 10 million people that bought Halo Infinite at $60 never buy another game again. I think Microsoft would rather retain Game Pass subscribers who are going to stay involved with the company and future releases over less active gamers.

This and Game Pass is different than a streaming service like Netflix. There are more features that Game Pass can offer.

> “When you subscribe to a channel that enables you to watch a video, like Netflix, that’s kind of the end of the monetization cycle that you have with that piece of content,” Bond added in the interview with Forbes. “In gaming it’s the opposite: there are items that you can buy in the game, there are extensions you can buy, there’s a next franchise you can purchase, there are other genres that you can leap to.”"
03/26/2021,stocks,">offering a stupid amount of games that cost millions if not tens of millions of dollars to make

A lot of the games on gamepass are 3rd party, microsoft has no development cost for those games.

>Do you think Microsoft would prefer to have 10 million people buy Halo Infinite at $60 or 20 million people subscribe to games pass for $10 a month if they could choose between them?

Did you do the math on this? $10 per month is $120 per year, then consider halo releases a game every ~3-4 years...$360 per person per halo release or $60...yeah, I think microsoft would rather have 20M people pay $10/month than have 10M people pay $60 every year."
03/26/2021,stocks,It sounds like you're just pulling numbers out of your ass. How much of this comes from Microsoft's official reports?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think they were trying to push everyone to Gamepass Ultimate which is $15 a month instead of $10.

If you're hooked into Xbox Live, you're stuck there. People aren't going to leave their online friend group because of a move they reversed immediately."
03/26/2021,stocks,">  All the settlement crap in Fallout 4 kind of ruined it for me.

the almost entirely optional and easily ignored portion of the game ruined it for you? Ok then"
03/26/2021,stocks,"What a good pick in 2015!!   


Congrats!   


Also, Fuck You!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you are going by ""# of sales"" alone, Fallout Shelter had 150M downloads. 

I prefer to stick with revenue when looking at companies. 

However, Fallout NV being before SKyrim was a mistake albeit a minor one and was only a minor supporting fact and even removing that; the thesis remains unchanged.

Bethesda was a smarty play, so is discord, and MSFT swallowing up a few more game devs is continuing smart money investments on top of smart money."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I was going to respond but looking over your post history.....Pass.   


Nice knowing you!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Actually the revenue of the games is all that is relevant. 

There a TON of cash cows I consider ""bad"" games in the F2P model. 

As a Gamer; I judge games by the quality when I PLAY them. 

As an investor; I judge games by the profit they produce individually as well as future potential profit. 

As we grow older we will DEFINITELY think new fads/games/styles are personally stupid but separating our personal feelings from revenue forecasts is extremely important (objective DD)."
03/26/2021,stocks,Has there any open world besthesda games that are not terrible at launch? imo FO4 had a better launch compared to others in the past
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agree.

I'm not a fan of Bethesda's take on the sandbox-style games. Too big and empty. And the different gameplay systems don't integrate in a way that makes all the extra content compelling. In Fallout 4, I didn't even touch the base-building mechanics other than when it was required for a quest. Compare that to Mother Base in MGS5, which I found satisfying as hell to manage and build up.

I still had fun with the main campaign though. But wasn't motivated to seek out every quest line like I did in New Vegas."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m the same way. For blue , low volatile stocks, I like to buy on 2% or higher dips."
03/26/2021,stocks,"What was the first Fallout you played? For me, it was Fallout 3, so I have the fondest memories of 3 because I had never played anything like it before. FNV has way more acclaim, but when I think of Fallout, I think of 3."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Halo was an Xbox exclusive and that was huge, all the mario games and stuff like that on Nintendo as well"
03/26/2021,stocks,It’s interesting cus i dont play a lot but wouldn’t mind paying for game pass and just play one tripleA a year.
03/26/2021,stocks,">Basically, a service for children"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I absolutely think it's going to cost them because most people have to move on to either PC or a new console in the future and this is the type of shit to make you twice about commiting to a company for as much as 12 years. Obviously, I don't want to assume things about gamers but PlayStation already has overwhelming market share anyway.

If people ditched their 360s for PS4s last year I think people can also ditch their Xbones for PS5s and their Series Ss for PS5 Pros."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, because the fact that you had so many settlements meant that there were essentially no cities or towns in the game unless you built them. Made for a very boring world to explore. That combined with the constant annoyance of defending settlements made it my least favorite fallout game."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah there were only a few quests related to this and I just ignored them. Although eventually I came around to enjoy the settlement stuff, but way after I finished the story."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Hey thanks ..  you know this stock solidified me as an investor . When you only have a few grand to invest and your biggest holding just sits around $44-50for over a year that really i dunno gives you Grey hair just holding on to it, but I am in IT and I knew sooner or later Azure and office 360 will start minting $ took a lot a longer but I am Glad I didn’t sell."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm long msft but I don't love this move. I don't think Bethesda games are going to be the GamePass seller they think it is. Not denying that they have had some strong sellers in the past decade, but it's not going to have the prestige of PS. I don't think the cash cow type games, like shelter, will make a large dent compared to other aspects of MSFT's biz."
03/26/2021,stocks,"And yet, you chose to respond anyways lmao"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Bought NV at launch, put it down for an entire year before I played it once again because of how bugged it was. Turned out to be one of my favorite games ever."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This and you can try games you wouldn't have normally felt comfortable paying $60; if you don't like it, you didn't waste $60. I've discovered a lot of games I enjoyed that I probably wouldn't have given a chance before. It's also made me feel less guilty about playing Madden, NBA Live, et al."
03/26/2021,stocks,"People go where their friends go without a doubt, speaking from experience. If all your friends on playing CoD on Xbox, you're not going to break from the pack over this."
03/26/2021,stocks,DIAMOND HANDS!
03/26/2021,stocks,"How would you expect MSFT to build out that library? 

The MSFT titles like Halo etc are no longer gamer darlings.  

What would you propose as an alternative? 

They are not just acquiring the IP, they are also acquiring the studio and employed talent. Even if Fallout, Elder Scrolls, and other titles lose some steam; MSFT still has talent in the studio to pivot to new game franchises. 

I don't think MSFT has many other options to build out their unique games. 

Time will tell though."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I also just recently played NV, I absolutely adored the game but it is still unoptimised as shit. I had to download multiple mods to even make it playable"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Also, cross play is becoming a thing."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Right, but most people's friends are presumably on PS, judging by last gen's sales figures. I don't have a bone in the console wars or anything like that - I'm just saying that Xbox leadership is making amateur mistakes that you don't see Sony doing."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Remindme! One year ""how is MSFT doing with Bethesda acquisition, respond to this thread"""
03/26/2021,stocks,Sony is putting all their PS infrastructure on Azure. MS already made the best play they can. The console wars are peanuts compared to that
03/26/2021,stocks,"I will be messaging you in 1 year on [**2022-03-26 16:47:23 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-03-26%2016:47:23%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mdnzup/microsoft_closes_75_billion_bethesda_acquisition/gsb5hgl/?context=3)

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-friday-march-26.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

> * Dow and S&P 500 futures Friday added to Thursday’s late-session comeback, which saw Wall Street break a two-day losing streak, putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 at about breakeven for the week. The Dow closed up 199 points, boosted by economic comeback stocks, after losing as much as 348 points earlier Thursday. Nasdaq futures turned lower Friday after the index closed slightly higher. However, it remained 1.8% lower for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up Friday but still below recent 14-month highs.

> * The Commerce Department is out with personal income and spending figures for February at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect an income drop of 7%. Spending is also seen dropping by 0.8%. In January, income jumped 10%, its biggest monthly gain since April, as Americans received stimulus checks approved in December. Spending in January increased by 2.4%. In the coming months, another round of stimulus checks, approved in March, could start showing up in the data.

*****

> # 2. Office-sharing company WeWork signs new deal to go public

> * WeWork, which pulled its IPO in 2019 after a dwindling valuation and resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann, has reached a new deal to go public. The office-sharing company agreed on Friday to merge with special purpose acquisition company BowX Acquisition Corp. The transaction values WeWork at $9 billion, a fraction of its one-time valuation of around $47 billion. Following the announcement, shares of BowX rose 2.5% in Friday premarket.

*****

> # 3. GameStop shares to open higher after soaring over 50%

> * GameStop shares jumped roughly 10% in Friday’s premarket, the morning after snapping a five-session losing streak and closing 52% higher. There was no apparent news Thursday. GameStop has been the most high-profile “meme stock,” popular among retail traders on Reddit and other social media platforms. The stock lost about a third of its value Wednesday after the video game retailer delivered disappointing fourth-quarter results, failed to give in-depth detail about its digital turnaround plans, and acknowledged it’s considering selling more stock.

*****

> # 4. Tesla ordered to have Elon Musk delete anti-union tweet

> * The National Labor Relations Board told Tesla to make Elon Musk delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers within the company. The independent federal agency also ordered Tesla to reinstate a fired employee, Richard Ortiz, a union advocate. Tesla must also compensate Ortiz for loss of earnings, benefits and adverse tax consequences that resulted from his termination. The NLRB decision was largely in line with an administrative law judge’s ruling from 2019, which Tesla had appealed to the full board.

*****

> # 5. Suez Canal blockage delays estimated $400 million an hour in goods

> * The Ever Given, a stranded mega container ship in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million per hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that move through the key waterway every day. That’s according to shipping data and news company Lloyd’s List. Lloyd’s values the canal’s westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, March 26th, 2021! :)**"
03/26/2021,stocks,Hoping for a strong finish to a shit week.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I am interested in that insider trade at FTAI, a guy on the board opened a position of 800,000 commons for $20 million? And it's an infrastructure company? Might be a good play here I am going to have to do some research on it"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Dow’s up, NASDAQ’s up, S&P’s up, so naturally I’m going to still be in the fucking red."
03/26/2021,stocks,What's this green stuff on pre-market?
03/26/2021,stocks,Holy shit that drop in Wework valuation. Rip
03/26/2021,stocks,I’ll just take a flat day at this point.
2021-03-26 16:04:26,stocks,"Tech is tanking at the moment, but it will come back up eventually. Don’t listen to the big media platforms too much! So lately the market has been going down and people might have gotten some bloody days in their portfolios. The correction has affected tech the most as the Nasdaq is about 8% from its all time highs.

The correction has happened because of number one: Rising treasury yields and number two: Sector rotation. Reopening plays are currently the trend that big money likes and money has gone there recently. 

This doesn’t mean that tech is bad in the long term. Stocks go down sometimes and this is the moment that it’s happening. But there is a silver lining to this story...

This gives us a good opportunity get your favourite stocks at a cheaper price. Averaging down is a very delightful thing to do and this is a perfect opportunity. And even if we continue to go down, it’s ok, since you can average down even more.

Another thing that I want to say is that you shouldn’t listen to the media too much. It’s their job to create havoc and drama in the stock market. Their opinions change every week almost, and it’s kinda funny sometimes. One week they say that you shouldn’t sell and another day CNBC reporters tell us how big tech is in a bad place and you should move to industrials, travel, etc. 

You have YOUR own plan. Do your plan and don’t listen to those whose job is to dramatize things. The stock market needs patience. Investing is for the long run.

Don’t look at the 1 day chart all the time. It can be very toxic for yourself, especially during a red day. So just chill and remember that your time horizon is in 10 years, not tomorrow.

That’s my 2 cents, have good one everyone!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Remember, Bill Ackman claimed all hotels would reach, ""$0"" kicking a panic selloff before closing his shorts, buying everything he shorted, and then turning less than $30M into over $1Bn. The media hosts a bunch of slimey fucks; listen to field experts who aren't concerned with stock prices, not self proclaimed experts."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You can buy both recovery/value and tech at the same time. That way gains in one section can offset the losses in another.

But yea I agree the media doesn't really predict anything they are hindsight minded. So when stocks go up they have positive things to say about them. Those same stocks go down they then turn on them. Nothing changed fundamentally only the stock price yet they say different things."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Every fucking thing I do is wrong. Everything. Literally every time I buy a stock, that very second that my trade executes, it starts to fucking tank and I am sick of it. I don't know what to do anymore."
03/26/2021,stocks,I averaged down Enron
03/26/2021,stocks,"Counterpoint, intel is currently trading under the peak on Aug 25, 2000.

I'm not saying scramble into memestocks, but be aware that a stock falling from an overvaluation can take over a decade to recover. It might be that every one of these recover, but when and will your money really be working for you?

All that said, I personally feel this is a pretty short term correction, similar to June and September of last year."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Media lies, do your own DD. Oddly, going against what they say has made me more money that listening to them."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Putting too much weight into media sentiment is a rookie mistake. During a correction like this you can see news articles about how tech is declining and will continue to, and you can see ones about how a rebound is coming. About how there's a rotation from growth into value, and by the time you read that article smart money is already rotating back into tech. 

News is complex, different authors with different vested interests and levels of understanding, opinions, influences.

Stocks always go up"
03/26/2021,stocks,My intel isn't tanking nor is my msft.  The market is just schizophrenic in general.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Why are there 10 don't panic self talk posts every time the market goes down 0.5%? Like, you aren't even buying the dip, it can dip way lower.

This actually makes me realize how much panic there would be from a real drop, and makes it look so much more like a bubble lol. The drops are normal, these type of desperate 1999 posts are not"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I am holding, aapl, msft, amzn, and googl firm, I trust them."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Isn’t a major correction bound to happen soon? I feel like everything has been inflated with money injected by the fed, by stimulus/unemployment, and with interest rates/bond yields so low where else would people put their money?
  
I guess I just feel like none of the market reflects reality right now. 700k people file for unemployment every week and yet all the major indexes are at all-time highs. It’s bizarre to me."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The problem with averaging down is we have been saying that for almost 6 weeks now. I dont think retail has much powder left other than an incoming paycheck and the market is not in the shape to be putting that straight in to stuff that continues to drop in tech even if it might come back.

You cant just keep averaging down for weeks on end. I say hold your shares and hold your cash.

Or buy SCHD"
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is where a more longer-term investment mindset is important. Technology and data are clearly the future of everything we do. No one in their right mind will deny that. If you need assurance and/or conviction, keep that in mind."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Everything is tech. No matter what it is, tech is the backbone. All they’re trying to do is to scare you into selling so they can buy it back cheaper and then let it run up again. If it’s a solid company and they’re doing well, then you hold and buy the dips if you can to dca down. It’s a long game. Have to think in years not days weeks or months."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Seriously, tech is the future. It’s idiotic to think that tech will stay down forever"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m bullish on Apple long term as well! It’s been rocky short term, but I’ve been capitalizing on that by selling some covered calls. It’s been working out well so far!"
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah but I need it to come back up before my calls expire :(
03/26/2021,stocks,All I'm seeing is a giant sale
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well, listening to the older investors vs the younger investors are different. Many of the older investors, the suits(the ones who are aged 50+) only look at the near term. The younger ones, you and I, the under 50s, should be looking 15-20+ years ahead. This is why buying on discount is good. Also, why staying away from value stocks is a bad play, unless you like the company, then by all means, invest in your favourites. But, don’t rotate into value stocks just because the suits are saying so. There is no money to be made in those over the long term. I mean there is always money to be made in the market, but we are talking making money on American Airlines over 20 years or TSLA/PLTR over 20 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,Why would tech ever be bad in the long term. Tech is how innovation happens. It’s cyclical.
03/26/2021,stocks,When things are going bad it can feel better to force a move and feel like you’re doing something. Often that’s worse
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol / I’m sure they said the same thing in 2001
03/26/2021,stocks,"Amen to this.

Good time to average down on anything you may have bought into recently. People will always crawl back to growth when they realise they don't want that 1.7% bond return!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Big boys seem to like to shake out the lil guy/gal so they can reinvest into tech/growth just before summer & ride the wave up (as everyone jumps back in) through end of q3 sept.  Imo it always seemed 
1. best time to buy was late march-mid april. 
2. Be prepared for a small “sell in may n go away” sell off prior to memorial day
3. Watch tech rise through Aug/sep
4. Prepare for EOY sell off due to profit taking oct-dec
Just my thoughts & uneducated opinion & not advice lolz"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well.. nobody can predict anything, Amazon dropped 94% during dot com bubble. It could recover or it could not, there is no guarantee that in 10 years horizon you will be up. However I will still stay invested at proportion I’m comfortable with"
03/26/2021,stocks,IPOE
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm investing everything I have into the cheaper tech stocks right now.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Tech is done, you all lost all your money that you invested in it. Take this as a lesson to only invest in oil and tobbaco and index funds. /S"
03/26/2021,stocks,What I keep hearing from all the podcasts is that we're in the midst of a rotation from growth to value and value will lead the charge in the second half of  this supercycle.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think a general rule of long-term investing is to **never listen to media outlets** because the model they thrive on is overconfidence on their forecasts, which are **almost always** shortsighted."
03/26/2021,stocks,Everything is on sale!!!!
03/26/2021,stocks,I remember someone tracked the predictions by big media's Jim Cramer and found him to be wrong more than half the time.

03/26/2021,stocks,This aged well in the short term
03/26/2021,stocks,Which stocks are they mainly talking about though?
03/26/2021,stocks,Lmao. How is tech tanking? $QQQ is at 316. What a bad joke
03/26/2021,stocks,Nobody knows whats going to happen if you just look at fundamentals you shouldn’t touch most of the big tech names. Just because a company dropped from its ATH doesn’t mean its a great buy all of a sudden. These posts make me really worried a lot of people will get burned badly.
03/26/2021,stocks,This is tanking? Goog is up almost 80% from last year? Apple is up 94.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Wait until it actually hits the desperate levels, it could take months or years"
03/26/2021,stocks,I cannot agree more man. Tech is the future.
03/26/2021,stocks,"So, while I sort of agree, it very very matters “what” tech you bought.

QQQ?  Yeah, it’ll probably be back, but it still is highly affected by interest rates.  Some of these other “boutique” ETFs like ICLN or ARK?  Individual mid/small cap companies? That remains to be seen.

Note to all investors, just because something is “the future” doesn’t mean it’s a good investment. It has to be executed well and provide value.  Not a stock market example, but Darien Scheme (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme) is a perfect example of this.  

Basically, around 1700 Scotland wanted a colony like the other nations.  So they set together to fund a colony in Panama...after all exploration in the new world was obviously “the future” right?  How could it go wrong?  Up to 20% of all of Scotland’s wealth was invested in it.  You’ll have to read up on it, but it was an abject failure for many reasons, and the colony failed quickly.  This ended up being one of the reasons Scotland had to join England in the act of Union because they were destitute from wasting 1/5 of ALL their money on a boondoggle.

Anyways, it’s an interesting parallel to me, I hope others can see it too."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Tech was WAY overbought from COVID.

this was/is to be expected.

People pulled out of all the sectors COVID hit hard back in march and put money into the stocks not directly affected by it (Tech). 

things will balance back out after COVID is contained.

I've been in recovery stocks since last march, and up 300% and not even slightly worried about holding. these last few weeks im down like 2% from ATH.   this morning I've closed that gap even more so."
03/26/2021,stocks,Nah the NASDAQ is in a crazy bubble right now. I’m buying PSQ and SQQQ
03/26/2021,stocks,"Or it could be that HF’s are shorting a large portion of the market in relation to GameStop. 

Don’t trust the main stream media at all. If anything, assume the opposite of what they’re telling you. If they say it’s a good time to get in a stock, 9/10 times you’ll have already missed the big gains. 

FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) is a major tactic or the big money players (namely hedge funds and short sellers) and they’re all in bed together with the media. 

How enjoyable and what a free market we have."
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm pretty sure this whole tech thing is just a fad and that we'll all go back to running small family farms or working in factories soon.
03/26/2021,stocks,Just wait till the fed removes seven trillion from their balance sheet. Then the fun starts.
03/26/2021,stocks,Is it bad that I'm kind of wishing it would tank a bit more before coming back up? I'm still in the green for most of the stocks I own and would love to average down a bit more lol
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think what so many people don't realize is that markets are inherently cyclical. We have just had a massive ~decade long bull market in tech (and broad equities). As markets have always done, we will now likely enter a weaker period where other parts of the market will outperform, namely energy and commodities (oil, precious metals, copper, iron, uranium etc.).

How long? If historical averages are anything to go by, we will see that part of the market outperform until roughly 2026-2027."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Never sell at a loss, hodl till the end"
03/26/2021,stocks,You call this tanking? Oh boy
03/26/2021,stocks,"People focus on treasury...  Look at the big picture: During the pandemic, tech was very, very important.  People bought stock in Zoom and other platforms that were needed more during the pandemic.  This is waning and underpriced retail is picking up.  People are going to be out again.  Think about cars, retail, in person services that survived the pandemic, maybe hotels,...  Some of their competitors are out and some of them are still in about to take more of the market share (Not advice.)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"What the fuck are you talking about? Tech is way overvalued with most companies making 2-3x gains in a year. This is not normal and it can't go up forever.

I am getting sick of people who started trading during the biggest boom market of the past 20 years who think they know what's going on. Nobody knows. So stop spreading your bullshit."
03/26/2021,stocks,Tech is the future. These boomers are just trying to scare people away.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the pep talk chief. Don't even know why this thread is required. Is it to calm undiversified high risk investors who should already know their concentrated sector  portfolio will be very volatile? Also tech is broad big difference between apple, MSFT, GOOG and speculative stuff like pltr, nio , BB etc. If you wanted to play it safe buy VTI"

03/26/2021,stocks,"Alt proposal: tech stocks are the dot com bubble of the 2010's, and are grossly overvalued."

03/26/2021,stocks,Today’s tech is fundamentally different from the dot-com bubble. Today’s big techs literally make hundreds of billions dollars year after year and the numbers are still growing rapidly.
03/26/2021,stocks,"The denial that tech is WAYYYY overvalued right now continues. This market cycle is peaked -- Apple isn't making revolutionary devices anymore, chip makers are down to diminishing returns on die sizes, EV prices are baked in for HUGE future growth. I don't see tech imploding, but I don't see how it's possible for it to see any huge gains for a while."

03/26/2021,stocks,"The big shops are constantly building positions as the markets move. Right now they are slowly building positions back into tech as this rotation moves, just as they were building positions in oil/value as tech was about to wind down. They have the advantage of massive capital, tracking order flow, etc. so they can lead the way, trigger sell offs, yada yada, manipulation, yada...in a few months, next year, whenever, you'll start hearing - valuations in tech look attractive again or some other narrative and they'll pump again. Look at the slope of NASDAQ vs any other major index. It's almost always steeper during it's runs than the dow, S&P, etc. but the sell offs are more painful. Don't let it deter you from tech stocks - they are quite literally the future so when they rip, they rip hard and fast. NASDAQ was the Covid darling because they enabled isolation, with that shifting it's expected to have a pretty deep sell off given the run up we had over the last year."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Beeing 8% down from ATH is not „tanking“ or a correction. It seems that many people joined the sub 10 months ago and it is the first pullback they experience. Wake me up when NASDAQ its 30-40% down from ATH, that‘s a correction. The issue is that most young investors only buy tech companies. And especially the ones who don‘t earn anything tank the hardest. Just diversify a bit more and you won‘t even feel the -8% right now as banks and industrials surged."
03/26/2021,stocks,"If the rich assholes would stop shorting every etf with GME and GME in general they wouldn’t have to liquidate their other positions, namely tech, in order to try to stop the bleeding, which really is only denying the inevitable. I encourage anyone reading this to hop over to GME and read the due diligence. Could make you a millionaire. Watch this get downvoted by shills too idgaf"

03/26/2021,stocks,"As someone who’s been in the market for 1 month, I have no reason to doubt that. I only regret not selling some holdings when they were 20% up, now they are in negative territory.

On this subreddit I hear a lot about how bad is CNBS. But I read Bloomberg news a lot lately and I think it helps me to educate myself of what is happening. But I never followed their advice on what to buy. Neither I feel like thy try to push you to buy anything.

Although the more experienced I become, the more I realize what I need to focus on, how averaging works and that short term news don't matter in the long run that much."
03/26/2021,stocks,Tech down? Yes! It’s buying season!!
03/26/2021,stocks,Market manipulation.
03/26/2021,stocks,When the tech bubble pops so many people will be bagholding for 15 years like in 2000. Buying companies at 1000 PE ratios because tech is the future and can’t fail.

03/26/2021,stocks,"There are also media outlets that play both sides of a company outlook as well for ad revenue clicks, so I wouldn't take on board what they had to say.
In addition some media outlets can be bias toward one way or the other ie: almost all media outlets vs GME.
You are better off looking up well known investors for your research ie Cathy Woods for alot of tech company information as they are the sort of people actually putting their money where their mouth is.
While no one truly knows where the market is going, If you are holding for the long term, the recent red days are a blessing to accumulate some cheap stock - think of it as a sale now for possible gains later."

03/26/2021,stocks,I'm buying strength. And strength at this point is value and Energy stocks.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You are conflating prices with value. A dip in prices doesn’t indicate value or a guaranteed bounce back. Look at basic valuation metrics and even better, the financial statements of the companies you have on your buy list. This market is high and while it may just be a small correction “buy the dip” thinking can be a costly proposition."
03/26/2021,stocks,"A few thought I have on how to deal with the media while investing:

Different news sources will provide different types of information - knowing which type of information to take from them and how to use it is key. I like to divide them into 2-3 categories:

**Overall News / Market News - (Bloomberg, Economist, WSJ, Financial Times, NYTimes, Marketwach and Yahoo Finance are somewhat lesser-quality but seem to fit here):** 

* These sources provide business / market-themed stories - articles about supply chain issues, M&A, comments from CEOs, overall market info (like stats on retail investing recently), etc.
* This information is usually general, and should not really be used for recommendations of stocks. I like to read these sources daily, but it is more about digesting major economic / market news then finding good investments.

&#x200B;

**Investment- Themed Sources -  (Barrons, Investor's Business Daily, The Street, Motley Fool? - maybe a bit click-baity but I included it here):**

* I personally subscribe to Barron's - I find their weekend issues are great reading, they usually have a few in-depth pieces on individual companies and their business prospects
* These sources provide more information that is directly related to finding new stocks to buy - Barron's usually differentiates between what is a ""Barron's pick"" vs. what is just an analyst pick. They analyze the companies within their industries, look at what their competitive advantages are, etc. The research is often only surface-level but serves as a good starting point to do your own work on valuation. 
* Most of these are interesting, but should only be taken with a dose of skepticism - DO YOUR OWN FOLLOW-UP RESEARCH!
* Some pieces on Marketwatch seem to fit in here as well

&#x200B;

**Click-Baity Financial Sources (Benzinga, Zacks, maybe Motley Fool falls here too, there are some others that float on Yahoo News or TD's page):**

* I try to avoid these at all costs - when you end up reading a lot of them they seem to be just articles used over and over and they just plug different stocks in - like a computerized version of a PE analysis but without any analysis other than the PE and how it relates to its industry. 

I don't use Youtube but I understand a lot of people here do. I would say be careful - there are tons of fake gurus in every subject, but investing has been ripe for some doozy grifters recently."
03/26/2021,stocks,I’ll wait until tech drops way more before buying. Still way too overpriced
03/26/2021,stocks,FNGD!!!!!
03/26/2021,stocks,I agree! I just bought 1800 dollars more of TELADOC and 210 of PINTEREST. PINTEREST under 70 is a buy and TELADOC was trading in the 300s before all this scare started.
03/26/2021,stocks,thank you for this ! I will keep investing my tech stocks .

03/26/2021,stocks,Im balls deep in tesla calls this week 🥲
03/26/2021,stocks,Market rotation being thrown around alot - there was a steady raise in some big name stocks while the daq has been tanking but the gains nowhere near equal the amount of money being taken out of the tech sector. On top of this rising treasury yields means people are selling bonds. So if people are selling bonds and taking money out of stocks it begins to beg the question... what is happening to this cash?
03/26/2021,stocks,Only tech with healthy balance sheets will do good in these rising yields and inflation environment.

03/26/2021,stocks,"I don’t buy the sector rotation story, tech is here to stay and it will rally even more than in 2020. Just take a look at how much tech is getting involved in our every day life, most people now shifted to telework and you know very well how much tech is involved in that. Even when covid will no longer be around which i really doubt in the short term, our life will not be the same. Most workplaces will at least adopt a hybrid system, entertainment is shifting as well to a more digital environment. And who knows in the near future you wont need to visit a doctor, it is already happening with telemedicine."

If you believe in the company long term load up on the “tanking”. That’s exactly what I did 6 months back on the energy stocks (Suncor, Enbridge, Slb), I was very happy every time my portfolio went down, so I can buy more at lower price.

I think that the daily change notification in stock values, creates an exaggerated bias in both directions."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Don't buy a stock anytime it has been consecutively up for multiple days in a row.  Check a stocks p/e before you buy it. Consider the story, is it really worth it? I get so annoyed with some of the ""professionals"" buy recommendations, they are pure bullshit (I almost made a long post on this morning on my frustration/dissapointment with the state of market advise).  To me AAPL and MSFT are perfect quintessential examples of what to buy now.  They have been relatively flat for months and are strong companies.  Their price will go up eventually.
I do own a little of both and have for 5+ years."
03/26/2021,stocks,Stop trying to time it perfectly. Especially if investing long term
03/26/2021,stocks,"> Counterpoint, intel is currently trading under the peak on Aug 25, 2000. 

Although including dividends, you would be up. Albeit less than the SP500 in the same period."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This right here. Everyone thinks that THEIR tech pick is the next AAPL, MSFT, etc. when in reality a lot of these companies are never going to make those ATHs again. Some diversification would probably do newer investors well, as I am seeing a lot of portfolios that are 100% meme stocks."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Important to note: *you* will be up much faster than it takes to fully recover on good companies down from overvaluation if you average down.

Just because it takes 10 years to reach ATH again doesn't mean that it'll take 10 years for your money to work for you--depending on what you do in that situation."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Intel is an interesting one, and definitely should not be used as the prime example. 

Personally I think they are very undervalued, despite their fab issues and AMD catching up. They have dedicated business customers, are independent of TSMC/Samsungs nightmare supply constraints, are a strategic U.S. company (AMD is US based but its complicated), bring in plenty of cash both revenue and profits, and its a duopoly, and they are entering into the GPU race, which is a duopoly and only need to capture the lowest end to make big bucks. They have a lot going for them despite the constant doom and gloom, and people forget AMD was nearing bankruptcy (I bought them at like $3, but sold too soon) before their turn around, INTC isnt going anywhere.

The biggest threat to Intel is if there is a push to move to ARM. Apple's success with the M1 is very concerning for the future of x86. The obvious hedge would be NVDA, assuming their merger goes through, but NVDA isnt exactly a value play these days.

Anyways, INTC is one of the few tech stocks that did not get a boost from the Trump years or covid rally. Its a bluechip, so not really expected to double or anything, but its a bit surprising it has been ignored."
03/26/2021,stocks,This is assuming you lumped summed in at the peak and never touched it again. Which I guess some people might do. Many will keep investing along the way though.
03/26/2021,stocks,The biggest drivers of the current tech sell off are “growth” stocks with no earnings.
03/26/2021,stocks,My strategy is doing my own DD and then doing the opposite of what it says
03/26/2021,stocks,Underrated comment^. I’ve made all my money by doing the literal opposite of what CNBC recommends.
03/26/2021,stocks,">Media lies, do your own DD.


This right here, *so your own* DD. Yes, that means reading the reports and checking the numbers which takes some time and is boring. But it also means you know what you buy...take DD from reddit/YouTube/Tiktok and its ko better then the news. No one is trying to make *you* rich, but everyone wants your money."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is all because of gme/amc. They are being  tanked at the expense of the market,  due to things like what happened to the Russel 2000 two days ago and how citadel and friends are increasing their funds in the gme/amc fight by selling other securities.

The media refuses to correctly explain what is happening, and you all are suffering as a result. I personally saw this coming and have been all in gme for some time. If you expect other stocks to go up right now your not doing your DD."
03/26/2021,stocks,“Johnny! Tech declined today! Find a reason and write an article about it within the hour!”
03/26/2021,stocks,Financial news is just madlibs mostly written by bots.
03/26/2021,stocks,"The market typically moves in advance of the news, so by the time you read it whatever movement it's reporting on has already happened.

Yes, people are rotating out of tech and into value & cyclical stocks. Thing is 90% of that happened a month ago, and only the stragglers are doing it now. The big money is likely already flowing back into *established* and profitable tech companies. Then the money will start flowing to the emerging tech companies again. It's hard to justify some of these risky tech valuations when the heavy hitters have dropped so much that they look likely to surge 50+% y2y."
03/26/2021,stocks,">Why are there 10 don't panic self talk posts every time the market goes down 0.5%? Like, you aren't even buying the dip, it can dip way lower.

Well let's be real here. Most people hear hold volatile growth stocks that dropped 20-30% the last months. That's is not reflected by the Nasdaq. So you should be aware of the context when people say they portolio is red, they are not talking about 1-3% losses."
03/26/2021,stocks,Most probs have growth stocks cause you can't make money with 5% a year on a 5k portfolio
03/26/2021,stocks,Tech is down a lot more than 0.5%. For example AAPl is down 16% from its peak
03/26/2021,stocks,"> every time the market goes down 0.5%?

Boo! Poor comment. He refers to the Nasdaq dropping 8% right in the post. And then provides meaningful insight."
03/26/2021,stocks,As a new investor these posts are very helpful. It’s the smart play to learn from those with more experience. Your comment stating that we don’t need these posts everyday is just as redundant.
03/26/2021,stocks,Agreed. People that can't stomach looking at -5% shouldn't be doing this.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Because most people bought into ARK ETFs (and similars) at the top and are now suffering the consequences of not being patient.

Not to be mean or anything, but a lot of people on reddit need a serious reality check from the market."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's not even a correction (-10%).  The big buying opportunity is not there.  If new traders are only for daily gains, they need to get out."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The number of young people “investing” (read: gambling) and expecting 20-30% annual gains is scary. The wild bull market of 2016-2020 into the even more wild 2021 gains has trained a massive population of noob investors to expect nothing but up, up, and away. They check their portfolios more than hourly and get scared and angry at every single little bump in the road. Those are the people making all of these posts. 

At this point, I almost want a real correction or crash just to teach these people that it’s not always rainbows and butterflies so we can go back to real market talk."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Because tons of people were already all-in, so averaging down is not an option for them"
03/26/2021,stocks,"> don't panic self talk posts

Fuck I hate these so much. It's like wallstreetbets without the awareness"
03/26/2021,stocks,Because the xbi is down fucking 30%?
03/26/2021,stocks,"He isn't talking about the market he's talking about nasdaq, which is what most people on reddit invest in."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Why are there 10,000 pumper posts everyday?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think it's less of a wider bubble and more a reddit phenomenon.

Lot of people on this site entered the market around the gamestop frenzy. They then invested in tech stocks, because that's what redditors know.

Reddit doesn't reflect reality. A lot of people miss that."
03/26/2021,stocks,"> every time the market goes down 0.5%

Uh, people here arent just investing in boring boomer index funds lol, their portfolios are dropping by more than 0.5%"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Exactly. OP has added nothing new to the conversation, just regurgitated the wisdom from the umpteen threads on the topic. The real dip, if it comes, will ruin plenty of impatient first-timers."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah honestly. Also in what world is a 7% drop over a month after many months of rallying called ‘tanking’
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol shoulda seen things last year. People panicking while i was laughing my ass off buying everything
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yup, looking forward to these subs being ghost towns for a while."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Those will be fine talking about stuff like pltr , nio , BB etc."
03/26/2021,stocks,"SLR changes will cause a lot of margin calls next month, forced selling, etc. The fed increased credit a shit ton at the start of the panda and now is reeling it in. These drops may just be smart money getting out before the bigger drop next month. We shall return to a market that requires $100B companies to actually be profitable... One day."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Just Averaging down blindly isn't the answer, I learned my lesson. Choose entry points and stick to those. Addresses the powder problem somewhat."
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you're investing, ie planning on holding until retirement, then 6 weeks is nothing.  Dips regularly last 3 to 8 weeks, and market wide we're not even technically in a dip right now, just some sideways chop."
03/26/2021,stocks,">I dont think retail has much powder left other than an incoming paycheck and the market is not in the shape to be putting that straight in to stuff that continues to drop in tech even if it might come back.

What? I've been buying the dips regularly for tech. I even recommended this on my $PLL DD on my page. I've made thousands off of doing it with them in specific. Just wait for a whales to have panic selloffs, if there is no fundamental shift or realistic reason for the drop then buy heavy, and reap the quick turnarounds. Every time $PLL dips more than 20% in a day I buy a dozen shares and it's become my flagship stock as a result - I'm concerned I'm not diversifying enough at this point because I keep making money and it almost doesn't make sense not to keep doing it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"So is computing, but that doesn't save INTC's share price. Being part of the world of tomorrow isn't going to mean your stock appreciates."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not to mention tech like eVTOL, VR/AR, and Space stocks will receive the bulk of the investment in the future b/c that's where the growth will be.  It's not that hard. You just have to have patience."
03/26/2021,stocks,"More like tech is the past, present and future lol"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Cars were also the future once, and planes, and look how those stocks NORMALLY do (remove outliers like Tesla and Covid related rallies). I believe in tech, its my career and hobby, but I also think a lot of the sector is overvalued."
03/26/2021,stocks,It’s still up 75% in the last year
03/26/2021,stocks,"When tech does not make profits, the stocks will eventually go down."
03/26/2021,stocks,The sterotype to be made based on the way you wrote this is that you are a Lordstown Motors bagholder. It might not be true but you come across a litle bit as a EV hype guy
03/26/2021,stocks,The Fed also didn't print $4 trillion buckaroos during the crash either.
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks for the bullish tech signal
03/26/2021,stocks,Tech is done??🤪🤪🤪 dumbest shit I ever heard!

03/26/2021,stocks,"What big tech name looks bad on fundamentals? I hope you’re not talking about FAAMG because I’d strongly disagree there

03/26/2021,stocks,"Look, books are never going to be replaced. The industry is too invested in them. This whole digital learning, internet, and computers is a fad. We can do all of that stuff with what we already have. Innovation is for fools.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Comparing running a colony and Tech is poor analogy imo. Yeah, obviously you need to invest in good company that you can trust to. However, technology is the future and it is something that you cannot separate from civilization. As long as humanity and civilization exist, the technological development and use of technology will be needed. Company can fall behind but that doesn't mean tech was bad. The company simply couldn't keep up with the demand of market and competition. We don't know for certainty that which companies will survive and stay on top or which company will certainly fall behind. That is the reason, everyone needs to do their own research."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m looking at the charts on those, it looks like they don’t really pay off(at least not the gains I want at my budget) unless you have an absolute crash again like March of last year, and those are still just tiny blips. I don’t see tech being so overvalued that big names like AAPL should be in the $50s long term. Year over year what’s the return on an index short position? Lol"

03/26/2021,stocks,">If historical averages are anything to go by, we will see that part of the market outperform until roughly 2026-2027.

What websites do you use to see past performance and make estimates for future performance?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Let's not go by historical averages, because tech on this go-around is nothing like tech of yore. Growth will continue to outpace value after this mini-round is over, and tech will continue to dominate."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Another way to see this is that the bull market is broadening out to include the other sectors. Tech is being rebalanced which is an overall healthy move for tech and the markets in general.

It might not be a weakening, but a broadening."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Lol not really. Tech names fully valued may not grow as much. Technology as a share of the economy will keep growing. Traditional industries will keep getting disrupted. Tech is still where you wanna be in the 2020s.
It just may not be crazily valued tech names (good company =/= good stock)"
03/26/2021,stocks,Remarkably stupid sentiment.
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol this is terrible advice
03/26/2021,stocks,"i sell at a loss all th etime. i just go down 30%, panic sell, and throw it all in GME when it already gains 50% in a day. *crying inside*"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I LOVE selling at a loss.... during corrections. I harvest my tax losses. Buy $100 of Stock A. Correction hits. Stock A and other stock I like, Stock B, both drop 20% over the course of a month. Sell Stock A for $80, purchase Stock B and claim a tax loss on Stock A."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Everyone must be holding ark and icln. Myself included, but I am still well into the green bought summer last year. New investors who bought at the top are hurting. They need to learn to be patient or panic sell"
03/26/2021,stocks,"People are looking too short term at all of that. By the time you look at the reopening pandemic plays it’s usually priced in already(media is reactionary remember). Airlines are at ATHs, Starbucks is above 100, Marriott is at pre pandemic highs, Ect. I’m sure there are some diamonds in the rough out there but still. There will be some correction at some point in all of that and then people will cycle back to growth stocks. So why not buy the growth stock now and be a step ahead for once?

Zoom is a good example of what to avoid: Any company whose success depends mainly on a temporary event. Roblox is one that I consider in that same category, they IPO’d to take advantage of the timing of having this huge group of kids stuck at home. And I will also say making a post pandemic play is relying on a temporary event. So just be aware of what you’re buying, there will be companies that come out the other side better too."
03/26/2021,stocks,Gas is already hella expensive.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Shower thought: If ""nobody knows"", then isn't it also safe to say that maybe it can go up forever? 🤔"
03/26/2021,stocks,I am also sick of people saying the bubble has burst on tech at every minor correction 😂
03/26/2021,stocks,If nobody knows then maybe you should stfu too eh
03/26/2021,stocks,What is this referring to?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I know you're getting downvoted but this isn't entirely inaccurate. A few market whales are fluctuating blue ticket prices in covering short positions still through selloffs. While this isn't the only factor, the ongoing short squeezes are impacting other prices. This shouldn't be seen as a bad thing, though. The artifical dips it's causing aren't because of equity loss or fundamental business shifts, its just because investors did a piss poor job calculating risk on massive short positions. We should see this as an opportunity for lower price stocks that we know will go back up. Thats basically how I've made almost all of my money in the last few months now. I keep buying dips that don't have a fundamental reason to be dropping and the returns have been rather nice so far.

Its going to sort-of suck when that stops."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Shouldn't be getting downvoted. You're spot on, just takes a little research"
03/26/2021,stocks,30-40% isn’t a correction.  That’s a full blown crash lmao.

Everyone on earth knows tech is a huge part of our life, do you think the market didn't know that in December? August?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Sell while you are still up think it's just gonna get worse IMO. You can buy it back again if it dips even lower
03/26/2021,stocks,So journalists are buying the dip? Bloomberg News is buying the dip? Valuations don't matter it must be a conspiracy?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agreed - people always quote Bloomberg or WSJ here, and then say don't listen to mainstream media when making investments. Neither of these sources provide investment advice, they provide business news. I am not sure if reading comprehension is so bad that people cannot tell the difference, or if they just don't bother reading and keep fueling their narrative."

Screw that lol. I want EV companies to do amazing and put us all in super cool self driving cars, I want clean solar and fusion energy to crush the fossil fuel business, I want nanotech and genetic engineering to end disease hunger and death. I want everyone else to be rich and secure and not have to worry about all the annoying scarcity and war crap our grandparents were forced to stressed about their while lives.  

I want humanity to ascend. To the rest of the solar system, to the stars, to as many other galaxies as we can reach before the expansion of the universe takes them across our light horizon and they are lost to us. And THEN I want us to crack the speed of light and give entropy the middle finger and go get those lost galaxies anyway and party hard until the heat death of the universe. Then we will just laugh and make new universes :) 

Sound good?"
03/26/2021,stocks,I don’t think it’s necessarily checking the numbers urself but rather finding analysts whose job it is to check the numbers and will give much better reports than you will and finding reports that are bullish and bearish and forming your own opinion off that. Not all analysts agree and acting like they have no value is stupid. It’s like choosing to cook a five course meal when you have a chef doing it for free. Not saying they’re perfect but if utilized correctly you can find great value in their writings that u wouldn’t find urself unless u spent hours

Or the market could collapse tomorrow. The fact of the matter is that nobody knows, and YOU certainly don’t know, so maybe cut people some slack instead of being pretentious?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm the one who was impatient about ARK ETF. I bought ARKF at $71 😭 on Feb 19th..... it was crazy af because it closed at $62 on that day..it never come back close to $70...so I bought at dips and managed to lower the average cost to $55. I can't lower it more because I've spent all my capital. I've learned that I really need to be patient. I took fucking expensive lesson and learned from it. I probably couldn't stay patient because I've missed quiet big opportunities by waiting for prices to drop but sometimes those stocks that you wanted to buy launches rocket to the moon, then never come back down. Maybe, I'm not experienced enough.
I just hate the feeling when I have to buy the stocks at dips to lower my average cost. I don't think ARKF is bad investment but it still hurts seeing them performing poorly."

03/26/2021,stocks,"This is the exact argument I was targeting.  Simple “tech is the future” does not equal solid cash flows, and value generation.

I should point out it wasn’t simply a “colony”. They picked the spot they did to facilitate trade between the Pacific and Atlantic - an early Panama Canal.  Obviously a “good idea” and the future of moving goods across this narrow strip of land was obvious, but yet they failed, and took out their whole country nearly.

Another example, look at oil and fracking.  Brand new technology, made it way more efficient than ever before, however many of those companies failed to turn a profit because they had poor capital discipline and too high of competition.  The consumer did great!  Similar to how most other tech will benefit society, but may not make much money for investors."

03/26/2021,stocks,Agree to disagree on INTC. I think a lot of AMD investors have chased it based on its past performance and are paying a premium PE for it.

I do like your ARK position. It adds alpha and disruptive technology into your portfolio. Some don't like it, and that's their prerogative, just keep in mind it's a polarizing topic. So much so I was permanently banned from bogleheads for defending a 5% position in ARK. 

I'm personally 60% indexed (domestic and international), 10% blue chip consumer (Costco/Walmart) and the rest in a mix of growth and disruption (TSLA, TDOC, PLTR, ACTC, IPOE, DKNG etc). Personally have 5-8% in ARK. I'm a long term buy and hold investor that is ok with volatility because we're in our mid 30s and have a 10+ year horizon."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't have a lot of familiarity with the holdings in those particular Vanguard ETFs but two things stood out to me. 
1. You have VGT and ARKK, which are both tech heavy, so 30% of your portfolio is in tech. Now the holdings of VGT are quite different from ARKK, but it may be worth considering if you want that much tech exposure. 
2. This is my PERSONAL OPINION. I think ARK ETFs are garbage that are going to not exist in the next few years. I know a lot of people will disagree with me on this so what I will say is this. Look at the top 10 holdings of ARKK and examine those companies. When I do, I see companies whose stock is already overvalued and priced in for the next 5-10 years with little to no upside and a LOT of possible downside. Take a long hard look and see what you see. Hope this helps."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Is it? If that's the case they should absolutely carry on to be honest. Nothing has fundamentally changed about ARKK, they are an aggressive high risk ETF with long-term growth focus. If someone's bailing because it's down after a month and they can't handle the swing, they should never have put their money in a high risk ETF in the first place. 

Give it 5-10 years and this dip will be irrelevant, and this is a great buying opportunity rather than a reason to pull out.

I have no position in ARKK (its not available in the UK) but would absolutely be jumping in if I could, for a small portion of my portfolio."

03/26/2021,stocks,Watch out cuz those prices might not come back. It's happened to so many before don't assume it won't happen to you.
03/26/2021,stocks,"The other lesson is that it's okay to take profit. There is a really crazy buy and hold mentality here that is generally good particularly for index/etf investing but not always right for individual company shares.

 If the shares you are holding pump 40+% in a year that is really phenomenonal performance for any company, and the market is likely pricing in multiple years of growth well ahead of shedule. If the price detaches from the fundamentals, work out what you would be willing to pay for the company and get some money out. Microsoft and Amazon's prices didn't just go up over the past 15 years they yoyoed on their way giving multiple entry and exit points. And no one really knew how they would go in the long run. Not every company that looked equal came out the same some just traded flat or slowly declined. 

Likewise sometimes you have to cut a loser even when it's down. Holding a declining company for 4 years to break even means four years of opportunity cost for that capital sitting there doing nothing."

Take a step back and re-assess here. ARKF is not the worst out there and the top holdings are actually very liquid, so stick with it and be patient.

After this, take a moment to see how you can diversify your holdings between asset classes, sectors, fund managers and regions. Right now you have all your eggs in 1 basket: same sector, same fund managers and asset class, which is a recipe for disaster when the shit hits the fan. 

Forget chasing the ""tendies"" or ""going to the moon"". This is a huge cliche and I don't really like to use it, but investing is a marathon not a sprint.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Its different because we have a science.
Colony was considered ""future"" because they didn't have the science and technology that we have right now. Science is what separates tech and Colony. Oil and fracking was the future at that time but science revealed that we can have better options and how using oil can destroy our environment and harmful to human beings. So, we know what kind of technologies are going to be needed. Elon knew EV was the future. Many vehicle company CEOs laughed at Elon and criticized him for being unrealistic but science was clear even back then that we indeed need EV in near future. VW CEO even admitted that Tesla's tech is light year apart from their company's technology and said himself that he respects Elon. He used to say Elon needs to be realistic and focus on reducing the cost and creating profits. If Elon did that, then he couldn't have current technology that his company has. Current Tesla's technology is undisputably the best in both EV and automated industry. Audi said they will going to focus on only EV and develop EV only from now on. It will probably take them 10 years to catch up with Tesla's technology. Technology development require time, money, and dedication. Back when Tesla stock was cheap, Elon knew that if he bleeds now and just soley focus on technological development, then technological disparity will be huge that other companies will have to bleed later and Tesla can go further while its competitions bleed. That is why research is important because you can clearly see what is eventually going to happen. That is why I invest in Ark. Obviously I'm not saying my investment will 100% succeed. Risk is always there because as I said company falling behind has nothing to do with technology. Company can be poorly managed and that has nothing to do with techs. Colony analogy was poor because those guys did not have science, tech, and tools that we have right now. Technologival innovations are inevitable and industrial changes are inevitable. Choosing the right company is the hard part."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I think cyclicals will still have their time to shine don't get me wrong. I loaded up on cvx and citi near their bottoms last year and it turned out to be the best decision. 

Most ""value"" stocks really aren't offering any value right now though. Rotation is kinda getting overdone if u ask me. I don't see them performing the way they have for past 6 months, for an extended period of time. 

Ultimately i believe in fundamentals. Stock prices do eventually follow fcf of a company. Fairly valued tech companies growing at 20%+ and even high growth early stage companies will still outperfrom in the long run. 

I do admit though that people get it wrong when they buy these spacs, evs, or cloud companies trading at 30x sales. Those companies could keep growing and just trade sideways for a long time given their already priced to perfection."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You are price anchoring. Let me explain it a little differently. First assume that I have some gains for the year that I prefer not to have to pay taxes on. 

I buy 1 share of SPY for $100. At the time I made this transaction, 1 share of VOO was also $100. Coronavirus hits and the entire market pulls back 25%. My share of SPY is now only worth $75. I sell that share of SPY and buy a share of VOO, which is basically the same S&P500 ETF.  I now have the same amount of equity, one share, in a nearly identical stock, and I can also reduce my taxable gains by $25. This is called tax loss harvesting. Market corrections are a great time to do this because the whole market pulls back."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You said ""Case in point, current economic and political state of affairs"" - what does this mean? 
How do you think the media is misleading us? Most financial news is not offering stock advice, it is just covering what is going on in the market. When tech stocks go down, the media will write that they went down."
03/26/2021,stocks,Well idk about that. I think GME needs to wait a few weeks and consolidate a little more before climbing higher. Think this is just a gap close. Most the time I'm wrong tho. Just be careful.

By doing that you're attracting more people in and over time those people will continue to learn and contribute to the more specific discussions like this.

I 100% agree with you as well. I just don’t trust ARKK and the expensive ratio are booty cheeks. Vanguard expense ratios are great and the ETFs I’m looking at have actually been around for a while.

My blend I’m looking at it will be:
VTI 35%
VTV 35%
VGT 20%
ICLN 5-10%
Potentially a bond at 5% maybe?

Not too sure on that one. I just really like the upside of ICLN"

03/26/2021,stocks,PLTR is a 2-3 year play at minimum. Anyone who expected the pump to last through lockup doesn’t know what they are doing. Anyone buying PLTR for short term gains is in the wrong stock.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not op, but it was the largest single increase since 1938. Pretty detached if you ask me."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agreed. There’s nothing wrong with being a novice investor and wanting to participate in discussions, but the fact that lots of these new investors here say “$X company is the future!” while simultaneously dismissing any discussion about valuations as boomer talk despite it empirically having pretty strong correlation with future returns is pretty annoying. Buying a company at a high valuation is high risk and potentially very low reward. When you’re pricing in 10 years of 30% annual growth, you shouldn’t be surprised if the stock shits the bed.

But this often falls on deaf ears. Easier to blame boomers, the media, and hedge funds. It’s kinda funny how conspiracy theories have become so normalized in the investing subreddits."

My entire portfolio is +150% while bag holding ARKF. I'm long-term investor and going to hold ARKF minimum 5 years. I just regret buying at that price because I could have bought many more stocks with the same price. I'm trying to build wealth and I find diversifying is great but not so great at building wealth. Diversifying is great for avoiding risk but I won't gain as much as return as I'm getting right now. I know guys that went balls deep into the stocks that I had conviction that will go up. I invested too but my capital was too small. On the other hand, the guys that ik they literally retired at early 30s....I invested in the same stock but I didn't have enough money to go balls deep like the guys that I know. So, I guess I will diversify my investment when I have enough assets to diversify. Right now, diversifying seems too early for me. Thank you for the advice tho. I think you are already rich considering the fact that you are telling me to diversify, but in case you are not rich yet. I hope you become rich and good luck to you too 🙏💎"

The alternative is you held from 100 to 75, it then recovers back to 100 and you sell. Once again no gains, so no taxes.

More likely closer to where it’s been hovering ~$11 unless something huge drops or they start turning and burning on revenue out of nowhere.

03/26/2021,stocks,"But you don’t have to sell once it gets back to 100. You can keep holding. The point is that I have taxable gains from all the other stocks I trade throughout the year. This basically allows me to keep the same amount of equity and to write off some of my other gains. There is a rule that says you can’t write off losses if you quickly sell and buy the same stock, so you have to find two similar stocks that both went down at the same time, which is very easy to do during a market correction."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Market manipulation isn't about moving them yourself, it's about creating unnecessary panic or a false belief that it will be successful to get others to move the market to your benefit.

What Ackman did was hold his shorts through the panic that he stirred up, close them, and then rebuild the bottom price stocks to ride them back up.

>this is just an emotional misunderstanding based on widespread resentment of wallstreet with bill as the fall guy, no? 

No, he pushed a panic that favored his positions and capitalized on people's fears. Thats manipulation and the SEC is too spineless to do anything about it.

>but I cant say that's entirely bill's fault in this case

So you're telling me that Bill saying that all major hotels are on track to hit ""$0"" is not urging people to sell at a loss? That's not using emotional rhetoric to get people to sell at prices lower than they normally would in the false belief that all hotels will go bankrupt?"

03/26/2021,stocks,"i just recently spread my roth ira contribution this year across ARK funds. I understand they're down now but figure since it's a long term play, I'm not too worried about the recent dip. Are you mainly concerned with the liquidity issues brought up with the smaller companies? i.e. when investors flee ark, they tank the small caps they're invested in?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is the way!

~Kami"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Why is that always the knee-jerk response? “If you didn’t buy puts your opinion is invalid.” Such a stupid take. 

Why don’t you buy millions of dollars in calls on every stock you like, huh?????"
03/26/2021,stocks,"IV on PLTR has been extremely high and options plays had very limited profit margins with the massive premiums the last few months. Not worth the risk reward for me, personally as there were far more profitable plays over the last few months. I did profit on the way down by getting in under $20 and taking some profits above $35. I’m long on PLTR and will be holding my remaining shares another couple years at least. 

I’m not even being condescending and most of this isn’t hindsight. Alex Karp said in CNBC like two weeks ago that if you aren’t looking to hold then this isn’t the stock for you. Cathie Wood has said similar in the last few months. People were talking about the warning signs for months. PLTR was far overvalued after they went public even looking at basic fundamental indicators, like the fact that they’ve literally never made a profit, provide a super niche and expensive service that hasn’t fully grown into itself yet, underperformed on earnings this quarter, the list goes on. Not to mention that lockup expiring in February was a very big red flag that an insider sell off could tank the stock (which it did). Even someone with half a brain should have known to sell above $30 and buy back in after a potential post-lockup dip. Worst case it doesn’t dip and you’re in largely the same boat as before. 

Lastly, it’s completely out of line to judge someone based on whether or not they did or didn’t make a play. You don’t know what my financial situation is like or whether it was worth it for me to play PLTR options, and that has very little to do with an objective valuation of the market dynamics around PLTR. There were WAY better plays to make than PLTR puts the last couple months. Sorry if you’re bagholding and made the wrong play but that doesn’t make me condescending, lol. PLTR is a long play and it’s foolish to think otherwise."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Like the company from the DD I did on it. I mean I could be dead wrong and lose everything from it, but I like what I see and think that in the long run the stock price is bound to go up eventually.

03/26/2021,stocks,I don’t worry about short term trends...
03/26/2021,stocks,"I mean yeah you don't have to sell... You're missing the point of my argument lol. 

If you don't sell spy and buy voo and wait for it to go above 100 you pay taxes on gains. Same with if you sell the bottom and buy voo and let it ride above 100 you pay taxes on the gains. I'm so not seeing the difference lol, I don't get it. 

If you buy at 100 and it drops to 75 and you gold it it climbs back up, you're not paying taxes on the ""gains"" of that 25 dollars cause it's not gains, you're breaking even. If you sell the bottom and buy voo you then are responsible for those 25 of taxes cause you bought at 75 so you are up. That then cancels out with the 25 dollar loss, so what's the difference?? 

It should all even out, no?"

03/26/2021,stocks,"Ark buys Bitcoin and Tesla more than anything else;
Tesla buys Bitcoin for its holdings now

The three are tied together now it seems, and a bunch of small caps are tethered together with Tesla & Bitcoin.

With Ark having dropped 25% from its high you do have to wonder what happens if people pull their money from Ark. Seems like it all rides on Tesla maintaining its valuation, and a Bitcoin or Tesla plummet could now drag a bunch of small cap tech stocks down.

Seems like a lot of risk all around to me... I don't hold any Ark but have a lot of tech stocks that I'm sure would get dragged right down as well, so hopefully the fund doesn't pop."
03/26/2021,stocks,"The liquidity issue is a concern, but not my main one. I think that if you look at how TSLA, SQ, TDOC are priced right now, it basically accounts for the next several years of upside. TSLA is the best example as they are basically priced to own the industries they compete in over the next 10 years. I just don't think that they will establish the outsized market share that is priced in, whether its electric cars, solar, insurance, etc. I also think Cathie's new price target is insane.Also, returning to the liquidity issue you brought up.

""Bla bla bla of course TSLA is overvalued I knew it was going to finally drop hard the last two months. I didn't short it though because I didn't want free money."" - literally 90% of stock traders right now.

No play is guaranteed. If you knew a play was guaranteed to happen of course you would dump all your money into it. You would be stupid not to. And if you're not convinced enough to put money where your mouth is you can't really talk down on others who had an opposing view who actually did put down money."

If I can lower my 2021 tax burden, I benefit. If I tax loss harvest into stocks I end up holding for a long time, that extra gain from buying at bottom is taxed at the capital gains rate, plus I pay that in the future delaying payments is always preferred.

2021-03-26 16:03:13,stocks,"NIO and XPEV are oversold, will have a very strong bounce - BUY THE DIP!  These stocks are getting hammered because of 2 reasons - semiconductor shortage and Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act

1. semiconductor shortage is temporary and is a non-issue. It will go away in a week or two
2. HFCAA - the main thing this law does is to prevent companies being listed that are associated with Chinese military. And even then, companies have 3 years (!) to comply and can only be delisted after 3 years of non-compliance. Neither NIO nor XPEV has anymore connections to military than Tesla. And you can be sure that if these companies are pressured to delist, China is gonna respond with banning Tesla from China, and thats never going to happen!

So all these factors brining these stocks down are complete hype and rubbish!! BUY THE DIP!!"

And I say ""buy"" in quotes because as foreign devils and capitalist western pigs, we are not allowed to own Chinese stocks, only shell listings that the companies offer as a loophole to their countries idiotic ban on foreigners investing in Chinese companies. 

Morals of owning stock in a country that is actively committing genocide aside, you are putting your money at the complete whim of a dictatorship. Xi could have a bad dream about NIO and throw it's CEO into a gulag tomorrow and there's not a thing you or anyone could do about it."

03/26/2021,stocks,"That's not actually true. 

The US has two trading partners that are larger then China, where as China exports the bulk of it's trade to the US. That automatically means they are hurt more in a trade war.

03/26/2021,stocks,In simple terms the chip shortage has is roots from one year ago when rona hit and the automakers had to place their orders so they massively reduced their forecasts and orders. They car market didn't go as low as they expected so there is massive imbalance between the needs and what it can be produced and if it took one year for this imbalance to halt some car manufacturing plants so how long until do you think that it will go away? Many projects/auto OEM scramble for what it's left in the market redesigning their products to use whatever variants of microchips that they can use so that they are not blamed for the manufacturing shuting down and paying penalties for it and this only creates even more pressure on what is available. This redesign can take even years (from the idea to the final production ready product) but now it's done in a couple of days or weeks.

03/26/2021,stocks,Many people aren't aware of it but it's a huge risk of every Chinese stock. The Chinese gov makes it illegal for any foreigners to own stocks in Chinese companies. I won't go into why but it's so that the gov has stronger power over their companies. These companies have created a loophole by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands called VIEs that get around this. So any Chinese stock you own is a promise that the shell company is going to pay you based on what the actual Chinese company earns. China has allowed this to continue because it gets a lot of western money into China. But if China decides that they want to close the loophole for any reason then you will be bag holding to a company on paper that doesn't actually exist. I think China is heading towards more autocracy and control in the future which is a bad sign if you own these stocks in the USA

Instead of ""2 soldiers injured by IED"" the headlines suddenly read ""42 marines killed by Chinese airstrike"" No one wants to deal with that right now. War is so unpopular in the US on both sides of the political spectrum.

China knows this. They've been preparing for it for decades. They'll never have a better time to just go for it.

And yea, as soon as they do that, every Chinese stock becomes worth exactly zero dollars and zero cents on foreign markets when the sanctions hit.

2021-03-26 15:57:11,stocks,"Does it make sense? Going long and short on NDX at the same time Hello, I’m pretty new to day trading (I’ve been investing in ETFs for quite some time tho) and I’m not sure if what I tried in the last days makes sense or it’s just a newbie stupid mistake so I decided to ask more informed people here.

In the last days I tried, with paper trading, to open a long and a short position of the same amount (leveraged) on NASDAQ 100 in pre-market, just a few minutes before market opening, with a small SL.

The idea behind is that the big volatility at the market open will trigger the SL of one of the two positions and let the other one run long enough to cover the loss and gain a profit.

For now it worked, at least on paper trading. The profit, except for one time, wasn’t anything remarkable but I didn’t lose any money either.

So what I’m asking is: would it be risky/stupid to try it out on the real market? Is there something else that can go wrong except that the SL doesn’t trigger in time or that the movement is so fast that it just triggers both SL and leave me with a loss?

Thank you a lot for any advice and I’m sorry if this was too much of a stupid question 😅"
03/26/2021,stocks,I think an options strangle is what your looking for.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you are looking for market neutral strategies that aren't options I would look into trading pairs. 

You can get a chart for any pair on trading view by doing x stock / y stock with the higher trading stock as x for ease of comparison. You want to watch out for splits as it cause the charts to lose their correlation it's best to do pairs on stocks that have not been split for some time."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Always works on paper. Strangle would be best or box trade. Though that would take patience for the market to move up and down to open the positions correctly. 

Never works the same in real life. Emotions (greed) usually take over. 

I recommend starting small. Vertical debits 5 wide. Only $100-300 bucks, usually they always hit and that’s $500 total return to let it expire ITM"
2021-03-26 15:39:15,stocks,"Tech for the next 2-3 years Is this not an excellent entry point? Sure tech has had a huge run up in the last year, but it has always been on the uptrend. With almost guaranteed low interest rates for the next 2/3 years, why would you not invest during this dip? Arguably this extra 20-25% money in the world is bound to go and stay in the stock market unless there are weenie babies who sell and pay taxes. 

The chip shortage in the short term might be negative, but once the chipmakers like TSMC, AMD, NVIDEA, INTEL are back to operating at full capacity, tech sales will blow past what we’ve had this past year.

In 2010 there was also a chip shortage, after a recession, in a time of uncertainty. Many chipmakers and tech companies saw substantial growth in the following years."
03/26/2021,stocks,Tech is not going anywhere.  Innovation drives growth.  I’m typing this on an iPhone.  Find me the percentage of all companies in the word not running on Microsoft Windows.  FYI to do it you’ll need google.

There are no signs that we will turn back to an analog world an still there is a lot of potential in ecommerce and digitalisation (worldwide).

ML is everywhere now, and the pace is accelerating as we transition towards automating everything from transportation to medical services. It's touching almost every sector of the economy, and much of the income that used to be derived from labor is transitioning to income earned on capital. 2-3 years is still pretty short term, but as we extend that horizon, betting on technology becomes more and more of a sure thing."

03/26/2021,stocks,"The problem I see with the ""chip shortage"" is that a lot of the shortage is due to government policy. The gov't trade war with China is disrupting semiconductor supply chains and the loose spending/stimulus policies is causing people to put their money into cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which is driving supply demand for bitcoin mining computers that require an epic amount of semiconductor parts. 

This is a problem because the gov't can reverse those policies at ANY time. Any time something seems like a fool-proof investment, you can bet that some government or critical insider interest actor will do something to reverse it, and anyone inside that circle will make ridiculous amounts of money on the reversal. 

You can go all in on the chip shortage, but remember that it was artificially created by fiat and can get turned upside down overnight without notice and that a lot of people and investing whales will know before you do if that happens."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Tech in general? No, there are a ton of duds in the index. Most no profit businesses that have gone public will likely never find its way to sustainable cash flows...which is what generates value for you as a shareholder.

03/26/2021,stocks,"The thing about ""tech stocks"" is that this is constantly evolving. We have what are considered tech stocks now because it's new tech. Before this we had the dot come boom which was also tech. Before that we had idk automobiles or something. Eventually today's tech stocks will just be old tech and the new stuff will come out."
03/26/2021,stocks,i think one other thing to look at is will those companies you listed be able to outperform a tech index you choose to benchmark to. i feel like this topic of risk v reward isn't discussed enough because we tend to lose sight of the long term goal

Who has the best smart watch? Who made air pods popular? Who made tablets popular? Who has one of the best chips in a laptop (perhaps the best)?

- Salary: 150k
- RSUs: 400k vesting over 4 years (100k/year)

Now that I’m learning more about the market and my own personal style, I’m reassessing these positions and deciding which to keep and which to sell. I definitely realize that I am not diversified at all. There are also two stocks that I can’t post about due to sub rules. 

AMC - 42 @ $16.64 (-34.27%) I started investing a few weeks prior to all the meme stock hype and naturally got swept into it lol still holding on to this one to see what it does.

AAPL - 3 @ 120.51 (+0.07%)

NET - 3 @ 75.35 avg (-11.54%)

CRSR - 5 @ 32.83 (+0.38%)

CRLBF - 6 @ 15.58 (-16.9%)

FSLY - 3 @ 74.27 avg (-11.89%)

FLGT - 1 @ 72.27 (+44.07%)

LMND - 1 @ 144.77 (-38.53%)

PINS - 5@ 72.32 avg (-5.69%)

VFF - 5 @ 17.04 (-19.57%)

Future prospects : Nintendo, Activision, Spotify, Tencent, Logitech, Sony, SiriusXM, Lovesac.

Would love some recommendations from you guys on ETFs so that I have a strong baseline in my portfolio. I’m definitely thinking in the long term now. Also interested to hear about green energy, EV, retail, travel, etc. Pretty much open to anything so I can keep expanding my own knowledge! 

Thanks for reading!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"ETFs: VTI, VOO, and VXUS"
03/26/2021,stocks,Maybe some boring boomer stocks might bring you some diversity and stability.
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is a textbook 2020 portfolio that won't work nearly as well in 2021 and beyond.  I would strongly suggest some rotation into value stocks, like financials, energy, industrials.  The easy money in tech has already been made and a lot of these stocks will likely enter long basing periods until the fundamentals catch up to their valuations.

The thing new investors have to realize is that 2020 saw companies put up growth in one year that would normally take 5-10 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,Stop following WSB and chasing meme stocks. Invest in a low cost S&P ETF/index fund.
03/26/2021,stocks,Might consider averaging down your cost on AMC while the price is low. Adding to your position will benefit when the squeeze happens!
03/26/2021,stocks,I had my eye on VOO and VTI! Are you recommending all three in the portfolio or just picking one ?
03/26/2021,stocks,Sometimes boring is good. A lesson I’m learning the hard way right now lol. Thanks man!
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m feeling pretty confident in these tech choices in the long-term personally, but I do see your point. Probably will be quite a bumpy ride. I’ll start looking into the sectors you mentioned. Thank you!"

2021-03-26 13:54:09,stocks,"OptimizeRx - long term stock, reasonably valued, good entry A company that came under my radar recently is OptimizeRx (OPRX). In the following I want to present (1) an overview about the company and its business, (2) some fundamentals with comparison to another industry-related comparable stock and (3) an overall outlook for the future.

**(1) Overview and business model**

OptimizeRx operates as a digital health company that provides communications solutions for life science companies,  physicians, and patients. Its products and applications include  financial messaging, a virtual patient support center that allows  doctors and staff to access sample vouchers, co-pay coupons, and other  patient support through their EMR and/or e-prescribe systems; and brand  awareness and therapeutic support messaging services, such as brand  awareness messages, reminder ads, therapeutic support messages, and  unbranded messages. The company also offers brand support services,  which focuses on educating and working with pharmaceutical manufacturers  on identifying, formulating, and implementing new eRx media strategies,  including drug file integration, sales force training, and strategy  development services for promoting their products. In addition, it  operates cloud based Mobile Health Messenger platform that provides  interactive health messaging for enhanced medication adherence and care  coordination; and HIPAA-compliant automated mobile messaging platform  that allows pharmaceutical manufactures and related entities to directly  engage with patients to enhance regimen compliance. Further, the  company offers patient programs with treatment and affordability  information, lifestyle and condition trackers, Internet device  connectivity, forms, and surveys. 

The most compelling part of the company's business is there B2B platform. What do I mean with this. So traditionally if e.g. a drug manufacturer like Pfizer or JnJ develops a drug succesfully, that is only the first step. What makes a new drug succesful is the distribution in the market, i.e. among the actual doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, psychologists etc. Same goes with new medical devices, e.g. by Thermo Fisher. After inventing and developing them, they need to be rolled out by the respective company to really cash in on this.

So traditionally this was handled by agents. They were going to the hospitals or pharmacies like WBA to offer them the company's products. They were presenting the products using PowerPoint, buying them nice lunch etc. to convince them of their new product. You can compare this with an insurance agent who tries to find new customers for their respective company to engage.

Well this however, is no longer needed. OptimizeRX has developed a platform, which allows companies to engage virtually with physicians, hospitals, doctors, psychologists etc. to promote their product.  

""When a new treatment is available, it’s important to get the word out as soon as possible so patients can benefit. The OptimizeRx platform is an ideal communications network to accelerate awareness of a new brand or to quickly spread the word during significant life-cycle events such as a new indication. And with OptimizeRx, you can precisely target the physicians, and their healthcare staff, that matter most. And you can put your provider communications front and center in the EHR."" [(read here)](https://www.optimizerx.com/provider-engagement-applications)

I always like to compare the company to Teladoc (TDOC). But while TDOC is B2C (connects the buisness, i.e. hospital, doctor, psychologist etc., to the customer, i.e. patient). OPRX meanwhile approaches medical care in a more B2B fashion, connecting the manufacturer of medical devices and new drugs to the actual places where they get applied or sold (hospitals, doctors, pharmacies etc.).

The overall advantages should be clear, catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic but to strengthen my point I want to give you some bullet points:

* While it takes consumers/patients a change of habit to change from a analog to a virtual platform which is always kind of connected to a certain laziness (by human nature, we are a creature of habit who does not want to change that quickly), businesses and enterprises are driven by hard facts, i.e. time and money. So if there is a more cost effective way, businesses will choose this way. And connecting virtually not only saves money, it also saves time (remember, earlier the agent brought lunch presenting his PowerPoint). No doctor has the time to do that.
* With the OPRX platform the doctor/hospital/psychologist/pharmacist saves time because he can find target-orientated solutions through the EHR. Being more efficinet saves time. And saving time saves money.
* Health care is growing rapidly, more money will be spent on drug development. These drugs need to be promoted and sold.
* As far as I have found out there is no other (listed) company that provides a similar service.

&#x200B;

**(2) Fundamentals, guidance and valuation**

OPRX has a market cap of $797M as of writing this which makes it a small cap. TTM revenue accounts for $43.3M which results in a P/S ratio of 18.4. Full year 2020 yoy rev growth was 76%, Q4 yoy rev growth was even higher at 123%.

For the full year, operating income was a negative ($2,135M). Q4 operating income however was positive $1.356M. 

So what you can see overall, is that the metrics improved especially lately. They increased revenue tremendously especially in Q4 with posting positive operating income.

OPRX didn't give explicit guidance. However, they set an aspirational goal of $100M. But what really strikes me the most isn't the fact that they will reach that, but how. Here's the part of the conference call transcript:

*Analyst: ""Okay, and then speaking of aspirations, I noticed you didn't give us a year in which you're going to have $100 million in revenue. So we've got a potential revenue of $100 million. I just wanted to dive into that, you  have  talked  about  a  shift  to  more  subscription  type  revenue  or  current type revenue. In this  year where you do achieve that $100 million in revenue, what percentage is subscription?""*

*William Febbo (CEO): ""\[...\] Yes, we don't give guidance, so we don't put a date on it. I think what's more important is we have the  team  to  get  there,  asidefrom  maybe  a  few  select  hires; so  that  should  scream,  we're  going  after  it hard. There's that leverage we keep talking about""*

He also said: *"" In 2021, we expect to see a continued favorable shift to higher margin recurring-revenue enterprise deals, and we believe our pipeline growth has been driven by a permanent shift to more digital enablement.""*

So the key takeaway from this for me is that

(1) a large part of their revenue is recurring

(2) the recurring revenue is higher margin, which results in even more operating income

(3) their pipeline is really strong in 2021 [(see here)](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise)

(4) they do not have to hire big time to leverage their platform. The platform is there, now they can scale it which is cost efficient, further increasing margins and operating income.

So overall they have strong numbers, they are scaling their business and there certainly is demand for their product.

&#x200B;

However: A good company does not make it necessarily a good investment, if it's too expensive (even [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) was dead money for quite some time after the 01' crash).

So what I want to do is compare the valuation of OPRX to Teladoc (TDOC).

The reason why I compare OPRX with TDOC specifically as mentioned above is because both  are operating a virtual platform in healthcare, just on different levels: while TDOC connects the doctor with the patient (B2C), OPRX connects the manufacturer of medications, drugs, therapies, medical devices etc  with the doctor/hospital/laboratory/pharmacies/etc (B2B). Same thing, different level of operation. 

So TTM P/S ratio is 18.4 in comparison with Teladoc's $1.093B in revenue on a market cap of $26.9B which results in a TTM P/S ratio of 24,6.

One could argue that this valuation gap in favor of OPRX is because TDOC grew their Q4 revenue 145% yoy while OPRX “only“ grew 123%.

However, there are several points mentioned above that make me pick OPRX over TDOC:

(1) OPRX is profitable, posting \~1.4 million in net income in Q4 alone while TDOC isn’t profitable

(2) business model: connecting B2B is traditionally higher margin and more recurring; also the argument I made above that companies will shift to digital solutions quicker than ""humans"" when it is cost-saving while humans still are kind of a creature of habit who prefer to go to the doctor in person.

(3)  outlook -> OPRX (admittedly vaguely) guided for 100 million revenue which would be up \~130%. TDOC guided for  \~2bn in revenue which would be up only \~83%.

So basically OPRX has

* cheaper multiples
* positive net income (!)
* higher projected growth

&#x200B;

**(3) Future outlook and entry possibility**

So I hoped to shed some light on OPRX, their business and their fudnamentals. I am highly convinced by the business model and honestly when I realized how drug manufacturers and medical device companies promoted their products before in comparison to OPRX's solution it was kind of eye-opening and thoroughly logical for me as no doctor or head of a hospital wants to waste his time with a PowerPoint of a sales agent.

The business shifted into the next gear of course driven by the pandemic. It was the initial booster. But from the statemtents during their [conference call](https://investors.optimizerx.com/static-files/8336b73a-4fd7-4ead-a8c3-f081c8063e68) about a month ago as well as the [latest press release](https://investors.optimizerx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/optimizerx-recurring-revenue-grows-it-secures-19-new-enterprise) you can be quite optimistic about the future of their business even afer the pandemic ends in 2021.

I know the stock is richly valued. Look at the entire market. It ran 500% yoy which I cannot deny is a good argument against investing right now especialy if you are risk-averse. And certainly it is a small cap stock which includes higher risk. But the business itself is high margin, high growing, profitable and from my perspective uniquely positioned to profit from a continued shift to digital solutions in a huge total addressable market.

It recently pulled back from a high of $64 to around $47.50 which is 25% off the high. Given the (for you hopefully insightful) facts mentioned above that was enough for me to enter a rather big position in OPRX yesterday. And what in the end makes the most sense to me is not particularly a financial but more of a common sense thought: The actual users of medical devices and drugs do not have time for a sales agent. Why not integrate it into an all around immersive platform. That is what OPRX does.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

03/26/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Forecast**

~~[Inflation is outpacing expectations](https://www.bea.gov/news/2021/personal-income-and-outlays-february-2021)~~, the [bond yield](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX/) is going back up, and, yesterday, we failed to break resistance.

We're going down today. The only question is how much.

The good news is that there's a lot of reason to believe that the bleeding will slow in April.

All this month, we've been getting bombarded by terrible February market data. Here's a fun sample of what that data looks like:

|Report|Actual|Forecast|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Durable good orders|\-1.1%|\+0.4%|
|Retail sales|\-3%|\-0.4%|
|New home sales|775,000|870,000|
|Current account deficit|\-$188 billion|\-$186 billion|

*Jesus Christ.*

That sucks -- but a little bit of early March data has started trickling out, and - especially since the stimulus checks came out -- it's looking a lot better:

|Report|Actual|Forecast|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Initial jobless claims (March 20th)|684,000|735,000|
|Empire State Index (Survey)|17.4|15|
|IHS Markit Survey Services PMI|60|60.1|

Next week, we're going to start seeing that much nicer March data coming out, and that should reduce a bit of the panic.

At the end of April, the major tech companies will have their earnings reports. If we haven't started recovering by then, I'm betting that investors will snatch up low-price tech stocks showing strong earnings.

So, there's an end in sight. But, in the meantime, for today, I'm forecasting a retread of yesterday's high and lows, but with a darker ending.

Today will be a **red day** with a **NASDAQ high of 13,009** and a **low of 12,725.**

*See past predictions and visualizations* [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B)*.*"

It's not because I need the money anytime soon, but it's just pathetic that it'll take me several months just to break even (I hope) where I could have invested in other stocks that would've accumulated gains instead. I am looking at you, NIO."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I just enjoy the fact whenever I try to get into a stock recently it insta tanks. 🙃

Bought that one meme stock for a $20 swing trade and it instantly dove into the 4 halts.

Bought VIAC three days ago for long term and luckily was able to get out early as its dove 40 dollars. Plan to get in once the stock settles again.

Bought ARKK yesterday hoping to cost average my single share down that was about 150 and Im hoping that I dont bring it down with me. Im patient with the one share as its long term but the rest of the shares I want to offload once I hit the new cost average."

03/26/2021,stocks,Made some stupid picks to start out. Really want to rebalance my portfolio towards mostly broad market ETFs but my money is going to be tied up in  ARK and speculative stocks for a while...
03/26/2021,stocks,Gained 2 k in the lats 1 minute!! 6K baby!!

03/26/2021,stocks,Damn my portfolio has ADHD. Up down up down up down up down gotta keep moving cant stop down down down up
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's a pretty bullish sign that we bounced this hard off of the SPY 3850 support line yesterday. If we don't return to that level soon, that could be a sign that this corrective phase is finally concluding."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is NOT a shill post (I have no positions at the moment).  


But what the hell is going on with these Chinese educational stocks?"
03/26/2021,stocks,I've noticed that weed stocks are getting tons of very good news lately (like Mexico and NJ legalizing recreational use) but the stocks keep going down... am I missing something in all of this?

03/26/2021,stocks,"Closed under 1% in the red. Not gonna complain, we go again next week. 🙌"
03/26/2021,stocks,Baidu at $170 I think was a really good entry point? Down more than 50% from the top on fears that I just dont think will pan out regarding China in the end.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Only down 3.5% this week with a lot of great buying opportunities. I expected a real goosing after Tuesday and Wednesday but hey, not bad. Next week, here we come!"

03/26/2021,stocks,Destruction as usual the last two months
03/26/2021,stocks,Make your bloody mind up pre-market
03/26/2021,stocks,What the hell is going on with premarket for like the last three days? Everytime I go check its like half a percentagepoint in the green just to say SYKE and drop off a cliff into negative territory an hour before market open lol.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thoughts on shorting NIO at market open? I feel like closing their production lines is going to cause a sell-off with people getting scared, but the damage mightve been done pre-market"

03/26/2021,stocks,Am I really going to end the day +0.01% wtf
03/26/2021,stocks,Go TSM gooo
03/26/2021,stocks,"My best guess is that you likely saw margin blowouts while I had stepped away in more speculative names. Caused volatility to stir up, which put pressure on other stuff.

Once that stopped, volatility went back to sleep, which helped the averages recover.

I have no explanation for what happened after that. But for me, considering that BOTH tech indices ended up ending up a percent, with something like ARK still ending red despite that, still shows me there is 0 appetite for more speculative tech right now.

Edit: The Nasdaq-100 ended up finishing up for the week with the composite down. I would not be surprised if NDX takes over in another hypothetical rally. It'd be more like what was seen up to early fall last year."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Downloaded the 2020 annual report from Disney because i started my first DD.

Wanted to start with an ''easy balance sheet'' that covers ALL revenue and expenses in one table. Boy was i wrong, im drowning in numbers and different kind of sheets.

Reading an annual report, especially when english isnt your first language is quite difficult."

03/26/2021,stocks,US100 just took a nose dive. Today is gonna be one of them weird days I think
03/26/2021,stocks,I’m not sure. Do we talk about “alternative currency” around here?  Because today is the day to get in for the next run up to the new ATH. Well. Yesterday was really. But today ain’t bad either.
03/26/2021,stocks,"A yields close below 1.675 today opens the door to at, well at least IMO considering how sticky they’ve been, the low 1.6’s to upper 1.5’s over the next couple weeks.

With more favorable conditions for the S&P, that’d support a thrust higher in tech."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m learning about leveraged ETF’s. I’m not investing in one, but I’m observing a triple-leveraged ETF against its normal stock to learn. I understand how the triple leveraged ETF can lose more than 3x the amount of the normal stock, but right now in premarket, SOXX is -0.28% and SOXL (the 3x ETF) is +0.81%. How is this possible?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Was up 1.9% and now is down to 0.5%. Even when you know it’s coming it still sucks. Bleh.
03/26/2021,stocks,"The NASDAQ thought it could shake me from my SQQQ shares. Psych, bitch! I was waiting for you to get rejected off resistance."
03/26/2021,stocks,NASDAQ looking to retest resistance.
03/26/2021,stocks,Is it best to buy 10 shares of 1 stock or 1 share of multiple stocks? I’m new to investing and would like to get started.
03/26/2021,stocks,My 4 shares of AT&T are green. Feels good to be a winner

03/26/2021,stocks,Thought I bought the floor on FUBO but it's kept plunging
03/26/2021,stocks,"PLTR is very dead today. It started so well, now its just sitting there doing nothing"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Exited my BIDU position on the way down, and I'm glad I did. I'm sure it comes back up but the bottom was nowhere in sight. I might re-enter around 170, 120 dollars below my initial entry..."
03/26/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/26/2021,stocks,Verizon (VZ) has been treating me well the past couple of weeks :D
03/26/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the NASDAQ crashing right now, but I need it to either moon or crash just a little bit more because, with this weird, middle-of-the-road thing, I'm doing a terrible job predicting it."
03/26/2021,stocks,WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH....... its a shit show MF you get me its been a shit show for a while now.
03/26/2021,stocks,Nasdaq and Russell like hahahaha SIKE
03/26/2021,stocks,Shopify sub 1000 incoming
03/26/2021,stocks,The floor is lava.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Loading up on DIS and buying the dip, but it keeps dipping!"
03/26/2021,stocks,God damn this is insane rn. Any reason?
03/26/2021,stocks,Well. I’m glad I scraped a little profits off the top.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Anyone bullish on ABNB here? Seems like a bargain and although it's ""tech"" it is still a re-opening play, sort of a hybrid, like Disney.

I think 170 and below is great value but want to see if anyone here has an opinion as well."
03/26/2021,stocks,If I had more dry powder I’d add to my SQQQ position
03/26/2021,stocks,"Which share shall I buy? I want to spend money

Buy the dip people"
03/26/2021,stocks,So what has happened to discovery lol
03/26/2021,stocks,I will always sell all my stocks before every March. F.ing month didn’t end..
03/26/2021,stocks,"So, what is the difference between nasdaq and bitcoin if stocks from a 3-billion worth company falls %30 within a few days....."

03/26/2021,stocks,"One last test of resistance before we break for the weekend, fine whatever, NASDAQ."

03/26/2021,stocks,Advice please. Going to invest 25% of each paycheck of mine into either the VT or VTI. Which of these would you recommend?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Damn, ARK getting smoked.

Sorry Woodsters."
03/26/2021,stocks,"So many spikes, dips, AAPL leaking and then going sideways. I feel a need to finally say it... I clearly don't know crap about the market."
03/26/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Forecast Results**

Today, I failed to predict that, shortly after lunch, the entire stock market would plummet 1.3% in about an hour, only to skyrocket up 1.8% in the next hour.

In hindsight, it seems so obvious.

Thank you to /u/GoatTrade and /u/keldarepew for letting me know that I'd wildly misunderstood the inflation data today, though. I was going to buy puts at soon as the market opened, so I would've lost a bunch of money if it wasn't for you two. 

Please continue to let me know if my DD is wrong."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Keep seeing people this week talking about dot com type of nasdaq correction 

Guys. It’s already pretty much there. the difference now is this isn’t entirely made up of vaporware. A lot of these tech companies make billions of dollars in revenue per quarter. it isn’t dot com where everything was speculation. 

The stocks that are pure speculation, if you want to compare those to dot com, it’s much more appropriate. And those are getting destroyed. even companies that aren’t “vaporware” and actually have strong products, just with speculation baked in, like PLTR, are down like 30% or more. Pure speculation hit even worse. Measure the growth of SPACs beyond NAV and tons of those have lost 90% of their speculation based value 

So no, let’s not pretend the entire nasdaq is going to dot com, that just wouldn’t make any sense. Imagine apple crashing back to $30, yea right. Not gonna happen. 

We aren’t out of the woods yet but starting to feel like the worst is behind us."
03/26/2021,stocks,Buying a little everyday until Easter. Tech is the future. Believe in what you have.
03/26/2021,stocks,Honestly at this point it feels like dunking on ARKs. Somebody’s gotta be making money shorting them lol.
03/26/2021,stocks,"SPY: Green, QQQ: Green, My portfolio: the Red Sea"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m seeing a lot of panic. It’s not very healthy. Actually it might be healthy for the markets. The correction might not end until we make it through the 5 stages of grief, and I don’t see a lot of acceptance yet."
03/26/2021,stocks,You win this round bulls. Congratulations.
03/26/2021,stocks,The market is unpredictable. These threads are proof humans must make sense of random noise. And I’m certainly not immune.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Are we going to see a market wide rally next week? Alot of catalysts are in place. I feel like Bidens infrastructure speech might kick it off. Unless he hammers on the taxes. 
Nasdaq seems to refuse going below 13000 for long."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Dumb question.

I bought shares with settled cash. When I went to look at sell preview, it says it may result in a good faith violation. I understand what that it, but not why it would be a violation?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"WeWork to go public through SPAC BOWX in a deal valued at $9 billion, this was thought to be a $100 billion company a few years ago, be interesting to see if they were able to quietly clean things up, they remain one of the largest owners of NYC real estate but have massive debt obviously. This was one of Softbanks biggest bets, could still pan out now that they got rid of that wacky CEO."
03/26/2021,stocks,UNITY!!! He came out the gate swinging!!! Up 6%!!!!
03/26/2021,stocks,"Normally I hate chasing rallies, but just in case yesterday did mark our second bottom before the springtime meltup, I'm popping in a little FSLY and AMD here while they're still so cheap. I'm skeptical of this rally, but also cannot deny how hard we've bounced off of the SPY 3850 support line. That's a very bullish signal. As always, we shall see."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Don't know what to do with BIDU! 

Today, all the other big Chinese names doing well (BABA, JD, TCHY, etc) except BIDU. 

BIDU is down 25% in 1 week, and 32% in 1 month.

A part of that wants to DCA and average down a bit, but already invested quite a bit 

(holding 70 @ 260, -22% )."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I came so close to getting some SOXL yesterday on the dip, and it's up over 7% today. Missed the boat, and that sucks."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Wtf just happened to SHOP, just dropped 4% in a split second?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Nio looks like a steal atm. What do we think? More room to go down?
03/26/2021,stocks,$OSCR. This broken IPO is about to have the sell side quiet period end. I expect quite a few BUY reports in the next week or two. This is a good risk reward trade. Shares could quickly rebound to $30. Not a long term hold though. I am buying May $25 calls.
03/26/2021,stocks,Scored Roku under 300...I’m satisfied with that
03/26/2021,stocks,So I'm considering getting into some day trading. What are some of your favorite lower priced stocks that you guys are day trading? Something that you see a fairly consistent up and down on.
03/26/2021,stocks,Bought AAPL calls for may 21st pretty cheap right now
03/26/2021,stocks,Any AMD predictions for the next 2 months? Will it bounce or go deeper?
03/26/2021,stocks,These 2 percent red days are starting to add up. Now down 5 percent for the year after being up 20 percent back in February. Sigh.
03/26/2021,stocks,Damn am I really about to load up on DKNG again?
03/26/2021,stocks,Bought some Tesla shares after 2 months of thinking long and hard :)
03/26/2021,stocks,"Can someone explain why NIO chart is always the same as Tesla?

NIO is in a different country for now etc, different battery style etc"
03/26/2021,stocks,Semis doing so well today.
03/26/2021,stocks,At one point DIS was far and away my best position. Now it's dragging my entire portfolio down. :$
03/26/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/26/2021,stocks,QQQ has finally found some resistance. Question is whether it'll hold. What even caused it to fall so far?
03/26/2021,stocks,Monday is gonna be green though. Don’t sell anything and wait til the end of the day to buy.
03/26/2021,stocks,You know I've been asking this question for the past month : WHEN WILL THIS END

03/26/2021,stocks,Damn. NASDAQ going to try to break out again?

03/26/2021,stocks,"Nice, looks like I can eat this weekend after all 😎


^^/s"
03/26/2021,stocks,Does anybody think it’s possible a large hedge fund buys a bunch of otm calls expiring today in the last 10 minutes for dirt cheap then buys a large position in those companies to make a quick buck.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Perfect max pain close on QQQ. I bought 0DTE calls on the last dip but sold them too early, could have closed for 1000% if held until close."
03/26/2021,stocks,Happy Friday everybody. Do you guys think it’s a good strategy to buy puts on a stock that shot up that day? From my experience when I own a stock that shoots up one day the next day it pulls back some. Has anyone else tried this? What do you guys think? All input is welcome.

This news was released this morning: $WKEY WISeKey CEO, Carlos Creus Moreira To Appear On Benzinga's 'Power Hour' At 1:30 p.m. EDT

Resistance - 16.60 
Support - 13.50

Watch for an oversold bounce this morning around market open. It should be a good time to buy IF it follows the pattern it's had all week which is to dip during open, and then peak around 12:30 market time. Yesterday it went from 13.60 to 16 during that time and would have made a great little scalp. 

As far as the fundamentals go, the patent that's used for WISeKey's NFT technology was established back in 2015, before any of us had even heard of NFT or WISeKey.

I'm looking to invest in something that will bring in predictable monthly recurring dividend. I'm happy to start small and keep increasing investment over time.

Therefore, I've thrown some money into Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF fund, as from what I can tell it provides a decent regular monthly dividend.

My ultimate question is: how much risk does this fund hold in general? I mean, I understand that all stock trading carries risk to varying extents compared to safe investments like a savings account. I guess I'm asking, would I be an absolute muppet to consider putting $200/m into Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF over a period of a few years?

Was it 480 even one month ago?

For a stock that already won the past, present, and future of streaming and smart TVs, turning profits before expected because they were spending so much expanding in terms of streaming platforms (nflx, disney, even hbo, aka all of them), advertising platform, and smart TVs, and already announced better than expected 2021 results in a year where nobody watched the Superbowl on TV because they were all streaming.

It's easy to search here for all the good DD.

I'll add until it hits zero, nobody can tell me this makes sense. Why would anyone even consider Netflix over Roku?

Also, just because Roku makes money off Netflix and does more than just content creation, yes they are comparable if you can run a Google search.

03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm here just thinking about the perfect nightmare scenario for Tech hOlders:

* Tech never rebounds, and instead bleeds slowly or stays flat over the next 10 years, due to demand and growth not keeping up with crazy evaluations from 2020. Clean Energy takes longer to grab hold. Apple is so big it has reached full market saturation.
* At the same time, the indices show slow steady growth, but only at 2-3% a year. at the same time, inflation increases at eats the gains away.
* At the same time, taxes have been hiked to help pay off the stimmy debts, so people are making effectively less.

Its 2031, the nasdaq is at 13,000. Apple is at 120. Your taxes have increased by 5-10%. Your dreams of early retirement are gone.

Everyone watches their retirement and investment accounts slowly increase based on savings only, while they watch the price of goods increase and the government taking more and more out of their paychecks.

Meet Jerry, former WSB member. he sacrifices daily to sock away 500 a month for retirement, which is less because taxes went up and a gallon of milk at aldis is 6 bucks now. He stares at his Tesla Share Price of 600."

I'm holding all my losses on AAPL and even ARKQ, but PLTR, XBI and ICLN, I got out a while ago. They've continued to go down. I bought boring stuff in other sectors, like XLB for materials, XAR for defense and ACGL for finance (avoided ETF's for finance cause they all shot up so quickly and landed on ACGL). All of them have gone up since then and I feel secure enough in them to know in the long run, even if there's a pullback, they'll steadily go up."

that's why I keep re-iterating to be prepared for and expect a drop of tech stocks down to slightly above pre-covid levels, but everyone keeps mocking me like I'm nuts. I think its perfectly reasonable given the run up and the continued macro run up the past 10 years.

I expect AAPL down to \~90-95, TSLA down to \~225, NIO down in the upper teens, PLTR mid teens.

Subtract out the euphoric run up post covid and draw the line from prior to March to now and its as reasonable increase. NOT EVEN a correction, just a reasonable increase.

blows my mind that people don't consider this from a macro perspective. live in the past 20 years not the past 9 months. People are calling me a ""doomer bear"" but my valuation is actually doesn't even consider a correction!"

03/26/2021,stocks,Anything under 80 is a good buy IMO. I’m long term though.
03/26/2021,stocks,Wait how are you down 5% today? Every index is green.
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah. I got in at 50. It's been rough for me. Really regret not selling when I was in the green for a bit. I do see potential in the next couple years for nio though.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, the open interest at 395 on SPY was insane, reckon the MM's where buying a shit ton of calls by bears who were selling covered calls thinking the market was going to tank into close. All the needed to do was initiate a pump on AAPL towards the close, wait for shorts to cover and puts to burn and voila -  Goldman has another $100M trading day"
03/26/2021,stocks,How does a call option go 1000% up with 0DTE? I mean even if it shoots up like crazy that doesn’t sound possible. Care to explain?
03/26/2021,stocks,"There's basically two traders. Swing traders like you're describing and momentum traders, which would bet that stock keeps rising.

You're probably going to get burnt though, I wouldn't recommend."
03/26/2021,stocks,Bb drops like a meme but climbs like a value stock. The worst of both worlds.
03/26/2021,stocks,BB isn't a meme stock. It was caught up in the AMC/GME fiasco but it's a good investment from the DD I've done on it.
03/26/2021,stocks,Agreed. I just picked up some of this last week and am feeling god about that.

03/26/2021,stocks,Not necessarily. Devils in the details. A growing economy with low rates could still support equities despite a tax hike.
03/26/2021,stocks,Lots of risks that haven't been baked in yet

03/26/2021,stocks,Why would that be stupid?  You’ll be diversified through VTI and VOO and will take advantage of any stock market growth that Tech leads through QQQ (which is bound to happen again).  Some may argue that there’s too much overlap between VTI and VOO to warrant different ETFs but I don’t think you’ll regret it in the long run.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you are sure about holding for 10 years, almost 99% sure you are safe. Go for it!"
03/26/2021,stocks,My consensus - you need to diversify your holdings.

03/26/2021,stocks,No thank you!
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you sell everything, maybe the stock market will finally go somewhere. Somebody obviously caused the market to go down, and it wasn't me"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Absolutely not. Just be patient. This stock is so oversold despite nothing fundamental to the business actually changing. Nio will ride high again, sooner than later."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Literally couldn't be a worse time to sell

They're ruining my portfolio right now without any significant reason, but I know if I hold then they'll come back and then some"

03/26/2021,stocks,Nestle
03/26/2021,stocks,You want to invest... In water? Just buy some barrels I guess. They can't get too old
03/26/2021,stocks,"On the radar but honestly I'm probably holding off on adding at this level. Does some like there is a couple of legit reasons for this dip:

- Could still be aftershock on the convertible debt issuance last week that left a sour taste in current shareholders mouth
- Canada added protection for horse racing on its single-wager on its legislation its trying to push through, which could mean less than originally anticipated revenue from Canadian single wagering

Still love DKNG long term, but this dip feels justified"
03/26/2021,stocks,I think bull trap before sell off during power hour. Lube up boys.
03/26/2021,stocks,"this sub hates whatever has been red for a while, and loves whatever is green right now. it doesn't matter what the stock is. crsr praise was every other comment during the first rally from $16 to $52."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Couldn't agree more. We're already grinding against this level of resistance again. It'll likely be a slow decline for the rest of the day, though likely nothing major.

I'm curious how the final few days of March/Q1 will play out next week. Think we'll retest SPY 3850?"
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm gonna buy dips and hold. I can't see tech NOT going back up.
03/26/2021,stocks,"ARK G, K and F are my only net losses at this point.  I haven't sold though, so the losses are still unrealized.  I bought into the hype right at the end.

* ARKG: -20.23%
* ARKK: -20.82%
* ARKF: -21.59%

I got into a lot of the other tech stocks early enough that I'm not actually at a loss, just a loss off the highs from January."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Down around 1.2% overall, 50% my portfolio is S&P and World Market. All my individual stocks are tech apart from McDonald’s and Nike. Got no cash free atm to average down which is what I was doing, I plan to hold most until the next tax year where I will start taking profits as I’ll be looking towards a deposit for a mortgage.

Will likely hold smaller positions in most of the big tech companies as they’ll only grow over the next decade."
03/26/2021,stocks,Im down 3.2% overall but I did cash out a couple of weeks ago and bought back in Wednesday ..thought I timed the dip perfectly haha. I'm still up overall as this is all money earned from the first gamestop rush.
03/26/2021,stocks,I've been averaging down so made some money back. Currently down 3.5k$ on a 30k portfolio.
03/26/2021,stocks,I wanted to increase my position this morning and waited around all day for a dip that never came. Oh well! Still a good deal after today’s run IMO
03/26/2021,stocks,"When a big sub like WSB all concentrate on a tiny stock, yes they can move it. But they couldn't move a bigger one, and surely not the whole market."
03/26/2021,stocks,none whatsoever
03/26/2021,stocks,Zero
03/26/2021,stocks,I am excited for their 3rd annual paper trading contest. Should really clean up that sub!

03/26/2021,stocks,"Take a look at their dividend history. It's not as predictable as it may seem at first glance, although it did pretty well through last year's crash compared to others.

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/qyld/dividend-history

QYLD is great and a very safe stock overall, but you're missing out on some possible growth while also throwing all your chips on the NASDAQ. Consider throwing 10% into DIA or SPY. A couple hundred a month is a good place to start."
03/26/2021,stocks,"In the same boat, really want to buy the dip in hopes that in the long term they expand and become a powerhouse however the news right now is somehow bad even though they have a new BOD member, 2 power plants being built for 2022 and teaming up with alpine. however because the market is down so bad right now the stock just won't increase until the market shifts."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ya, you could if there's a seller, I'm pretty sure. You'd probably be getting pennies per share though
Edit: there's a very big gap between its current price and 29. Makes me think there's more to the story"
03/26/2021,stocks,Depends on what you think will happen to the stock's price....
03/26/2021,stocks,Look at the options chains.  Usually a whole range of strike prices available.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Wow, what a terrible idea"
03/26/2021,stocks,Why would you sell at 22% loss? That's an insane loss to eat for no reason other than impatience. Just relax and wait.
03/26/2021,stocks,I would put them in spy instead of AAPL personally
03/26/2021,stocks,really. baba didn't teach you not to mess with Chinese ecommerce stocks?
03/26/2021,stocks,It’s down to 190..
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think this is a bad sell point. NIO is literally on the resistance right now, i think there is a good chance of a bounce... unless it breaks the support... check the blue line: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO"
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm down on NIO as well and am not going to try to get cute with it.  I think that when it rebounds it's going to happen quickly.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Do what makes sense to you. I really wanted to sell in the past two months. The bad news keep accumulating for NIO, but people kept telling me it'll bounce back soon. Should have just followed my gut feeling, even if it's risky. At this point, it might be too late? I really don't know what to think of NIO anymore."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Why do people sell at a loss anytime a dip comes? Nio has a bright future, just hang tight for a while."
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, that's a terrible idea. Why lock in a 35% loss when you can just be patient and make it up later this year?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Nio is down so much because of a recent string of bad news around China and the chip shortage, on top of the tech dump

It's oversold and will very likely spring back"
03/26/2021,stocks,Not diversified enough and do more dd
03/26/2021,stocks,"Buy the dips for companies you believe in; in 6 months you’ll be glad you did.

Edit; and fucking hodl"
03/26/2021,stocks,"My suggestion is to hold these, but your future weekly deposits maybe go for something more solid like VOO. Your portfolio is too risky imo, you need more solid bases."

03/26/2021,stocks,No idea because market is green. My calls 4/16 are fucked! Think I should continue holding?
03/26/2021,stocks,Cause they’re overvalued as fuck. Just look at their competition in flutter. 50 dollars seems like a fair valuation for them rn. It’ll drop close to that once March madness is over. Let’s not forget they were at 54 not even a month ago
03/26/2021,stocks,I think GNOG is a better value.
03/26/2021,stocks,Fractionals. Or ETF
03/26/2021,stocks,Are you on Robinhood? Get the fuck off Robinhood
03/26/2021,stocks,Fractional shares are fine. They have the same value as normal shares do. The only difference is that you can't trade fractional shares outside regular trading hours
03/26/2021,stocks,"fractional shares are fine, I do it for stocks like AMZN and ETFs but i prefer having a full share. Idk it just bugs me owning a piece."
03/26/2021,stocks,Wouldn't it be a conglomerate?
03/26/2021,stocks,"ARK would be a good vehicle to swing trade now, if only I knew how to execute it without shooting myself on the foot repeatedly.

I heard your theory, but why would the market go after Cathie specifically and how would she have any impact on the tech sector? I believe her stuff is overvalued collection, but shouldn’t that be limited to the overhyped stuff like Teslas and TDOCs. Aapl and Amzn are sinking as wel and she isn’t holding those."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Brace for the deadcat bounce like we had beginning of March...

03/26/2021,stocks,"You realize it's still up 230% over the past year right? (Even after going down 30%). That's not sustainable, at some point it has to revert back to the mean"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I mean if you’re down 30% on it at some point you got to take losses.

On the plus side I’ve day traded the hell out of it like 6 times since the end of February. Hold and we win my ass.
03/26/2021,stocks,A wizard did it.
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm in the same situation and will be going with VTI. As tempting as it is to go with QQQ I decided that sorta defeats the point since it's *so* heavy in tech (as are the ARK funds).

83% when J. Powell isn't talking. He screws me up.

*EDIT: Possibly about to get a little lower today.*"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Another user pointed that out.

Overall inflation is above expectations, but most media outlets seem to be reporting inflation excluding food and energy, which is below expectations. So that part might not be an issue.

Admittedly a little less confident now that I see how that's being spun."

03/26/2021,stocks,I think ppl mock you because you change your predictions every week.  I think that any one  of us can do that and eventually be right.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I partially agree, but, correct me if I’m off here: 

During the pandemic we essentially saw the markets crash UP off the back of the feds monetary policy. We printed what, like 20-25% of all money in circulation? asset prices adjust for this, their “value” may not have changed much, but the units they’re measured in have been diluted 

In my opinion, that’s going to have a lasting impact on pricing. AAPL @ $100 pre pandemic is a different value than AAPL at $100 post-money printing extravaganza.  

That’s why im thinking when evaluating this, I should leave a bit of a cushion above the levels i contrast with pre-pandemic, because the pre-pandemic levels aren’t scaled for the amount of $ in circulation now 

Which is why I think we’re nearing the bottom of the pit here. I could definitely see more pain here, but not as bad as what we’ve already seen. Just the way I’m looking at things"
03/26/2021,stocks,"What about the Dow Jones though, isn't that pretty much now fully recovered to pre-COVID and at ATH? I keep looking at most of the value stocks and they are either at or higher than pre-covid prices."
03/26/2021,stocks,So are you piling up cash to grab em at those prices then?
03/26/2021,stocks,I’m holding what I have and buying dips at prices I think are bargains. There are a ton of great deals right now.
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah I’m going to hold my SQQQ until Tuesday to confirm the breakout and then stop trying to play the indexes. I got greedy and the market is punishing me for it.
03/26/2021,stocks,Its gunna cause things to be more expensive.. sounds bullish to me. Companies report higher earnings.. employees (likely) make less. The market loves that shit.. soo.. Could be green.. if its red.. I'll be buying.
03/26/2021,stocks,The corporate tax is basically guaranteed imo
03/26/2021,stocks,Is that the 35% bernie proposed?
03/26/2021,stocks,"No. Not same day, and yes under 25k.
Bought Wednesday and want to sell yesterday or today. But keep getting the GFV warning."
03/26/2021,stocks,"If everything keeps swinging the way that it has these last few months, we'll get another chance on a dip next week."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I saw that it was above 40 before the Feb/March shenanigans, I was thinking of grabbing some around 30 and holding until we got back up to 40+, assuming the markets stabilize soon and we start going up consistently."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm down on all my tech, EV, green energy and health stocks, which make up the majority of a lot of people's portfolios

That's why so many say they are down"
03/26/2021,stocks,Not 5 percent sorry I was down 1.9 percent today but I was now down 5 percent for the year
03/26/2021,stocks,Tesla and nio combined make up 20 percent of my portfolio. That's why
03/26/2021,stocks,Same. My portfolio has erectile dysfunction.
03/26/2021,stocks,It's been falling even when bond yields are falling. There's no longer a strong correlation between the 2
03/26/2021,stocks,So many stocks on sale... Wonder if I should buy now or wait til next week.
03/26/2021,stocks,"23 yo male, subscribe to both p+ and disc+"
03/26/2021,stocks,ORCL
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, i have friends that work there, and bought in last year. It has been nothing but good to me. It should be fun watching what happens after the split."
03/26/2021,stocks,"That and they are one of the few innovative tech companies left in Canada, which means they have an almost endless stream of tax incentives and government support to be successful. I've liked them for a long time too."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I would be flexing, but my portfolio lost 10% last Friday, another 11% Monday, and 13% Tuesday. In two weeks my portfolio was down 35% from the high March 12th."
03/26/2021,stocks,But it’s usually the retaliation companies take. When they realize they are getting taxed more they threaten to move stuff out of the states and to cut jobs. This causes panic and people sell. Not even the fact that their profit is cut. It’s the panic after. Has there ever been a corporate tax hike that affected the stock market positively? Best case scenario is we trade flat right?
03/26/2021,stocks,100% GME
03/26/2021,stocks,"They're in much better shape than hot growthy names. 

Consolidating is better than just getting absolutely dumped and it is likely that mid-February-March was the hot growthy names' turn to get blown up (like it was FAANG's turn in early fall) and then start consolidating instead of being able to rebound fast."
03/26/2021,stocks,Apparently its mainly Chinese education companies- so dumb
03/26/2021,stocks,I think both are undervalued in an overvalued market. Both have reasonable PEs
03/26/2021,stocks,"^ i think you're right.  it kinda stabilized at $45 after hitting $43.
$AI has been doing the same thing: long ass slide down to $65 after ipoing at $100
$affirm  same story as well.  slideeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

they say timing is everything but these are crazy times"
03/26/2021,stocks,How can you say that when it's been on a steady decline all week?
03/26/2021,stocks,5 year olds who can get their parents to buy them anything if they annoy them enough
03/26/2021,stocks,It seems to drop when there's positive news or bad news. I miss the days when it actually overperformed the market.
03/26/2021,stocks,All world ETF
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks, that's very helpful."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ouch, yeah that's rough. I'm down 13% overall which in grand scheme of things isn't so bad but I'm expecting a lot of tailwinds ahead going through to the summer as well. Market sentiment for growth/high PE tech stocks doesn't look too great unfortunately."
03/26/2021,stocks,"My plan is to put down a DP for a mortgage next year as well. In hindsight, maybe it wasn't the brightest idea to take on all this risk but now this is the hand I am dealt with currently. Got caught up with all the gains that has happened last year"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I hit an old buy limit the other day that I forgot about on AMD, so I guess I like the price as well."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I agree that those four seem a little too good to pass up. Though im still not convinced we are at the bottom yet. I wanna wait before i jump in. 

Im waiting to see what we do when we retest the low from beginning of march.

Plus the nasdaq us still 300 points from an official correction"
03/26/2021,stocks,welli just bought some @ 25.44 easily. easy 29-25.44 profit i guess?
03/26/2021,stocks,So is there less gain by choosing a strike price that gives the option a better chance of expiring itm? Like is there any downside to picking a very close strike price?
03/26/2021,stocks,Good thing I'm not doing that
03/26/2021,stocks,"THis. I am also down on my ARKG (12%), just going to be patient. If it takes a year for it to go back green, then so be it."
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm not I'm just lamenting buying at the top
03/26/2021,stocks,What if it he keeps losing and it drops to 50% loss?  I will never understand why people don't cut their losses lately.
03/26/2021,stocks,Bidu not Ecom
03/26/2021,stocks,What do you mean?
03/26/2021,stocks,Thinking of jumping in. Pump and dump.
03/26/2021,stocks,No I wasn’t.
03/26/2021,stocks,XD
03/26/2021,stocks,A very very heavy burtation tonight.
03/26/2021,stocks,How do you justify a PE of 120 in this industry
03/26/2021,stocks,Why do lots of people say to get off Robinhood?
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol no not at all
03/26/2021,stocks,Not sure I fully understand let’s say I automate about $200 per month so after 3-4 months would I have a full share or three fractional shares? My understanding is 3 fractional shares. Those I wouldn’t be able to trade after closing but if I bought one full stock I could trade that correct?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Search Reddit about Roku, on this sub there is quality DD

And they are a top choice of investors if you listen to podcasts, I would never use Reddit as my primary source"
03/26/2021,stocks,Amazon and Apple both make a far superior product than what Roku is offering. It's crazy they got as high as they did.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don’t think you understand the stock market. If you believe a stock is worth $x and it goes below x, you just keep buying. Why would you sell if a stock goes down in price purely due to market sentiment? That makes no sense.

That’s why it’s so important to do proper DD, prepare DCF’s and determine a price target. Because if you don’t, how they hell would you know if a specific price is good value or not. You’ll end up selling and the lowest and buying and the highest point"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Right. It's just the entitlement that annoys me. Like, yeah...stocks go down sometimes too. If you can't accept that risk you have no business being in the market. Go stick your money in a savings account."
03/26/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes that’s how I’m leaning too. I think the big banks will do well this year with restrictions on their buybacks lifting, economy opening up etc so probably won’t go QQQ"
03/26/2021,stocks,Yep. SSO is good too! Was considering that instead of VOO myself too
03/26/2021,stocks,🤷‍♂️
03/26/2021,stocks,What? He boosted the market the last two times
03/26/2021,stocks,"Part of it is Europe going back into lockdown.

This could hammer the value play portion I laid out in my DD, but this should have no bearing on the Next Tesla portion of that same DD."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yep. I'd prefer 145
03/26/2021,stocks,Damn that's awesome - hope you're wrong today tho lol!
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks for pointing that out. Fed strips out food and energy. Oil dropped 4% past week so another sign that inflation won’t stick.
03/26/2021,stocks,I read the feb report it looks like it went down across the board only offset by highly volatile energy price movements. Which makes sense.
03/26/2021,stocks,The rest still applies but it might cause the bonds to ease up again. Will need to look at their reaction to it.
03/26/2021,stocks,Guess what 75% is in.
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's great, I'm invested solely because of the EV potential, but anything along the way that bumps its value is amazing.
What do you mean by price targets? Who's targets are they?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Nah because even the S&P 500 is up 56% the last year! I would be surprised if you were almost in negative and didn't start in the last 5 months. You should probably rethink your strategy
03/26/2021,stocks,Everything non-tech has been super expensive for the past few months. Are we supposed to be buying in at the top now?
03/26/2021,stocks,Because tEcH is not the future. Logs are! Buy logs!
03/26/2021,stocks,So they are issuing more shares? What is the benefit of this for the company?
03/26/2021,stocks,Damnit. You win. Don't spend it all at once.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Dow is higher than pre-covid, but they companies actually produce sizeable product, so their valuations are closer to reality now and in the next few years than tech stocks are closer to their future growth projections in the next 5-10 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,"exhausted about 50% of it DCA down, plan is to spread the last 50%, little each week."
03/26/2021,stocks,Starting to look like the nasdaq has some real resistance at around 13000
03/26/2021,stocks,"In fact I'd say the possibility of a tax hike happening became a reality several weeks ago (if you think it's a problem, thank the firing squad Shafer led).

I do not know if you're going to see a reaction off taxes or infrastructure (given that infrastructure has already ran up quite a bit). I'm leaning toward up in the end for next week but 4k might still be a fight for the S&P."
03/26/2021,stocks,"If its webull your trade takes t+2 for you to be able to sell... so today you should be able to sell it once market opens. 

Its stupid but i think it prevents day trading."
03/26/2021,stocks,I bought heavy into BB at $10. It's pulling my whole portfolio down. The rest are either recovering or trading sideways.
03/26/2021,stocks,Might as well just keep putting more on them but the chip shortage is hurting them and Corsair big.  However TSLA might defend the best against tax hikes among nasdaq100.
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, the correlation will remain between the two until yields settle down. Just because the market is capable of falling even when yields decline doesn't mean the market is done caring about yields. Inflation will remain a boogeyman for this market for the remainder of the economic recovery."
03/26/2021,stocks,Correlation remains when there are *sudden* movements in bond yields.  Gradual movements have not shifted it as much.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you buy now, you're trying to catch a falling knife. Could pay out very well, but it's a double edged sword. You'd be betting that the market will turn around next week"
03/26/2021,stocks,"are you also subscribed to disney plus, hulu, netflix, hbomax?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah. At its current price I think it's a good long-term entry point. Could drop even lower over this correction period. Yesterday it dropped all the way to almost $9.
03/26/2021,stocks,Sounds like you may need to diversify? I’m only down 3% the last two weeks.
03/26/2021,stocks,you sound like an unoriginal white guy smh
03/26/2021,stocks,"Probably would be a short lived one time event. Correction that would be a buying opportunity if overall economy is growing and rates are low. Big public Companies have so many levers to pull with NOLs, income allocations, depreciation write offs none of these companies pay close to the headline rate of 21%. Some studies indicate incremental increases over time have little or no impact on LT equity prices."
03/26/2021,stocks,So buy them?
03/26/2021,stocks,Chinese education companies are always a good investment. Chinese parents take their children's educations *very* seriously.

03/26/2021,stocks,You're welcome
03/26/2021,stocks,Buy land with water on it or build yourself a pond or lake. You'll have way more storage capacity than barrels. Plus you can actually do stuff with it like fish or swim
03/26/2021,stocks,"If long term, time in the market beats timing it. Those prices are good entry points and you can always average down."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It closes in the 2nd half of 2021. If you're comfortable with waiting that long, then it seems like a done-deal"
03/26/2021,stocks,">Like is there any downside to picking a very close strike price?

Costs more in premium which in turn makes your break even price higher. Also the fact that, by law, the intrinsic value must be included in the option price so you're not necessarily buying any extra value."
03/26/2021,stocks,Only that it costs more per contract
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, don’t. Patience :)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Exactly. Everyone has to bag hold from time to time, especially when the market is going through a correction. I own a bunch of Nio in the $50s. It sucks, but it's not my first time a position has turned on me, and it won't be the last. I'm ignoring that position, and focusing on how I can snag the best deals elsewhere while we're going through all this volatility."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Don't fret. Everybody makes that mistake from time to time. Next time you find a stock you like, add it to your watch list and wait for a pullback."
03/26/2021,stocks,How much have you lost so far?
03/26/2021,stocks,I BLAME YOU FOR THIS
03/26/2021,stocks,What does that mean?
03/26/2021,stocks,Expansion.  They are only operating in 2 states at the moment but are going to be adding to that this year.
03/26/2021,stocks,Because they unilaterally decide when you can and can't buy/sell stock.
03/26/2021,stocks,Because they are a scum of a company. You don’t even own the shares you buy on Robinhood.
03/26/2021,stocks,It's additive
03/26/2021,stocks,"The fractional shares add up. So if you buy 0.3 shares and 0.8 shares at 2 different times, you have 1.1 shares. You'd be able to trade that 1 share after hours, but you wouldn't be able to trade the 0.1 shares"
03/26/2021,stocks,I'll add that Googles new Chromecast with GTV is better too IMO.  That doesn't even factor in LG and Samsung putting tons of money into their own OS system.
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah I agree
03/26/2021,stocks,"No I do. 

You must be one of those constantly doubled. Down on SKLZ and down 40%."
03/26/2021,stocks,Artistic or autistic?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, unlike JPow, Biden will project the same confidence in the economic recovery without presenting a fear of raising interest rates.  Taxes are another issue, of course.  How the market will react, I don't know."
03/26/2021,stocks,Even better
03/26/2021,stocks,"Starting to look like I will be!

I think misunderstanding that inflation data screwed me up."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, you're right -- I looked at the overall numbers. Bloomberg and other sources seem to be reporting the PCE without food and energy, though, so it looks like that's going to be the official story."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m very curious to see Apple’s take on the EV market too, if they do decide to enter into it... right now my understanding is that they’re just fiddling with the idea. 

As for the price targets, those are just potential goals financial analysts have been publicly posting throughout. You can find them on google under search phrases like “AAPL price target” and you’ll see several price listings conducted by multiple analysts. AAPL just so happens to have an average of $150 price target, with a high of $170 in its bull case by the end of the year (so analysts effectively predicting that Apple’s stock price will rise to that price by end of 2021)."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Analysts & brokers publish price targets, what price they think the stock is going to be at a year from now & why. That’s the only convo where overweight is a good thing lol."
03/26/2021,stocks,Elaborate for me
03/26/2021,stocks,"Tech is 100% the future, I own tech for like 9 years. I have made a killing on it in a face ripping bull market, I bought a house with it.. I also want to keep making a killing and watching my tech double in 12 months is alarming at best. I embrace healthy pull backs and cooling off periods."
03/26/2021,stocks,Money. Companies can sell additional stock to fuel growth or retire debts if they believe their stock is overvalued currently.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yep, it's an attempt to raise more capital. If the share price goes up after the initial dip, the company will have more money to expand operations, pay off debt etc."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Too late, cashed out bought a lambo"
03/26/2021,stocks,"For sure, it got rejected twice today until the run up into close."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Appreciate the help. That kinda sucks, but I’ll just learn to hold for at least 2 days I guess?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Parents subscribe to Hbomax and netflix, roommate has Hulu no ads w/ the Disney+ espn bundle, also have Amazon prime"
03/26/2021,stocks,"We have YoutubeTV, Disney+, and Peacock."
03/26/2021,stocks,Well I’m not worried about the market long term but I do believe the tax hike would firmly put us in a bear market and growth would slow until republicans are back in control.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Pick your favorite one or two and add. 

I think I've been pretty open about my opinion of what's likely going to happen in April, if you do see a rally occur. But it's not an endorsement to do anything. I assume we are all adults, and we can make our own decisions."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Meanwhile we’re creating Instagram for kids. 

China will have a generation of scientists and engineers to compete against our  “influencers”. 

Future memes will be epic though."
03/26/2021,stocks,So dumb because I missed that news- guess the big one IPO’d yesterday and they all took off today.
03/26/2021,stocks,Unfortunately i know that  just a little gun shy after the last 2 months
03/26/2021,stocks,"didnt know it was that far away but i did initially invest with the idea of holding for 2 years. the post i read mentioned it may reach $40's in 2022. but i guess $29 is the ceiling, still cool."
03/26/2021,stocks,Hadn’t  considered the extra value part. Good point thanks
03/26/2021,stocks,I haven't lost anything so far. 👍
03/26/2021,stocks,Source?
03/26/2021,stocks,Por que no los dos?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't think the higher taxes are baked in yet

I believe we are ready to get bullish BUT, I also believe we could see the market take a big hiccup if the tax situation is not handled with kid gloves

Biden is a corporate democrat, but he's under a lot of pressure to appear like he's going to make some changes. I think he absolutely will raise the corporate tax rate"
03/26/2021,stocks,I believe alot of economists agree its a more stable metric to draw conclusions from. I would need to research it further though.
03/26/2021,stocks,"150 would be incredible, I can believe it too, whenever it drops below 120 it always springs right back up. I read this article before buying, it has a lot of evidence that apple is all in on EVs https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/#apples_auto-related_domains"
03/26/2021,stocks,"On what? If you're underperforming the index, why not just invest in the index?"
03/26/2021,stocks,I cashed out too. Bought a burger. Single patty. No cheese. No fries.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I feel like the market is on a knifes edge atm. I thought it was gonna tank, but at the same time i feel like it could go on a major breakout. Decided to put my money in some broad etfs for a bit untill i can better judge the current sentiment."
03/26/2021,stocks,If you used settled cash thought i think you dont have to wait i thought. But if you use buying power or sell a stock then buy you have to wait before selling again. Its annoying and has made me hold this week when i wanted to rebalance a few things
03/26/2021,stocks,This guy streams
03/26/2021,stocks,"And you dont see the problem? You could be subsribed to all of them, but nobody has time to watch all these. Especially Discovery when netflix makes the same crap as them."
03/26/2021,stocks,Officially an owner of all FAANG stocks now. Will check back in 20 years and see if it was a good decision.
03/26/2021,stocks,LOL- agreed. We withdrew our youngest From our school district last summer because of their wishy-washy Covid stuff and I didnt want her stuck doing “virtual school” for most of the year. Realizing how much she hasn’t been learning at her highly rated school makes me totally agree that our education system sucks! She told me yesterday she wants to stay in mama’s school because we have three day weekends and half days all the time. But like you said our future Memes are going to be awesome
03/26/2021,stocks,It seems like it's trading far below what it should be. I'd say you should be able to sell them off for a little under 29 soon enough. It's only a matter of time before whales jump on the opportunity to make 10%. Very good find though.
03/26/2021,stocks,"here's one 
https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Fertitta-s-Golden-Nugget-Online-Gaming-reports-16048145.php

also their loss last year was because of costs associated with an SPAC merger."
03/26/2021,stocks,Totally agree. The Biden stimulus could be priced in or it could fuel a melt-up. Same with the infrastructure plan. That said I feel like we’re running out of tricks to keep stimulating an economy and market just to avoid facing reality. I only have a small position in SQQQ but if things go south next week a little could go a long way.
03/26/2021,stocks,That’s what I thought as well. Settled cash = trade when you want. (Under 3 per 5 day rolling period) Perhaps they just show the warning under two days either way? It does say “may result” in a violation. Might just have to test that theory out of it doesn’t clear today.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I disagree that that is a problem, its not about watching everything on each platform its about having ACCESS to what you want to have access to.  Discovery makes even shittier and more desperate reality television than netflix thats why i need it."

03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/26/2021,stocks,Personally i think the market has trouble assessing just how much certain companies have benefitted from this pandemic. Once the damage becomes clearer and companies stop beeing propped up the surviving companies will be in domination positions. All these mini corrections might end up removing the weeds from the garden so to speak. I think a meltup next week is in the cards for sure. But at this point im gonna just play safe and ride it out. I don’t have a strong enough confidence interval on my thesis to solely play on it. Having diversification here seems like the only solid play i can make atm. The biden speech is what i will be looking out for most as market mover. Either he pushes us into exuberance on dreams of a strong economic future or he slam dunks the market with the taxes.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I did some reading on this the other day actually cause i was pissed i couldn't close a position. 

From what ive read some people said their accounts have never had issues and they violate it all the time... others say they have its restricted them where they dont get instant buying power now. 

So kinda up to you. If its an emergency id say go for it... you get two slaps on wrist first. If you can wait id just wait. 

Webulls time for things is kinda goofy. Check now and check around 930am"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Should only be an issue if you used unsettled funds. Possible you used a mix of settled/unsettled which is considered unsettled. I'd call your broker to clarify.

The 3 day trades per 5 days doesn’t apply here"
03/26/2021,stocks,go buy cable then
03/26/2021,stocks,"Again, I agree with you here. Things like lifting the eviction moratoriums are going to be market movers. I’m literally gambling by taking a bearish position but I also know when to fold. We’ll see what happens, good luck going into next week."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Locked to an expensive contract and I get content I don’t want to pay for: AMC networks, local television, Sports, cable news, etc."
03/26/2021,stocks,U2! Irrationality remains hard to predict as ever i suppose haha.

03/26/2021,stocks,"After seeing some comments on game stop it’s interesting how it’s back on the rise! I’m not invested but it’s sure interesting to watch from the sidelines. People convinced it’s done, the pumps again. Others sure it’s hitting 300, it drops to half that.

The spam on subs is getting tiring but the main show is still popcorn tv for stocks."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Holy shit, what's going on with FuboTV? Is this an amazing discount, or is there something going on with them?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well I thought I was finished with GME yesterday, but here I find myself looking at it again trying to decide whether to get back in. Other stocks are boring now... Thinking about putting my play money back in and trying not to check it so much. I don't believe the whole moon thing, but I could see it going to $300+, I can also see it going to $40."
03/26/2021,stocks,"At this point I just can’t be surprised at whatever GME is doing now, still holding a loss for now but I think I’ll jump ship when I break even to save my mental health"
03/26/2021,stocks,Thought I was going to basically get wiped out today by joining bear gang temporarily around the Biden speech but NIO is giving me hope. Probably will still get fucked but maybe just maybe magic will happen and NIO gets to like 30 today lol. I’ll be satisfied if it can stick around 34-35 all day.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I see a lot of talk about the “hedgies” (and I hate that word almost as much as I hate them), but does this shit really concern them? Are we really sticking it to them? Are they actually pissed and/or shaking in their booties? Or is it all just a fine way to raise esprit de corps?"

03/26/2021,stocks,with nio pre market numbers. it’s definitely a buy today.
03/26/2021,stocks,Why is CNBC listing BBY with the other meme stocks?? Please god don't tell me reddit is going to ruin this too.  I legitimately bought shares a few weeks ago because it was significantly undervalued... if the WSB people are going after it then it's destined to crater...

03/26/2021,stocks,GME is basically modern day gladiator pits.
03/26/2021,stocks,"For sure, it’s fascinating to watch. I made good money the first pump and have slept easy since then. Step into WSB though and it’s full blown delusional hive mentality. Sometimes I look out of sheer fascination and other times it’s just depressing haha"

03/26/2021,stocks,I'm holding. Any optimistic news from Congress will make the whole sector pop. I like APHA because they're established and they aren't solely dependent on US federal legalization. I think federal action is imminent and it's going to be the next industry to boom. It's just a matter of timing. Very bullish on the sector in the long run.
03/26/2021,stocks,Same
03/26/2021,stocks,"Wondering the same lol. The thing is it might not go lower than 34 35. It's fucking tempting at its going rate. I will prolly fomo 10k pounds. You are not gonna lose any money but if it does go to 30, you don't know how long its gonna take to work its way up to 35."
03/26/2021,stocks,It’s still so early in the sell off and still trades at a PS of 24. That’s extremely rich. At the end of 2019 I remember it trading at $4. I think the company has a lot of promise but it stock is still too high.
03/26/2021,stocks,Today could just be the beginning of their suspended production dip.
03/26/2021,stocks,Kind of scary with the talk about the government going after Chinese stocks being traded in the U.S.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Travel, tourism, hospitality, leisure, restaurants are industries that will probably see a spike. Keep in mind that a ton has changed such as rules and people's behavior, so don't expect a huge spike.

But other stocks that will probably do well that you're not thinking of are healthcare, retail, automotive, and the like."
03/26/2021,stocks,Amc
03/26/2021,stocks,Gme is ass dan
03/26/2021,stocks,"It’s kind of confusing and I don’t want to tell you the wrong thing, but all I’ll say is there’s no way it can keep going. There’s millions of new users on WSB that don’t know what they’re getting themselves into. That’s not to say it won’t go a bit higher in the short term, but a lot of them genuinely believe it can go to 100k, which is absolute bullshit."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Nobody knows what is going on with GME. People telling you it can go to 100k or more pulled that number out of their butt. But so are the people who say it can't go to 100k to be honest. 

Just enjoy the rollercoaster saga on the sideline or drop like $200 to buy one share in case the impossible happens and it hits 100k/500k/1 mil."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Everything should be positive. They are who they are and are getting into sports gambling which is huge.

Only thing I can point to is the assumption of declining members with people not being stuck at home with the vaccine."
03/26/2021,stocks,Do you see anyone else making money the last month?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Same, debating. I just dont learn my lesson lol. I lost all gains by jumping in 2nd time, but fomo is so hard to control esp after a chart like yesterday’s"
03/26/2021,stocks,"If it hits 300 you better be in that desk, looking, ready. If not sure it'll be 40 by the time you check.

Honesty just watch the market.
It's a storm out there but you wanna go on your boat.

I wouldn't get in GME. If it hits 700 good for them, best of luck, but my mental wellbeing is more important. That's a rollercoaster of stress and payout is blurry.

There something about diluting stock from the company so do research.

Have people seen companies like NVIDIA from 600$ to a $499??????
That seems like a better juicy position but yet I'm not in it because nobody now's what's happening.

This could be a 2 month correction"
03/26/2021,stocks,When you’re at your break even price you then put in a stop limit sell at that break even price. This way you can try to max out any potential profits without losing money.
03/26/2021,stocks,"That is what I did yesterday. GME was driving me crazy. Now that I am out I can't stop thinking about getting back in. It gets in your head... Probably studies being done on GME people right now, officially to be deemed a ""disorder"" in the future? Damn you GME!!"
03/26/2021,stocks,If your investments affect your mental health maybe you should give it a rest bro
03/26/2021,stocks,I bought into GME at 300 or so. been averaging down and managed to sell at a couple bucks profit today. What I've learned from GME is that if it hits 60 dollars you'd be stupid to not buy as much as physically possible. Then again I'm not your financial advisor.
03/26/2021,stocks,the news for nio is overblown. its only a 5 day stoppage. other auto manufacturers had to do this as well but they dont get hit as hard
03/26/2021,stocks,"What I find funny about the memes coming from WSB and /r/GME is this idea that hedge funds exist only to short companies and bilk retail investors. While those are both things that I'm sure hedge funds do, what hedge funds mainly do is try to make money... which to me would indicate that sometimes they do in fact want the stonks to go up.

And of course, the idea that no other hedge funds are playing either side of the GME game is also silly. Like they are literally called hedge funds, of course they're going to hedge their bets!

And thirdly, if you think that the majority of retail has the tools and wherewithal to get out before hedge funds when the crash comes  (and a crash will come eventually, whether next hour, next month or next year), I think you're sorely mistaken.

(By the way, I'm not shit-talking GME investors, I made decent profit on the first run-up and if I hadn't pissed it all away trying to learn options I'd probably go for another ride. It's just the cult-like certainty and outright propaganda of some WSB folks that makes me worry that some people are going to get fucked.)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"A hedgie was likely responsible for the gamma squeeze that caused the stock to go from 40 to 200ish a few weeks back. They're probably one of the ones keeping the price high so they can transfer wealth from retail to themselves. (Stock/option pool?) [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/melvin-capital-posts-return-of-more-than-20percent-in-february-sources-say.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/melvin-capital-posts-return-of-more-than-20percent-in-february-sources-say.html)

If someone is into meme stocks because they want to gamble and make money, that's fine. But they're not changing the world or fucking anyone but (mostly) other retail investors over."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah I completely agree with you about that word. Wtf is “hedgie”. All of the WSB jokes are so stupid now. Just called it a hedge fund ffs.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Some do but keep in mind while retail has some power a lot of the fights is between the short hedge vs the long hedge. It is unsurprising that while Citidel and friends are greedily naked shorting GME and AMC, rival hedge funds find out about it and devised a plan to not only make a lotta money but also potentially bankrupt Citidel to be able to grab all of their clients. Retail diamond handing it is just making the long hedges job easier."
03/26/2021,stocks,so who gonna buy ?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Fuck
. What caused this 90%?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"just made $0.33+, now I can buy one banana. thank you sir"
03/26/2021,stocks,Falling like a rock but I bought more at 22
03/26/2021,stocks,Gme is gambling. There are no fundamentals to explain it's price movements. It's movement is due to wild speculators.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I mean, not to state the obvious but selling is how you realize profits. Not everyone thinks the squeeze is realistic at this point. But I agree, GME makes no sense."
03/26/2021,stocks,so did you buy ? now it is trading 35.63
03/26/2021,stocks,"yeahhhh. buying in at open if it is around 34.50, 35"
03/26/2021,stocks,nio? can't find it on t212
03/26/2021,stocks,Frankly if that’s a case they will push it up with all their social media buzz. Following WSB is the new investing craze. You got in before the buzz. If it goes up 50% in next few months than I consider selling half. Don’t sell too soon.
03/26/2021,stocks,BBBY was GME before GME was GME.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Maybe so, but not until after it flies. Look at RKT, WSB jumped in for one day and it skyrocketed. Only for one day though. WSB is talking about too many different companies right now. they need to narrow it down to one or two again and then we're really going to see some action. Although it does look like GME and AMC are back in the forefront."
03/26/2021,stocks,What do you mean what's going on? It's been two weeks since IPO.
03/26/2021,stocks,I only have 10 stocks.
03/26/2021,stocks,scanners?
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks for the laughs
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not sure about the $1k, but you can double your investment if you sell by Jan 29th, 2021"
03/26/2021,stocks,"You invested (gambled) 20 years of life savings into GME?!.. Jesus Christ... Good luck. You're gonna need it. I really hope it works out for you! Oh and btw, don't listen to the posts saying it will shoot up to this price, or that price. They are just guessing (and hoping), and have absolutely no more of an idea than you do whether or not GME will rise. It's an extremely volatile stock, and the chances you could lose some, or all of your life savings are very high. You should NEVER invest more than you're willing to lose, especially in a speculative stock like GME, best of luck."
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol
03/26/2021,stocks,Hahahahahaha
03/26/2021,stocks,Good one dude
03/26/2021,stocks,omg
03/26/2021,stocks,😂😂😂
03/26/2021,stocks,😬
03/26/2021,stocks,"Never go all in,stocks are very unpredictable. You also bought high. I don't know if you're just trolling, because that's just a crazy trade.
There is no get rich quick, guys that made a ton bought when it was super cheap and pumped the gell out of it. IMO, the stock is absolutely toxic. Hopefully it rebounds to you buy in so you can get out.

I know there were or are guys at 300 waiting. The odds of GME reaching 300 is shit. This is aiming at the core of the earth. It's a 40-50 stock max, all this talk of online shit is just talk. They would have competition all around them and all they can really hope for is exclusive titles.

Today was a great example of how bad the stock is, it dropped and recovered, I scalped it for a gain then it was a slow bleed. People are catching knives trying to keep it up, but you need volume and new money. Today's first rebound was new money taking a predicted cut, after that it couldn't hold up.

I hope you're joking, but if you're not, wait and see. You may lose more if there's a large enough drop, but day traders come in and drive it up trying snatch an eady profit. When it gets to your number, sell off shares to not such a high risk level.

And no, the stock will never see 1,000. IMO it will bleed out with little death spasms on the way down.

I love Game Stop, go there because I hate digital downloads. I buy used games there, controllers, consoles, etc. It's sad, but the same shit happened to Ritz cameras then Blockbuster. Digital cameras killed Ritz, Everyone and their sister killed Blockbuster. Gamestop is not needed.

AMC would have been a better buy, pre covid their stock was around 15, regardless of stream, movie theaters still have a draw. AMC also has stream and a channel.

Really hope you're joking.

03/26/2021,stocks,"They'll negotiate a bit, worst case scenario get the chinese stocks audited to GAAP standards. Best case scenario nothing happens.

The US really doesn't want to fuck over chinese stocks, as they'll retaliate by selling US treasuries and fucking over US companies invested in China (TSLA for example). It'd be WW3 but in the financial market.

It's all noise meant to create a 'tough in china"" stance for the presidents. The one thing I do admit is it's keeping chinese stocks from their true valuation."

03/26/2021,stocks,Nobody honestly believes 100k+ right? Market cap would be 7 trillion. I would be surprised if it ever reaches 1k but I guess it's possible.
03/26/2021,stocks,Played GME conservatively and now headed to Cancun in a few weeks. I liked the stock
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, seemed to be a lot of them, but a lot of people losing money too. Crazy month to add to a crazy year in general. I have been in AMZN, AAPL, TSLA, PLUG, PLTR and GME. GME has been the most fun."

03/26/2021,stocks,I'm right there with you.
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah I like Nvidia but don't see any reason to jump in until there's a sign that the stagnation they've been in basically since August starts to trend up. Maybe start buying in slowly.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Been there, done that. For me it was just a great way to sell on a dip only to have it launch right after..."
03/26/2021,stocks,Thank you :)

03/26/2021,stocks,"It's going to end at some point. Some people have/will make lots of money. Some people will make some money and replay how they should have made more. Some will lose...

The trick is going to be what will people do when this is over. Very few are going to walk away from this and not want to chase that gain (or the daily drama)."
03/26/2021,stocks,is it really that hard to just hold on to the shares? jeez

03/26/2021,stocks,"Well, yes, of course. I know that much hahaha. But if the stock was up 18% why would *that* many people sell? So much so that it knocked the it down to -4%. Something about that seems a bit fishy to me."
03/26/2021,stocks,"grabbed more when it was -2.06

it may go lower. i thought that was a good number"
03/26/2021,stocks,i probably should have bought more but i split the buy between nio and sculptor capital. nio for hopefully growth and sculptor for a 10% dividend

03/26/2021,stocks,"That is such flawed logic, literally spreading FOMO. If you actually did what WSB tells you to do you wouldn't make any money. Their whole point is don't sell. At all. Not ""sell when it hits 350"". If you never sell, even when it's high, then you have 0 gains.

WSB literally runs on FOMO, so no, you can't listen to them if you want to make money."
03/26/2021,stocks,I got embarrassingly far into this comment before realizing it was sarcasm.
03/26/2021,stocks,Indeed! (Mostly)
03/26/2021,stocks,There's probably an element of that. Just look at the charts and how they jumped around the election. They haven't come all the way back down. But I still feel like there's a lot of growth to be had and legalization in some form just feels inevitable at this rate. A majority of people support it and we're seeing traditionally blue and red states start to legalize.
03/26/2021,stocks,I dont think they will tank it. it got hyped up months ago. now reality is setting in. it can still be a 60 plus by year end. i believe china wants to be the new global leader in the ev market. which is why i think after this chip shortage (which is a very suspicious timing) nio should get back on track. with probably by year end expanding into europe. eventually to the us. which i believe is their biggest goal. as far a pumping up a stock goes it does not have to be a chinese company for that. there’s plenty of us companies which do that. i think people are biased toward chinese companies.
03/26/2021,stocks,"America pumps ge, they literally put a bunch of trucks in front of Biden's parade. Nio's problem is the chip shortage, that's why i prefer xpev. (It is smaller and had already decided to consolidate this year)"
03/26/2021,stocks,You are probably right about that. Like it or not our relationship with China is interdependent. We need them for the cheap stuff they have to sell and they need us for the cheap stuff we have to buy. Kind of like a bad marriage you can't get out of because you can't afford what it would cost you.
03/26/2021,stocks,oil is crazy volatile at the moment.  It scared me off.  Of course you could buy retailers that sell gas. Maybe SVNDY?
03/26/2021,stocks,"assuming one stops rapidly trading meme stocks now/in the middle of the year, and  no longer holds them, the losses that were rolled into the CB do eventually get realized, correct? Like if the GME stuff stops in march, i sell off my positions in it, and I dont touch it for the rest of the year, any washed losses from the past few months would then be counted, right?"
03/26/2021,stocks,They literally said they stopped retail buying to stop it going into the thousands first time round.
03/26/2021,stocks,When it was halted back in January it was 500+ and kept going up. If the halt didn't happen it wouldn't be far fetched to think GME could have hit 1000 and from there literally rocket to the moon. Tesla was at one point worth thousands a share last year after getting shorted and had a squeeze that lasted almost the whole year. GME was and still is far more shorted than Tesla ever was. Remember shorting is like forcing down a spring. The more pressure of the short the bigger the force of the release/squeeze.
03/26/2021,stocks,"There is no technical limit to the stock price. This seems to be the most heavily shorted stock in history, so there is potential for a massive squeeze. It reached the 300-400 price zone already twice in a matter of days, what makes you think it would have problems reaching 1k? Now 100k of course nobody knows, but market cap will definitely not be a showstopper to this."
03/26/2021,stocks,I think gov would step in before it would hit 100k. 1000 is realistic though. IMO.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't think anyone thinks it would go to 100k and hold there. They are hoping for a squeeze that would peak up there. A squeeze doesn't care about fundamentals, it's a result of compounded short positions."
03/26/2021,stocks,">Nobody honestly believes 100k+ 

You'd be surprised but there are some people on other subs that genuinely believe it will. The mentality is very cult-like."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Sure, but OP doesn't want to lose money and wants to finally break even."
03/26/2021,stocks,When this is over I'm buying long. I still believe it has a long way to go up still it just might take longer.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes it is. I don't want to lose all my play money. Now I'm just waiting for a chance to get back in again. A lot of people held on to shares the first time and then ended up back at $40. Why bother unless you want to try to make some money? Maybe it's never happened to you but I had a long hold on a stock with $7,000 invested in it. Bad news came out and it started going down. I held. The stock got halted. It stayed halted until it reopened at a value of 1/10 of 1 cent per share. I know GME is not going down that low, but $40 is a realistic bottom. I would like to get in at a price where I can just long hold it but buying it in $190 or $200 is not a long hold for me. As of now I'm comfortable around $120 a share."
03/26/2021,stocks,"So, you have to be ridiculously lucky to have bought before they even manipulate it. 😁 In other words, more chances of winning the lottery than predicting it."
03/26/2021,stocks,Same reason it crated to $40 before spiking back and maintaining a $160ish price for the past month. If you can find the future pattern you will be a very rich person.
03/26/2021,stocks,"looking forward to jumping in again scary 

i had to sell my stocks although my purchase price was steel around $19 

i could not tolerate dropping my profit 

looking forward to jumping in again trying to find the best price"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, the factory is opening back up next week though, right?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Scranners?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Here, there, everywhere..."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes I think there is some bias towards Chinese companies right now. The thing that concerns me is I don't trust information coming out of China. I would not be surprised if they actually have plenty of chips just like they did with face masks.
03/26/2021,stocks,"When I say manipulate, I mean the Chinese government literally invests and owns every Chinese company."
03/26/2021,stocks,100k is very different from 1k or 2k
03/26/2021,stocks,1000 sure but 100k? Let's be real there is absolutely no way the big guys in suits would let that happen lol
03/26/2021,stocks,squeeze percentage has fallen big time since then. market-watch has it at 18.75%. thats not short squeeze material.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If a short squeeze happens and the stock price is too high, any hedge fund that shorted the stock can just declare bankruptcy.  They're not obligated to cover if they can't get the extra fund to cover.  There actually is a limit to how high the price can go."
03/26/2021,stocks,"And you don't think shorts have covered, at least a fair amount? Short% keeps decreasing every report, sure they might not be 100% accurate but still."
03/26/2021,stocks,Based on what? It's a failing company attempting to bring itself back from the dead.
03/26/2021,stocks,"""We"" lol. Does retail own even 10%?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Wallstreet will just shut the stock down before this happends.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good point, lol."
03/26/2021,stocks,"i think you might be losing your chance to get in soon. anyways i held to 80% down and i’m back up, so if you would’ve held on you’d probably be fine. but you do you. did you not see that gamestop called out the shorts in their 10-k filing, and warned investors not to buy at the top? doesn’t that seem peculiar to you?"
03/26/2021,stocks,It crashed to $40 because brokers (most notably Robinhood) imposed buying restrictions on the stock. This hasn’t happened today so it’s not the same reason at all.
03/26/2021,stocks,you have a good point. my only question to that is why would they do it. that could very well be the case but i always look for motive.
03/26/2021,stocks,"And corporate lobbyists own the American government. I dont care about politics, i just want to make money."
03/26/2021,stocks,"They said into the thousands, so 1 thousands, 2 thousands etc. I'm not talking about 100k."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Could be thousands could be tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands who knows. Also remember not everyone will hold to the end when the stock hits 1k, 5k, 10k, a lot of people will decide to cash out. You are not going to everyone holding to 100k+ before cashing out. Although if it goes goes to the moon I expect a lot of people will sell most but hold just a few shares in case it really does reach an absurdly high number."
03/26/2021,stocks,Except that doesn't nullify their standings. The idiots they borrowed shorts from such as the brokers and then the DTCC insurance itself pays for the order flow. Said DTCC has been getting increasingly picky with new rules about shorting and hedgefund's positional transparency. The ability to liquidate all their holdings is also a rule that is in review.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Talking the possibility of hitting 1000 during a short squeeze if it happens, but if they become a successful ecomm company, why couldn’t they be worth $1000/share? That would value them at aprox 70billion which wouldn’t be that large for a successful ecomm company. I don’t know what that kind of time line would look like, but originally I was talking strictly short squeeze."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I would say based on the fact that there’s a lot of speculation and people dumping their money in, hoping to get rich. I’m staying far away, But given the ridiculous reasons that people are buying the stock, I don’t think anyone can predict anything one way or the other. It’s complete chaos"
03/26/2021,stocks,Bloomberg terminal screenshot shown around 7.41%
03/26/2021,stocks,I am genuinely happy for you. Takes a lot of nerve to do that. GME has to be watched too closely and I don't have time. $120 a share and I'll go in long.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, if I had held longer I'd be in great shape. I sold it as much because I was just burnt out on it as the price change. I held when it was down to 118 till it went back up to 167. I wish I kept holding now, but I did what I did. Now I just set it to buy at $120 and I'll check on it and if I think it's near the bottom, or even a little bit below where I sold it maybe, I'll be in with both feet. I will be seriously looking at it at end of day today. Not always, but often that's the best chance to buy."
03/26/2021,stocks,I am the same way. Any motive would be a guess but if I was conspiracy theorist I would say that it's crippling manufacturing in other countries and then all the sudden they're just going to be pumping out vehicles. I don't know if there's any truth in it or not. Just a little bit wary of Chinese companies right now. I and the last person to be giving investment advice though. If anything doing the opposite of what I think usually works out best.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sure, I'm not disputing the fact that it could have gone to 1 or 2k, who knows. But it would still surprise me if it happened this time around"
03/26/2021,stocks,"But like, shit was halted at 500 as you said but you dont think its gonna be halted or suspended or whatever in the alternative universe where it really does go to some absurd number like 20k?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's the reason a bunch of new rules are rolling out with the express purpose of covering the DTCCs ass as they see possibility of some hedge funds risky plays can threaten the entire system. Make no mistake, after this GME/AMC saga is over nobody will be allowed to make another short play like this ever again."
03/26/2021,stocks,Sounds about right. Imagine thinking retail is playing any part in this fiesta except for holding the bags once big money is done fucking them
03/26/2021,stocks,"i check the price probably 5 times a day. it doesn’t have to be watched too closely. download an app that alerts you on 5% price changes, or 3% if you’re antsy. i legitimately hope for both of ours sake that it does hit $120, so we could both buy some more. i recommend reading some of the research that has been done recently. i don’t believe this is over by a long shot"
03/26/2021,stocks,thats a great point i believe they would claim a shortage to cripple manufacturing. you might be on to something there
03/26/2021,stocks,It absolutely will be. GME will never hit more than a few thousand. The government/banks literally would not let it happen. Redditors seem to think we live in a wild west capitalist free for all.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't think it's over either. I'm setting my hopes for $120, but if it gets to a point where I think it's settled I'll be back in. I need an app like you have. I'd be happy with alerts at 10, 15, 20%. I had too much time on my hands during spring break and I stared at it day and night. Kind of got a GME overload. I'm holding my play money in the account and it's ready to go when I get the urge."
03/26/2021,stocks,Or maybe I've turned into a conspiracy theorist. I don't know. if they are doing that then maybe that actually might help if you want to invest in it.

I mean I guess it's better than picking individual stocks, especially considering I just don't have the free time right now to do solid research to give myself the confidence. I dont want to let the extra money past my emergency fund to sit there doing nothing, but I don't as of this time want to put it into something super long term. Don't get me wrong-- I have a 401k and IRA to which I regularly contribute, but on top of that, I wanted to invest in something slightly riskier that has some potential to give reasonable returns in the short term.

03/26/2021,stocks,"It's 50% short term bonds & cash with the other half stocks.  I'm sure it's normally fairly safe but with short term bonds yields already at basically nothing they can't provide as much downside protection as normal.

$ALLY $SLM way way up ATH.

$DFS also at ATH.

03/26/2021,stocks,At least theres no risk of buying the peaks in tech and EV now. I'm gonna DCA with those sectors for life since that's where the real gains are
03/26/2021,stocks,"You can back it up fundamentally. They have been cheap for over a decade. But if it’s gone parabolic, it’s probably not worth it. What people don’t understand what is happening is money managers have to show returns on an annual basis, not 5 years from now. So what is happening is real and is going to continue until at least q3. Synchrony and MasterCard are probably safer than banks. But it is easier and safer in Industrials and Materials"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes.  Financials are positioned well to be market leaders after underperforming for so long.  The Fed will start lifting restrictions on things like buybacks and dividend increases, and rising interest rates is great for financials.

Here's a secret: you will make more money over the long run investing in stocks at their ATHs than you will trying to find ones trading in the lower part of their historical ranges.  A stock trading at its ATH is a sign of strength.  The only time it becomes a problem is if the valuation has gotten way out of hand, which is what we saw with tech.

They've been on a pretty steady uptrend for years though and saw spikes to $90 and $85 in the year prior to the pandemic. I can't speak for others, but in their case it's more a return to normal and I'm continuing to buy on dips.

Stock buybacks alone should continue to bolster their price."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Simplify your thoughts:
1) if you short term trade those financial stocks, just be happy to take profit when they are ATH; 2) if you plan to long term hold, sell some at ATH & buy back later when price lower which will be sure lower for financial stocks. 

If you have nothing in financial stocks yet, it is not a wise to think of buying ATH stocks just bc they are at ATH."

I think financials are solid investments. Since they had a great run up recently it may be somewhat slow moving, but timing is damn hard to predict in the market. So IMO it doesn’t so much matter the when but the if the prices will continue to rise, which I believe they will. 

I’m long JPM, MS and ISBC. BoA, C, GS and other major financials are also great picks for future growth in my opinion"

Unfortunately at the moment, most sectors as a whole are overvalued. Some cyclicals are somewhat fairly valued, but I fear they will still experience a downturn if the whole market dips.

I took large positions in financials back in sept/oct/nov. I think it’s a bit too late unless your time horizon is 5+ years and even then you’ll likely underperform. 

I’m currently finding it very difficult to find anything to dca into. My time horizon is shrinking though, I’d like my money returned in 3-5 years.

The FED will eventually do this but not before it causes a little more pain to the market..

Any thoughts about this transaction"
03/26/2021,stocks,Chub has gotten fat and throwing weight around since the last time I heard that name. I don’t know what Hartford would sell it self for but I bet it would be high even if they did. Only thing you could do is compare similar and smaller market caps and look for a brand

03/26/2021,stocks,"Large Commercial P&C broker here, I would argue that a blanket statement like that isn’t q hundred percent true. Rates as a whole are going up on all lines of insurance and some accounts are getting much higher deductibles but most are just getting rate increases (though significant) and/or much more moderate deductible increases. Property and Casualty insurers have been cutting rates and offering favorable terms for the past 10 or so years and similar to the stock market in correction mode or what is known as a hard insurance market. It’s not so much being greedy but rather rebalancing their risks. Also large portion of P&C  companies revenue comes from investments so if the market turns sour their cash will dry up fast.


What I will say insurance companies and brokers are consolidating like crazy, see Aon Willis and I wouldn’t be surprised if another large insurer swoops in with another offer, but I’m not sure who else would make sense if any of them."
03/26/2021,stocks,No reason to argue about that statement. It’s a fact on a recent rule for some industrial properties.
2021-03-26 07:33:50,stocks,"$HGEN - short term COVID play with Phase 3 data release by end of march and 5-10x possible ROI Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”…  “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”

Here’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success
4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]:  “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID – getting worse**

As many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx).

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

**Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well. 

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

POSITION: 1250 @ $16.30"
03/26/2021,stocks,Holy fuck someone actually talking about hgen. FINALLY
03/26/2021,stocks,Awesome DD! Wish I had the balls for pharma. Clinicals feel like a literal coin toss and COVID vaccines approval hasn’t seen to have a huge sway in value. Maybe because of the large upfront investments.
03/26/2021,stocks,great write-up of what’s going on so far! i’ve been in this for a little over a month and unfortunately not a lot of people have picked up on this so it’s really good to see some more attention getting on reddit. you should cross post this to other subreddits!
03/26/2021,stocks,"Posting for a friend...

That is an extremely well-written post. Thank you for sharing it. I would only ask the author to note two other points. In terms of funding, in addition to our arrangement with Hercules, we also raised $140M from the PIPE and public offerings; that we have a Controlled Equity Offering set up with Cantor for an additional $100M; and that we still have about $50M available on our shelf registration."

Look, I know shorters have a bad rep and screwed up recently, but fundamentally this is not good news. It means people who generally have a decent understanding of the firm and the industry are willing to bet on a decline at substantial risk to their capital.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Agree with you on HGEN being a good short term play but I'm betting on the opposite. It has a huge downside  but no immediate upside: if trial fails, price tanks immediately; if trial succeeds, there are still other obstacles before the drug can get to the customers. In other words, the risk is lopsided. I'm buying puts on this one. Or maybe a strangle, we will see.


A different story if this were a long term play though. But maybe this isn't the best time to get in."
03/26/2021,stocks,"What good is DD if it looks at everything through rose colored glasses? Are you trying to \*determine\* if it's a good company to buy, or are you just trying to \*convince\* yourself it's a good company to buy? Most drugs don't make it to market. Current mRNA vaccines are doing a very good job with COVID variants (despite what OP says). Effectiveness of mRNA vaccines result in far fewer serious symptoms of infection (i.e. reduced need for this drug). Other drugs are currently available to help suppress the cytokine storm. OP doesn't mention any of this. Is there big upside? Possibly. Is it already factored into share price? Probably to some extent but I doubt there's 5x-10x upside. It's not like COVID drugs are flying under the radar. If the drug isn't approved be ready to baghold at $2."

03/26/2021,stocks,"No competition? Good luck with your trade. I think if this were a year ago, I would invest.

03/26/2021,stocks,"RemindMe! 5 days

Good luck on this yolo!"
03/26/2021,stocks,50000+ shares damn! what's your basis on those?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Admittedly, I’m more in tune with the science and projecting a price isn’t my strong suit. The $1+ billion in revenue for 2021 is something the company has repeatedly mentioned as a conservative Estimate  (USA-only). If that’s the case, I’m pretty comfortable giving an approx 5:1 market cap w/ corresponding PPS around $100. The stockpiling and ex-US sources creates a ton of revenue generating opportunity, but it’s hard to quantify. it’s also hard to know given how COVID is seemingly changing day to day, but it appears that it’s gonna get worse yet and the opportunity for lenz will be there. 

Given the partnership with Operation warp speed, BARDA, and others, I’m confident they’ll be able to hit the ground running with producing lenz should they get EUA approval. 

Also, the severe COVID therapeutic landscape is a barren wasteland right now, so Lenz should have little trouble establishing its presence. 

I guess these are mostly rehashing my original points, but that’s how I back up my price levels and why I think $hgen will have little issue taking off as opposed to falling flat."
03/26/2021,stocks,This is true with most small bio companies close to releasing top line results.  The SP is going to move in a significant way.
03/26/2021,stocks,GL my friend 🙏🏻
03/26/2021,stocks,It could lose a big portion of its current value if the trial is a failure though. Don't throw your whole life savings into it.
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes! I did touch on it briefly in my short interest section and at the end about its low float/volume and ease of price manipulation. It’s at a mouthwatering price (IMO) and I wish I could average down more. I bet the SI is higher than Mar 15 report given recent activity — the stock could really moon with good P3 data if the shorts don’t cover
03/26/2021,stocks,"i agree with you for sure. i think if you look an option spread we have two main plays going on. longs hedged with deep OTM puts and shorts hedged with deep OTM calls. classic to all small cap biotech with an upcoming binary event. it’s all based on respective investment hypotheses. i’m personally net long but have also hedged. so agree it’s not necessarily good, but if you believe in the upside and are hedged, high short interest gives you a temporarily larger upside"
03/26/2021,stocks,They are doing it prior to results being released when the SP is easily manipulated due to low volume and a small float.  They aren't taking a significant risk.  They will abandon ship prior to news or at news.  That will be reflected in the SP.
03/26/2021,stocks,"GME really ruined this. There's a reason people are short a stock. No, it's not so they get squozen out. People only see short and think squeeze, they don't take a step back and wonder WHY people are short."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I highly doubt they have done the amount of DD OP has done.  Just like in gme they see a easy opportunity to make money and assume dumb money will fold.

I am betting on $aso also.   Heavy shorted retailer, but there is tons of amazing DD on it also"
03/26/2021,stocks,Ur too kind😂😂. GL to u 🙏🏻🙏🏻🚀🚀🚀
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don’t think op is promising anything. He’s saying the potential is there. This stock moves on very little volume. Also, It is very under the radar. Positive results will bring in more retail especially with the extensive and developing pipeline."
03/26/2021,stocks,"it has the potential for 5-10x IF trial results are good and it goes for EUA. at the end of the day it’s a binary event and it could fail for all we know, but do your own DD and look into the research.

i’ve been in this for only a month and to me everything i’ve been reading sounds positive."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good luck, sir.  I'm obviously opposite you.  I believe the upside is tremendous if top line results meet statistical significance.  An EUA and sales will be given based on positive data.  

I see you've got a 20c too.  That's smart."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sorry, what obstacles are there? They've already positioned themselves for production with BARDA, and have consulted with the FDA to redesign their primary endpoint for highest power and fastest EUA."
03/26/2021,stocks,And I did just that. 4/16 10p/20c strangle. I would have gone for the May expiration date instead but I'm broke.
03/26/2021,stocks,"The drug is 100% dependent upon top line results coming out within 5 days.  The recent studies out of the UK (among others) showing the role of GM-CSF in severe covid-19 patients reinforces the science behind Lenzilumab targeting GM-CSF.  Current mRNA vaccines are helping tremendously BUT there is a significant portion of the population who refuse to take them, it's a big world (look at Brazil) and there are variants that we don't yet fully understand how the vaccines will handle them.  There will be at minimum a multi-year demand for this drug if effective.  That doesn't include DOD stockpiling.  That's plenty of time for the Car-T trials, and others, the company is running to complete.

Other drugs available to help suppress the cytokine storm are mostly ineffective.  Ask the doctors watching patients die every day.  Remdesivir, Dexamethosone, Tocilizumab offer help to some patients but not the most sick.  The other approved MAB's are not approved for hospitalized patients that are hypoxic.  There is a void in SOC that Lenzilumab can fill.

The drug was selected by the NIH to be part of the ACTIV 5/BET trial that continues to add sites to the study.  They chose Lenz out of 100's of drugs to compare to Remdesivir.  These studies shut down quickly if they are not showing positive results.  You can verify this looking at the other ACTIV trials.

The data from the trial is being shared directly with the DOD even though the company has not seen them.  The DOD, through BARDA, has assigned fill/finish capacity to Humanigen.  That is one of their greatest resources.  They can throw money at anything but actual resources are limited.

Through CRADA (Cooperative Research And Development Agreement) they had Janet Woodcock working on behalf of the company with the FDA to make sure all their ducks are in a row.  They are currently meeting with OWS on a weekly basis on CMC's (Control, Manufacturing and Controls).

Every bread crumb you follow with this company highlights the favorable position they are in should anticipated results reach statistical significance.

PT is more in the $5 - $50 range on initial results.  With EUA it will go beyond that.  $2 is too low due to the rest of their trials with KITE Gillead on Car-T and brain tumors."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Admittedly, I am bullish on the stock so I am biased. But no, it’s not convincing. Given the science and current data, I think lenz has a great shot. You’re right, most drugs do fail - it’s still a risk of course and I pointed that out. 

I echo pretty much everything u/__nerman has to say. So many things pointing in the positive direction for $HGEN"

03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the great DD will the results be published at month’s end? As far as I can see, the clinical trial will be finished by then; so I presume it could take longer until the results are published. But that’s just my assumption."
03/26/2021,stocks,"For sure, I’m only putting around $80 into. I won’t make as much if it goes well but that’s better than risking my entire portfolio."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yup, happened to me with FREQ. Read a very convincing DD post on it (no fault to the poster) and threw a decent stack at it and then the trial was a disaster and it dropped 75% 🤣

So I doubled down!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Are you the guy who sold HGEN straddle? Can't find the comment but I vaguely remember someone who said they sold a straddle 12.5p 20c I think.

Good luck to you too."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Maybe my original comment wasn't very accurate. I spew a lot of BS on reddit these days.

Not sure if obstacle is the best word to use here. What I meant to say was if the trial fails it fails, if the trial succeeds there's still more work to be done before production can start. I think they also need official FDA approval? One scenario is instant, the other scenario requires more time.

Anyway if the trial succeeds the price will jump. That's why I bought both put and call."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's not just covid.

&#x200B;

The original plan for GM-CSF antagonists is to reduce the severe side effects in some new cancer immunotherapies.  There are some amazing CAR-T therapies coming to market but they have some significant acute inflammatory dangers, and a GM-CSF inhibitor appears to reduce that substantially.  That's the longer term future for the drug.

Obviously Covid revenue now would speed commercialization for cancer substantially."
03/26/2021,stocks,If all this was as convincing as you make it out to be then it would be reflected in the stock’s price. Not saying you’re wrong. Just that I think the upside is far lower than this and other DD suggest and the downside risk is greater than most DD consider.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You should be Bullish on this stock! You've done your homework, and found a great opportunity. If others take the time to do the research I think they might come to the same conclusion. All stocks have risk, but I am with you in that I'm very comfortable right now heading into a major catalysts."
03/26/2021,stocks,Agreed. There may have been other factors at work. A case study is not a clinical one but it’s all  we’ve got for now.
03/26/2021,stocks," “In this multi-hospital assessment, when controlling for COVID-19 risk factors, treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone and in combination with azithromycin was associated with reduction in COVID-19 associated mortality. Prospective trials are needed to examine this impact.”
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7330574/

“Vitamin D deficiency markedly increases the chance of having severe disease after infection with SARS Cov-2. The intensity of inflammatory response is also higher in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. This all translates to increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients who are deficient in vitamin D. Keeping the current COVID-19 pandemic in view authors recommend administration of vitamin D supplements to population at risk for COVID-19.“
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77093-z"
03/26/2021,stocks,"The trial enrollment completion was announced January 29th.  There is a 28 day follow-up that ended February 25th.  Since then they have been collecting and analyzing the data.  The CEO has been consistent in stating the data would be released in March.  Any day now.

Interestingly, they announced full enrollment around the same time they announced BARDA/CRADA expansion and several manufacturing partners.  The pump is primed."
03/26/2021,stocks,"At least in this case it’s a phase 3, based on really good phase 2 results"
03/26/2021,stocks,Word for word exactly what happened to me lmao
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yea FREQ was a valuable lesson in how to only play with a small amount in these stocks with binary events driving the price, and to hedge aggressively against whatever you do play"
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, not me.  I'm mostly shares with calls at various strikes.  Very bullish on this one."
03/26/2021,stocks,Would probably speed up a buyout from Gillead or other BP as well.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Fair enough.  It was valued at over $1B mc and over $23 a share in February though.  That's pretty substantial for a company with no revenue or approved drugs.  You can look up the short interest that has driven the stock price down over the last month.  It's 2021 trading.  The 52 week high is 33.95.  Even doubling February's closing high of $23.83 gets us close to $50.  That's very doable, imo."
03/26/2021,stocks,I think the bigger issue with that patient was they prescribed hydroxycholorquine at the same time they gave him Lenzilumab.  Patient was on 400 mg for two doses followed by 200 mg twice daily for an additional 4 days.  There is really no way for us to tell the effect that may have had on his treatment.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I do recommend reviewing the Mayo clinic case studies.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470718/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470718/)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"okay wow where to start. first of all that first article is from patients A YEAR AGO. when we knew nothing about covid treatment. i could link you ~multiple~ double blinded studies that have since actually found no benefit. standard of care is way better now (which is remdesivir + dex btw). 

Secondly, all that the second paper shows is a correlation between unhealthy individuals and low vitamin D. it could even be that covid infection decreases vitamin D levels in at risk populations (but people definitely aren't dying from vitamin D deficiency). until there is an actual double blinded randomized controlled trial, i’ll wait before jumping to any conclusions here.

it’s clear to me you have no understanding of the scientific process whatsoever, and are still hanging onto the crumbs that donald trump has fed you. this has been a pointless conversation. congrats."
03/26/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/26/2021,stocks,"To me the lowered share price and increased short interest is largely due to seeing just how effective the vaccines are at preventing serious symptoms. That and the faster-than-expected vaccine rollout in the US means the demand for the drug us greatly reduced. The vaccines are almost certainly more effective at preventing severe complications than Lenzilumab will be at treating severe complications.

The market outside the US is a factor, but I feel like the places that could most benefit (Brazil, S. Africa) aren't exactly following the science on this stuff to begin with so I'd be a little skeptical it'll be broadly adopted.

I feel like the stock is priced pretty fairly, maybe a spike after good news but settling around $20, but serious downside risk if the trial isn't positive. That said, I'm not a shareholder so I'd love to be wrong for the sake of the people Lenzilumab might help."
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol
03/26/2021,stocks,"hey man, great response. continue peddling snake oil, I think you have Alex Jones on your side."
03/26/2021,stocks,Looks like the snake oil is being pushed by HGEN.
03/26/2021,stocks,how so?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Peddling overpriced monoclonal antibodies for a disease state that can be mitigated by cheaper alternatives.  This is why people went after Martin Shkreli, who is an angel by comparison."
03/26/2021,stocks,"you still haven't proven the ""mitigated by cheaper alternatives"" part yet. Can you prove that? Are you aware what proof is? Am I being trolled?"
03/26/2021,stocks,The mistake you made was engaging.
03/26/2021,stocks,realizing this now
03/26/2021,stocks,Lol
2021-03-26 06:42:21,stocks,"Tomorrow Stock Pick for Next Week Announcement. President Biden will be releasing his budget spending plan to the public next week. Definitely will be seeing a spike within stocks in the right sectors. What are your guaranteed stocks that will be in his plan?

The sectors that I am currently expecting are:

1. Energy
2. Infrastructure 
3. Weed (Uhhh)
5. Climate?
4. EVs?
5. Healthcare?


And the my unexpected choices: Semiconductors/Fiber Optic Network

My stock choices: CAT/ICLN"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Meetkevin spoke about this today: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSZuhGGrADc


He seems pretty sure energy/climate/ev are a given. Not sure exactly how much it will boost the stocks since it might be priced in but we will see. Still holding to my dumb ICLN lol"
03/26/2021,stocks,ARVL & Root
03/26/2021,stocks,Uranium maybe?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I might be ignorantly bullish, but my eye is on tech. Massive selloffs with increasing lower side support at a steady price. Current bottom has been tested a few times with increasing consistent resistance. 

Tired of hearing tech is over valued, the same ramblings were constant of being over valued pre-COVID. Tech is a bullish sector with high volatility. 

Tech does well when there’s conventional failure. The longer the Suez Canal block is there short term volume moving back."
03/26/2021,stocks,My advice sell everything 5 minutes before he makes it public. The market will probably run those stocks in anticipation of the announcement and will be disappointed with whatever Biden wants says.
03/26/2021,stocks,I got Starbucks
03/26/2021,stocks,Will be buying more Root. Oversold and massive short float.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Eaton. If you want a non speculative industrial that is crucial in electrification. Otherwise go buy one of those crap charging station spacs or crap that’s going to continue to get you blown out. Btw Eaton just purchased a legitimate charging station company. Wind, solar, EV... it all requires products made by Eaton to scale."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm starting to become hesitant on federal marijuana changes since President Biden fired those guys for past usage. If the Democrats in Congress can't force his hand it'll be state by state. PA and NY are rushing to pass legalization since NJ passed it. Expect a tooth and nail fight elsewhere, just look at South Dakota right now."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Materials mining companies BBL, VALE, RIO.  Whatever you build is good for mining,  from bridges to EVs, Solar to trains,  they all get made from stuff that gets pulled out of the ground by mining companies.   I have $5K in both BBL and VALE so far."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ill probably keep going my long term ETF route:
DRIV, PAVE, and ICLN"
03/26/2021,stocks,"One thing you're forgetting is that sleepy joe can't pump the market for shit. Mango knew how to pump the market. 

The clean energy run started during elections, expecting a Biden win, and it was fucking great. But as you can see all of that has died down now. I wouldn't expect any pumps, they're all priced in. 

I'd pay more attention to Jpow and the Fed. SLR, interest rates, banks reinstating dividends and buybacks, the APHA/TLRY merger, etc. 

also if you watched joe speak today when he started speaking the market dumped. when he stopped, there was a pretty fat green dildo lol. Let's just hope stocks don't drop further. Prices are pretty low already for DCA with the most recent correction."
03/26/2021,stocks,Dementia drugs
03/26/2021,stocks,"Bought ROOT at $11.50 glad to see they’re finally getting some traction. I might have to buy more, 6.8% borrow rate and a short interest of 47.36% of the float."
03/26/2021,stocks,Root short squeeze is on
03/26/2021,stocks,"Value is starting to look overvalued, we will be rotating into tech soon"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Tech will be around but what kind of upside are you seeing that's not already priced in? Covid was *the best thing ever* for tech stocks and made them jump years ahead in valuation. The aftermatch is probably not even more tech-expansion, it's already happened. If anything it'll slow down since the easy markets are taken.



I'd eye things that will benefit from things returning to normal, things that hadn't already had a decent recovery (like many airlines had). People will start going out, drive their cars again (and do necessary maintenance) not to mention office space will be in demand again."
03/26/2021,stocks,Do you think the bean shortage will make the prices go up or down?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Been considering RIO specifically as well. 

Have been hit by mining before though so kinda leery"
03/26/2021,stocks,Also been considering SU. Any thoughts on them?
03/26/2021,stocks,Lawsuit filed against ROOT yesterday by shareholder
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agreed,  it's very cyclical.   If you believe big changes are coming though,  that's the place to be.   Even without an EV/green energy revolution, I'm looking at a shortage of houses and other banal stuff like my new stove was on three months backorder.   Risk is that I don't have a good reliable information about the rest of the world which is what really drives demand. I didn't have any mining companies so I split a normal position size between those two."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I really haven't looked at that one too close.   I got 200 XOM at exactly $50, because they talked less green than the other big players and I  wanted an oil company that believes in oil. If XOM starts seriously taking about going green I'll dump them and look again.   I'll keep SU in mind."
03/26/2021,stocks,"That always happens, I’d care if it was class action"
03/26/2021,stocks,"My approach with mining has been to always have it split between types of minerals. I live in a huge coal state, and see first hand how that can go...."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’ve only slight glanced at XOM recently. Been awhile since I did DD on them but ultimately decided to pass at the time. I’ve since exited some other positions and now looking to get back into oil. 

And taking advantage of the dips from the blocked route right now doesn’t hurt either haha"
03/26/2021,stocks,Very nice.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good call on both.   XOM was risky before, but I think most of that has passed (hopefully).  Oil is hated right now and everyone believes that EVs are going to be universal.   They don't think about big transport (ships, trains,  planes,  trucks) and they forget about the rest of the world doesn't have the infrastructure necessary for EV (India,  Pakistan, etc).  Even here in America it's going to be a long time to build enough power plants and high voltage cables to support more than 10% EV."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Had similar thoughts. I mean here in West Virginia, we hardly have high speed Internet in half the state, let alone common EV charging stations. The only current ones are some super chargers at various Sheetz along the main interstate through the state. While I’ll agreed EVs will be more popular as time goes on, that’s still a ways down the run (ba dum tis)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm in rural Georgia,  no option for any real internet.   I've pre-ordered starlink and they are ""targeting "" second half of this year for availability.   Unlike other Musk companies,  SpaceX seems to under promise, over deliver so I'm hopeful."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I originally grew up in rural WV (now live in main part of the state) but my mom still lives there and the fastest Internet she can get is 50 mb/sec haha it’s a joke really. She streams shows over ATT cellular faster. 

Due to my type of work I’m often at coal companies and coal fields for meetings in the southern part, and they dont even have cell coverage let alone broadband. Our legislature has spent easily the last 6 years talking about expanding internet infrastructure here, but no one sees any time soon."
2021-03-26 06:32:18,stocks,"Bloomberg: Volkswagen as the Next Tesla is firing up stock investors (Re. VOW and VWAGY)

[Bloomberg: Volkswagen as the next Tesla is firing up stock investors](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/volkswagen-as-the-next-tesla-is-firing-up-stock-investors-1.1581434)

Excerpt:

> The stock started taking off last week as investors bought into the Germany company’s plan to supplant Tesla Inc. as the global leader in electric cars. Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess made a series of announcements on his strategy to beat his California-based rival, emulating his counterpart at Tesla, Elon Musk. In return, VW common shares picked up a bit of Tesla’s cult status, soaring 60 per cent so far this month.

Also:

> Sell-side analysts tracked by Bloomberg factored the new prospects for the company’s EV plans into their models, leading to the average price target rising alongside shares. Yet for the moment only about 7.7 per cent upside is left in the preferred stock if the 12-month average target is any guide. Hence, no surprise that the number of analysts rating the stock a buy is right where it was when the rally began.

And:

> VW is a giant compared to Tesla when it comes to sales volume. The German carmaker sold more than 9 million cars last year versus just half a million for Tesla. And while VW is still trailing Tesla in terms of EV sales, the gap is closing fast with Volkswagen accelerating its growth from the low base. Yet Tesla’s market value is almost four times greater than Volkswagen’s after a stunning 743 per cent share price rally last year."
03/26/2021,stocks,Has anyone factored in that the weakest part of VW has always been ironically.... the electric?
03/26/2021,stocks,"And GM is up near 100% in six months due to Mary Barra talking about electric cars and making Cadillac the premium EV mfg.   The momentum is great but at the end of the day there will be roughly the same number of cars sold globally it will just be a much larger % that will be EVs.  So I suspect if you are going to play this game, you do it as a trade rather than a life long investment."
03/26/2021,stocks,EV bubble [pop](https://youtu.be/bw9CALKOvAI)
03/26/2021,stocks,"Porsche Automobil Holding SE is the better play. 

That way you get the agricultural, long haul trucking, and bonuses like Lamborghini along with Volkswagen."
03/26/2021,stocks,Is VW entering the residential solar market?
03/26/2021,stocks,No
03/26/2021,stocks,"Fundamental truth for VW: every electric car they sell replaces an ICE car sale and is less profitable, at least for now. This isn’t a recipe for growth. The stock surge is all hype and no meat"
03/26/2021,stocks,doesnt matter because vw doesnt have elon.
03/26/2021,stocks,"With the amount of times VW has had a lawsuit due to cutting corners as well I don't know if I can ever trust their cars if they did have a ""self driving"" or ""battery car"" I'd be fearful for battery starting fire or the self driving function breaking down."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Their ID.4 has not had a good showing. It's not a bad car, but it is the weakest of the new electric cars."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Owned two VWs. Can confirm both had electrical issues. They weren't expensive to fix or anything, but it does make me wonder."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Their cars are horrific. The Jetta in the US is the goto car for them and they haven't ironed out things like the windshield wipers motor, the electronics or the fogging of windows for over 30 years. 

Let's face it. This is a boomer EV play. all VW has is the German engineering name and the VW brand.

But their products are garbage. Garbage. I hate the German engineering means good products. It doesn't. Every country in the world has good engineering but for some reason they get credit far making it in engineering.

Give me a break. I'm bearish so much on VW"
03/26/2021,stocks,"The upside for GM is not much, given its previous bankruptcy dealings, and given that its announcements have not been very bold.

VW, on the other hand, is a [$1.1 trillion enterprise in the making](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mb3y4s/tesla_tsla_could_be_worth_29_trillion_usd_by_2025/)."
03/26/2021,stocks,"What matters a lot in the EV play is the fact is that AI is **throttled**. Even if we maintain exponential increases in computing ability fully autonomous vehicles are a long shot. Since that’s what Tesla’s business model is building to they’re fucked if tech holds fast and conventional auto can replicate them with less features.

However with battery and charging breakthroughs, in the short term more affordable EVs have massive upside potential. VW doesn’t want Tesla’s prices and can out manufacture Tesla and deliver on a global scale. 

When it comes to auto engineering I will bet on the Germans every day of the week."
03/26/2021,stocks,"EV bubble runs on renewable energy, hence, no pop."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Lamborghini sits within the VW Group auspicies, not Porsche SE."
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm in both POAHY and VWAGY.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not to my knowledge.  Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng aren't, either."
03/26/2021,stocks,And then you realize that this is priced in since VW has a P/E of 13.
03/26/2021,stocks,"So?  The EV *pump* (not just ""hype"") works for Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng, not just Tesla.

It's all about money-bleeding companies being in a position to raise capital with minimal dilution, if the *story* is good.

The story so far is:

 - Second mover advantage
 - Realistic shot at beating Tesla in two years
 - Willing to invest in EV infrastructure, unlike other legacy automakers"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Plug Power doesn't have a charismatic CEO, yet PLUG outperformed TSLA in 2020."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is a problem with a lot of German companies when it comes to reliability.  

One of the reasons is that German companies keep engineering teams for different subsystems largely separate from each other.  The final prototyping team is supposed to work out the kinks instead of the original engineering teams.  It does reduce a lot of wasted meetings in the beginning of a building out a new car, but major oversights sometimes get through which would be caught by teams working more closely together.  Volkswagen also loves to re-use parts and sometimes it is better to redesign a part instead.  

Japanese car engineers are the complete opposite.  Their entire crew works together from start to finish."
03/26/2021,stocks,This is exactly what I thought when I read about VW becoming the next Tesla. Really? VW?
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah the Jetta is a breakdown machine.  I have a few friends that bought them and every single one of them said that car had problems.  I had very little problems with all my Toyota’s.
03/26/2021,stocks,Actually its successful BK filing is what gives it the ability to become really valuable with little baggage.
03/26/2021,stocks,You don’t understand GM. It’s future will look similar to Waymo and Tesla with automated driving due to it’s ownership of cruise. EVs don’t have much to do with it’s upside.
03/26/2021,stocks,We will get to full autonomy one day.  Question is when.   AI is getting better and better.   Just need to train the computer to think like how a human would.  There’s too many situations and unknown to solve this problem procedurally.  It all have to be AI and adaptive learning.  There will still be accidents but I’m thinking less than with humans behind the wheel.
03/26/2021,stocks,Its pretty clear you don't know anything about AI so please stop spreading misinformation.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think all ESG sectors r in danger at the moment. Blackrock made it worse. But if u look back and see how many EV companies went ipo via spac deal last year, i think it’s on bubble stat, and may be it’s about to get bigger or recent correction released some pressure, who knows. But i wont hold big position of EV sector"
03/26/2021,stocks,That should answer the question of whether or not VW will be the next Tesla then
03/26/2021,stocks,With a shrinking E
03/26/2021,stocks,"Huh?

Sorry, but EV plays are *not* valued based on P/E.  They shouldn't be.

It's VW's turn."
03/26/2021,stocks,"It's too bad that Japanese auto will be the last movers to the EV space.

But hey, let's keep profiting and growing ICE market share in India and Indonesia, right?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"On to that, i think German working laws are good for the employee but hinder innovation. There's just so much for the employee that stops the ideas of overworking and has engrained in the culture of doing just enough to get s paycheque...now obviously there are exceptions so before I get flamed. 

But look at the average German, 5 weeks vacation, 38.5 hrs, tons of employee incentives.

Look at Japan and America. Work you to death and work culture is to be the best and do the most hours. On top of that, what was stated about meetings and being efficient.

I can't say that any company from my experience in German has been anything but efficient."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah low quality car made by unskilled Labour. Fits the story
03/26/2021,stocks,Agreed it will happen. It’s just a matter of the computational cost and how quickly we can get the hardware that can support it in mass production at cost efficient prices for manufacturers.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You clearly know less. AI is throttled by exponential compute times. Even as GPU computation is improved Amdahl’s law holds and there’s a theoretic limit to how far we can go without algorithmic or quantum breakthroughs. Classifier visual and LISAR networks are not cheap computationally. The sensors are expensive and it requires even more compute power to conduct underlying functions. It’s doable with current technology but cost prohibitive.

Google has proven the viability self driving cars, but do you know how much those prototypes cost? It’s purely because you have to spend a lot up front on stable system with sufficient hardware to hold for the longterm. The price point on these vehicles is $60k+ it’s not an iPhone. I’m just saying that EV’s are tied to Tesla hype, which isn’t coming for at least few more years.

2021-03-26 06:23:35,stocks,"What are your BEST strategies to avoiding emotional trading? **Quick background:**

So, I've been a long-term investor for nearly a decade now. I was of the mind-set of just ""set it and forget it,"" and would only look at my portfolio maybe a few times a week. FAANG still comprises the majority of my portfolio. Many of my positions are safe blue chips, some growth and value stocks that have rewarded me nicely over the years. I finally started taking profits on some of those investments.

I didn't start actively trading until January when the meme stonk craze brought me in...since then, I've been neglecting my day job (thankfully I work for myself) and trading incessantly. I've spent the past few weeks researching options and learning various strategies. I find myself excited for 4am to start the trading day. Some days I'll have my eyes on the market from 4am thru 8pm...active trading sure is a lot more fun than passive investing, but it's taking a toll...

**Emotional trading:**

Lately, I've noticed that I'm becoming more and more emotional with my trades. For example, when I'm loosing on a trade or taking losses, I'm itching to try to win it back. I find myself gambling and chasing stocks that are running...holding bag after bag...and still holding when I have 100%+ gains... etc. 

It's been a stressful past 2 months since...I lost money on GME last month. I made the mistake of taking sizable positions in ARKG and ARKF at their absolute peaks. I liquidated a lot of my FAANG stocks to pick up hyper growth stocks that pulled back 30-60%...Suffice to say, my portfolio is seeing a lot of red these days, when historically it's been mega green.

Currently I'm also riding the meme stonks heavily and have been doing pretty well with my positions and options up until the massacre earlier this week. Now I'm looking for ways to negate my recent (soon to be) losses and throwing whatever dry powder I have into the market. I've gone from a patient, Warren Buffet style investor to a crazed WSB ape investor. I can probably use some balance at this point.

**Now my question: what are your best strategies that you have for avoiding emotional trading and keeping even keel through the wild and wicked swings of the stock market?**"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I look at my portfolio and buy stocks the 1st of every month. Other than that, I don’t look at my portfolio, and if I want to skip a month, I won’t look at it for 2 months. It’s honestly the best way because looking at your portfolio every week is too stressful."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Emotion only kicks in when u don’t have any confidence. Know your company u investing or gambling. If u research and learn what you are about to get in, every dip is an opportunity. My examples are $KDP WM MP and few others."

03/26/2021,stocks,"keep a stock diary.

I keep a page on everything I buy: some notes on fundamentals (P/E, P/B, return on capital, debt levels, etc), price when I bought. a sentence about why I bought, and why I might sell. and a note on when and why I did sell, and at what price.

I prefer to look at my portfolio only when I buy, which is usually once a month with my paycheck. too much looking at the details makes me crazy. the hedge fund manager Seth Klarman said somewhere he doesn't even have a Bloomberg Terminal at his desk; he's investing for the long-term and doesn't care about minute-by-minute fluctuations. if that strategy can help him earn 20% a year, I figure it was worth trying."

03/26/2021,stocks, Ale sure you have a rules based system you are comfortable with and do not deviate
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is what you do.

Step 1: get sleep

Step 2: get more sleep

Step 3: did you get enough sleep?

Step 4: make sure you're getting enough sleep

Sleep has a tremendous role in emotional regulation, which is essential for any experienced trader.  I've been on a winning streak since November, make 3-5% every week until the week ending on 3/12. I actually made considerable money on the way down due to my strategies. BUT on the week ending of 3/12, I yolo'ed some GME 800c 3/12 and SPY 395c 3/12 and lost over a grand, and got myself flagged as a PDT and now one of my accounts is locked until June lmao. 

It's like being drunk on fun and then having an abrupt stop to the party. It's important to cool off sometimes if you notice yourself going off the rails. Take breaks, plan your trades, don't overtrade or over manage. Set price targets and make exit plans. 

I'm going to say that you're not experienced enough yet since you said January, and I'm going to assume 2021. So I'd start with learning to manage position sizes, set up some plans and rules to keep yourself in check. 

&#x200B;

1. NEVER yolo more than 3-5% of your account on any one trade. If you go over that, you'll blow up your trading account and it'll suck. Luckily the GME and SPY loss was within my personal risk tolerances
2. Trade with a plan, set price targets, stop losses, exit plans for profit-taking, and so on. This gets really tricky, but I use technical analysis for this. People say it's horse shit, and I agree. I've left lots of profits on the table, or sold for a loss only to have the underlying go up shortly after. Find your own plan that works for you, nothing is perfect. If it's a crystal ball that works, it works. Why do I still use it? It has made me more gains than losses consistently. 
3. Have confidence in your trades, plans, and investments. Don't over-manage your trades, looking at the screen 24/7. This one just requires experience and an overall feel of the market. For example, if you're selling calls on tech stocks, and you see tech stocks doing bad, you could be more aggressive with the calls you sell. Conversely, I wouldn't be buying calls or selling puts. I would short tech, etc. Commodities, bonds, etcccc. Confidence comes from DD and research, fundamentals and sentiment. 
4. Diversify your portfolio and trades. Have hedges in place. Don't put all your eggs in a meme or tech basket. 
5. Set personal limits. On a losing streak? stop trading for a few days to cool off. Maybe stop trading after 3-5 consecutive losses or something. 
6. Learn about the fallacies of sunk cost, anchoring, and so on. Sometimes it's better to eat the loss and move on for better opportunities. This especially applies to options, since the greeks mostly work against you. 
7. Options and greeks are a whole nother can of monsters. 

But, as a long term investor for over a decade, I'm sure you know your way around stocks and the market. Just take the time and patience to learn and become disciplined. If not, it's okay if trading is not for you. Honestly buy and hold combined with DCA usually wins in the long run. Most traders are not profitable. Also its a lot of time and stress to trade actively lol. My forceful break has allowed me to catch up in school, for better or worst."
03/26/2021,stocks,I had to stop trading early in the morning or putting in orders late at night... Rarely was I thinking clearly. Nope I ignore the market until about 30 min after open. Reduces my bad decisions considerably.

03/26/2021,stocks,"By recognizing when I'm being emotional, simply. First I do my homework and then I trade. But if I'm not certain that my next move is not driven by emotions then I do nothing. I'd rather miss gains than take a loss, the later having a bigger negative impact on overall moral in my opinion."
03/26/2021,stocks,Go back and study the trade history especially on stocks that you already so. Then learn from it.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Out of curiosity what do you do for a living?

I ask because every investor has different ways of removing emotion. Personally I’m an engineer so I only  let the technicals make my short term decisions. The animal spirit of the market is profitability predictable with a mathematic approach applying both to the equity’s trend and underlying company. I take longer term risks betting on growth with a backbone of safer dividend earning companies. 

That was more longterm, day trading is only profitable if you lower expectations. Stop losses are crucial. If you’re right set them quick. If you’re wrong back out and wait to re-enter where you left. 

If you’re going to play meme stocks I actively recommend only playing more bearish positions. If you can do it deep OTM call offerings are great. Beyond that DONT HOLD. 20% return fast is a solid return, especially on a stock backed by conspiracy theorists. 

The key point is you held a longterm safe portfolio which likely yielded near 100% returns in the last year. Did you think about it constantly? No. Invest in value not in hype. If even weekly 100% gains were possible we’d all be billionaires. There is no get rich quick scheme unless you assume extreme risk."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I 100% feel you on this. I had a very similar experience. I slowly grew my account over 6 months for 60% gains. Then all the gains were wiped out in 3 weeks. Easy come, easy go.

The biggest and most important thing I keep telling myself: its just money.

The first step of being emotionally detached from your investments is creating an aggregate networth and budgeting plan. A few key questions I use for myself:

* How much money do I have in the market via equities?

* How much money do I make from other income sources?

* If my equities go to zero and don't recover (ie. global catastrophic financial meltdown), how long will it take to get me back to where I am today?

* If my equities see an 80% drawdown (ie. 2001 dotcom, 2008 financial crisis), how long before I can get back to where I am using all income sources?

Creating budgeting strategies lets me sleep better at night. Because if I have a 60% drawdown in my trading portfolio, I know my net worth will only draw down by about 20% because of my aggregate financial asset allocation. And a 20% drawdown in net worth doesn't seem as scary as a 60% drawdown in net worth.

After you've done that, you need to create a manifesto. You need to write down why you're trading. All the existential reasons:

* What is your end goal of trading?

* When will you stop trading?

* How much money is considered ""life changing"" so you have financial independence?

Once you've created your manifesto, now write down your trading strategy and start keeping a log. Restrict yourself aggressively if you know you have weak determination (I do...so I have to be very strict with myself). Here are some trading strategies to get started:

* How many total stocks do you want to own? When I first started out, I didn't want to own more than 10. But I realized that even that was too much, so I pared that back to 5 to get my bearings. Over time I slowly grew that to 10 total stocks. If I ever want to buy a new stock, I force myself to drop an existing stock and make a justified reason as to why I'm buying a new ticker and replacing an existing ticker.

* What is the reason you bought the stock? Is this a momentum trade? If yes, what is your entry/exit points. WRITE IT DOWN. Force yourself to exit when you have written down the entry/exits. Don't try to squeeze every extra dollar. Don't worry if you missed a second pump. Don't hold garbage that tanks after bad news. Is this a conviction trade? Then buy and hold. And when you make more money, buy more. Companies like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN are all conviction trades. You buy and keep accumulating because you have faith they'll keep growing. And there are more volatile conviction trades. I'm a big believer in NET, I think they're putting out amazing products and will 3x in the next 5 years. I'm continuing to add to my position in NET whenever there is a drawdown. I consider NET currently trading at < $70 to be a steal if I zoom out and look at 5 year time horizons. Some people feel the same way about IPOE (SOFI), others about ABNB, and I think TSLA was the biggest conviction trade historically.

* What is your tax implication? When you sell, you have to pay the tax man. How will you store all your proceeds, carve out tax burden and reinvest your earnings?

* How do you handle macro market events? Do you set stop losses? Do you keep extra kindling to buy into dips? Do you just set and forget? You need a strategy that lets you sleep at night. Also, what about the opposite? If you bought a stock and it hits your price target well ahead of schedule. What do you do then? Do you pare back your investment? Do you double down? You need to understand these impacts so you can properly balance your money.

What works for me is writing things down and going back and reading them once a week before I do anything to my portfolio. Without writing things down, you won't commit to a strategy. And write them down on paper. There is a social psychological impact of writing down your convictions with a pen on paper. It reinforces it stronger into your brain and holds you more accountable."

2021-03-26 06:11:58,stocks,"$127 per share rough estimate for Appharvest in Five years Price of Appharvest - $APPH is struggling and being shorted to oblivion, so I'm trying to compare Beyond Meat - $BYND to $APPH projected 5yr Revenue of $467M for a rough estimate of what this company could be worth. According to my estimates (calculations here - [https://i.imgur.com/mRAPmqr.png](https://i.imgur.com/mRAPmqr.png)) it gives an estimated 5yr value of $127/share for $APPH, a potential 7X increase from todays share price of $17.81!

I believe the Shorts are intentionally keeping $APPH low, the amount of shorting is ridiculous, in order to accumulate shares on the cheap, the #AgTech sector could potentially be the new EV Stock a few years from now, especially with traditional farming facing so many challenges with drought, pest, labor shortages, and disappearing farm land due to development!

Appharvest projected figures taken from - [https://novuscapitalcorporation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Project-Agro-Investor-Presentation-vPublic\_2\_AppHarvest-1.pdf](https://novuscapitalcorporation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Project-Agro-Investor-Presentation-vPublic_2_AppHarvest-1.pdf)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Dippy dippy veggie chips, Im in it for the long haul, can’t be bothered by dips.

Can’t wait till they have 5 mega facilities in operation."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks for linking this. Does AppHarvest discuss the strategy on how they plan to successfully grow their business to $467M run rate?

For example, BYND has three go to market strategies:

1. Direct consumer sales - They continue to expand how many stores will carry BYND product

2. Restaurant/FastFood relationships - They recently partnered with McDonalds to offer a green veggie based food line. https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-announces-strategic-global-agreement-mcdonalds

3. Consumer Staples partnerships - They have announced a partnership with Pepsico to offer plant based protein snacks (ie. Frito Lay chips?): https://www.beyondmeat.com/whats-new/beyond-meat-and-pepsico-establish-and-introduce-the-planet-partnership/

I haven't dug into Appharvest, but I agree that AgTech is going to be interesting in the next 10 years. Chris Hadfield was interviewing James Cameron back in November 2020 and James Cameron said that he's focusing his attention on AgTech and technology to solve food insecurity. He said that there is so much mindshare in the EV/cleanpower space that he instead is directing his attention to a space that doesn't have so many eyes on it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYOgs1VO7dA

(Its a long interview but enjoyable)

Also, why is APPH being shorted?

Most stocks have a political or macro reason to be shorted. TSLA was shorted for political reasons, as HF's that were loyal to traditional energy (ie. coal, oil/gas) had vested interests to see TSLA falter. GME was shorted because it was seen as a dying legacy business model in a digital industry. AMC was shorted for similar reasons, as more movies shift from theatres to direct-at-home.

Whats the logical behind APPH is being shorted?

BYND is volatile as the plant base protein space has two head winds:

1. Meat is still seen as a luxury good. And as incomes rise around the world, eating meat becomes a status symbol of wealth. This has been evidenced by the BRIC nations seeing higher meat consumption. Plant based proteins are good for the world as an aggregate, but most people are still concerned about the status symbol that meat provides.

2. Price and economies of scale. Its still cheaper to raise meat in many ways. 


Moreover, just perusing through AppHarvests' website: https://www.appharvest.com/

It looks like they're not focused on the actual go-to-market workflow that BYND is focusing on. They seem more focused on the actual growing. So I don't think this is an apples-to-apples comparison? Why are you comparing BYND to APPH? They don't seem too close to each other in market segment or industry."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Same, can't wait till I can actually buy one of their Tomatoes in Texas as well!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"APPH sells directly to grocers and is planning to sell to fast food vendors in the near future.  Similar to BYND. I agree it’s not a perfect comparison, but somewhat applicable imo."
03/26/2021,stocks,"There's not much to compare APPH with, so BYND, a high growth Food tech company seemed as good as any...  APPH already has their first facility built, currently have 3 more under operation, and is planning to hit 9 facilities by 2025, for a total of 405 Acres.  From their example in the investor deck, their 60 Acre facility is projecting revenues of 42.5M/yr (excluding financing cost), or 0.7083M/Acre, so $287M from all 405 Acres; so not sure where they get their $467M from, but that could be from lower financing cost, depreciation of their facilities, and other accounting stuff...

I'd have to read up more on their Market strategies, but I can see their products being a huge hit as a Premium cost produce in Upscale grocery chains like Wholefoods; the well off folks shopping there don't bat an eyelash at paying more for high quality organic produce that has a good Climate story to it like Appharvest does.

As for why HFs are shorting Appharvest to death....who knows....SPACs as a whole are being shorted to death everywhere, part of it could just be that collateral damage... They are currently valued at 2022 Revenues, but \*shrug\* Wall Street has no qualms about valuing companies like TSLA at Revenues 5-10 years from now.....  My current theory is that shorts are trying to keep the price low to accumulate shares on the cheap, because this could be a runaway stock in a few years.

51% of qqqj holdings are in VO. 

QQQj is new so its YTD performance is 5.34% while VO is 6.34%. 

Qqqj expense ratio is 0.15% while VO is 0.04%.

For reference this is the rest of my portfolio:

VTI 43%

QQM 10%

QQQJ 10%

SCHD 5%

VO 8%

03/26/2021,stocks,"Personally I would drop QQQJ for VO. 

Looking at etfrc.com 88% of qqqj is covered by VTI. so i feel like that would be good to drop. 

Qqqj is tech heavy while VO is the full market of mid cap which in the long run i think is safer. 


What im looking to do is minimzie the number of ETFs i hold, decrease risk (id rather make a consistent low return vs have a higher return with higher risk). I dont wanna have to look at my portfolio every day like i do now."

2021-03-26 04:40:11,stocks,"PSA: It's okay to sell at a loss Lately there has been a lot of ""diamond hand"" mentality out there, and not just with meme stocks. It seems to be a general sentiment about the market as a whole, that we must buy the dip and hold through it. This is a good strategy for your long positions that you are planning on holding for 10+ years, but most people have at least a few positions that are not long-term 'ride-or-die' equities. And yes, there are times when it's fine to sell the dip as well.

The prevailing argument is that, if only everyone would stop selling, the market wouldn't crash. But this is the prisoner's dilemma. The fact is, people will sell. No matter how bonded you feel to your cohorts on Reddit, they will turn against you and sell as soon as they see enough commas in their portfolio. (Or enough blood)

If you are holding shares of some company, and you believe the price of those shares will continue to drop, then what's stopping you from selling? Is it fear that you'll sell at the absolute bottom and miss out on gains? Isn't it just as possible that you'll sell right before an even bigger dip, and be able to buy back in at an even lower cost basis? Both choices are worth considering. It is not rational to simply dismiss the option of selling as inherently bad.

Bottom line: It's OK to buy high and sell higher. It's also OK to sell low and buy lower. Stop trying to get the perfect timing, because you never will. If you're watching your net worth drop to unrecoverable levels, it's time to think about selling. Don't fall in love with your positions. It's a lonely hill to die on.

EDIT: I'm not a financial advisor, but if you're looking to rotate into less risky investments as a hedge, I would recommend learning about SPACs. Most of them are trading at their rock bottom right now, which means you are pretty much guaranteed not to lose money if you know what you're doing. Used correctly, they can be like savings accounts with infinite upside potential. Selling at a loss can suck, but it sucks less when you're putting that money it to something that won't make you poor and might still make you rich. Just my two cents."
03/26/2021,stocks,"You should sell if your play was purely speculation. Why would you sell if your stock has dipped but none of the fundamentals of the company has drastically changed. If your gonma sell, you should have a good reason to. The important factor is to know why you bought in the first place. If you are gonna sell, then you probably shouldve not sold in the first place. Only good reason is if you had another play that would make up or give you more gains than your losses."
03/26/2021,stocks,People love to yell “diamond hands” but there is also “opportunity cost.”
03/26/2021,stocks,...SPACs? That's your safe solution?
03/26/2021,stocks,This is probably going to get downvoted but imo if you're not willing to buy at areas of value and sell at areas of overvalue then you're better off just buying and holding the s&p500 if you're just going to buy and hold. No reason to really even buy individual stocks
03/26/2021,stocks,"That all sounds well and nice, but selling off if the deal goes bad is sometimes not an option. The reality is most of us only have 3 day trades to burn a week, plus that unsettled cash rule and avoiding Good Faith Violations makes it a real challenge.

03/26/2021,stocks,"This is terrible advice. Most people lose money because they get scared and sell during downturns instead of buying the dip. Even people who buy ETFs on average significantly underperform compared to the ETFs they own because they sell at the wrong time.

I could not disagree with you more there. Your net worth has nothing to do with it... unless you need money for bills or something right now, then sure, tough fucking spot.

Otherwise, that’s when you buy!!

The chances are the same that my bet will be right or wrong, the only difference is that I now did lose 5k for sure and need perform 100% to get recoup my losses.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Good reasons to sell if you still believe in the company:
1. Weird market conditions leading to a potential crash. (This might be here now. Depending on how much you believe it, might want to cash out till things drop way more. You also might miss out on another bull run by doing this, so your choice depends on your risk tolerance.)
2. The company actually got overvalued. A good example is ZM. I used to be long ZM because I use it every day for work, and it's gotten a lot better quite quickly, and there will still be uses for it post pandemic. I sold last month right after earnings because it seemed like no one cared about it anymore. I was calculating P/E ratios the other day, and ZM's is actually twice as high as GME's. While I believe in ZM as a company way more than GME, and I know they're different sectors, if we agree that GME is way overvalued (most seem to), then ZM probably is too. I'm not currently invested in either ZM or GME."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I mostly agree, but it depends on the time horizon. If you're not willing to wait years for the fundamentals to drive the share price back to reasonable levels, then you're in for a rough time.

It is possible for a company to have a strong fundamentals, to even be undervalued, and for the share price to still enter an extended decline due to market sentiment.

Truly, all stocks are speculative. Even when you're just looking at the fundamentals, there's still a very real possibility that a good company will fall under hard times. Looking at past success and assuming that success will continue is just as speculative as looking at a market sell-off and assuming that sell-off will continue."
03/26/2021,stocks,I only sell if I'm not comfortable holding the stock at the price I bought it or if I am sure I can make money faster with another stock and then rebuy the initial stock.
03/26/2021,stocks,"The other possibility is that your analysis of the stock is wrong.

By selling and rotating into a less risky sector, I can deduct those losses this year. Plus, I can always buy back after 30 days, still deduct the losses, and then hold until next year. 

It's probably saved me $40k in taxes this year. Granted, I'll have to pay it at some point if the tech stocks recover, but I'd much rather spread it across multiple years as opposed to having to horde a ton of cash this year."

Everyone should have a percentage of their portfolio that they're willing to risk on a single trade (my number is 5%) and if any trade starts to threaten more than that, you should probably sell. This is why stop-loss orders should be a key part of anyone's risk management strategy.

Point is, nobody should be getting anywhere near unrecoverable losses with proper risk management. If you're headed in that direction, you probably made a bad trade and should try to get out of it, not double down."

03/26/2021,stocks,"> I have seen people get berated and abused for talking about selling

I frequent this and a few other investing/stocks subreddits pretty much on a daily basis and have never seen anybody berated and/or abused for selling. 

> it’s ok to sell, if it would prevent catastrophic losses

By the time you know there will be catastrophic losses it’s usually too late. So unless you’re day or swing trading (in which case you should have a sl anyway), it wouldn’t make sense to sell for a big loss unless there’s a major catalyst. Some will say “but opportunity costs” and they wouldn’t be wrong. You are missing out on ***potential*** gains elsewhere. But there’s also a chance that the next stock you put your money in also crashes. So if you bought the stock because you believe in it and none of the fundamentals have changed, the most logical thing would be to hold through dips, and that’s what is most people recommend and I agree. 

Now, if you want to sell that’s cool too. It’s your money. But the saying “time in the market bears timing the market” is popular for a reason. But I’m the end, everyone is different and nobody knows what’s going to happen so do what you think is right for you."
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you buy going up 30, 50, 70, 90 and the stock takes a dip you need to wait and sell at 40, 60, 80, 100. But you might not be able to get 100 and instead eat a loss. But since you made money on the climb you can afford to lose a little by selling all the rest at $80 or $75. Pull your profits gradually and bank them because you might need them at the peak."

I still don’t quite agree tho.

If I originally invest $100 and the stock is down to $50, maybe it will never get back to $100, but if I think it’s going to go back to $80 then it’s smarter to buy than it is to sell.

My point is that the amount of the loss has nothing to do with it, gains/loss moving forward is the only thing that matters."

GME P/S ratio has historically been around .25, so I think the previous poster’s $40 per share is best case scenario once the frenzy subsides. I’d bet on $15 max. However, I think there COULD be support for $40 in the future, but even that’s a big IF.

There are certain things that happen to the market that guarantee something going down. 

Another example, say Biden goes out of his way and says that he's looking into enforcing Marijuana regulations more strictly, what do you think is going to happen to a lot of the pot stocks?

Its not impossible to predict things happening to a stock, its just something that you have to do a fair amount of DD on to make sure you are appropriately weighting the factors effecting it. Somethings serve as greater catalysts than others.

As far as predicting GME, I've been fairly reliable just following the volume. Whenever the volume starts dipping, that's when you suddenly see it drop rapidly in price. Volume starts picking up again, stock goes up. This is largely due to what actually is the reason that GME is priced what it currently is. 

Something similar can be done with domestic oil atm. As soon as I saw the Suez was blocked, I knew that domestic oil producers would get a boon off of this for short term, since the Suez is a major oil shipping highway.

Cohen does really seem to know what he is doing, and from what I've been seeing, everything looks to be going according to plan. That being said, I think we can judge GME (on your numbers) when the Q1 earnings come out. I expect big things there.

03/26/2021,stocks,"The magazine is no longer a profit driver, but helps with brand identity.  A few years ago they switched over to non nude in the magazine.  They are suppose to have great brand recognition  in the all ages including under 40 ( with 40% of customers women).  They are suppose to have amazing brand recognition in China too and their product is everywhere ( they licences the brand, I'm sure they can get better license deals in the future). Your not buying a magazine, but a highly recognizable brand in search of a product ( CBD, sex toys, lingerie, condoms, beauty supplies, themed casinos, branded clothing, etc.)  I think their brand recognition will give them a high return on equity.  Their CEO is the former CFO of match group (think tinder)  and so he should be able to use the brand image well.  I could see this doubling in a year and being a potential 10 bagger in 5.

Also NFTs, which I'm not sure how valuable they will be long term.  They could be a huge growth catalyst in the short term anyhow.  My bullishness on the stock is independent of NFTs, and any benefit from it is a bonus in my opinion.  

In short, there is a lot I like with the stock."

2021-03-26 03:47:23,stocks,"Finding the best buy (basic DD/ discussion): AMD, AMAT, NET, QCOM NET=  $67

-52 week high= $95.77
-BVPS= 2.722
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate -0.13, actually -0.12
-PE= Unavailable 
-ROE= -15.2%
-Net income= -120M
-Operating cash flow= -17M
1 year growth= +197%

I know everyone is saying that NET is a buy and that its a steal at this price... but when you look at the financial profile i just dont see it? I see its up 197% over the year which is a ton. Am i missing something? Outside of it being hit hard by the correction we are in i feel its very high risk

AMD= $76

-52 week high= $99.23
-BVPS= 4.82
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 1.23, actually 1.29
-PE= 237
-ROE= 58%
-Net income= 2.5B
-Operating cash flow= 1.1B
1 year growth= 67%
 
This is one im watching pretty heavily. I feel that the only downside i see to this one is that the PE is so high. However everything else looks solid. They have a heavy hand in the chip/ semi world too. Looking at the one year chart it had a massive upward spike around august/ September and now appears with this dip to be back on its normal trajectory. Its currently running below the 1 year 200 EMA also. And is running at the 5 year 50 EMA. this one to me seems like a for sure buy. Though i suspect this to still fall with the rest of tech for a little while longer. 

QCOM= $127.28

-52 week high= $167.94
-BVPS= 6.5
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 3.93, actually 4.19
-PE= 21.74
-ROE= 95%
-Net income= 5.2B
-Operating cash flow= 5.8B
1 year growth= 95%

Of the 4 listed this one has the lowest PE. It definitely took a little hit with this correction and is down a good bit. This one also had a large run up in 2020 and appears to be normalizing down on its trajectory sitting right above the 50 EMA for the 5 year and below the 200 EMA for 1 year. This company will have a heavy hand in 5G and while last year in my opinion priced a lot of that in i think itll still have a consistent growth which is what i want. It also has a dividend of 2.6 as a nice bonus. 

AMAT= $119.72

-52 week high= $125.8
-BVPS= 12.5
-EPS= FY 2020.. estimate 4.07, actually 4.17
-PE= 28.63
-ROE= 39%
-Net income= 3.62B
-Operating cash flow= 3.8B
1 year growth= +167%

AMAT is a backside play on the semiconductor world. They compared to the rest of the group have removed the best from this dip. I would almost say people are viewing this as a value play since its a manufacturer with a reasonable PE. I am curious if this will actually dip or not since its current running above the 20 EMA for 1 year. But i think this will continue to run as we are in such a massive shortage of chips. 

My order of buy would be 

QCOM
AMAT
AMD
NET

Though i am not convinced i wanna buy NET."
03/26/2021,stocks,"He shoots, he scores! Nothing but NET."
03/26/2021,stocks,"QCOM now faces competition from Apple, who historically has been a major customer.

Apple announced they are working to make their own 5g tech in house."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Where were you up until July of last year when QCOM was dirt cheap?  I stopped buying in January of 2019 because it was already my largest holding 150% of my normal.   Anyway, I sold 2/3 after the run up but I'm still holding a normal size position for me (100 shares at this price) .  

QCOM is solid,  all the companies that deal with them hate the way they sell IP separately from chips and can therefore sell chips at a discount. However,  QCOM survived all the court challenges and have the only functioning 5G capability after IBM dropped out. When AAPL capitulated they signed a five year contract (going off memory here because it's late).  They are very powerful and make money,  lots and lots of money. 

Risks, well,  now that all the legal stuff is settled and they have long term contracts and are the undisputed leader in mobile tech, all that is priced in,  why would it do anything other than go up slowly paying a pittance for dividends (was 5% before).  

Also,  medium term,  IBM could make a better 5G chip (haha), or AAPL could make their own chips ( after the contract expires because they're well-known for making chips haha).

I bought my first set of shares in March of 2015 when their CEO made comments about starting to look at ways to cut costs (this is a normal part of every other business,  but They make too much money to care before that) so the last risk is that they don't have an culture of cost control and the stress is gone.   I held onto a double sized position until after the last earnings call when they didn't raise the dividend.   Dividends impose discipline. 

So yes,QCOM is the best out of the group,  but I'm only keeping it because I want to keep a little exposure to tech."
03/26/2021,stocks,All by NET are in SMH. Plus you get MU and TSM too. And lots others.
03/26/2021,stocks,The P/E for AMD also concerns me but they’ve got solid revenue growth. I’ve been buying a share every time it dips $2 and my average cost per share is still $88 lol
03/26/2021,stocks,"Qcom for the 5G play and PE only 23.  Then AMD, once tsm figures out their shit and gets amd chips made full scale they will kill it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"They might,  in the future,  but as of right now AAPL is buying BOTH the chips and the licenses from QCOM.  If in the future AAPL starts making its own chips,  they still have to buy the licenses from QCOM.   That's why the settlement was such a massive win for QCOM."
03/26/2021,stocks,Unfortunately i wasnt investing back then. But i really enjoyed your input. I definitely feel its a good long term hold
03/26/2021,stocks,I currently own SMH its 5% of my portfolio
03/26/2021,stocks,The biggest attraction to AMD right now is the price compared to where it was. Though that PE scares me
03/26/2021,stocks,AMD P/E is only like 38 according to TDA and Finviz. Where did you get 236
03/26/2021,stocks,That would change my opinion on it tho...
03/26/2021,stocks,Thats the assigned PE from webull
03/26/2021,stocks,can confirm TDA lists it at 38.41x PE
03/26/2021,stocks,AMDs PE almost halved after last earnings report it’s under 40 they are absolutely killing it.

2021-03-26 03:13:39,stocks,"Is it wise to consider dividends as a possible safeguard against losses? I'm considering buying stocks of a company that has quite a good div. yield.

The stock has been on a downtrend for some time but I have done some DD and checked their financials several times and I think at some point they should rebound and their market cap should better match their EV / EBITDA and book value. They're at a very low P/E multiple now compared to similar stocks.

I see there has been quite a good resistance... let's say... around X value.

Even during the pandemic, they paid dividends in cash and in stock. They have a very sufficient reserve for future dividends right now sitting in their last financial report. I expect they could deliver around 4% of their current market cap just in cash dividends.

Am I safe to assume that then I have a safeguard in case their price drops less than 4%?

Note: I'm not talking about a US stock so please detach this a bit from the current correction situation. This should be just about considering this dividend strategy in a vacuum.

Bonus question if you feel like answering: what about stock dividends? This company gives a lot of stock dividends and I normally don't see the price have a similar drop, so that their overall market cap has been growing year after year. Can that also be considered as part of a positive outcome?

Thanks!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Overall I would say yes. My portfolio is about 70% dividend stocks and 30% growth stocks. During the bull market run my growth stocks like AAPL, PLTR, TSLA and SFT did really well while my dividend stocks like JNJ, PEP, and LMT didnt do bad but they grew slowly. Specifically my REIT traded flat the whole time. During this market sell off my growth stocks are doing terrible while my dividend stocks are doing really well right now. Now my REIT is moving up everyday. Overall they do provide a hedge because they tend to be less volatile at least the ones I own."

[https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=UCTT](https://csimarket.com/stocks/growthrates.php?code=UCTT)

some highlights from the link above:

Y/Y growth of 29%, and 5 year average growth rate of 24.4% (for comparison, corresponding values for S&P are -3.24 and 7.37, Tech:7.9% and 12.6%, Semis: 15.9% and 12.8%)

**Profitability (👍👍)**

Also, detailed tables here

[https://csimarket.com/stocks/Profitability.php?code=UCTT](https://csimarket.com/stocks/Profitability.php?code=UCTT)

Some highlights:

operating/net margin is considerably lower than industry (e.g. average 5 year margin of 6% compared to industry average of 21%)

**Market Outlook (👍👍👍👍)**

According to the most recent [world fab forecast](https://www.semi.org/en/news-resources/market-data/world-fab-forecast-report-highlights-q1-2021) report from SEMI, the WFE market is expected to expand by 15.5% to $74.6B in 2021. In comparison, the WFE market grew by 16% in 2020. It is expected to grow by 12% to $83.6B in 2022.

UCTT  has not given a guidance for all of 2021 (except that they will try to beat the WFE market by 10%), which they have managed to do in each of the last 5-6 years. This implies that their target is roughly 25% annual growth in 2021.

**Valuation (👍👍👍👍)**

As of today, the PE is 27.5. At first I thought this was so cheap because I was comparing to the big names in the semis (e.g. ASML: 57, NXPI: 1063 (WTF!),). But comparing to competitors it seems very close in valuation (e.g. ICHR:32, MKSI:27)

However, forward PE seems quite attractive, just 16 for next year (according to [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uctt/price-earnings-peg-ratios](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/uctt/price-earnings-peg-ratios))

**Market share (??)**

Was not able to get proper information on how the market share is compared to competitors.

**Conclusions ( )**

I like the stock:-)

It is having a great run lately  (17% 1month, 70% YTD, 151% 6M), and still holding well in the tech pullback lately. The company is still only has a 2.1B market cap and provides an essential service to some of the biggest names in the semi-conductor industry. I won't be surprised if this one goes 2x or even 3x the next couple of years.

I don't own any shares yet, but planning to dip my toes in it soon.

PS: This is my first attempt to do a proper DD, so be gentle in your feedback :-)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"40 percent sales are to LAM, 20 percent to Applied Materials. I bought this in December on the TSM news. It trades like LAM on 10x leverage. This is an incredible company that is the biggest beneficiary of increased spending by foundries. It is going one layer deeper than the semi equipment names. I expect huge things for this company for the very least the next 3 years. It is still cheap."

2021-03-26 02:37:30,stocks,"For diversified portfolios, how long on average do you guys spend on DD and research on individual company’s stocks prior to investing? To each their own..

But I have seen posts on here with people stating it takes on average of 500 - 1k hours for them to go through an individual companies research, especially if you are not experienced in the industry or sector. 

This includes going over the fundamentals, 10k, quarterly releases, listing to phone calls, quality of management, sector comparison etc.

This is just with regards to building enough knowledge about each industry and company’s overall financial health and ability to create a sustainable competitive advantage among competitors. 

Basically, how much research on average is spent on analyzing and evaluating just to build a high conviction rate about each opportunity based on a solid understanding of the company’s fundamentals as well as political, economical and social catalysts that may affect the market, the economy, and more important your long term investments?

Any additional opinions, suggestions and advice? 

I myself, apply a top down approach for fundamentals and a integrated combination of strategic + tactical and dynamic asset allocation approach for rebalancing my portfolios. 

I don’t use DCF models. 

Thanks! :)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"The problem I think with investing so much time in DD, is you're literally wasting precious time of your life. If you're a millionairte / billionaire living of your investments, go ahead and learn about the company! 

But from 50 hours to 1000 hours, is there really gonna be a very big difference on your dd? 

Even if your assumptions are true because you did 900 more hours of DD, an unpredictable event could happen, which would mean you've wasted a good thousand hour for nothing. 

IMO, in about two hours from reading and looking at balance sheet, you can already know if it is worth continuing your investigation in a company. You have enough time to look at the product they offer, their plan for the future, their history, profitability, future expectations, etc.

Then, I think it is worthwhile looking at competitors or similar companies to see how they are doing, if the sector looks prosperous, etc. 

I've been investing for less than a year, so people might not find me credible or whatever, and you probably won't too. Im not experimented enough to make accurate predictions based on current and future numbers, but I think I can damn well know if a company has a chance to have a good future or not, with a 4-5 hours of research. As I said, I won't be able to predict exact values, but at least I will know how their business work, how it is better than similar companies, and what I should look out for in the news."
03/26/2021,stocks,"500 to 1k hours sounds like overkill for just one company, unless you intend to make a massive decision. Even so, by elimination you could probably pass on most companies after a look at basic things like a balance sheet and income statements within an hour. 500 hours at 8 hours a day would take over two months to complete. I can't help but think that after just a day's worth of work, you don't begin to suffer huge diminishing returns for your efforts. By the end of those two months, your work may not even be valid anymore."
03/26/2021,stocks,Bro you can get a finance degree in that time 😂
03/26/2021,stocks,"I try to make as many bear arguments as I can, if the stock gets through most of those then I feel comfortable investing. There is so much information available to investors that we eventually get to a point where more information increases our emotional confidence in the position but wont add value to the decision-making. As in, if you spend more time making a decision, you may feel better about that decision because of the time spent on it, but it doesnt mean you will have better returns."
03/26/2021,stocks,"500 to 1000 hours would, at 8 hrs a day, would be 13-25 work weeks. That seems.....not feasible."

03/26/2021,stocks,2m for a etf?! I usually look into a etf a little longer and do dd’s on their holdings. That’s way to short for any type of dd.
03/26/2021,stocks,That’s not his question
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah, 2 or 5 at most. I don't do any indepth research if I'm  holding known ETFs like Vanguard Growth (VUG), S&P Value (SPYV) or Russell 2000 (VTWO) & muncipality bonds  MUB which is what I have now..

I've had other ETFs like Franklin Templeton country ETFs and Fidelity sector ETFs...I've just glanced through on holdings and its sector wireghtings to see how it's constructed.

My retirements accounts are all index funds - s&p,midcap, small cap, developed international, emerging, REIT index fund....

Just a glance into the holdings was sufficient to know what's in it.


ETFs have anywhere from 100 to 2000 holdings. How do you do dd on even 50% of them??? What kind of dd on the individual holdings would you be doing?"
03/26/2021,stocks,He asked how much DD. My DD is buy lots of TXN. Always. What's wrong with that?
03/26/2021,stocks,Ok so if I ask you the CEO of the top holding and what’s you record you’ll be able to answer that without 3rd party help? Ik not saying look at all 100 but the top 10 which make up 40+%. Knowing what in it versus knowing who’s controlling your money and the knowing companies it backs are very important.
03/26/2021,stocks,She asked how long is ‘your’ dd. Not what is. Also if you have a 100% TXN position I’d recommend you reconsider.
03/26/2021,stocks,"yeah, so if I'm just going for the standard or core  ETFs that are constructed to follow their respective indexes, I just need to take a glance through yahoo finance or morning star or even my  brokerage account to see what the top holdings and other holding weightages are and get feel for the fund's construction. I'm trying to get some the benefit of some factor diversification that the underlying index offers and not some specific stock's fundamental's benefit. 

If you are going for some thematic / edge case ETFs, sure, makes sense to do a lot of research. I don't hold any unicorn ETFs as I don't have time or the tools to do that kind of research.."

2021-03-26 01:41:43,stocks,"Price corrections and pullbacks are normal. Don't panic. Too many idiots and doomers here are thinking that this signals the ""end of tech stocks"" or that it's a sign that you should invest in some Boomer stocks, bonds, or something excessively safe. No. It's a price correction, and the end of highly overpriced valuations. If you have rational faith in a company and its future growth, then just fucking hold and buy the dips when possible. If you're down even 50%, as long as you aren't in some very risky, iffy positions, you will make it back in time. It might take even a few years, but hopefully, the new retail investors/traders have learned their lessons now.

Just because NASDAQ is suffering a correction on the order of months, it doesn't mean that tech or growth stocks overall don't have a future on the order of years. And anybody who tells you otherwise is either salty because they bought high or just wants to feel better about their slow-growth positions. Just avoid speculating and do your own DD.

Anyways, to put this into personal context, I've probably lost more than the majority of you on this subreddit (over 30% of my port), but even I think that the lessons I've learned during this past few months will make me a much better investor and trader from here on out. I started investing late and missed almost all of the tech/growth stocks rally during the past year. I jumped into my positions about a month before this recent price correction started and lost a massive amount of money, largely also because I borrowed off of margin. So in other words, I borrowed off of margin during basically the worst time possible, and I also used it on some of the most meme-y, fad stocks (including EV, ARK ETFs, you name it), so I suffered some of the largest losses. But I'm not gonna lose hope, and you shouldn't either, because I know that time in the market beats timing the market anytime. 

Just wait and you'll make everything back as long as you've learned from your mistakes, whether that be buying when things are high, FOMOing into growth stocks when they're long due for a pullback, or being scared to just hold or buy through the dips. And ofc, if you don't want to trust me because I'VE made some shitty moves in these past few months, then you don't have to, but this post also paraphrases loads of advice given to me from much more experienced investors and traders. Take it as you wish. Think of me (or at least who I've been) as the example of what not to do."
03/26/2021,stocks,That’s why I only invest in etfs. Averaging down and knowing it will always go back up is peace of mind

I wish people had to post their experience and dollar amount so we actually knew who we were talking to. If I had to guess, your young and just joined this market within recent months or maybe within the past year, the amount is something under 10k, and your primarily in hydrogen, genomics, or spacs...and....you reasoning for this is hype and not financials of companies.

03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't even think you are being optimistic by saying 20% this year. Seems highly realistic, especially if this ""correction"" is anything like the bear market from the last year when all this COVID mania started.

Not to draw any parallels to the 2020, but we are witnessing massive inflow of new retail investors. Someone with no equity has first to become a buyer to be able to become a seller. That pushes the demand higher, constantly. That is primarily, in my opinion, what makes USA market grow while other markets struggle to bounce from crisis/recessions, other markets have problems with volume and liquidity since. I am from Europe and I know the financial culture of this market. 

For example, in my country, on the stock exchange, average volume for LIQUID equity is minimal. Today - most traded stock's volume was under 200 000$ total. I invest in companies listed on USA stock exchanges. I have only one positon on my national market because of the great dividend, and that is all.

2021-03-26 01:28:55,stocks,$BBW value play Ive been doing some research trying to find companies that are still undervalued and due for a bit of a turnaround. I came across build a bear workshop. I didnt even know they were publicly traded so i figured i would spend a few minutes looming into them because why not. They smashed their earnings with .40 eps instead of an expected -.16eps. They did 255 million in revenue last year with i believe 90 million coming in the fourth quarter. This company has a market cap of 122 million as of market close today. Their revenue per share was 17.11. There are 15 million shares with a float of a little over 11 million. You can use any valuation you want or compare it to any other mallbased retailers and they should be trading at at least 2x the current market value. I pulled all of this off yahoo finance. Im sure there are downsides to this business but that revenue per share has me interested any input?
03/26/2021,stocks,I would wait an earnings or two.  Highly specialized retail like that is bound to take some punches during financial issues

03/26/2021,stocks,"I agree that it's easier/faster to learn when you have real money on the line. It's hard to say what strike price (ITM, ATM, or OTM) you should use or how far out to buy your options since it depends on a lot of different factors. For buying simple long calls, as an example if I think the underlying will increase significantly in the near future but I'm not entirely sure on the timeline then I might target an ATM call with an expiration 3-6 months out. This gives me plenty of time to wait for my target profit to be achieved without needing to worry so much about theta decay in the short term. The debit premium will be more of course though.

You should take a look at https://optionstrat.com or www.optionsprofitcalculator.com and play around with the features to see how profit/loss and the cost of options are affected by different things like your strike price, expiration, implied volatility, etc. It is easier to understand when you see a visual representation. Also read about implied volatility since it is perhaps less intuitive to understand but critically important. If IV is too high you might consider not purchasing long calls at all since they are likely to get IV crushed, and maybe opt for a debit spread instead or some other play."

2021-03-26 00:49:31,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 25, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 25, 2021**

Stocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet another volatile trading session. Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. 

In an interview with NPR's Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency."" This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. 

However, despite Powell’s consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, “This will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it’ll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they’re most needed.” 

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, “We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what’s going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve”. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it’s time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

We agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Earlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, [insisting the vaccine was “strongly effective” against the virus. ](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d)

2021-03-26 00:18:06,stocks,"Looking to invest about $150,000, need advice on what and if now is a good time I have a trust that was set up for me over 10 years ago, and in that time it hasn't gained much even before the pandemic happened. So I decided to take a more active roll and request a portion of it to be moved to some better stock(s). But I need some advice on what to invest in and if now is a good time.  
So if you had that much to invest, where would you put it?  
Are there any high risk/possible high reward stocks you'd be willing to invest $10,000-$15,000?"
03/26/2021,stocks,First advice. Go somewhere other than Reddit.
03/26/2021,stocks,"And you came here ?? LoL.  
Index fund it, my man. 
Unless you take a small portion, like 5% and learn to play the gamble."
03/26/2021,stocks,"you might not have a vote in how the trust is managed. 

the trustee is legally obligated to follow the terms of the trust.  they don't get a vote, either. this is a big deal: trustees are held to a very high standard. if the trust says invest in X, Y and Z and nothing else, they can't wake up one day and randomly decide to also invest in A, B and C. so your first step is to understand the terms of the trust and any limitations placed on management for assets. if the trust says to keep it all in a stable low-interests money market account ... that's what will happen. you don't get a vote. 

beyond that, if you do get a vote, I would not take advice from strangers on the internet about stocks. I would just move a portion of the money to a low-fee index fund or ETF of some type, or possibly talk to a few good CFPs and/or buy some boring blue chip dividend paying stocks. nothing too exciting."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Most of it should be in a set of broadly diversified ETFs or index funds. But don't dump it all in at the same time. No one knows which way the market will go. Put in 5% each week or two.  If there is a sudden drop of over 5% after adding, add more right away."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I agree with most people here that you should only consider input as opinion, but that if you’re able to control the investment, stick mainly to broad index funds. Something like 60% VOO, 20% VXUS, 5% cash, and the last 15% into sector ETFs and “safe” stocks if you’re young. But also don’t just dump everything in at once.

Just my personal opinion on how I’d do it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"A couple of questions for you.. 

1. Are you prepared to lose your entire trust? over 90 percent of new investors and trades lose everything.. 
2. What do you know about the markets? Do you know what makes them go up and down? Do you think the dopes on CNBC REALLY have retail trades best interests at heart? If you do, you're living in fantasy land. 
3. Do you think some online service you can sign up with is going to make you a winner?? Why do you think they are selling internet subscriptions? One would think if they were successful traders/investors that they wouldn't need to.. 

You want to start trading? Open up a SMALL account.. Start paper trading for a couple of months and see how you do.. Then nibble a little.. Going all in with your money is NOT advisable. Good luck to you.."
03/26/2021,stocks,It is the absolute worst time to invest that money.
03/26/2021,stocks,Honestly it’s not a good time
03/26/2021,stocks,"Third this. What I would also do is go ahead and get setup on a broker that allows paper trading.

Paper trading is where you trade fake money for fake positions that actually updates with the stock market. If you are new to stocks in general, this can be a vital tool for building literacy."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’ve been playing with $50, and making myself imagine it’s a larger amount of money so I can learn the risks with just a small amount"
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you compare against two of the best performing stocks if the last decade, almost any portfolio will fall short.

The real question is how has it performed relative to the SP500 benchmark.  Ask them for that comparison or figure out for yourself 

If they matched the S&P 500 they did fine.  If they didn't, fire them and move your money to low expense ratio broad market mutual funds.

Then spend some time educating yourself.  If you think you must trade individual stocks, limit to 5% of your portfolio to start.

You'll find out quickly that picking winners beforehand is a lot harder than identifying them after the fact."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm not a financial advisor, but you may want to see about hiring an actual financial advisor for real who can guide you.  I mean personally, I have a combo of long term holds and day trades, the long terms aren't as sexy but they're still up more than the lame 1.5% my highest yield savings acct offers currently.  If you're just wanting someone to throw some tickers out at you & hope for the best, chances are you're gonna say goodbye to a chunk of that 150k.  Consistent & steady growth would be a diversified mix of ETFs, they manage the individual stocks in each group instead of you doing all your own research.  Best thing I can say is read up as much as you can and decide what' important to you - do you like the green energy sector, tech, cannabis stocks, retail, construction, etc and give it a try.  Definitely start a little at a time & expect to see both red days & green days.  Good luck to you!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"> I haven't seen a lot of growth with what the trust is currently invested in so I'm just looking to take a portion(about 150k) of the trust and try putting that in some better stocks.

do you have that authority? I mean, the trust is not your property. assets held in the trust are owned by the trust, managed by the trustee for your benefit. you may not have any say whatsoever in how the trust is managed. in fact, it's *probable* you have no vote: the entire point of a trust is for X to manage the money on behalf of Y because the grantor believes X is not capable of managing money themselves."
03/26/2021,stocks,"> I thought stonks only went up.

Do you get the joke yet?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I know - that’s why I picked the lower estimate (x3/y rather than x8/y). 8x year-on-year growth would be o er £1billion per share.

03/26/2021,stocks,"I didn't say 3x every single year. I meant 3x 10 years from now compared to where it is today.

2021-03-26 00:09:56,stocks,"Should I sell to consolidate ETFs? I started investing in 2019, and until this year it consisted of googling broad ETFs and throwing a few thousand into each (QQQ, VOO, IVV, SPY, and many others). Now that I’m actually putting effort into learning what I’m investing in and moving into single company stocks, I’d like to consolidate these just to simplify my portfolio. 

Good idea? Or is it a better idea to just leave them as is to avoid the taxes from realizing gains?

Thank you!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"SPY covers about 80% of VTI. so I'd pick one or the other. VTI covers the entire US market (about 85% large companies, 15% mid size and 5% small). in contrast, VOO covers most of the large companies and part of the mid-size. 

QQQ overlaps considerably with both VTI and VOO, but is dominated by large tech companies and doesn't have anything else ... no Johnson & Johnson, etc."

There are specific hedge fund strategies that look to be a combination of long and short within equities, i.e. “130/30” is 130% long equity and 30% short equity with net exposure of 100%.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Basically: when they shorted at $10-15/share, when the price hit $110-360, they were down 1,000 - 2,000%. Nobody can stomach that type of loss, unless you have some sort of tiny position. If they short $1 billion at $10, that's massively different than shorting $1B at $200. Technically the share price could go up 1000-2000% from there, but it is much more unlikely.  
Now the other question: if the shorts have supposedly covered and there is only 20-25% short interest, why is it impossible for me to short it, and the shares are officially ""Hard To Borrow?"" Where are these supposed shares?"

03/26/2021,stocks,Equity should not be mistaken for equities as in stocks. That said I doubt that many hedges have short positions and treasuries without any long equities. Why do you think?
03/26/2021,stocks,"They might have enough collateral to cover for two years, but the fact is no equities manager is going to propose to his boss that they spend 12B continue to ride a train straight to hell."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Don't discount, Fidelity, though. They're on a higher level with their fuckery. By just sitting on the sidelines and not restricting trade, they captured the lion's share of the mass exodus from RH, Webull, and TDA. They also didn't end up getting grilled by Congress. Also, who offers both of the other funds to their investors?They show up in the top 10 investors almost everywhere that you find BlackRock and Vanguard. One difference is Charles Schwab, who owns TDA. Look up their top two investors (by an enormous amount), and notice who's not on that list. 2021 is going to be a crazy year in finance! They're currently culling the herd."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Honestly, I had 100 GME shares around $84. Had to paper-hand those for unforseen expenses. When I got my ship righted, GME was already moving back up heavily. When I chose AMC, it appeared as if the momentum had shifted in that direction, to me, anyway. I think both are great plays, and I also think they're intertwined, relying upon the momentum of the other. I disagree with the one or the other mentality. 

Both have made great strides to return to prominence and I think they will both impress over the next few quarters. I just think GME will have a harder time holding its current valuation than AMC. I think AMC could easily return to its $20-$30 per share valuation, in time. Again, that double or triple, which is a very modest target for my typical strategies, is way better than the losses that others are currently printing in non-meme stocks. It way outperforms the losses that I would have incurred if I maintained my previous positions. This was a defensive move to preserve capital, by not trying to buck the trend. It's working out rather nicely, in hindsight. The squeeze would just be gravy."

03/26/2021,stocks,"It's not about keeping each other afloat. It's about self interest and contractual agreements. Lenders don't just set margin requirements on a whim, they're agreed to in advance. If a lender started trying to actively screw with a borrower and tried to call collateral in excess of the percentage that was agreed upon, they'd find themselves without clients. 

And Citadel's deal with Melvin was far from a friendly boys club agreement. They saw they were in a rough spot and forced them to hand over a piece of their company for their loan. Citadel did it because they saw an easy way to make a ton of money, not because they wanted to help out a competitor."

03/26/2021,stocks,What does this data tell? HFs covered their short positions for gme?
03/26/2021,stocks,Because the whole idea is to benefit from growth of the markets not to conquer them. Every investor wants the markets to be strong and healthy. The collective size of the hedge funds gives them a huge advantage over individual investors so they feed off each other and take money from fools who play the markets like a roulette wheel. They all want to maintain that edge.
03/26/2021,stocks,You don’t think they figured it out over a pint or two down at The Full Schilling? Or they pass cash back and forth all the time? Of course there’s no free lunch but it helps to have friends. Guess why the short squeeze hasn’t and won’t work.
03/26/2021,stocks,"They'll buy out at a loss, then? Again, their margin interest is low, it doesn't compound. Inflation will decrease losses even further. And worst come to worst, hedge funds have been at the receiving end of losing trades before. It doesn't scare them as much as you think to take a hundred million in losses. But it takes tremendous effort to keep the Game Stop train going for **years** to force them to take those losses. Retail investors are getting tired because not all of them are winning. Not by a long shot. Most people who go into Game Stop lose their money. How long do you think this can go on?"

03/26/2021,stocks,I 100% agree - Matt Levine had a column about this right after the January Gamestop fiasco where it seems to greatly benefit retail. I can't wrap my head around how retail investors lose using payment for order flow  - the numbers don't make sense. I think most of the people pushing this narrative were not buying stocks when they had to pay $5 fees/trade - and have now bought into this narrative that PFOF is this conspiracy worked up by hedge funds to screw over Generation Z.

03/26/2021,stocks,"No, you don't understand what they use PFOF for. They don't use it to extract recoup from lower fee's. They use it to recorder the payment flow so they can maximize profit. That maximization of profit isn't a few cents per order, it can be millions. 

You can say that it benefits the small investor BUT you don't understand they are being ripped off by the manipulation of stock through those reorderings. Citadel just isn't a MM, it is a hedge fund. The very fucking people making the market, ordering the payments, is also trying to take every last cent of the market to put in their pocket.

If they are n competition with small investors what's to stop them from reordering the fee's in such a way as to distort the price of the stock? What's to stop them from reordering the trades so that it pushes the stock in the direction they want?

I.e., when people put in market orders and they reorder so that they order buys to drive the price higher then short the stock to then drive it lower. 

These guys aren't doing this shit just to extract a penny of a share. They are doing it to manipulate the entire market so they can extract billions. Citadel makes around 5B a year now. It has it's hands in everything.  It's goal is to maximize profits... not to play fair. It doesn't give a shit about some individual losing money. The market is zero sum. They want it all. You don't start a hedge fund if you are not one of the greediest fucks on the planet."

Brokerages can't use a market maker unless it's the same or better price than nyse is offering. 

Market makers mostly just match trades in the dark pool with trades in retail and pocket the spread. There's always a spread, because dark pool can trade in fractions of a penny. 

It makes 5b a year, but does literally 40% of all trades in the market. That sure sounds like less than a penny  a share  to me. Feel free to do the math if you don't believe me."

I personally believe this will all be over within a month - I strongly believe the bull market will return - but until then, I... don't know how to make money with swings. I'm heavily invested in swinging (*not so much day trading, but the few times i've done it, it was very profitable for me... minus the GME fiasco, lol. Haven't touched those meme stocks in a long time, never will again*) and I would say 80% of my profit comes from those, but now that the market isn't performing well, it feels like its best to wait it out. 

However, I'm trying to see if theres any way i could make SOME profit in the meantime. I'm not asking to make 1k a day, but is it possible to make something like $100 in 3 days? Maybe I get more invested into day trading? puts perhaps (I'm very inexperienced in puts, but i'd be more than glad to learn).

2021-03-25 22:40:56,stocks,"Mom left me some money Mom died last July from suicide and insurance paid out 80k. I suffer from anxiety and have been keeping it in my savings. I knew I should invest it, but the fear of losing my mom's gift to me was debilitating. Now I'm on wellbutrin and it's helped me alot. 

Yesterday I woke up and opened a brokerage account and shoved 500$ into AMD, INTEL, FORD, and some of that game store stock. (Hehehe)

After breakfast I took 60k and parked it in a high interest savings account for now. .55%

During lunch I took 10k and put in into a 10 year fidelity GO 60/40 account. (I have mixed feelings about bonds but it's better than letting it sit in savings.)

Not sure what to do now. I'd like to keep at least 20k available in case I decided to buy a house. But beyond that I'm just not sure. Still worried there is a bubble In the economy and scared shitless I'm going to lose this gift.


Edit- about game stocks, I only have half a week's net wages in it. Nothing crazy.

I really appreciate All the advice. I'm going to be busy looking up dividends, indexes, fiduciaries and reference your comments in the future.

As for that guy at the bottom, who said I'm bragging... Id give everything I have and MORE to have my mom back and in good heath."
03/26/2021,stocks,"First of, I can't even imagine the magnitude of your loss. But I offer the deepest condolences my friend. 

Second, if you really want to get some returns out of the money your mum left you - you're starting on the right food by investing, saving some hard cash (emergency fund) and parking a lot of it in savings accounts. But if you really want to see sizable returns (with the guarantee you probably won't lose the initial 80K), then I'd get on Investopedia in your free time and just read through the basics of investing. In the meantime, I would take 30K out of the 60K in your savings and spread it over multiple ETFs in your brokerage account. Look at these tickers: $QQQ, $SPY, $VOO, $GLD, $VUG. These are all great ETF's to invest. They all average about 10-15% annual returns. So let's say you want to diversify and not just pick one ETF - I would put $6K into each of those for a total of $30K. 

\*\*This is in no way investment advice, but this is how I started off myself.\*\*

Third, while your money gets its returns from the savings accounts and the brokerage, use the remaining of the money you have left and use it for yourself. As u/ruubduubins said - do and invest in things that would make your life happier, better and calmer. There's nothing in the world that compares to your inner peace. Go get it.

The last few days have been the lowest lows anyone has seen in a while so I’ve been buying the dip (buy when everything is really far down so you can just ride them back up when everything recovers). Yes my portfolio is down but I love buying the dip cause it feels like a discount. I know that everything i’m buying is stuff I won’t sell for at least 10 years so i’m fine. But one last thing, and it’s very important, only invest what you are okay with losing, and when you do invest your money (if you choose too) treat it like you just bought Mcdonald’s with that money and you just ate the food, it’s gone so you don’t care if it’s up or down, it will really help in the long run trust me."

03/26/2021,stocks,"If you take ANY advice for here take this advice
1. Do nothing for 1 year (close)
2. Speak to a financial PLANNER!! Not Broker Not anyone at a Bank No insurance agents, why, everybody!!!! Except the planner works on commission. Aside from what your mom left you must discuss your entire financial picture, is this a small fraction of what else you have OR is this now 90% of what you have.  What other savings or emergency savings do you have (it should be a minimum of 3 months total expenses) do you currently have any credit card debt? Car pmts? Payday loans? Owe friends or family any money?  Is your job secure or are you planning on leaving within a year? Do you have health insurance? Disability insurance?  You DO NOT NEED life insurance unless you take care of someone (family) and if you die what happens to them? These are some of many questions you need to answer before putting $100 into any stocks or investments.  You’ve been given enough money for a very good start on your life’s journey, you shouldn’t be afraid of losing or spending it UNLESS you don’t have a plan, at least a 5 year plan.  I’ve helped people with this for almost 35 years and I’ve seen some real sad cases that just could not be fixed, be smart and oh yeah, whatever stock or investing advice you get here is just pretend with play money, this isn’t for you.  Tell nobody about the $$$$, not “friends” old family you haven’t seen for years, etc. they’re there for your money and nothing else!! Good luck and be safe.  Feel free to ask me whatever you want but PLEASE take this post seriously."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m sorry to hear about your lost. I wish you the best, and good luck with investing."
03/26/2021,stocks,"OP. I'm sorry about your mom. Definitely don't bet the whole farm (80k) on meme stocks or day trading. You can lose everything. It's good for learning, though. put in a couple hundred and play with it. Definitely save up for a downpayment on a house. I'm not sure where you live, but 20k for a house isn't a lot. You need to pay lot of fees and with any home, you're looking at renovations. 

You should look into Roth IRAs, like with Vanguard. Fidelity is good too."
03/26/2021,stocks,"1. Define what you want

Do you want absolute security?
Could you life with a (temporary or real) loss of 20%? 50%? 100%? 

How fast will you need the money? 
will you need it to pay for some tuition fees or a plumber? Do you want to save it to buy a house? Or are you well off, and can add the money to your pension fond ? (Aka. 6 months, 5 years, 40 years?)

2. Select assets that you can trust and understand.
If you don't know how a future contract on gourds works: DO NOT BUY IT.
If you need 100% security buy AAA bonds (Germany, Switzerland, United States) or just keep it on a savings account.
If you can tolerate some volatility and want to make some gains without understanding the stock market properly (!) Just buy a MSCI WORLD and a MSCI emerging markets ETF(in the ratio 70/30). That is already a good strategy and over-performs the typical chaos investor quite a bit.
if this is gambling money for you, than say goodbye to your money and invest it in some aburde ForEx derivate and watch it shrink by the minute.

3. MOST IMPORTANT
SELECT AN EXIT STRATEGY!!!!!
under what circumstances do you sell? Imagine: The market just collapsed, your ETF is down 40%. What do you do. Think that through. Get familiar with the decision. If you decide to hold (and that is mostly the smartest choice), STICK TO IT! SAY NO TO EMOTIONS. don't buy or sell quickly, unless you are ABSOLUTELY experienced.

To sum it up: keep 3-6 months wages aside on an ""emergency fond"". Don't use that to buy anything that is not necessary for the continuation of your life. (Plumper: yes / XBox: no!) Refill that fund as soon as possible if you take something out of it.
Put the rest in world wide diversified ETFs. 
If you really want some action and gain experience, select 10% of your portfolio to buy stocks. That's it. If you, in a year or so, still find it interesting and you have read a lot about it, slowly increase your risk-part of the portfolio. Never above 30-40%.

And don't talk about money! Use the internet, not your strange MLM uncle, to get informed."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sorry about your mom.

If you want low stress ways to invest your money I would personally look into some index ETFs.  VOO & VTI are my top 2 recommendations.
QQQ or one of its variants if you like tech.

I'd keep some liquid in a ""high yield"" online savings just in case.  

The stock market goes up and down, so if you are truly worried about losing your gift, you may have to mentally prepare yourself.  60-80k is a lot for someone not used to the churn.  I would start with 10-20k at first to notice it's movements and get accustomed, then build up.  Or just don't look at it since it's a long term investment."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Intead of a high interest account, I would park it into some high dividend accounts.

My big two are T & ETV; ETV pays .11 cents/month and probably as stable as you can get. 60k into that grabs you about $440 in dividend each month qnd relatively low risk investment. My 2 year old's account is 100%in there. At 20,000 shares you could easily retire [that's what in building up towards]

Not financial advice though."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't plunk it all into the market at once. Instead, start to put $500-$1000 per month into a general S&P 500 ETF like VOO and just watch it grow year over year. Safest way to invest, period."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Sorry for your loss. I know no amount of money can put you at ease, but you can use it make your life a little easier.

If you buy a house, it is always a good idea to pay off the mortgage. A dollar into your mortgage is effectively a risk-free 3% since you would otherwise be paying 3% interest.

Get a broker like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade. They will be happy to help. They can help you asses your risk tolerance. Something like stocks are relatively risky, even the safer stocks are much riskier than something like bonds or a high interest savings account. Your broker can help you gauge how much risk you are willing to take and what you should invest in.

A good concept it dollar cost averaging. Essentially the idea is you put $1000 into your investment every week, say every Tuesday morning. Up or down. This let's you avoid getting in and it crashing right after you get in. It also takes the emotion out of the equation since you have a schedule."

03/26/2021,stocks,Hmm. Maybe look at buying a house instead. That would be a big down payment. Make sure you can afford a mortgage but interest rates are still cheap. Odds are that you’ll make more on a home than any stock. Best of luck and wishes.
03/26/2021,stocks,"you can get 1% apy from some accounts like m1 finance. free. might be worth looking into,"
03/26/2021,stocks,"First, sorry for your lost and glad you are feeling better mentally. 

This question has plenty of “it depends” answers. Im going to make a few assumptions. You are single, do not own a house, and do not have any dependents. 

If where you live you can put that money into a down payment for a house and your income can support the mortgage + home ownership costs, then I’d suggest you definitely go the down payment route. 

If not, I would put that money into VOO: an ETF that tracks the S&P500. I would suggest you break the 80K into 10K parts. Every Friday for 8 weeks, invest 10K into VOO. This way you’ll have an averaged price of the market in those 8 weeks. The market is quite high right now, so I wouldn’t suggest you put all 80K in one shot. 

You can be more safe (high yield savings acc or more fixed income exposure) but this is what I’d do. Assuming you’re young <30 years old, I wouldn’t touch bonds. Increase your risk when you’re young and decrease it when you hit near retirement >50years old. Again, this is what I would do. I’m also very confident and comfortable with my risk appetite. 

Best of luck."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Do you need this money? How much do you have going on from your normal job, now that you are employed?  
If at all possible, take this money, all of it, and go to a fidelity store and ask them for help. What you've done so far sounds a bit random. 80k is a great jump start. But you have to put it in the right places to get the most out of it. 500 in 3 random stocks is neat, but its not going to do much. 60k in a savings account at .55 is most of your cash tied in something that will actually lose value over time by not keeping up with inflation. 
  
Can you afford the normal bullshit involved in a house? The amount you actually pay per month after fees. Plus normal house shit like replacing water heaters, or having shit like the ac repaired."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Man I can't even imagine the pain you're going through, I wish you the best of luck.

As for the money, I know housing is high right now, but if you can find something that's a fixer upper with a guest unit you can rent out, chances are you'll come out 10% yoy over a 25 yr horizon at the very least.

I think stocks is probably not the best fit for your anxiety, unless it's something extremely safe like spy/wide market ETFs

3. Set aside enough to help you with securing a home so you aren't giving money to landlords for the rest of your life.
4. Anything left? Depends how you want to play it. Do your own DD, if you don't want to be overly active put it in a good tracker (IMO) after the market has experienced a large pull back. If you want to be more active then pick some stocks you like and do some research, make sure you diversify so you don't lose a bunch to a sector rotation!

Then my suggestion is look at Berkshire's and Scion's (Buffett and Burry) last portfolios, read Buffett's annual letters and look at Ben Graham's books. Look in to dividend payments. If you are gonna follow Ark Invest (Cathie Wood) way please dont go all in. Best investment is investing yourself."

Now, I recognize that I’m posting this on /r/stocks and the advice in this book is no fun, lol. 

It basically boils down to:

Individual traders rarely outperform the market

Time in market beats timing the market

Fees will undermine your earnings  

Just stick it in the right mutual fund for your risk level, especially low fee funds like vanguard, and let it grow over time. 

10k invested 10 years ago in vanguards 2055 retirement target fund would be worth 25k today. 

if performance stays similar, your 80k would be worth 200k in 10 years time, and 500k in 20 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,"that 60/40 is good given that you are anxious about losing money. it will do reasonably well when the market is doing well, but it will also make sure you have a good amount left during downturns

considering that, I would move some of the savings account money into the 60/40. keep like 6 months of living costs in the savings account and the rest can go into higher risk/reward places

for the 60/40 fund, make sure it says ""index,"" which is the much cheaper and equally good returns version of the one that does not say index 

given your risk aversion, don't put too much money into individual stocks (ford, gamestop, whatever else). no more than, say, 20 percent realistically. if you like the company and expect it to increase, knock yourself out, but only with what you can afford to lose (much if reddit is very toxic about ""yoloing"" things, please avoid this, do not apply for a margin account, it's not worth it in my opinion) 

I second what that person said about investing in yourself, too. the best investment you can make.

it seems like you are taking a responsible and earnest approach and have a good learning mindset. it is hard to do normally, let alone in times of crisis. I am so sorry for your loss"

She worked hard to make me self sufficient and I jumped at every opportunity to show her how self sufficient I was. Because I knew it made her happy. Unwittingly, I was just making it easier for her to rationalize what she did.

I wasn't involved with the estate stuff. She was married and her husband handled alot of the things. Things I did do though, (taking one for the team) I went through all of her belongings and packed them away or got rid of things. It was hard and emotional, but I did it. Mom didn't raise no bitch.

For the insurance, you just call the company and file the claim. The most important document you will need is the death certificate. The DC will take care of most things. You present that when closing accounts and stuff.

I'm sorry I wasn't more help. The first few weeks were a blur. It was tough. But it got better. I was super super lucky I had my GF. I wouldn't be where I am today if not for her."

03/26/2021,stocks,that's been a common advice trend in this thread. I appreciate it!
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'll check it out, thanks!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks, solid advice. This also gives me time to get up to speed on investment as a whole and not make decisions I will regret later."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I feel bad for him. You have to be in a bad place to say something like that.

Yeah the problem is really knowing what I will actually need in the next 5 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,Absolutely. I'm focusing on family at the moment.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Housing in my area is extremely overvalued. The house I'm renting right now-

2006- 200k
2012- 85k
2017- 150k
2021- 240k"
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm currently 30yo. I like your advice but I think I might break it down even smaller over a longer time.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm working on formulating a plan. It was a bit random, but that's why I'm here. To run the gauntlet of information. I do need to talk to a financial planner soon though.

 I can handle the house BS. but the housing market is super over inflated right now.

Like 25% above 2006 levels of fucked."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks, but honestly it wasn't hard. I was so depressed and scared, I just stayed put. I feel better and braver now though."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Awesome, I'll check those out, and I woke up today and created a ROTH and put some ETFs in it."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good looking out, I was worried about this as well, but apparently life insurance payouts are not taxed. At least they aren't in my state."
03/26/2021,stocks,How so?
03/26/2021,stocks,I'll look into this
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks!
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I woke up this morning and started creating my ROTH portfolio and also buying some ETFs and I missed the jump.

Oh well. We will see what it does in a couple days."
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks. I'm going to work on that ASAP
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah I feel that. The cleaning alone is killer.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good advice, I'm going to research what a sector rotation is."
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm on it. Definitely doing this. I opened a roth today and created a small portfolio.
03/26/2021,stocks,Not super into gold and silver bullion. What's the return been like on that?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thank you, I'll check those out"
03/26/2021,stocks,That last bit sounds like something I would say. I'm definitely big about facing fears. Thank you for your reply.
03/26/2021,stocks,I'll have to research this
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah I had a suspicion that might be the case. Although it's a little easier to avoid that when dealing with ETFs, correct?"
03/26/2021,stocks,I already had it available and connected to my main account. Do you have any recommendations?
03/26/2021,stocks,Congrats. I think I missed the boat on crypto for the time being though. What's your opinion on index vs mutual funds?
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'll check it out. 

And I agree with your points but I do need to factor in other details.

I have student loan debt. I need to decide if I should service some of the higher interest ones with some of this money (6.5%)

I need to decide how much to hold in savings. Because once the housing market settles back down if like to have some kind of liquid assets.
Or Maybe I can just pull money out of the market? IDK.

I'm going to talk with a financial planner."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks. Although some people convinced me to swap to a 85/15. 

I'm 30yo, so IDK whats a good mix for me, but 40% seemed really high give the return is like 6% tops. 

I'm sure my risk aversion will fade. I came into adulthood in the middle of the recession. Ive watched the market bounce back. I wished so hard that I had a wad of money to invest when the markets were down. But I was a poor college kid barely scraping by on food stamps.

I created a ROTH today and pushed 3k into ETFs. Then I pushed 1k into my brokerage and invested in other indexes.

I'm going to see a financial planner about the rest."
03/26/2021,stocks,Whoa dude. Wrong thread? I don't think we have spoken before?
03/26/2021,stocks,Where did you read that?
03/26/2021,stocks,Where can I read up on this?
03/26/2021,stocks,"My first vehicle was a '94 Cherokee for $1,000. That Jeep ran like a dream, never gave me any problems at all. The guy selling it was the second owner and an older guy who had kept it garage kept the whole time he had it. Definitely my favorite body style Cherokee, only ever sold it because it was only front-wheel-drive :( Fast forward a few years, I bought a 1990 4.2l Wrangler for $1,500, purely a mud toy; one of the most joyous things I've ever owned. Glad you were able to pick up something fun for yourself, keep your head up & sorry for your loss."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Cash is nearly as good as BND.  Assuming OP is young, SPY is a good long term play, although I'd do VTI."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes indeed
03/26/2021,stocks,"Look into the boglehead philosophy. You won't become a millionaire overnight, but you won't lose your money over night. And in the long term you match the market in growth which is very hard to do when you're individually picking stocks"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I just googled it and oof rates have dropped the past couple years, looks like 0.55% isn’t bad nowadays"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Maybe the better way to do things is to invest out of your job earnings, I totally understand the mental block on losing (or thinking like you have) the money from your mom. 

Instead of putting that into stocks perhaps it’s better to use it as a nest egg and invest from your everyday earnings instead of you really want money in the markets. Losing that sucks but I think would feel much less troubling than losing the money from your mom."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Still, that’s crazy to me.  If home ownership is an option, that’s generally safer than the stock market and can be very profitable depending where you live.  I currently have 85k in the market and I would take it all out in a second if I could get a house in my county"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don't have anything in dividend stocks right now, came here to post about this as well. Even something like AT&T has a 6.9% dividend and might be a good alternative to cash holdings."
03/26/2021,stocks,"A lot of people in this sub have become too smart for their own good.  They never would have invested in crypto or NFT and they missed out on huge bank to try to look smarter then other people.  You can take 5-10% of that chunk and invest it like a kid. Who cares what everyone says. They are all just scared. Buy virtual sports cards, a gold bar, an old car and fix it up.  Sure put the majority of your money in ETFs or an index fund and buy a piece of property but don’t be a afraid to make fun investment that might make you look silly because of advice from scared boomers."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Honestly, not acting for several months was the absolute best thing you could have done, and would have been my advice if you had posted this 8 months ago. Grief and trauma can really interfere with thought patterns and impair judgement. Don’t think of it as procrastination. You didn’t fail to act, you just weren’t ready yet. You didn’t make any decisions you regret or take on something you weren’t emotionally prepared to handle. Investing in your mental health first put you in a far better position, emotionally and likely financially, than catching a run up in the market would have."
03/26/2021,stocks,Your salary is high. So as long as you are getting something into the markets on a near monthly basis you’ll be fine
03/26/2021,stocks,"200k for a house still a good deal. Where i live a plot where you build a house costs 500k+, the house another 300k+ and a finished house 1m+ and i dont live in a big city or anything"
03/26/2021,stocks,"That's because it's a tourist destination which is a  *good* thing.

You have more options - airbnb etc.

Stocks are good but the amount you can leverage by owning assets is huge.

House's in my area are expensive too. But I put down like 200k and turned around and took out a heloc for 100k. So I lowered my mortgage payments for 30 years but got my money back interest only for 10 years.

There are so many benefits to owning realestate VS owning stocks  and you can definitely do both."
03/26/2021,stocks,"That’s good, it could go a long way if invested properly. If you want to understand the stock market, read “the little book of common sense investing” , I think there’s a free PDF copy online too."
03/26/2021,stocks,"My advice is, I mean. Some stock subs don't like crypto talk. Btc is always a good choice, I just happen to think eth is currently undervalued more. They're both dipping a bit for the last few days though, and if you're in them long term and can handle (ignore) short term volatility, they're probably both good options.

At least, in my opinion. Not an expert, not advice, etc, etc.."
03/26/2021,stocks,If it's for emergency then I suppose that's fine. Ideally you should have 6-12 months of expenses as emergency.
03/26/2021,stocks,"There is a  huge industry that gives advice on investment and retirement, and they work from commission. Advice is not free. In Hawaii we see a lot of trust fund kids going through their mommy money, find a career you love, stick with it. It is nice to own  a house when all your coworkers rent apartments. Last thing set up an automatic deduction and investment plan with your local, bank. You get used to the small deduction from your checking every month. Charlie Sheen may be good looking, and funny, but he put his money up his nose, don’t watch Wall Street."
03/26/2021,stocks,Thank you for replying!
03/26/2021,stocks,Have you also posted to r/personalfinance?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Just one additional advice! Do research on Lottery winners. They almost never know what they do, and an awful lot of them loses it all within 5-10 years. Learn from their mistakes. 

The main reason why rich people STAY rich is, at least from my experience, that they are used to money, for them it is just a cold number, a tool, while poor people what to show around how wealthy they are now.
It is incredibly more difficult to STAY rich than to become rich. If you make no mistake, put this money in an ETF, do your taxes properly and always keep an emergency fund, that you refill from your current income, not from your ETFs, you WILL DEFINITELY live an easier live.
And don't ""lend"" money to people. Eighter make it a gift or don't give anything at all."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Same here but I live in a weird area that even in 2008, the bubble didn’t pop. Average home cost is $558k as of last week and on average it increases 7% per year 🥴"
03/26/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/26/2021,stocks,"Depends on the growth you want to see,"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure what high interest accounts you have over there but .55% seems low. I’d just do a little research, go to a comparison site and see what else is out there. 

Actually I just looked for you and all high interest accounts seem to be around that rate, that’s insane! 

Still worth comparing and seeing if you can find an account where you get bonus interest each month for not making a withdrawal."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good to hear. 85 is fine, my combined accounts are less than 10 percent bonds as well, so obviously I don't consider that a mistake. I mostly said to keep the 60/40 because you mentioned your risk aversion was high, and I was considering it as an alternative more to the savings account than to the equities (stocks/ etfs/ mutual funds) 

One thing I'll say is that the point of bonds is not to get high returns but to avoid bad negative returns. if your time horizon is 10+ years there's not much of a point to having 40 percent bonds. that said, considering that equities are highly priced right now and are due for correction (stocks going down), if you're looking to use the money in the next 3-5 years, there's a decent chance that 60/40 will outperform 85/15. 

That is not to say you should change back; personally I would not, I'm just saying this because you have said you are new to a lot of this and wanted to make sure you were aware. 

Your financial planner will know better than 90 percent of reddit, that's for sure. One thing to make sure is that the person you see does not make money from commissions. That means they should be charging some kind of fee. Either way they will profit off of you, which is why I do all my own stuff (and honestly it sounds like you've got your own stuff under control). In your situation however, I completely understand the utility of an advisor. Just don't go with anyone who tries to sell you commission products. Those products are usually bad (and always worse than simple index funds), and even if they aren't, it represents and ulterior motive for them.

Best of luck with everything"
03/26/2021,stocks,If I type the words in here it will autobahn my post for a topic violation.  BitK01n is what I mean.
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you have any loans at a bigger interest % than whatever conservative investment you want to make (pension fund, bonds), just pay those off. People in my country are taking out their second pension group now that they are allowed and paying off their mortgages.

The hedgie shills say ""well the investment only compounds, while the loan payments only get smaller and smaller over time!"" well that's good and all. You just take the monthly payments you would have had to make and invest them from zero and you're not losing out on compounding investment profits."
03/26/2021,stocks,Im working out of town right now for a week. I can't wait to get home so I can start working on it. It needs alot. Including a trans swap (it came with an extra transmission)
03/26/2021,stocks,Yes indeed
03/26/2021,stocks,I found some that pay higher like you were saying but they seem to be super obscure small branches that I'm not familiar with. I also have anxiety about not being able to access my liquid assets when I need them.
03/26/2021,stocks,"No, I understand that it's just losing value sitting in a bank account. I understand that the market rises and falls.

The hard part I had to get over was realizing that it didn't have to happen all at once or all or nothing.

I appreciate your thoughts, it's actually very helpful to me, by helping me reflect on my own thoughts."
03/26/2021,stocks,I feel I might be being manipulated RN but I'm not sure how LOL
03/26/2021,stocks,"Well with interest rates and loans being as easy as they are to get, I don't see why you couldn't, as long as you make enough income.

I just think houses in my area are wildly inflated and I refuse to be a sucker."
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks I'll check it out
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah this is something I need to bring up when I see a FA. thank you
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks, Its nice to think I can keep things a little lighter hearted."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks. Yeah it was rough at first. I had a few close calls and bad decisions. When I got back home from dealing with that ordeal I just wanted to jump on my motorcycle and release my frustrations on that. I knew it was likely a death sentence but I didn't care. My landlord was there and talked me out of it. He probably saved my life. There were some other examples but I won't bother listing them. But they all just proved to me I just wasn't ready for more stress.

 But I knew one day I would wake up and do something. And that day has come."
03/26/2021,stocks,Yeah it's been a rough road getting to this point. Now I just have to make up lost time. Thanks for the support.
03/26/2021,stocks,It's all relative though. Being 100k upside down in a house I didn't really want to be in for 10 years is really hard on a young man who is trying to put the correct foot forward in investing.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I do have a HSA, I haven't had time for therapy yet, but I did see the GP to get on the meds. A therapist is on the to do list."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is sound advice, but being upside down in a mortgage is not somewhere I want to be. Plus I'm in a new relationship and i don't necessarily want to get our finances that mixed up."
03/26/2021,stocks,"There's such a learning curve with the stock market, I've been kinda ignoring crypto. But I'm interested. I just think BTC is extremely overvalued RN and it will tank. And all the other cryptos will follow (again)"
03/26/2021,stocks,I'm not going to blow it like that. It would crush me. I don't think I would be able to live with that guilt.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I haven't, because it would require divulging alot of information. I'm not even sure I should have spilt so much here. I might make a burner account for that."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good advice, thank you. Yes I've read of people squandering windfalls. That won't be me. Not without a serious fight."
03/26/2021,stocks,"No problem! If you want any suggestions let me know, I can tell you who I have used and my experience with them. Also, I think you picked mostly good stocks, I’m in ford too currently and optimistic about the future."
03/26/2021,stocks,"There's tons of undeveloped land between Tampa and orlando.

It's kind of relative. I've lived in SF and NOVA. I've seen the house prices there. But those areas are already heavily developed and are tech metros. The people in this area just don't make that much.

There's a ban on evictions and foreclosures right now. It's holding the market up.

Houses last year that are worth 150k are now 250k. This is Because of Covid. Why would I leverage myself in something that could lose 100k in equity overnight?

Here's what I'm talking about check out the price history on this home. https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/5617-Rockfield-Loop-Valrico-FL-33596/45020115_zpid/"
03/26/2021,stocks,True. I'm doing my best in removing the emotion. This thread has GREATLY helped with that.
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks man. I hope they aren't going through a hard time.
03/26/2021,stocks,Oh you just used the fancy word for crypto. I see.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I am sorry about your mother, but thats about the sorriest statement i have ever heard.  I am waiting on my student loans to be forgiven. This country is done with that kimd of mentality."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I don’t know your credit situation but any payments made during this deferment period are applied directly to principal and not interest. I’m buying a home soon hopefully and found out making these payments helps with the debt/income ratio so I just wanted to share. I hope the best for you, good luck in life and happiness and I’m terribly sorry for your loss."
03/26/2021,stocks,Im a hell yeah SISTER but ill hit a mud hold and spin that sucker dry in 2.5 in my jeep
03/26/2021,stocks,"That’s gonna be a lot of fun to work on. I love how easy Jeeps are to tear apart. I still remember being 16 and trying to impress a girl I was with, revved that thing up in neutral and dropped it in drive because I was an idiot & wanted to burn rubber in an automatic. Dropped a driveshaft, told my parents it happened when I hit a speed bump. God bless my mother because she bought every bit of that story."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Dude look at comparable around the country. Around the world! Look at Cambridge Mass. San Fran. Tampa is a steal!  In Canada, my house cost 700k in 2018 it could now be sold ina day for 1.2 mill. Tampa is cheap as fuck."
03/26/2021,stocks,Ya with that kind of principal I would park it somewhere safe for the moment where you can access it fairly quickly
03/26/2021,stocks,"Hey, I’m sorry for your loss. If your intention is to invest some in the market and sit on it in fear of a dip that is ok. Invest $12,000 into a Roth IRA right away.  This will cover last year and this years maximum contributions. Buy a total market, or S&P 500 index with all 12k (you can even set this to dollar cost average and buy 1000/month for example so the rest is still cash), set the dividends to reinvest, and sit on the rest cash in a regular brokerage account. This Roth IRA will grow tax free for many years to come and is money you cannot “touch” without a penalty until you are 59 1/2. There are a few exceptions like first time homebuyer, which you mentioned, in which you can withdraw penalty free. 

If you have 6k still “waiting” in a cash account next calendar year you can contribute your 2022 funds. This money can grow exponentially over the years and you will never regret this decision. 

I don’t know if other subs can be plugged here, but r/Bogleheads is worth looking at.

There is a “rule of 72” where 72 divided by investment return percent is how long it takes that money to double. If the market averages 8% then in 9 years that 12 becomes 24, 9 more years 24 becomes 48 etc. compound interest is your friend. Don’t gamble, be smart.

This will sound contradictory to what I’ve suggested, but There are many ways to manage a windfall, which is what has happened to you. You need to take emotion out of your decisions and the best move short term is to do nothing. Let 6 months blow over and then return to this. You have not stated your age, but if you are under 40 that 60/40 account is far too bond heavy. I am happy to help with any questions about what I’ve written."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ya, I get that.  Basically my income is such that I would have to rent out a room to make the payments and that kinda defeats the whole purpose of owning a house IMO.  It’s deceptively expensive, if you don’t have at least 20% down the bank makes you get mortgage insurance and then there’s regular insurance, property taxes..."
03/26/2021,stocks,You seem pretty smart. You don't have that much money. I don't know if you really need a financial advisor. Get a library card. Read more finance & investing subs around here. Watch more finance & investing vids. Watch the Peter Lynch & Warren Buffet lectures. Get all the usual investment books. Diversify. Be patient. That's my two cents.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yeah understandable, i was just wondering about the house prices where you live

good luck :)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I get it, cryptos got a pretty steep learning curve too... And honestly it's more dangerous because it's unregulated and the space is filled with pump-n-dump shitcoins and shills. So yeah, take your time and be careful."
03/26/2021,stocks,480K in student loans? how did you accrue that?
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sorry, but I’m fascinated by this.  How does it disappear in 19 years? Does that mean you’ll have it payed off at that time."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Regardless of whether you agree with the politics of it, if you had a debt that someone was talking of wiping away would you pay it now or wait to see how things shake out?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks for the info! I appreciate it.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Sure bud, next you’re gonna tell me that he’s not gonna ban all the guns."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I took the long way to becoming a doctor but to be honest the short way wouldn’t have been significantly cheaper.

Edit: to clarify I go 2 B.S. degrees  before going back to school to be a doctor."
03/26/2021,stocks,"med student prob + 10/10 loan forgiveness. its not an issue, hes a doctor"
03/26/2021,stocks,No problem. When you take out federal student loans you know (meaning you are provided with) different options for repayment and whatever the current rules are. For each loan they can make rules more in your favor after you sign for it but generally can’t make ones that make you worse off than when you took that loan out. When you graduate you do an exit interview where you are given the current programs and rules. Going in to school I knew that I would either be making 10 yrs of equal payments (now that all this school happened that’s not an option for me cause it would have been around 4700 per month and the department of Ed says to pay that you should make 550k per yr. I make good money but not that LOL) or I would be on an income based plan (there are other plans but they were equally in realistic as the 10 yr standard plan) there are a few different income based plans that have different qualifications but all include loan forgiveness. The plan I currently qualify for requires that I submit proof of income annually then they put that through a formula that spits out a number that is what they say should be 20% of my disposable income per month and what I am required to pay. For me this is less than interest only so the loans keep getting larger. As long as I make all required payments the remaining balance will be forgiven 25 yrs from graduating or if I only had undergrad loan it would be 20 yrs. I paid 6 yrs so far so 19 to go unless there is a drastic increase in income that would make it cheaper to pay the loans off. I’m sure there are a bunch of people here that will try and offer their 2 cents on how this will effect taxes and what not since it’s assumed that the amount forgiven would be taxable but even if it would be taxes don’t really work like that.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I'm glad I didn't have to spell it out for him."
03/26/2021,stocks,"If you take out a loan, your word is given that youll pay it back.  Not that ""hopefully it be forgiven"" or paid back by someone else. It makes you a liar and a thief. That is all."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Good to reduce your debt, but your money should be making money as well. Becoming debt free but then not having any cash is leaving you cash poor. Could consider paying it off over a longer term, like 3 years, and finding ways for your cash to earn more than the interest you're debited.

If you can I would suggest scaling it back to at a maximum your age (if you’re 30, 30% max). A simple 2 fund portfolio of VT (70%) and BND (30%) in this example would suffice and be most cost effective as far as fees and taxes inside a Roth IRA. (I am a vanguard investor so am more familiar with their funds and ETFs, I believe you can purchase them commission free on fidelity as well)

03/26/2021,stocks,"I’d have to look, I believe I was 465kish. I was a freshman in 01 and had no issue getting loans while doing under grad in and off for 12 years the only stipulation was no more undergrad loans once you have a bachelors so in my case I was about 3 years in when I decided I wanted to be a dr so I changed degrees and because of course sequences I needed 2 yrs min for prereqs. So my advisor is as like if you add a few corses every semester, 2 winter terms, 2 summer terms each year (so 4 summer terms) I could graduate with dual degrees ( not double majors ). My school had a 20 credit per semester cap that I needed a waver each semester to take 22-26 but the extra credits were included in the full time tuition so from the time I decided to be a doctor and change degrees I could have saves a few thousand tops, like a drop in the ocean. Then the rules for grad school are a bit different since statically people who barrow for grad school are much less likely to default. Also I had some grants and used the GI bill for some parts so the actual cost was even higher this was just what the feds chose to charge me some interest on before eventually forgiving it. 

The way I look at it is bankrupt is bankrupt doesn’t matter if it 40 or 400k although it’s a bit harder to convert student debt to other debt that can be wiped in a bankruptcy these days than when I started (not that bankruptcy was the plan LOL)"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Ahahahahhaa no, no they dont.

Mine was over 300k

Depends on what type of loan you are talking about. Mine were a mix of Stafford and Plus.
Believe me, Uncle Sam is not in the interest of reducing your debt to him. 

As OP mentioned, there is a student loan forgiveness program. It’s tough, really tough to qualify.

As of April 30, 2020 only 2215 people qualified for it since it’s inception in 2007. That’s a fart into the wind when compared to the number of people who would qualify in the original spirit of the program: work for an underserved or nonprofit and contribute to society in a meaningful way and get your debt lifted after 10 years."
03/26/2021,stocks,I was similar I was 26 when I decided to be a doctor and still have all the prereqs to do. Depending on how he is paying his staff may have a higher take home pay them him. Also if he graduates that long ago the same programs were not in place and it was harder to get government money so he may have private student loans that would need to be payed back and now income based plans or forgiveness for that.

The market always continues to rise in the long term. The old adage is “time in the market beats timing the market”

03/26/2021,stocks,"Great! If you have any high interest debt, like credit cards pay that off immediately. Then think of your emergency fund (6-12 months living expenses). After that is set aside think of your retirement. I can’t stress opening a Roth IRA enough. It is simply a tax sheltered brokerage account for retirement. Put 15% of your earnings into that or 6k yearly (whichever comes first). Try and max that out yearly. You don’t want to work forever and you don’t want Uncle Sam taking it from you so get that money growing tax free!

Edit: I am under the assumption you are employed. If this is not the case then you will need more savings for your emergency fund and should not be investing until employed. 

Also I know the idea of a retirement account and Roth IRA is not exciting at all, but it is the smart emotionless move. Block out the noise, stay the course.

Also look into target date funds if you do not want to rebalance your portfolio every 5-10 years as you age. They charge a little more expense ratios to manage but make it close to zero thought to invest in for the rest of your life"

03/26/2021,stocks,"This is only half true, when you start a program the cost can change each year so you don’t really know what your total loans will be then interest while fixed for any given loan with change so each term will have potentially different interest rates that you would not have know about at the start. So we know we will have ‘large’ costs but not exactly what they will total."

Private school is more. Caribbean schools are insanely expensive and people going there have to get insane private loans. Finally, a lot of people simply take out the max loan amount to be able to live on their own instead of roommates. Some people have no much of a choice, they have families and no other ways to make income while on school."

03/26/2021,stocks,This All correct but I would disagree with it being hard to qualify. Anyone who stays in an income based repayment plan for the specified time qualifies but there are a few factors that make it so few people have used the program. 1st the cost of education has gone up drastically recently (doctors of my same specialty TSgt graduated 10 yrs before me have 1/4th the loans on avg) and it was previously cheaper and affordable to pay on the 10 yr standard plan (meaning 20% of you disposable income would be higher that the 10 year standard plan payment) with income based repayment plans as a fail safe and forgiveness as a fail safe to the fail safe compared to me I knew going in I will pay roughly 2.5 times my principal then have the rest (1.2 mil calculated before the Covid changes so less now) forgiven. Just like any contract I read it before I signed it and based my decisions on the terms. As the cost of a program increases quicker than the the compensation for a graduate of that program the graduate is more likely to find this strategy ideal and a larger percentage of people will use it. Government and Nonprofits are good but not necessarily the best deal using your numbers they will forgive 300k after 10 years so you are better off in the private sector if you get paid more than 30k per year more there.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not sure why you're so upset about it. I personally think there are more productive ways to help struggling people then student loans, but if I had a ton of loans where the interest is frozen and there's talk of maybe forgiving at least a portion of it, what is the problem with waiting it out?

It's the same kind of mentality like the ""I walked uphill to school both ways"" kind of people, being bitter and angry if someone else dares have an opportunity to make their lives easier that you didn't have."

Less snarkily, there is a difference between intending to skirt paying back a loan at the outset, and waiting to see if the government is going to pay back the loan for you in an industry that spent the last 20 years preying on students with the promise that college education will make or break their financial future. So many kids go to college because it's ""just the next thing to do"" and wind up getting useless degrees because they don't know what they want to do. For many students this is their first loan and they don't realize the weight it will carry once they graduate or stop attending. Some of them go back a second time because they finally figured out what they want to do. Most of them end up in crippling debt for the next decade or two. Especially if they don't finish. This practice by the secondary education industry is deceptive and disingenuous to first-time adults.

College and education is important but not at the cost of going into debt for a loan that unlike most other debt will never age out and isn't candidate for discharge under bankruptcy."

Congress has been giving handouts to corporations for decades.

But god forbid we enter an unprecedented global pandemic and people need financial assistance because their employer went tits up and nobody is hiring because they think they might to.

In the case of student loans, this wouldn't be the first time the government has stepped in to address predatory practices which it contributes to. To get almost any other type of loan or credit you have to have established credit history. Your parents are also expected to contribute financially to education, and their wealth partially dictates how much loan you get. And unlike most other loans, if you go bankrupt at any point in your life federally-subsidized student loans are not on the table for debt elimination, nor will they ever fall off your credit report until you pay them off. The Higher Education Act of 1962 enacts that federal student loans have no statute of limitations, and supercedes the FCRA here.

Student loan debt is among the hardest debt to get rid of and we ask adults with less than a year of adult-experience to consign themselves to this debt, lifelong in many cases.

Let's be frank here. Walmart doesn't have the greatest online presence. They are trying their best with Walmart+, but it's not there yet. Good news is that I don't think their online presence is 'priced-in', which means that the current valuation of the company doesn't account for how big it can actually get. The company still makes great revenue and margin in the space and there's room for growth.

# 3. Current valuation

The stock is currently down about 10% since the ATH (all time high) in Dec 2020. Not gonna lie, grocery stores did get a boost during the pandemic since a lot of people cooked more meals at home, but look at the 50 day moving average. The stock moved higher faster than anticipated, but it's trending well with the average line in the right direction. In the past 5 years, the stock has dipped below 50-day moving average a very few times.

While we are at it, let's look at some of the fundamentals:

PE: 28.14

PS: 0.67

PB: 4.66

These are some of the lowest number I see in my portfolio right now.

# 4. Is there a bear case?

From what I can see, very little. If WMT is down, I am pretty sure the whole market will be down. I also don't foresee them making poor business decisions in the coming future that will cause WMT to inverse the market growth.

# 5. Is there a better alternative?

Maybe Costco? but Walmart fundamentals are better with higher performing chart data. (I own Costco as well).

TLDR: WMT has solid fundamentals, is down 10% for no reason, is seriously undervalued right now, there's no bear case, no rising competition, potential huge growth with online presence, it's a BUY.

\*not financial advice. I can't do DD. I am terrible at stock picking. Tell me why I am wrong."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't say Walmart is over or undervalued at the moment. I bought some recently during the dip. The dip is largely financial institutions shuffling their investments around, causing a correction and I'm hoping it'll pick up over the next 6 months. Walmart did really well during the pandemic, being an essential grocery store. It has a bit of room to grow but not as much as others. In terms of worldwide expansion, Costco is starting to enter markets like China whereas Walmart is mature in most major markets so online/ pick up is really where it can gain additional business. I think the target price for this year is probably near the all time high earlier in the year. Most grocery stores are safe investments for the next year because there is still uncertainty about covid worldwide. Vaccines are not reaching outside the US fast enough and if there are additional lockdowns or new variants, Walmart will continue to do well in sales. Just buy, hold, check back in 6 months."

2021-03-25 20:10:15,stocks,"What are some of the considerations that go into the amount of shares a company issues? I noticed some penny stocks at 1$ might have 200 million shares outstanding. 

On the other hand, other companies may issue 10 million shares at 20$. 

Both companies would have a market cap of 200 million in this example, so what are some of the consideration that go into the amount of shares a company issues? 

Since both companies would raise the same amount of money in these examples, I'm not sure why some choose to structure their shares outstanding so differently."
03/26/2021,stocks,But there can be other reasons for needing more shares. A company I’m invested in just had to increase the number of shares just because insiders wanted to be able to buy more lol

I've been watching the Nasdaq closely...my theory is that it won't break more than 10% down. Creeper close today but rebounded a bit. Wondering if we're starting to see signals of a bottom. If it breaks 10% I'm going to do some more averaging down with my tech/growth stocks. I'll be adding to VFH and VIS. Feel like my portfolio has some solid counter balances to the growth stocks now.

Thanks for the advice. Don't know why I couldn't put my finger on this as the most reasonable action to take...guess you have to talk through it out loud sometimes"

03/26/2021,stocks,"For a bearish argument, there's insurance companies to consider. Health insurance companies tell medical companies, like a hospital or your Dr office, how much it will pay them for the service/drug/procedure/exam, etc. If the company says ""a tele-health visit costs $100,"" insurance will counter offer $50. If you can't get insurance approval for certain things involving the operation of your business, then it becomes unsustainable to continue to operate in that way. 

This can work both ways for TDOC. If insurance companies decide it's great and will save THEM money, they'll be in great shape. Then new tele-health companies will have to compete for insurance approval against already established TDOC. If insurance companies decide that in person visits cost the same for them to reimburse so either is ok, then they're good to go too as long as the operating costs are less than the reimbursement for the services because the actual overhead of the company submitting the reimbursement request doesn't really matter. If another company comes in an under bids TDOC, or some other more nefarious shit goes on, there's a chance that insurance companies will choose to utilize the new, cheaper company and TDOC is out of that system. This already happens with system based coverage so it's not hypothetical (your employer provided insurance will pay for St. Helen's Hospital system affiliated providers, and your PCP is St Jude so you have to switch). 

Not saying telemedicine and tele-visits aren't the future, they are because the population is inherently lazy and will always, as an overall whole, choose convenience when it benefits them (see GrubHub, doordash, instacart). But competition will be harsh and the medical industry is jacked up. 

TDOC acquiring LVGO was huge for them, if they can utilize the assets. I'm long term bullish on TDOC. However, I don't currently hold any, they've been branded a ""covid play"" and the market don't care about TA or value analysis (good P/B ratio, fair book value per share, good debt/equity ratio). I'm guessing the pullback is based on their debt going from $470M to $1.4B and a negative EPS, negative profit margin, etc. from the merger, plus the fear that tele-health is going out with covid. Forrest and trees shit."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think TDOC, to many institutional investors, is likely to continue raking it in if the pandemic continues going or many office workers continue to work at home. Other than that, I think they are pricing in that this doesn’t work as well when you have people living normal life (even though its definitely more convenient, sometimes people like just to have the experience for whatever reason). Plus Amazon, of course, but I also feel like Google’s investment in American Well had another reason to do with it. It certainly won’t be the last telehealth company to do what they do so maybe its overvalued? Those are just my thoughts, you don’t have to listen just some things to consider."

Our shutdowns did devastating things to this economy.


https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/pdfs/mm7010e3-H.pdf. CDCs 1.3% decrease report.

The media hyped this Covid for political purposes, the left took it and ran.  Look at California, still in lockdown mode, and upset with any other state that doesn’t lock down its own citizens. Then I have the pleasure of being called “stupid” because I don’t fall for the BS hype. There was no reason whatsoever to shut down our economy 0. The media and democrats initially told us not to worry, then at every turn politicized everything Trump said. How many people died early because of the lack of Hydroclooquin? How many people died after the doctors realized the intubation was dangerous? How many kids got sick? But I’m stupid for calling bullshit.

That’s not what shorting is.  Shorting means you sell borrowed shares and are OBLIGATED to buy them back.  Shorting doesn’t mean you simply sold high and will buy it low later.

You can’t “accidentally” short.  That’s like accidentally selling a car that you don’t own.  “Oops, I sold property that didn’t even belong to me, and the brokers accepted this transaction for some mysterious reason!”"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Edit: Was the second half meant for the OP? It doesn’t really address what I said. I was thinking of the adjective not verb when I wrote my comment.

Edit: I’m aware people can “be short” on a stock, meaning they shorted the stock, people can also “go short” on options, meaning they sell the option, meaning they profit potentially less if the option appreciates in value. I was referring to the common theme of someone who “is short” either in stocks or options having a greater expection for return if the asset they are short on does not appreciate in value.

Edit: I figured the OP probably saw an article about someone who sells an option “being short” and wondered “have I shorted the stock without meaning to since I’m short on a call option for it.”"

* The move was to rotate into value and small caps a couple months ago ... I did; Feb and March have been all green baby!  But that trade is crowded now ... No obvious plays today ...

03/26/2021,stocks,">There was a lot of speculation people were going to dump the checks into stocks even if that wasn't the goal

There's always a lot of speculation around the stock market, and a lot of it is bad. There are a lot of snake oil salesmen, and there are also a lot of misinformed investors. In this case, a bare minimum analysis would show why the people dumping their checks into stocks cannot (on its own) significantly impact the market:

The total world wide size of stocks is roughly $70 trillion USD. The equity in the US market represents a little more than half the equity in world market. The stimulus bill included around $400 billion in stimulus checks. Which amounts to roughly 1% of the US market equity or 0.5% the world market equity. 

If we assume that all this money went into US stocks, it would only increase the equity in the US market by 1%. Which would be a small effect. But this assumption is unrealistic. The overlap between people who invest in the market (excluding retirement accounts) and the people who get the stimulus is small. The lion's share of the stimulus is going to people who can't afford to invest in the market. Thus most of the stimulus check money is not going directly into the stock market. The direct impact on the US market should be much smaller than 1%.

The bigger impact of the stimulus on the stock market is through speculation. If investors believe that the stimulus money will help businesses, then they will be more likely to invest in stocks. But speculation is fickle, the current market conditions, and the stimulus has been under discussion for months."
03/26/2021,stocks,I was thinking of ones that have recently dropped back close to their lowest.

But honestly the stimulus isn't even the reason most people have found they have more disposable income to invest. In my case, it is because we have not had to pay for my wife's student loans for over a year (and apparently won't have to for another 6 months or so). That's like $500/month back in our pockets that we had already budgeted to be spent on the loans, so from March '20 to Sept '21 that's like $9000 extra that we otherwise wouldn't have - way more than all three stimulus checks combined. At this point, throwing $1000 at a few stocks is suddenly feasible, but we wouldn't have been able to if we had to put it towards those loans. 

I have a feeling a lot of other people found they suddenly had extra money after not having to pay their student loans all year as well, and that is mainly where the new investors came from. This is why they need to seriously consider the student loan relief that is being thrown around, that will free up so much more disposable income for 20-40 year olds that can be put back into the economy in so many better ways than paying interest on an overly inflated loan that couldn't really be turned down."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I agree they need necessities, but what changed for them during the pandemic that isn't accounted for in the working population? 

The non-working elderly live off of some sort of fixed income that wouldn't have changed during the pandemic. SSI was never not being paid and the price of goods did not drastically increase, theoretically they were in the same place they were before the pandemic. Nothing would have changed as far as their living situation as well. I may be missing something obvious, but what changed for somebody living off a fixed income that made them unable to pay for home and food?

I don't understand the children argument either. They depend on their parents' income, who are accounted for in labor statistics. The children aren't accounted for in the number of people who received checks, only the people who received them. 

I feel like your argument actually furthers my point. Only around half of the US population works, so 80% (160 million working population, 127 million checks) of the population whose lifestyle could have been effected by the pandemic received a check. This, understandably, works out because ~20% have incomes above the cutoff. Going back to my post in which you replied, around 20% of persons were financially adversely impacted by the pandemic. It gets back to 80% of people received a check, while only 20% would have been in a worse position than in years were there was no check."

A blue chip is a nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound company. Blue chips generally sell high-quality, widely accepted products and services.

03/26/2021,stocks,"Well we didn’t really have meme stocks back then per se but I recall they both  were considered fairly risky stocks. They weren’t companies my parents broker would have recommended and though I remember telling my mom to invest in AAPL back in the early 2000 ‘s, she unfortunately didn’t. 😅
I’ve got the same feeling about GME right now and I’m holding for the long term. If a ‘squeeze’ happens that’s great but I think they are seriously undervalued even at this price."
03/26/2021,stocks,"But GME, BB, AMC are nothing like AAPL or AMZN.  Sure, people thought Apple and Amazon were overvalued or risky, but they were traded normally.  Perhaps people bought into the hype, but GME is not normal. AMC is not normal. They’re beyond volatile and their stock price is completely disconnected from the company."

If TSLA rises up to $900 by end of year, you stand to make $250 on your $650 investment.  If you had bought it today at $630, you'd make $270 on your $630 investment at that same selling point.  It's really not that much of a difference.

03/26/2021,stocks,"I completely agree. I've been always been wondering though, doesn't DCA cost you more in terms of fees? 

For instance if you DCA each month, even with a minimal brokerage fee of 0.1% per transaction your annual fee cost would rise to 1.2%. Consider the fact that you'd do that for more than one position and you could reach the 5% levels. 

In contrast, a lump sum once per year would eat up only 0.1% respectively."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Unfortunately yes. They're everywhere and it's extremely annoying.

Maybe some are just looking for confirmation bias for their bags?"
03/26/2021,stocks,Investors worth their salt don’t check price tags.
03/26/2021,stocks,"You wouldn't add up the transaction fees in percentage terms, you would average them. So 12 transactions at 0.1%, where each transaction size is 1/12 of the total, is the same fee as one transaction at 0.1% of the total. Some brokers have a small flat fee on transactions as well, which would make DCA marginally more expensive, but it's negligible for any significant amount of money."

If you want to trade on the side (I do) get a separate brokerage account so you aren't even tempted to micromanage your B&H investments. I tend to re-balance my B&H account about twice a year. I make monthly deposits which will either go to building my existing positions (remember, buy what's down, not what's up) or entering new positions if I've found something new I like. I monitor my value tickers outside of my brokerage account; if they hit my target or even get inflated in my opinion that is the exception where I will login and sell. That capital will either go into an index fund or just wait until I can decide where to re-deploy the capital.   


I must admit, as much fun as trading is I am obviously a B&H investor....because my trading account has divulged into 60% shares and LEAPS calls on a single stock that I really like (not what you're thinking).

I'm still a new trader though. Currently down 2%, doesn't sound like much, but it is. Was up and down, probably averaging $130 day, but this week had me forcing trades or chasing, breaking your own rules are easy.

03/26/2021,stocks,"> combined with the fact that nothing is making any sense to the average retail trader. 

I think this right now is my biggest issue. Recovery stocks are still shooting way the fuck up, some of them far past where they reasonably should be BEFORE covid. Tech seems to *finally* be getting its legs but this month was pretty awful in terms of predictability. I couldn't even retreat to my typical safe havens of swing trading dividend stocks because a lot of those were on upward swing and only seem to just now be coming down. A lot of supports and resistances broke making it very difficult to tell what's going on.

The big thing through this whole ordeal is having proper risk management. I could have gotten burned several times over while trading but I bailed at the first sign of trouble, and walked away in the green. Lots of people decided to hold overpriced stocks because they're traders trying to be investors and they got destroyed.

>If anyone thinks this is a correction they are in la la land.

I mean, it was a correction, but it was a correction to some sectors of the market and not others. SPY did well and NASDAQ got throttled as a general observation. And not even all parts of tech got hit. Apple is down 20% from ATH while the likes of google and microsoft are doing just fine. Facebook was down before the market took a downturn(which I was in at the time) so it didn't really drop during the correction, and then promptly just shot up. Market's been weird yo."

1000 p/e ratio is particularly insane.  People are betting Tesla is going to continue to grow at a crazy pace for many years into the future.  

For reference, Verizon, a solid, well established company has a P/E ratio of 13.  PayPal, as an established company that is still growing quickly has a P/E ratio of 66.

This seems like a pedantic difference at first but it's not. DCA'ing is done to correct for market volatility and functionally serves as a means to hedge using time, aka not timing the market. DCA'ing would have you buy at any price over that time interval(within reason of course), while buying more when you see a drop is by definition timing the market. Two entirely different strategies."

Stocktwits had a high success ratio for spotting trends right after they started and Twitter wasn’t great in general.

The mentality of hopping on a trend *after* it’s hot is what gets most people. I use a multireddit of subs I like, sort by rising, and check it a couple times a day. Non hyped, boring DD shows up every now and then. I dig into myself, and if it looks good and the price hasn’t popped much yet, you may have found a winner.

03/26/2021,stocks,"So you disagree but then provide examples of “tech” stocks that have uncertain futures, agreeing with me.  Ok."
03/26/2021,stocks,"So a great example of why there is a shortage is to look at what happened to toilet paper last year you had businesses using the JIT method of inventory control. Suddenly there is an unprecedented spike in demand and these factories already run 24/7 based on estimates built up over the last 30-50 years so they have minimal product waiting for buyers.  It took months to catch up and suddenly the market was suddenly over saturated 

So with lithium, my understanding is that it is a very similar problem now that everyone is trying to develop lithium ion batteries for literally every possible application. There is a shortage right now and it takes years to get mines open and ramping up production. So just as sure as there is and will be a shortage, there will also be an inevitably huge glut."

03/26/2021,stocks,"This is probably common knowledge for some of you, but I just learned some stuff I didn't know about cost basis and taxes. 

With more volatile stocks (especially meme stocks), selling your initial investment when the share price is high is smart IMO to ensure you don't lose any actual money (ahem, AMC has been making me lose sleep; I bought in March 2020 before ""meme stock"" was even a widely know term). 

But it's important to note that you're taxed on the gains of individual shares, not on an overall dollar amount. So even if you only sell your initial investment, you're still going to be taxed on the gains of individual shares. And if you sell within one year of holding a stock, you'll be taxed at the short term capital gains rate, which is the same as the regular income tax rate. 

Just figured I'd share. I wasn't clear on that and it's pretty important."

If it does, I think 4k+ will trade before options expire in April and then I wouldn't be surprised if the rest of the market sees a correction. It's doubtful the Dow keeps pacing at 50%+ over a 12 month period from early November. It could easily jump 20-25% this year though."

He says that although everyone thinks the stock market is a sure fire way to build long term wealth as long as you stay invested for the long term, that only appears to be the case if you look at it in dollar terms.

If you have to get a human involved they may charge you a big fee ($25) and may or may not apply that even if the trade is cancelled. I can't think of a reason anyone should need to do that any more. Maybe some computer-illiterate folks still do it."

03/26/2021,stocks,Yes temporarily.
03/26/2021,stocks,What’s it currently at and when are they planning to impose these potential taxes
03/26/2021,stocks,"You usually can't buy the stock at the strike price anywhere because it's never at that price.

You should always be able to buy the stock at the current price.

If you are trying to get a bargain on the stock by buying an option then calling it, that won't work. The price of the option is always more than the difference between the current price and the strike price.

To make the other party send you the stock, you tell your broker to exercise the option. That's when you need 100X the strike price to send to the counterparty and when they send you 100 shares of stock, per contract.

70% of the time the price of the stock doesn't change enough in the right direction before expiration to make it worth exercising the option. That's not a typo. 70% of the options you will ever buy will expire worthless.

When you got authorized by your bank to trade options, they should have given you a booklet that explains all of this. If they did not then they are actually breaking the law."

I'm a little bit angry over that.
I had to do a little test but it wasn't really hard."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I would not use that bank as a broker, like,  at all.

I can't imagine the corporate decision that they made to allow customers to trade options but not stock.

I suspect they will act as counterparty to your trades and just soak up all your money."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm actually not sure, I've never done that kind of option trade. It depends on what your broker requires, they might want you to have enough cash to cover the purchase if you get assigned. Or maybe it depends on your margin account status, I've never gotten into margin."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Maybe you misunderstood me. I can buy stocks, however I'm not able to buy the 100x stocks from my option contract at the strike price."
03/26/2021,stocks,"So it's because you don't have enough money in your account? You can afford 100X the premium but not 100X the price?

Again, they're doing something wrong if your account doesn't contain enough margin (collateral in cash, stocks, or other value) to back a loan to exercise the option.

If your account does have enough margin, just not enough cash, you can do one of three things.

1. Buy and sell the option without exercising it. 

2. Exercise the option, specifying to the broker to sell the shares immediately.  You will get the difference between the current share price and the strike price.

3. Exercise the option and hold the shares with margin debt.

The first is almost always the only good choice. The time value of an option makes it larger than the price difference in the stock, so you yhrow that time value away by exercising.

But if your account is not a Margin Account, you shouldn't be able to exercise without having ready cash in the account.

You should be asking these questions of your broker and having them explain exactly how you will be allowed to trade with the amount of money you have and the type of account. They should be forcing you to read and agree to all sorts of documentation before they allow themselves to make any option transactions for you."
03/26/2021,stocks,"This is probably common knowledge for some of you, but I just learned some stuff I didn't know about cost basis and taxes. 

With more volatile stocks (especially meme stocks), selling your initial investment when the share price is high is smart IMO to ensure you don't lose any actual money (ahem, AMC has been making me lose sleep; I bought in March 2020 before ""meme stock"" was even a widely know term). 

But it's important to note that you're taxed on the gains of individual shares, not on an overall dollar amount. So even if you only sell your initial investment, you're still going to be taxed on the gains of individual shares. And if you sell within one year of holding a stock, you'll be taxed at the short term capital gains rate, which is the same as the regular income tax rate. 

Just figured I'd share. I wasn't clear on that and it's pretty important."

03/26/2021,stocks,"I think you’re massively overestimating the benefits of solid state batteries. Plus margins on batteries are low, but Tesla sells the cars as well which is why they receive larger margins.

QS solid state battery is comparable to Tesla batteries:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kqah8v/those_who_bought_into_qs_just_because_of_jb/gi3i7ht/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Without getting too into it, I totally agree with what you're saying... initially. 

The first generation SS batteries will not compete with several generations in Lithium ion and all the other traditional liquid cells. But that's the floor, not the ceiling. 

It's all about potential.

Edit: and to get deeper into it would require a thorough analysis of actual chemical potential, energy density, and potential capability. The ceiling for SS is magnitudes higher than the ceiling for all non-SS. SS is the end-all, be-all for lithium-based batteries (and most battery concepts for most applications, for that matter).

After reviewing the comment you shared, you're only making comparison to Tesla's promises.... several things here: QS is bigger than EVs. EV batteries are one market. Batteries are not a one size fits all. However, on the topic of size, SS batteries can be made physically smaller than other battery forms, and the applicability for smaller batteries is obvious everywhere.

 Tesla has made promises for years... they tend to eventually live up to most of the hype, but they rarely execute their timeliness promises. I would dare say all of those numbers you mentioned will fall behind 3+ years, as three years tends to be the actual amount of extra time it takes them to meet the things they say."

03/26/2021,stocks,"The Qanon thing comes from what I've seen personally on Webull and other social media. Tons of Trump and My Pillow guy memes with AMC and GME saying ""keep hodling, ape together strong, moon soon.""

Also looking into a lot of these ""DD""s, the math is wrong or it's completely false info.

Like the dark pool bullshit swirling around yesterday. Completely false info was spread by multiple profiles saying hedgies were trading in dark pools to drive the price down. It was removed from several subs and across several social media platforms when it was found to be false but these profiles posting these were deleted as soon as they appeared.

Now the GME and AMC crew are convinced that because it's being deleted that it means it's really happening and that is proof of it because it keeps going bye bye. Instead of the truth of it was completely blatantly false information.

I would honestly put money down and say that hedge funds are creating shitty DD for dumb apes to follow to keep them holding GME. 

Especially when you factor in the short volume for both AMC and GME yesterday. My prediction is yesterday was a day to let all the apes load up before the crash of both GME and AMC foday.

Next week predictions: AMC 6.50 by April 1st, GME 78 by April 1st. This morning at market open both will rise about 10% respectively then about 10:45 or 11 am it will start to crash.

I could be wrong, who knows. But at least I'm not spreading false info to keep this alive. Every media story that is published now is under a microscope by the WSB conspiracy team.

Why do you think the mods of WSB keep pinning the rules daily and in them they mention to ""remove tin foil hat""? An article gets published and within 12 hours there are multiple ""if we assume Jupiter is in retrograde and CNBC went to school with Fox News then shorties short the short bus, apes together strong, moon soon.""

Like news article default to being about 5 hours behind the actual happening because they have to get typed up and edited and approved and so by the time it comes out ""see WSB eating alive Motley Fool for no reason this morning"" its about 5 hours behind whatever happened. WSB is taking this as FUD and spreading false info even though at the time of writing the article the price was moving exactly how the article says.

It's literally where the saying ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" comes from. News gets ahold of it and reports on it and by that time it's actually published whatever catalyst they said or described has already happened.

Also to further pile on the Qanon stuff, as soon as you point out anything to these people they attack you and call you a bot, despite being able to see my entire reddit history. 

I just ask you that if you truly believe in GME or AMC that you actually look into some of these profiles posting this pro GME and AMC stuff. Out of the three profiles I was following yesterday, two of the three profiles no longer exist. The third one got his post removed because he titled post ""shorties shorting during restricted times"" but it was just a screenshot of a sale. I later got OP to admit he was assuming it was a short and has no idea or evidence to identify this as a short sale and that it could easily just be a regular sale.

No that is not correct reasoning. The dark pool stuff driving down the price could indeed be false. That doesnt mean the SI isnt high and that doesnt mean a short squeeze isnt possible.

The only question you need to ask is: "" is it likely that the short interest is still >100%?"" If so a short squeeze is still very possible and buying in at 200$ could be a reasonable buy."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Any thoughts to this deal possibly not happening. And if so do you think another buyer would appear? It seems that the STB is difficult to get approval from them.  
Do you see the price of Kansas City southern stock going higher now that the tender offer has been made to purchase it"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Yes, it definitely seems like it'll be a challenge from the merger to get approved but I do think there is some hope in terms of it happening - I'm going to quote another reddit user (StonkThirty) who commented on my post on wsb:

**"" I think the KCS deal has a better shot than NS or CSX at least in part because of how the networks are distributed. The previous deals would have made a shitshow of a monopoly in some parts of CONUS; the KCS deal in contrast basically just connects the dots for CP to Mexico without absorbing large chunks of the rust belt and northeast in the process.**

**Plus this time most industry people and shippers are onboard as opposed to a bunch of groups against the previous two attempts. This deal also plays nicely into USMCA** [**https://www.aar.org/article/why-the-usmca-is-critical-for-freight-railroads-their-customers**](https://www.aar.org/article/why-the-usmca-is-critical-for-freight-railroads-their-customers)**""**

and personally, for me, as the KCS railway is the smallest out of the Class 1 railways and makes a smaller revenue compared to the other Class 1 railways in America, I think it'd be harder for this to be rejected (though still possible).

&#x200B;

As for another buyer appearing, imo, I doubt it would happen right away because it seems like a lot of thought/planning/money has already gone into this purchase so the merger being rejected would be a big stepback for KCS. As for the KCS stock price going higher now that the tender offer has been made to purchase it, maybe somewhat but I think we've already seen a lot from the initial boost (\~ $224 - $259) happen already. Any chances of it going higher would be based on positive rumors around the approval or maybe some kind of positive politics around it (ex. the US President talking positively about the merger)."
03/26/2021,stocks,"I have a long position with shares but after that drop last week I also got 40 $103C 4/1 at $1.71. Worth $1.81 today, probably will sell tomorrow if it’s up and buy more shares."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Bro, market prices reflect the market.  If people are selling, not buying, the price will go down.

> Everything i read says corrections are 10 percent declines and bear markets are 20-30% declines

Then the drops you’re seeing aren’t “corrections” or a generic vague “bear market”, or, the platitudes in the reading material are wrong.

When you talk about “10% declines”, what is the standard deviation or confidence interval of that average figure?  Did you think there was some law that dictates the fluctuation of prices?

The stock market is not free money and is not predictable money.  There is no “this was only supposed to change X%.  It shouldn’t have changed so much!”"
03/26/2021,stocks,"I guess I just dont understand how people can set the price for a stock at 170 then literally a month later the price is at 100 and nothing has changed with the underlying. I get stocks being overvalued, etc but in the case of PTON for example, it literally had half of its market cap wiped out within a few weeks. Im just having a hard time understanding the reasoning behind these type of moves"

They have a new development called Beach Club that is opening up April 15th. This is a stop for cruise ships. In fact, Richard Branson (Virgin Cruise) is a major investor in this property. Funny is that the word is that the first ship coming in is a Carnival Cruise ship.. Who knows what will really happen.. But, this is the word for this property.. You can look up any of these properties.."

03/26/2021,stocks,Democrats and Republicans have handled this pandemic differently.  Democrats wanted strict lockdowns and republicans didn't.  Democrats wanted to decide what people could do and Republicans wanted you to decide what to do.  When you compare Democrat controlled states like New York and California to Republican states like Texas and Florida the infection and death rates are about the same.  Democrats don't want to re-open.  It is happening on the local level via governors and mayors.
03/26/2021,stocks,A fund is probably using repo to finance that transaction so i would argue that my point is still true.
03/26/2021,stocks," Texas and Florida have higher infection rates than either New York or California. Why exactly do you think that Democrats don't want to reopen the country? But this is getting off topic. My point still stands, this isn't an accurate assessment of the current situation. The country is reopening, and Carnival Cruises, as well as other stocks will go back up"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Funds aren't repoing out bonds to fund term loans. You'd typically have lines of credit with your primes or custodians to participate in tls. Funds reverse repo to banks to make some money on assets, they wouldn't typically repo out"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Your lies are easily proven false.  The death and infection rates aren't that much different. In fact California has the highest death rate even though they had some of the strictest lockdowns.  

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_deathsinlast7days

As for why I think democrats don't want to open the country.  I guess I can't help you dude.  Brainwashed people who get their news from CNN and MSNBC will never get it.  It is more than obvious that democrats are the party most interested in keeping the restrictions in place.  Of all the places in the country democrat controlled states and cities are the ones sill keeping restrictions in place."
03/26/2021,stocks,According to who? Ive have never heard that funds dont often use repo for funding.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Not in the distressed debt market lending that were talking about. They'll repo out assets to obtain shorter term leverage, but term loans don't have short term investment horizons"

03/26/2021,stocks,Thanks! Realizing more and more that if you want to survive/make money in the market you can't follow the herd. Probably much better off just inversing what everyone else says.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I'm 40% tech (no TSLA and only a little PLTR though) and I'm only down 1% over the past 30 days. How are you guys so much riskier than I am?

03/26/2021,stocks,"When I was young I bought on margin and got destroyed.  Margin calls will rip your guts out.

Next I bought the Story and not the Numbers.  Fooled with penny stocks, Canadian exchange stocks,  Learned about catching a falling knife and the dead cat bounce.

Then I would place large bets on companies and win and lose big.  Since it was an up trending market, I came out mildly ahead but it was no different than gambling.

I learned about pigs turning into bacon when shorts came in with untruths decimating good companies.  I hate them with a passion and think they have stolen more than organized crime ever did.

Now I study the fundamentals, do DD , research and also shadow some of  Warren Buffet picks except Railroads. ( Because of the rail accidents and believe pipelines are safer for local residents but fortunely never bought pipeline companies.)

Once in a while I have to jump out of a company when accounting irregularities which are impossible to foresee pop up.  Otherwise I don’t let my emotions run wild if the company is sound.

The only  individual stock I own a lot of is Apple.  I bought it when the first iPad came out and beat Buffet.  When he arrived the Apple shorts went away.

I still read MacRumors and other sites to make sure Apple is staying ahead of the competition.I own stocks, bonds, ETFs, metals and some real estate so when one is going down something is going up.

I paid off my mortgage in 10 years  and put some of those savings into an IRA.  Then I got smarter and put it into a Roth instead.

Finally I pay my  Visa and Amex  cards off monthly.   Never had a car loan driving older vehicles for years  and  now buy a new one every 5 years cash.  I give the old ones to relatives.

Maybe you can avoid some of my mistakes."

The strategy can be anything:
* Buy stocks and set stop losses to ensure you don't take any large losses
* Buy stocks in companies you believe in and hold long term, with goals to beat VOO/VTI/QQQ
* Swing trade on momentum and get out when TA shifts (ie. RSI, Bollinger bands, MA, etc)

03/26/2021,stocks,"u/cahphoenix, I didn't know that MSFT had made so many technological steps to avoid becoming irrelevant.  I still had the old view of the titanic MSFT headed toward obsolescence.  But it looks like they've taken really big steps to avert disaster.  

I switched to OSX in 2012 and my experience with Windows and MSFT is dated.  I use VS Code on OSX, it's pretty nice, similar shortcuts to SublimeText3.

I stopped using MSFT products and doing development using MSFT tools back in the day when they were actively using FUD to try and slow the growth or open source adoption.  Against Linux and Java/JEE mainly.  Their tools were closed, you needed   
their Windows and IIS to run .net MVC applications.  Also they made it hard to go outside of their stack.  If you used Oracle DB instead of SQL Server good luck with getting drivers to connect your web application to a non MSFT db.  Everything they   
did just seemed ... obstructionist.  It really irked me and I lost any sort of respect and trust in them as a company.  They were a tech juggernaut and were using their weight  
to stifle anything innovative and good that they didn't invent or own.   

My memory was that MSFT was 

\- trying to delay or stop ""good things"" outside of MSFT from happening; literally trying to stop or delay progress because they didn't invent it or they didn't own it; this sort of thing set technological evolution back.  I firmly believe if it were not for MSFT, we'd have better development tools and life would be much easier for developers by now.

\- copying revolutionary technologies (i.e. .net is MSFT's Java) and claiming credit; trying to kill those technologies and trying to get developer mindshare.  

\- trying to subvert standards.  When the standards committees disagree, MSFT goes off and creates their own standard.  I think there was a time when they tried it with Java (there was an MSFT Java that was created in response to the Java committee not agreeing to where MSFT wanted to steer Java)

It was just this schoolyard bully of a company that was using underhanded tactics on anything they didn't own or that could pose a future threat to MSFT.  I had a really bitter memory of their practices and that's pretty much stuck with me all these years.  I'm even suspicious now because MSFT was always claiming that they had changed  
and would be a different company come next year...  Only to disappoint.     
I just don't trust them to come around and contribute to open source projects  
because they've had such a long history of FUD, subversion, IP theft (creating the MSFT  
version of Java) and stifling break-out technologies."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Have never tried Oatly because they don't have it here where I live in Canada. I do buy about 8 cartons of earth's own a month for a house of 2. Wish I could invest in earth's own but as far as I can tell they are privately held. I wanted to invest in Oatly, but we have to be realistic. I don't want to ride another rollercoaster like beyond meat."
03/26/2021,stocks,AAPL slow mover. Goes down faster than it goes up. Not for me though I cheer for AAPL because it’s good for entire market.
03/26/2021,stocks,"I’m in. 

At some point will market makers provide options?"
03/26/2021,stocks,"We had ourselves a nice few days to end the week, congrats! Glad to see it back on track after struggling since that SunTX sell last week"
03/26/2021,stocks,Woo! Patience was a virtue here. I took some profits but I’ll be back to load up on a dip
03/26/2021,stocks,Congrats to you too 🥳
03/26/2021,stocks,Hey since you're playing with a dividend portfolio  you might want to check out $MO Altria. They pay a pretty penny dividend wise.
03/26/2021,stocks,AMLP
03/26/2021,stocks,Just wondering what long term holds you have now?
03/26/2021,stocks,But where
03/26/2021,stocks,There is no need to be nice to slaves
03/26/2021,stocks,"Hey been days but I’ll respond. 

Your point of stocks being denominated in dollars... well so is gold. And gold is also valued against euro, yen, GBP’s etc. so that point I think is flat. 

And at minimum, stocks would absolutely keep up even if the company wasn’t growing or contracting, but just on an inflation trade, they would rise. Maybe gold would outperform i. The near term. And that would be from panic buying in the futures market will leverage that comes with it. And then the bubbly top would pop and they’d be right next to stocks again. 

And your #2 point about a company going bankrupt. Well that is the risk of equities. And why they’ve outperformed gold 4x since 1971. And that’s just the broad market including the losers. 


And Peter makes predictions so often that again, he’s bound to be right about something, sometime. But it’s insignificant. Unless you are that lucky guy who watched an interview. With no knowledge about anything, put all your money into leveraged gold futures contracts. And gold rises 10% in a month or 2 and you cash out with a ton of cash, that’s just the only way you’ll make money on shiff (funny, buying dollars by selling your gold). 

There will be no hyperinflation here. Period. 
We can get a lot of inflation soon from supply constraints and stimulus, but it will be temporary. And the goal is 2% over time. Oh! Another half baked proof of Peter as being correct. When the Fed’s goal is 2% inflation. Over years, yea the dollar can lose 50% of value. So looking at a long chart you’ll be like “omg he’s right!”  But that 50% dive takes multiple decades. It wasn’t that one year the dollar was dumped in 1/2. And your going to nail the top. 

The fed does not want rates at 0. They understand the problems with that. 

But we have Janet Yellen at the treasury. Awesome. Former fed chairwoman. And when she was the head honcho she told congress we needed fiscal stimulus. And it fell on deaf ears. DEMAND side stimulus. Actual programs and projects to create things. Real economic growth, not just bumping the numbers. 

The fed alone can only effectively do more of a Supply side stimulus in providing more cheaper dollars/liquidity to motivate people to chase returns. Problem is when the money just chases rising assets like gold or stocks. With less real growth actually occurring. 




And when it comes to too high inflations “the fed is powerless to stop it”

Wrong. We did it in the 70’s. Really high annual inflation. This is literally the best fight for the fed."

03/26/2021,stocks,"Did I say ""for sure""? You asked for POTENTIALLY 200% return... If you are that stupid, that you think there is any stock that is 100% guarantee to success, then good luck 😅"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Is it Illegal, if not unethical, if after a secondary or private placement of stock, newly issued shares, as what happened yesterday with my $VUZI, that the underwriters, given shares in the transaction, could Short the stock with those shares and buy it back with those same shares?

03/26/2021,stocks,Stock up 16% last two days. TD upped its price target to 12 and they always under estimate the earnings
03/26/2021,stocks,"I am trying to figure this out: are the unbiasedstocks' Reddit score basically the amount of mentions in a specific time frame or are there other parameters they calculate in there? I am assuming it's the amount

thx in advance for your answer <3"
03/26/2021,stocks,"He actually has a description of what he tracks on his website. I use it for the scores, but if it wasn't his it'd be something else. I'm very happy with it but I'm not totally sure how he weights his metrics.

That's the weakness of my model, it really relies on his methods staying consistent"
03/26/2021,stocks,"just checked it, looks interesting. 

I am kinda thinking of working on a code that takes all the parameters mentioned into account , maybe we could produce similar results to further strengthen your theory or allow flexibility. one thing i am not sure of is the weight of the parameters , guess some trails and error could lead to something."
03/26/2021,stocks,I can definitely help you test it out
03/26/2021,stocks,Sounds good! I’ll let you know 👍🏻
03/26/2021,stocks,"I think if you’re completely new to the whole topic of finance and economics I would STRONGLY recommend: ‘How money works’ and ‘the economics book’ by DK
These are really good books to get the basics. 
They mainly feature infographics, but it has extremely useful information with simple ways of explaining it. 

These two books touch on pretty much every important aspect you need to know about the two subjects and they give you a strong but basic grounding, allowing you to build on from there!"
03/26/2021,stocks,No I haven’t I’ll try it out
03/26/2021,stocks,LAC calls for November are looking great.
03/26/2021,stocks,Thank you.
03/26/2021,stocks,"Amen brother.  Amen!  Suicide and murder should never be someone's last resort when mistakes, accidents, or failures arise.... because there are some folks that would kill not only themselves, but their entire family too when they're feeling super afraid.  

Money comes, money goes.  It's not the solution to one's ""real"" problems, and by that, I mean one's insecurities."
03/26/2021,stocks,"Thabks OP! My buddy and I are finally getting into trading. Our strategy was to get single base hits frequently vs chasing occasional home runs. Then we ran into your post. It aligned perfectly with what we’re trying to accomplish. 

We’ve been studying your tables and reading your answers to the questions asked. It’s been a great learning experience for us!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"Awesome! This is a rough week to get into it since everything is falling, but it'll probably give some good buys for when things go green.

I used to chase the huge 500% gains you see all over here, until I realized that consistent 15% gains add up a lot more over time. Let me know how it works for you or if you have any questions!"
03/26/2021,stocks,"So far, not really. The market's been very choppy so I'm not trading much. I did have a few tickers hit that 15% goal but far less than the 75% success rate OP stated. It might work better with some tight stop losses, maybe at 1% so the bad trades kill themselves as early as possible.

Keeping an eye on unbiastock and OP's spreadsheet is still probably a good idea if you don't have access to a traditional scanner.

If you're going to try this, paper trade or use small positions with tight stops."
