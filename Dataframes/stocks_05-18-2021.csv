2021-05-18 19:13:47,stocks,"“Playing with the house’s money” is just all mental accounting. It’s really just a bias that can hinder long term gains. This is only really beneficial if you don’t know what you’re doing (gambling) or in a really speculative positions. 

If you did your DD, you should have price targets set out in the long term. DD isn’t just about looking at all the possibilities they might have and all the qualitative stuff. People need to look at the numbers and financial statements before making investments. Sure, a company might have industry altering innovations up ahead, but at the end of the day it’s still a company that needs money to run, if they have no money coming in, how will they sustain themselves?  

If you did everything, and you are still wondering, then ask yourself “why do you want to sell?” If your initial investment thesis changed or an event that the company announces materially effects the company in a negative way, then it’s fine to sell."
2021-05-18 19:16:05,stocks,No one every went broke taking profits.
2021-05-18 19:30:38,stocks,This is the way.
2021-05-18 19:16:55,stocks,Should never go into a trade with out an exit plan.  For profit and for stop loss.
2021-05-18 19:05:48,stocks,"Well, a decent amount of stocks and companies are actually at or near all time lows. Not everything is overpriced and overvalued. My portfolio is full of stocks I feel are actually pretty undervalued. The general sentiment that you hear isn't the best information to go off of and rely on. You'll hear people preach crash's and bear markets like nothing, it's nothing to pay any mind to. 

Best strategy is to just keep slowly investing an allocated amount each month in companies you believe in, and keep buying/holding through ups and downs. Trying to make the right plays for a crash can easily lose you more money than just holding stocks through a crash will. But yeah, 100% not everything is overvalued."
2021-05-18 18:54:10,stocks,"the entire market is not overvalued. parts or sectors are overvalued, but not the whole thing. 

for years, I've tilted towards value investing. this ensures most of the portfolio will be reasonably valued or undervalued. after going through a few market cycles, I've seen how value tends to come out the best in the long-run. I'm comfortable with under-performing because it's always come back and then some."
2021-05-18 18:43:55,stocks,Small scalps.
2021-05-18 18:42:29,stocks,"Uranium, dividend yielding stocks, and selling covered calls on things I want to hold long term."
2021-05-18 19:07:07,stocks,"I usually do my own financial analysis on companies and forecast earnings, etc. to come up with IRRs. I then link all my excel/Google sheets into one sheet to create a dashboard. I usually have a list of my holdings which I’ve already done the rest of my DD on, and whenever those reach a IRR that’s favourable - I add. 

Companies that I find that have decent IRRs I’ll spend time to looking into more like qualitative stuff. Everything is updated in real time so it’s pretty routine. The only things I change are when earnings reports come in and see if my forecasts are in line. If not, then more adjustments are made."
2021-05-18 18:45:27,stocks,I don't think it's overvalued. 86% of the S&P have beat earnings. I think the earnings growth continues and we grow into the current prices
2021-05-18 18:42:05,stocks,The crash already happened last year...
2021-05-18 19:21:46,stocks,I’m struggling to find a better opportunity than VIAC. And the LEAPS are so insanely cheap. Great company with massive upside potential.
2021-05-18 18:52:34,stocks,Horse racing. I’ve got a hot pick in the 7th race.
2021-05-18 19:17:09,stocks,"Thanks very much! 

This is such great advice. I hadn't thought it that way - so the idea is that while the market may be overheating, there still plenty of value out there if you look hard enough?

Gives some peace of mind, if I find the value I don't have to worry about a crash."
2021-05-18 19:21:46,stocks,"Such great advice, thanks so much for this! It gives some peace of mind to hear that strategy works. My goal is to do the same! Do you have any particular industries you're focusing on at the moment? I know everyone should stay in their own areas of understanding, but I'm just curious."
2021-05-18 19:08:42,stocks,Good ole children scalps
2021-05-18 18:47:10,stocks,Thank you! Can you explain what you mean by that - are you doing trades with a much shorter timeframe?
2021-05-18 18:59:25,stocks,"Me too, and sold a bunch of covered calls on aht."
2021-05-18 19:17:43,stocks,"Thanks very much, this is a great example to follow. I think I'll start doing the same."
2021-05-18 18:43:38,stocks,so did the recovery lol
2021-05-18 18:46:34,stocks,"The SNP is back way higher than it was before the crash. I'm a novice but it doesn't make sense to me. Sure, inflation will increase stock prices a bit, but the entire global enconomy has been ravaged by Covid. How can the market be higher than it was before the pandemic even started...?"
2021-05-18 18:56:10,stocks,Has no impact on when the next crash will occur.
2021-05-18 19:34:23,stocks,"I'm with you. Although I bought at $41.50 and it dropped to $37 at its worst, so I'm wrong for the time being. But the P/E is crazy low, and it just beat its last earnings and the four earnings before that. Plus they have great new strategy of converting their massive traditional audience to streaming, which could really work given all the original content they make and have in their library. People have been treating it like a meme stock due to that whole Archegos collapse, but I'm thinking it's just a value play, with a 1 to 2 year timeframe and a possible takeover or merger in the pipeline. But what do I know, just getting started lol"
2021-05-18 19:05:00,stocks,Probably the same reason company earnings are higher than before the pandemic started.
2021-05-18 18:44:35,stocks,Take two is always a solid earner. They have tons of vr and ar tech already and more in development. Plus they own rockstar so they basically print money
2021-05-18 18:50:36,stocks,"I think it's mostly just wording. Commodities are roughly categorized in four major types: Minerals (metals and other solid materials), energy (mostly oil and gas), animal (livestock and meat), and other non-animal agriculture products. Whether your refer to these as commodities or natural resources (as long as we are speaking of mostly unrefined products) is irrelevant. To know what is in an ETF, you have to read the corresponding fact sheet.

The way each of these categories trades is very different. Metals such as gold or platinum are rare and can be seen as a storage of value. Most people are familiar with that idea. Energy is consumed and prices fluctuate. Prices for oil and gas tend to affect the price of everything else. Again, most people are familiar with the basic idea. Agriculture products and animals as commodities are more foreign and not commonly traded in retail. If your ETF is involved in that, read very carefully what it does."
2021-05-18 19:06:24,stocks,No reason its valuation should be higher than BYND.  Their 2020 revenue was almost exactly the same. ($418M for BYND and $421M for OTLY). BYND is at $6.6B but generally considered to be overpriced.
2021-05-18 18:22:16,stocks,Buy buy buy
2021-05-18 18:22:19,stocks,Don’t know anything about the company but Oat milk is some vile slimy stuff.
2021-05-18 19:10:17,stocks,"Yeah this was kind of how I took it. But as I said in the post, when it comes to food companies I really know nothing about valuation. Someone could convince me BYND and Oatly shouldn't be worth more than 1-2 billion, but I could also buy an argument that plant-based foods will be much bigger than they are today, the market is growing and their could be potential growth in the future.

But a $10 billion valuation is a bit much for a vegan milk company that also does ice cream and some other stuff. Yeah, it can grow, but at 10 billion I think it needs to grow INTO that valuation. I just can't see Oatly being almost 2x BYND, and I think BYND is more popular."
2021-05-18 17:30:50,stocks,I like schd
2021-05-18 17:57:12,stocks,Pretty much everyone in market cap weighted index funds is tech heavy at the moment. I use the SPDR Sector ETFs to try and balance out a bit.

2021-05-18 17:33:26,stocks,Dividend ETF? Interesting. Sounds like a good play since I feel that money is shifting from growth stocks to value stocks especially with inflation and uncertain interest rates
2021-05-18 18:10:26,stocks,Why XLB

2021-05-18 17:24:40,stocks,"A few things - from a buyers perspective, high rates means less affordable mortgage means less demand for higher price houses (housing demand lower, prices lower). From a sellers perspective they’ll have to lower prices to meet demand likely, but maybe less ppl sell because they can’t afford new mortgage with higher rates on new house.

More expensive mortgages tend to increase rent as people can’t afford to buy. 

Also keep in mind housing prices are super inflated already. Not all REITs have exposure to the same risk with reopening, etc"

2021-05-18 17:28:26,stocks,I think it’s easier to find value in businesses than in real estate since the returns are more easily predictable by the real estate market.
2021-05-18 18:06:39,stocks,"If you're able to invest in MDU apartment buildings, I recommend that.  30% down is great, 40% is better.  Buy a C class building in a B area. Look for a building that cash flows at 80% occupancy. Look at the trailing 24 months occupancy. Fix it up, raise rent slowly, and enjoy the monthly residual income for the rest of your life. Or raise rents, sell, roll into a 1031, and enjoy no taxes on them gains. Rinse & repeat. 

Absolutely do not manage by yourself. Idgaf what anyone says. It's not worth it. Hire professionals familiar with your building and area."
2021-05-18 18:57:22,stocks,IMHO utilities could do better than REITS. UTF or UTG pay good div if you believe infrastructure spending will continue to grow.

2021-05-18 18:28:28,stocks,"> Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won’t fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. 

That doesn't sound right. Market buys and sells are to be avoided because they _will_ fill, but at whatever price the broker can get or sell it for. Which means that you cannot predict what you'll pay or get, particularly for a volatile stock. If the nominal share price is 20, and there are 100 shares available with an ask of 20 and 50 with an ask of 25, a market buy for 150 will fill at 3250, not 3000. This is particularly risky if you're trading on margin as it can cause you to overextend.

To be clear,  use limit buys and sells. Just not sure about your explanation"

2021-05-18 16:29:35,stocks,"It sounds like your thesis is that yes fundamentals exist and everyone should do their research before making a buy but that you also consider the sentiment of investors to be a pretty key part of the research process. It's not all about the balance sheets and fundamentals of a company but about the image of the company in the eyes of the ""audience"" or customer base ***of the share***. Yes the company does things and customer sentiment for the services or goods that the company sells on the market are one thing (and correlated to the share price) but the sentiment of the target audience of the share is the direct driver of price. 

As younger and more online generations start thinking about saving/investing for retirement, how do you think this will change? It seems like my peers (myself included) have really high standards for companies, people, and products and are quite willing to turn their back on a formerly favorable entity for bad behavior. Do you think that institutional sentiment will get more volatile like retail sentiment? I know that Vanguard and other huge institutions are making moves towards ESG ETFs as a rival to whole index funds which has me assuming the answer is yes."

In addition to that, investing isn't popular in my country at all, only 5% or so people have stocks, but luckily that's slowly changing and people start to realize that if they don't invest they'll have no money to live off in retirement.

It's about growth.

If you feel it's going to grow at by 100% for the next 3-5 years, it's likely fair valued.  If you think growth is going to be 150%, it's undervalued.  If you think growth is going to be 20%, it's insanely overvalued."

So why don't they get reported on then, if they're on the same level as Palantir then? I'm pretty confident that the reason this fairly minor shit is getting on the front page is because everyone seems to bagholding right now, and this is basically hopium that they didn't fuck it up.

A hedge against an inflation can be a provider of some product/service that has low capex, ideally a moat of protection and can set pricing for its product/service.

Historically, gold has been a so-so hedge against inflation, it rose faster than the rate of inflation but only slightly and in the meanwhile equities exploded.

Also most commodity markets do not work in this naive simple way ""*more demand for metal X -> price of metal X will go up*"". Actually, the demand may go up and the price will go down. Demand for copper went up but the price went down for 15 years (and spiked only recently). Uranium now sells for less than it costs to produce and if demand increases, there is one state-owned producer which can scale easily and flood the market very quickly. Lithium is even worse in this aspect because it isn't a rare metal and it isn't a commodity (there is no commodity and no futures market for it right now - compared to e.g. copper)."

2021-05-18 14:34:55,stocks,"No.  Just last year Albemarle corporation said the price of Lithium is too low for Lithium mining to be profitable.  The problem with lithium batteries is not that material costs are high, it is that there are not enough battery manufacturers to meet demand."

So how are you positioning your portfolio for inflation then? REITs? Financial sector? 

> No, lithium is relatively abundant and the future situation (in 10-20 years) may be very different compared to today - consider recycling of old EV batteries, new mining technologies, new battery compositions.

There is a new company I've been looking at involved with lithium mining and a strong emphasis on recycling old EV batteries in a more environmentally-friendly closed-loop system.

Despite the supply, the cost of Lithium itself has been upward trending."

2021-05-18 15:12:46,stocks,"The margins are *currently* low. The demand is only going up and up from here and that’s the point as to why you want to get into lithium now or in the near future because once it gets more profitable because of the higher demand, that’s when you will see price action.

2021-05-18 13:56:32,stocks,"Underselling the competition. The Institute for Local Self-Reliance notes in its report that “Amazon uses its vast financial resources to sell many products below its own cost as a tactic for both eliminating less well-funded competitors and acquiring customers into its Prime ecosystem, which sharply reduces the chances they will shop around in the future.” In 2014, Bob Kohn, a technology attorney and founder of EMusic.com, asserted that Amazon used predatory pricing to gain an advantage in the book industry, as reported by CNBC.
Displacing an open market with a privately controlled market. By using Amazon Prime to corral an ever-larger share of online shoppers, Amazon has left rival retailers and manufacturers with little choice but to become third- party sellers on its platform; in addition, half of all online searches begin with Amazon. In effect, Amazon is supplanting an open market with a privately controlled one, giving it the power to dictate the terms by which its competitors can operate, and to effectively levy a kind of tax on their revenue.
Amazon leverages the interplay between the direct retail and platform sides of its business to maximize its dominance over suppliers. As Amazon extracts more fees from suppliers, it reduces their ability to invent and develop new products. Meanwhile, Amazon is rapidly expanding its own product lines, using the trove of data it gathers from its platform to understand its suppliers’ industries and compete directly against them. Many of these Amazon products appear at the top of its search listings.
Increasing prices once the consumer is hooked. Already there’s evidence that Amazon is using its huge trove of data about customers’ buying habits to raise prices. It’s also started blocking access to certain products, charging higher prices, and delaying shipping times for customers who decline to join its Prime program."

All brokers take T+2 days to clear stock trades (T+1 for options). It sounds like your Fidelity account is a cash account while your RH account is a margin account, because margin accounts will let you use money from a sale that hasn't cleared yet, while cash accounts will hit you with a good faith violation if you trade with unsettled funds. But if you have a margin account with under 25k in it, then you're subject to PDT rules which limit how much you can day trade (does not apply to cash accounts)."

2021-05-18 12:29:46,stocks,"You're not wrong at the core but at the same time, there is a lot of things going on that we don't know, particularly when it comes to the military industrial complex, flight and aero space. The F117 was in service for years before it was revealed to the public. That was early 1980s tech and it was about 20 years more advanced than anything expected.

The same company that produced it, Lockheed Martin, also produced the F22, the most advanced stealth fighter that is publicly acknowledged right now. Anything beyond that is considered a UFO at this point.

But Lockheed Martin has endeavors that go far beyond building fighter jets. They have been doing extensive and secretive research into nuclear fusion, metamaterials and who knows what for a long time. Their website even says one of their goals with fusion is to provide aircraft and spacecraft with *unlimited range and unmatched endurance*.

If that was their publicly acknowledged work in 2010, then you have to ask the question what they might secretly be up to today."

2021-05-18 12:34:22,stocks,I agree with you the thing is the level of advancement these “aircraft” have is so much higher than the f117 or f22 were compared to the existing aircraft at the time even tho they were more advanced. They still had fucking wings and burned jet fuel hahaha. Like sure they are 20 yrs ahead at the time but the basic physics and aerodynamics were the same as all aircraft and still are. What we have here today are objects moving in any direction at a given momen pulling 700 g’s with no wings or control surfaces or obvious propulsion or fuel burn. This is a different level.
2021-05-18 12:40:10,stocks,"I know exactly what you're talking about and I also know that pretty much every case of a UFO being filmed has been either:

1. Classified or otherwise secret aircraft testing
2. Unusual weather phenomenon
3. Fake

I have seen the most recently released videos (which incidentally were actually published years ago, but recently got more traction as they were acknowledged to exist). I'm certain it's a weather phenomenon or some other mundane explanation."

2021-05-18 12:44:37,stocks,"I saw the videos, they are indeed very interesting and any explanation is purely speculative. That level of instant propulsion in any direction would be the hardest to explain, and I can't even explain it with speculation. As for no wings, looks can be deceiving. It's probably possible at this point using a computer cluster to model a plane or helicopter that from afar looks like a loaf of bread and build it using metamaterials. But we won't know until we know."
2021-05-18 12:53:03,stocks,Lol. Well you can lead a horse to water. Don’t know what to tell you if you think the recently popular vids are weather phenomenon.

Just reading about this and looking at the price of both, this feels like a good idea to be holding a bit of both and a good time to do it. Looking to get some input and opinions and see what others might be doing here, apologies if this is already being discussed elsewhere."
2021-05-18 12:28:40,stocks,"Long time T holder, i dumped my entire stake after announced dividend cut and media company spinoff. No reason to own T now, where you can own VZ or MO"
2021-05-18 11:51:26,stocks,"T without Warner media is just a heavily debted cell phone company that cut its dividend.
Not sure I would want either of them right now."
2021-05-18 12:15:32,stocks,Long time T holder. Love the dividend and TBH it's all about the dividend because the stock has been stagnant. If the dividend is cut there will be no reason to hold in my opinion. Because let's be honest they aren't that great of a company and they have way too much debt.
2021-05-18 11:55:54,stocks,"T is a shit company, tbh."
2021-05-18 14:49:10,stocks,"I don't own T, but considered it a while ago. I didn’t buy in because of the debt and streaming competition (I do own DISCK however). The negative coverage of the deal seems really overblown. They bought TW in 2018 for 85B. Since 2018, they've made over 13B in operating income and have another year with it representing 18B in income by the time they sell. They're selling 29% of TW for 43B, valuing the combined business at 148B, for which shareholders get 71% representing 105B. That’s combined value of 123B from owning TW (income +spin off value).

Having the dividend cut sucks, but with the dividend the stock wasn’t going anywhere and the amount of money they’d have to spend to compete with Netflix meant either the dividend or HBO Max’s growth potential would’ve been stifled either way."
2021-05-18 17:58:48,stocks,"It is a falling knife right now, do not touch it. Too dangerous play. Buy it when price is so low that dividend yield is above 5%, no reason to risk capital here for yields lower than oil companies."
2021-05-18 12:42:56,stocks,"I think it's a good business decision for AT&T. It's not like WarnerMedia is being spun off for nothing. T controls more than 70% of the new company. It receives cash from the deal and get rid of some of its debt. With this, T can better focus on its core business.

More research is required, but it sounds like the new company will not be traded publicly? If yes, that's good news for T. Otherwise the share price will be affected long term for sure."
2021-05-18 12:25:48,stocks,"T isn't terrible if you're just looking for somewhere to park money for a while due to its dividend, but you'll have better long term success with actual growth plays. T has been pretty stagnant for a while now, even with HBO Max being implemented in the last year. There's just not a whole lot of upside."

2021-05-18 12:00:50,stocks,"So your advice (opinion) aside from stay away entirely would be to wait for whatever this newly formed company will be to either announce its IPO? Or sit back and see what it does before getting in? I know people on r/dividends tend to like T but I am assuming this merger business will sour that benefit to some degree.  


Edit: syntax"
2021-05-18 12:56:36,stocks,Isn’t the dividend cut confirmed now?
2021-05-18 15:05:40,stocks,"They will have a decent chunk less debt after this merger. I’m not thrilled with the dividend cut but T was always a 7% a year stock solely off its div, now we’ll get more ~4% div but we could see growth again. Personally I’m willing to wait and see, 3% growth isn’t a ton and it would put shareholders back to even in this as an investment.  With the debt reduction I think this will poise them nicely moving forward in the 5G field especially if the infrastructure bill gets passed. 

Now the new co is the wild card. They are going to be a bit debt heavy out of the gate, but will have enough assets to be a solid player in the streaming market. IF they do well with that we could get considerable growth out of them in the first few years.

Edit:  I also think that Stankey is showing that he wants to change the status quo at T and get the company back on top. Admitting purchasing Time Warner was a mistake and coming up with this creative way to mitigate their loss on that while shedding it is a good sign of his vision moving forward. He was also behind the direct tv deal. I like his focus on the core business and think he will drive this company well in the upcoming years."
2021-05-18 12:01:43,stocks,Can you elaborate on this? Why do you think so? Are you saying financially or just the service they offer?
2021-05-18 12:02:44,stocks,I dont think the new company needs to IPO it will be public from the start since they are giving shares to people who old T & Disc. That to me is the incentive but the debt isn't makign people excited I think

2021-05-18 12:32:53,stocks,"Shrinking margins for decades is the biggest red flag. Poor management is the other problem. 

The last 2 decades or so they were unable to capitalize well on mergers while insiders kept getting bonuses. Board doesnt seem to care about shareholder. Customer sentiment is horrible. One of the most hated companies in the USA for decades now. 

This latest spin off looks like yet another pay day for execs and insiders. They will give each other bonuses yet again for work well done then grant other insiders a big exec job. Shareholders now get to pay for two sets of executives rather than 1 (yay). Doesn't benefit shareholders in any way. Also allows the company to take on more debt, which means we can expect yet another bad purchase soon I guess."
2021-05-18 12:06:05,stocks,"Understood, I guess by IPO I just meant whatever the equivalent in this situation would be (just hit go) But to your other point, this is exactly what I am wondering, do people think it makes sense to go in on one or both of these companies now while the prices are dipping in the hopes that they will come out of it owning shares in a newly formed company that competes with Netflix etc. and does not carry the debt anchor associated with T currently, or better / safer to just sit back and see what happens?"
2021-05-18 12:52:21,stocks,"Exactly, every time I've been sucked into a bullish position on T, it's gotten rammed straight down my throat because they aren't even trying to play the game. The ONLY thing I'll ever invest on T is puts. They've never failed to pay off."
2021-05-18 12:27:07,stocks,"yeah i'm wondering the same. at first it sounds like a great idea. own T (a good dividend stock anyway) and get some of this new company stock too. mayeb that's not how it works?
the dividend cut seems to be fueling the sell off which makes sense as that's why people own T but yeah for a shorter term investment is T a good buy. idk sorry. research required"

* The stock went up so much that i now believe its overvalued.


* The stock went up so much that its now too big of a percentage of my portfolio, then i reduce the size of it.


* The initial reason i bought it at first is no longer valid. I no longer believe in the stock and i believe its better to cut my losses and go for a better long position. This needs more than just ""it went down 10%"", i need a legit reason to think its not a good choice anymore."
2021-05-18 11:41:29,stocks,"For me, If the original thesis and assumptions that I made about the company's future when I put in the money has changed, then it's time to sell."

2021-05-18 11:44:03,stocks,"Many reasons. It might include stuff such as: If your initial investment thesis changed, target price met early with no material change in the company, news that affects the company materially (financial or qualitative), etc. 

It really just comes down to answering why you want to sell something you’re holding long term. Instead of asking when to sell, ask yourself why."

2021-05-18 11:41:06,stocks,I want all of my stocks to at a minimum double every 5 years so I sell if I no longer believe that the stock is likely to at least double in the next 5 years.
2021-05-18 11:46:21,stocks,"Depends on your investment strategy.  A friend of mine would invest and as soon as he achieved a 2%-5% growth, he would sell. Do that over the course of a year and the compounding profits can be quite good. He was more ""Short Term"" minded.  Long term folks might follow juaggo's advice which is also very sound as well. Me personally I follow both practices.  I have long term plans that involve me taking profits from my short term plays. It's all a matter of preference."
2021-05-18 12:02:30,stocks,"I have two criteria I use on my holdings.

1) it has gotten such a gain in price I call it ""stupid high"" and I'll take my profit.

2) something has fundamentally changed with the company that makes me not want to hold it anymore (might be a sale for a loss, or a sale for a gain)."

And one reason I would not consider to be a good reason to sell but I’m sure you’ll get a lot here is when the stock has gone up by a certain amount. Its only a good reason if the fundamentals don’t support it...so alone it is not the reason to bail out. If the company 2x in one year on their stock but also 2x their earnings - stay the course."

Don't overthink it."
2021-05-18 14:02:40,stocks,"Whenever you decide to purchase an equity whether it be stocks, bonds, mutual funds, commodities, gold, etc. you have to also have an idea of what your plan is for that investment. Do you plan to keep it for a short term gain, do you plan to sell it if you see a certain percentage profit, are you looking for a long-term hold, are you looking for long-term dividend payments, are you looking to sell options on it (covered call), etc. have a plan from the start and the plan may be very different for each security you own. Having a plan also helps keep emotion out of trading to a certain degree. As long as you have the conviction to hold and follow your trading plan. Sometimes investors act impulsively based on very short term market moves. While this may be beneficial when for example selling a particular stock because it unexpectedly hits a new significant high based on news, Regular impulsivity when buying and selling stocks usually leads to chaos and a decreasing account balance."

2021-05-18 11:51:55,stocks,"Generally speaking, you should have an overall goal for every portfolio. You buy securities that you have concluded will contribute to reaching that goal. You should sell securities that you determined to no longer fit your strategy.

For me, I mostly invest for dividends and long term growth. In practice that means I tend to buy with the intention to hold for a long time, possibly forever. I reinvest the dividends flexibly taking into consideration daily market conditions.

It's not like I will never sell, but I tend to have a very specific reason and plan in my mind when I do. I might have bought a security for it's yield and will sell it when it becomes evident that this yield is cut or cannot be guaranteed. I might sell a stagnating security for something with more upside. Rotating into something that is a better fit for the portfolio.

What I will not do is cash out simply for the money or panic sell on red days. Always have a reason and plan when selling."

Too big of a percentage of your portfolio? Why does that matter? Why would you kill future gains like that if it's doing very well for you? Unless you mean you want to secure some gains and then buy back in at the inevitable dips, but cashing out because it's making you the most profit doesn't make sense to me."

After the split, the share price jumped up to $1.60. By my dumb math, that means I could exercise the option and sell the 100 shares for a $46 profit. And the expiration is so far away, plus with the volatility of the split, I'd imagine some nice extrinsic value, too.

The problem is that the option is only trading for $8...

Why? How? If the option contract has a an intrinsic value of $46 and it has intrinsic value in it's far expiration and volatility, how is this option contract not currently valued at $50+?

EDIT: I just noticed you can't buy/sell options for Assertio right now...is this standard after a stock split?

Is this possibly the only time it makes sense to exercise my call and sell the stock? Or do I hold and the option price will catch up with reality soon?"
2021-05-18 11:41:38,stocks,The option strike price will adjust to account for the split.
2021-05-18 11:32:02,stocks,Asrt had a 4 for 1 reverse split meaning your. 5 call is now at the 2 dollar strike so its like 33% otm
2021-05-18 12:15:32,stocks,"Excellent, thanks for clarifying"
2021-05-18 12:15:14,stocks,"Got it - for some reason I assumed a split meant 2 for 1, not sure why

So really - it sounds like my contract lost a lot of value, as I need to hit a much higher trade price to break even?"
2021-05-18 12:27:34,stocks,"there are 2 splits: stock splits (bullish) and reverse splits (bearish), both can have any number (30-1, 2-1, etc)
 
yes, your contract is far otm now"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Company I work for has been aquired, what is a normal exchange rate for unvested options? The company I work for is being aquired and I have stock that is unvested but am wondering if there is a normal exchange rate typically seen when this happens or if it's normally a percentage? 

I have 1500 unvested shares in a grant, I understand that number will decrease but the share price will increase, hoping to be able to estimate what my share total will drop down to. 

Thanks for any info!"
2021-05-18 11:14:59,stocks,Zero. There is no guarantee that unvested options will transfer.
2021-05-18 11:17:32,stocks,"It all depends on the company that is buying the one you work for.  I have seen where they automatically vested them all for everyone.  They could also be converted to options for the new company with the same vesting rules.  The company could also chose to do something different.  There isn't going to be any standard.  A lot will depend on if the acquiring company actually wants to retain the employees of your company.  If they are ok with or even want to lose some of the employees they will be less generous, but if they really need to keep you they will be more generous."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"A question about AbbVie balance sheet: what am I missing? I’ve been trying to analyse the AbbVie balance sheet (annual reports here [https://investors.abbvie.com/sec-filings](https://investors.abbvie.com/sec-filings)) in the last couple of days, and have something I’m apparently not understanding. The first thing that stands out is the shareholders’ equity, which was negative in 2019 and barely shifted to the positive side in 2020. This inflates the ROE (about 35% in 2020 according to my calculation) while the ROIC is significantly lower due to the large amount of debt (about 3%).

Now the near-zero book value and the high debt seems to me like a huge red flag. If one looks at the cash AbbVie is generating, their operational cash flow in 2020 was $17.6 billion and free cash flow was $16.8 billion. About $7.7 billion of that FCF goes out as dividends. The long-term debt interest payments for the next years will be, according to the notes on their balance sheet, in the range of $2.8 billion annually (paid from OCF) and the principal payments $8.4 billion in 2021 and a massive $12.4 billion in 2022 (paid from FCF). That means practically no cash will be left after debt principals and dividend payments to invest in growth, or for buybacks for that matter.

Now this looks like a textbook value trap to me. However, it’s one of the few companies Berkshire has been buying this year so they seem confident. In addition, according to their annual report, they still manage to get cheap loans from the market, so lenders are not seeing them as a risky investment either.

So the question is, what am I missing on their balance sheet? Where’s the value that Buffett is seeing? Is this just a dividend play? Trying to learn this stuff here so would appreciate if somebody can point me to the right direction!"

They seem to want to grow by buying companies and existing drugs rather than through R&D. So debt will remain part of ABBV future, and with ultra low cost of funding loans, it may work in its favor. 

Own it and ABT for a long time, if I had to sell one, would be ABBV as I believe ABT is much lower risk, with more stable growth ahead of it. 

Not beating on ABBV, as with dividends included it has provided a better rate of return, but don't believe it will beat ABT over the next few years."

It really depends on the individual stores and their location. We have two Walmart near us and the experience is vastly different. 

One always has empty shelves, products on the floor (which is trash shoppers' fault and not Walmart's), 2-3 checkout lines open when there are huge lines in each one, rotten fruits and produce that look like they've been there since the Great Depression, etc.

We know that Burry has ~ 8,000 contracts, which implies a price of ~ $66,000 per contract. What? For perspective, one 6/17/2022 $1,200 P is trading for $66,075 at the time of writing this - the price per a given contract bounces around for strikes above $1,200, but the price is in an uptrend.

2021-05-18 08:35:16,stocks,"They can do anything they want but offering a second class of stock has nothing to do with not wanting to split it has to do with voting rights.  In your Google example they did a 2-1 split with the payout being the newly created class of shares being the non-voting ones.  This gave everyone who owned Google the same number of non-voting shares as they had voting shares which is why the price stayed the same.  The reason they did this was insiders wanted to sell but they did not want to dilute their voting rights so they sold some of their newly created non-voting shares.  I believe that newly created stock options and grants given to employees are now the non-voting shares also to not dilute the voting stake the founders have.

As for BRK here is the google summary:

Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of common stock designated Class A and Class B. In 2009, a share of Class B common stock has the rights of 1/30th of a share of Class A common stock except that a Class B share has 1/200th of the voting rights of a Class A share (rather than 1/30th of the vote).

Something something fractions are bad maybe?"
2021-05-18 15:54:52,stocks,"No I didn’t. My point was that Amazon would attract a lot of investors if they made a stock split. But I do understand why they don’t, because they have enough cash, peasant."

2021-05-18 12:49:05,stocks,"If you fail to see why this doesn't matter since you still receive the dividend and price appreciation, than yeah you're right this isn't worth discussing.

Oh no! I own 50.42 shares of company X! That .42 is *bad* since I technically don't get to vote with that and my *broker* holds it until I get a nice round 51. *The horror*

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,Iron Butterfly 🦋 Can anyone tell me if this option strategy is profitable? Been hearing about this strategy and wanted to know if it’s really that easy to turn a few bucks into some big profit. I know that you have to pick a pice and pray it stays near that. How can I maximize profits with this? And is there a better strategy with little cost but a higher chance of getting profit? Lastly is this strategy even worth looking at?

No."
2021-05-18 08:48:06,stocks,"Sure, it's profitable if you do it correctly, just like any other strategy. But the upside is limited, just like the downside is limited. And it only works when volatility is low. 

Read https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/030314/what-iron-butterfly-option-strategy.asp. If there's any part you don't fully understand, don't use the strategy. It's easy to fuck up options strategies if you don't know exactly what you're doing."
2021-05-18 09:32:49,stocks,"Any strategy is profitable if applied to the right situation. On any non-volatile stock where it is likely to work, the return is pretty small. On any stock that is volatile enough to get a large return, the strategy is less probable to profit.

The same can be said for pretty much anything though. There is no ""better strategy"" in general, just a bunch of tradeoffs. You have to make a guess at what the stock is going to do and then choose a strategy with a risk and return that is attractive to you."

How long should it remain in my brokerage acct? Should I divide it between banks? Basically how do the ultra rich do it?"
2021-05-18 08:14:53,stocks,"The question you're asking is a loaded question. It leaves several questions that I feel should be answered to give you an accurate answer however let's skip all of that and I'm going to answer it at your face value question.

My assumption being that you have a million dollars after taxes, and no debts owed. The best place you can stick your money if you were trying to maintain that level of wealth, is in the stock market.

If you're not concerned with growing your wealth at some crazy multiple, buy a large ETF such as spy, QQQ, or one of the other ones that floats your boat.

These won't make you rich by any stretch of the imagination, but over a long period of time you will have more money then you started with because over long enough periods of time stocks only go up.


Some people are going to suggest real estate but it's a horrible suggestion. Most people who don't come from money are idiots when it comes to money. There are so many ways you can lose money in real estate if you don't know what you're doing the only real answer is the stock market. This doesn't mean that as you make money you can't make small investments and dip your toes into real estate and build your experience, but dropping $1 million on real estate out the gate is a surefire way to lose money in my opinion."
2021-05-18 08:10:45,stocks,"Ultra rich buy more stocks, buy business, reinvest in business, buy real estates, buy more assets like a private jet and write it off as a business expense
Or you could divide about 250k into different banks that offers the best fees and intrest rates . 

I said 250k because that's the normal insurance return a bank can give incase of an economic recession
Please don't be like like that guy who put 7 mil in a private bank and lost all of it (Got back 250k as insurance) because of the 2008 banking crisis. The banks used other people's money to hedge against thier loses and was unable to pay him back so be wise with your diversification"
2021-05-18 08:24:20,stocks,"I believe the question here is that our OP believes that he will have a sudden windfall but the market will tank and therefore immediate reinvestment into long positions will burn that money.

You might want to research a good financial advisor sir... Preferably a big firm, perhaps in a big city.

I'd say 1m is paper handing though ;)"
2021-05-18 09:34:57,stocks,"Why would you insure it? reserve what you need for taxes, and keep invest the rest in a diversified manner. Ultra rich buy real estate, companies, gold, etc.  But 1M is not that level of money."
2021-05-18 11:56:38,stocks,"Just buy up treasuries directly from [treasurydirect.com](https://treasurydirect.com) . You make poop but its safe if all you want to do is maintain the money while you wait. Nice thing about it is you can time when it is returned to you.

I used to roll over 30 day treasuries when i had a lot of money sitting around and I didnt have time or didnt want to invest it.

Otherwise your best bet is to actually buy something. Even if a bank goes under, they cant just take your stock. If you still dont trust them then you can also ask for a stock certificate (an old school paper that says you own x number of y stock)."
2021-05-18 16:49:15,stocks,I would also get Chase private client with that $250k. Then get You Invest with them so when you are ready to invest it is all in one. Immediate transfer of funds into investment account.

Investing in real estate. Unfortunately this cause some fights with my wife since she's pretty old school. Sorry, those times are long gone. From my understanding is much safer to buy REIT stocks rather than buy actual properties. Properties need mainteinance and taxes,and once a renter is in it may become hard to kick him out for whatever reason. I friend of mine took exactly 8 years of back and fort lawsuits to kick somebody out of his house. BUT,yes there's alway a but. Maybe buy a bunch of homes for short stay Airbnb rentals in some touristy area. That would prove to be a decent return of investment IMHO. But ehi,at least that goes for the area I live in."

2021-05-18 09:46:33,stocks,"THANK YOU for the actual explanation. One of the better responses thus far. I do agree with putting it back into the markets, however until I’ve decided exactly how and where to place the money (let’s assume it’s multiple millions), how can I get something like FDIC insurance?

2021-05-18 08:34:37,stocks,"I agree
RIETS are easier to maintain and less of a hassle
But actual properties have a much better ROI if you're dedicated and can give you passive income for a life time and once your mortgage payments are done you can sell the house at an appreciated value. IMO buying actual real estate is way better. It is hectic but worth the ROI. Like OP said he doesn't wanna keep it in exchanges and wants to get insured asap.

Tbh RIETS work best when you don't have enough capital to buy an entire property and cannot risk more"
2021-05-18 07:49:35,stocks,Ok but that’s more of a long term strategy. Prior to purchasing real estate how is the money insured?

2021-05-18 10:56:22,stocks,"Uhhh from what I've seen, you've got to spread it around. Realistically the banks don't insure the whole thing in one account. Let's say you have 3 mill. And you use someone like (insert random bank) bank of America. Each separate account insures uo to 250k (from what i've seen) using the FDIC insurance. So you can have multiple checking accounts insured to that amount. But i hear you saying ""That seems messy! Thats 8 or 10  accounts with one or multiple banks! Is there an easier way?"". Well bud it's the first way i found out how to protect multiple millions. The other way I'm learning about and looking into,which i must admit, is wayyyyy freaking better is something called ""security backed lines of credit"". Get this: you can have x amount of dollars in the stock market to grow and be untouched (like he suggested some broad etf's ! *wink wink*) but they will give you up too 80%(this really depends on THE BANK,and other factors like how much money you put in, the market value and volatility of stock you picked, credit score(i think), and means to pay back (like if you have more money just sitting in bank account with them not being used as a line of credit). This gives you a win-win scenario. You get liquidity to use atleast  30-80% of your net worth for growing your new found wealth (or living off) and you get some safety/security in leaving it in a Stock or portfolio you hand picked. I know one bank in particular would give this line to minimums of 250k and up to 80% of that 250k. 

Sorry this is long winded. I personally know the feeling bro and wanted to help out. I hope this information finds you well!

Edit: i wanted to say buy assets! Anything that cashflows that can either beat inflation or store some value is worth it to use and diversify (i hate diversifying but it's really needed when you want to keep a thing trudging along)."

If you are looking for a way to insure a base amount (i.e. an emergency fund), I just use a money market account that is insured via the FDIC (through the investment firm I use). This is the account I hold profits in prior to deciding how to reinvest, or if I need to pull money for something that comes up.

all major car manufacturers have spent billions - either by themselves or indirectly via SW develoopment companies, startups, you name it - to get self driving vehicles going. none have yet to produce REAL autonomy. 

most systems ""kinda"" work, but only in harshly controlled environments and under specific circumstances. 

those companies have been at it for decades. 

and then - out of the blue - comes TSLA and claims to have solved all the problems all other manufacturers, developers etc couldn´t. yeah. 

If GOOGL hasn´t made their autonomous driving system (waymo) public and couldn´t get it done for mass production, I do not believe one second that TSLA was / is able to do it. for the simple fact that that GOOGL is leaps and bounds ahead of almost anyone when it comes to Machine Learning and AI. they also have some of the largest amounts of data collected when it comes to traffic. (every android phone constantly sends data. every Iphone with google maps installed does the same). plus data from their own cars. 

most of the capabilities TSLA claims to be ""state of the art"" is available in most modern cars as well. nothing revolutionary about anything they claim if you look and compare closely. 

they are just bold enough to call it autnomous."

Who decides what are the acceptable standards? are there any laws that define FSD clearly?

>Tesla does place a disclaimer on its website in small print that notes the $10,000 full self-driving package does not make the car autonomous, and it requires active supervision by the driver. 

This is like cancer warning on cigarette packs, I am sure Tesla will have something like this in their purchase contracts as well that'll help them get out of the woods. At max the way I see it, CA DMV will say you can't continue this practice (may be a fine), Tesla will oblige and come up with new marketing strategy.

>Should Tesla be found in violation of California regulations, it faces the possibility of having its autonomous vehicle deployment permits suspended or revoked in California. It could also have its manufacturer and dealer licenses pulled as well.

This will be more of a loss for CA than Tesla. A lot of companies have already left CA, many are thinking about leaving, Tesla will just be another one. Elon has made his intentions clear about moving out of CA. There will be jobs and revenue losses and it will be a bad PR for CA."

2021-05-18 09:11:59,stocks,"Oh look, more FUD!

For those who have never actually looked into this and are just taking some random media's word for it, Tesla doesn't market the system as ""self-driving"", they market it as follows:

> * Navigate on Autopilot
>* Auto Lane Change
>* Autopark
>* Summon
>* Full Self-Driving Computer
>* Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control

>Coming later this year

> * Autosteer on city streets

> The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers as demonstrated by billions of miles of experience, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions. As these self-driving features evolve, your car will be continuously upgraded through over-the-air software updates.

So they market the capabilities as ""autopilot"". For those who don't know what the term autopilot means:

> An autopilot is a system used to control the trajectory of an aircraft, marine craft or spacecraft without requiring constant manual control by a human operator. Autopilots do not replace human operators. Instead, the autopilot assists the operator's control of the vehicle, allowing the operator to focus on broader aspects of operations (for example, monitoring the trajectory, weather and on-board systems).

This is exactly what Tesla's software does.

They do mention having the ""Full Self-Driving computer"", but never the functionality (yet). In other words, this investigation has zero chance of succes."

I just wish that ""Care for people"" was always present, but it seem very selective.  Maybe even a farce. Maybe its not about people, and more about oil in terms of FSD. Maybe its not about people, and more about money in terms of opening up.

2021-05-18 13:55:48,stocks,The only way I see FSD cars working at the current state of technology is if hive tech is used and every car on the road gets chipped. A computer can not currently perceive what decision other drivers are going to make. Also environments are really too complex for humans to code out all possible constraints. Blind corners where someone could blow a red light a person may be more tentative than a computer. Hives would allow cars to know exactly where other cars are. The only other obstacle is the infinite variability of nature that we rationally try to anticipate like a rock slide on a bend along a mountain road.

Your brain actually flips the image from your eyes (because it is actually upside down due to lensing), and dynamically integrates the two separate images to build a 3d model of your field of vision.

Your vision automatically also categorizes everything it sees (being prey for billions of years makes that extremely important). 

All of this happens without you thinking about it, with almost zero delay.

* Trafikklys og stoppskiltkontroll

Kommende:
* Automatisk kjøring i bygater

Funksjonene vi tilbyr i dag krever at sjåføren til enhver tid har kontroll over kjøretøyet, og gjør ikke bilen selvkjørende. På grunn av dagens regelverk vil du måtte bruke for eksempel blinklyshendelen for å aktivere visse funksjoner. Av samme grunn er rekkevidden og manøvrerbarheten ved bruk av Summon begrenset.

For å kunne aktivere nye funksjoner må de oppnå langt større pålitelighet enn menneskelige sjåfører, og dette må dokumenteres gjennom milliarder av kjørte kilometer. I tillegg må funksjonene bli lovlige å bruke, hvilket kan ta lengre tid i noen områder enn andre.

Mens vi utvikler nye funksjoner vil Teslaen din forbedres kontinuerlig gjennom trådløse programvareoppdateringer."

2021-05-18 12:49:42,stocks,">None of this is a Tesla specific thing

I disagree, Tesla's approach is very different to the competition.

Everyone else is using LiDAR to help establish what exists around them, they work with cameras in conjunction with a 'point cloud' of all the distances and directions to objects around the car.

Tesla relies 100% on computer vision to work out what those objects are and how far they are away, which means it requires a much more complete understanding of what each object is.

If a system using vision/LiDAR sensor fusion 'sees' an object the size of a person, 20 meters ahead even if the camera can't be 100% sure what it sees is a person the system still knows that it exists and is probably a person.

A vision-only system needs to be sure it's a person, work out the size and then figure out how far away it is.  


This gets more complicated when you have something that looks like a person but isn't (e.g. a picture of a person on the side of a van). That's trivial for a LiDAR system as it just sees a big box with a flat side. A vision-only system has to work out is that someone stood in front of the van or is it just a picture?"

The problem comes with distance, LiDAR gives accurate distance measurements a long way out, to get the same accuracy with stereo vision you need high resolution cameras (because the stereo angular resolution gets smaller), but that's fine because high resolution cameras are cheap right?

The problem then comes computation, if you want to keep the same sample rate you need a huge amount more compute for high res images and this is largely why Tesla uses 720p for their cameras. I think that's partly why they also use forward looking radar - I don't think they could get accurate enough distances at the range they need for high speed driving with 720p stereo."

2021-05-18 15:12:51,stocks,Houston or China
2021-05-18 15:02:22,stocks,uh huh
2021-05-18 19:28:25,stocks,What are you talking about? Lidar is just another sensor to collect data. Why it has anything to do with preprograming?
2021-05-18 14:15:50,stocks,"Does Tesla actually get all that much data from all of their cars? I would have figured they get metadata and stuff, but the raw sensor data is the key, and there’s no way they are getting that from all of their cars."
2021-05-18 14:05:21,stocks,"You have absolutely zero way of knowing how much data either party has.

Nor do you know the quality of said data, so 10x more of garbage data is still garbage fuckin data.  It's useless and doesn't fucking matter so it doesn't need to even be brought up as some kind of ""haha got you"" thing

You are blindly accepting the words of what this man says when there's absolutely no evidence to back it up"
2021-05-18 13:32:54,stocks,"> Also says “Full Self-Driving Capability” right above...

Yes, and then it goes on to explain what ""Full Self-Driving Capability means.

I'm not going to go into all the emotional statements you made in the rest of your comment, as there's clearly no point when you're using words like ""exorbitant"" for things that are obviously worth whatever people are willing to pay for them. I don't own a Tesla, but if I'd buy one I would seriously consider paying $10,000 to get a piece of software that is going to change the world and will cost much more in the future AND be a part of its development. You might not share that opinion, but obviously there's no ""truth"" to what a piece of software is worth."
2021-05-18 12:17:40,stocks,"Not at all, I'm perfectly willing to change my opinion when someone shows a compelling argument, as I'm sure you are very well aware since I changed my opinion after you shared information on Tesla's China deliveries from April the other day, which by the way was very disappointing and a perfect moment for me to refuse to believe it if I was driven by emotions."
2021-05-18 16:48:54,stocks,"People can explain away car accidents as one or another person being at fault, or dying as a result of drunk driving, etc. The first family that dies in a Tesla fireball on the freeway as a result of a self driving error, there will be outrage and laws will be made. It doesn’t matter what the overall statistics show and it doesn’t matter what is “fair,” FSD will have to be near perfect before it’s widely implemented because people will not accept risking their lives to a computerized system that has flaws that only slightly beat existing fatality rates.

Edit:

I’m sorry, I must have skipped over the 1% of human errors line. Even in that case, I would be willing to bet that it just wouldn’t be enough to a) satisfy the public and b) satisfy relevant parties from a liability standpoint. 1% is still a lot of fatalities that would essentially just be a random selection based on zero human involvement/error. People don’t have as much sympathy for human drivers because you can blame it on human error. Playing a death lottery every time you get in your car is a very different"
2021-05-18 14:25:38,stocks,Have we all forgotten the lesson of Star Wars?
2021-05-18 14:37:24,stocks,"Oh I know and I agree stereo vision is very helpful I was just pointing out that it still has limitations. 

LiDAR has a whole host of problems as well, it's very low resolution for starters."
2021-05-18 15:54:35,stocks,"A strong lack of self awareness in this comment.

Anyway this is an engineering problem so I'm not sure that number of scientists on the payroll is a relevant metric. 

If you compare the number of engineering teams around the world using sensor fusion to solve automated driving the real narcissism is to entirely discount LiDAR in public (while continuing to use it internally)."
2021-05-18 18:57:42,stocks,"most cats that jump at cucumbers have never seen a snake, this is an assumption."
2021-05-18 15:12:43,stocks,I feel like Will Smith covered this in iRobot.
2021-05-18 14:46:31,stocks,"So it’s actually really difficult to find that data, I was referring to a Cathie wood interview I saw maybe half a year to a year ago, trying to find it again. But Tesla collects data from their vehicles, and they have the largest number of EVs fitted with cameras and sensors on the road and they are collecting data in each an every one. Unless you use lidar and plan on mapping out the entire continental United States, having your cars feed you data and make corrections to your software based on the data you get, it exponentially increases the systems efficiency. Now I don’t know how much of the data the receive is able to be actually modeled. I also don’t know how hard it will be to gather this data when the have 2,3,4 million vehicles on the road all sending data at once and the logistics of parsing through petabytes of data to use. Lots of unknowns for sure, but I believe the company with the best and highest quality data will beat out even the most advanced software, and for me Tesla is in the lead."
2021-05-18 14:11:51,stocks,"No evidence to back it up, have you ever seen a video of the fsd beta, ever been in a Tesla with fsd beta? It’s pretty fucking cool and scary at the same time, have yet to experience that in any other vehicle besides a geofenced one."
2021-05-18 13:45:17,stocks,"Get real dude.

9k USD for what’s essentially a fugazi is not “exorbitant?” There’s not even any certainty that Tesla will win the FSD race or that it is something that will be solved anytime soon. 

If you do some research you can also find that many consumer groups have been calling for FTC investigations into Tesla’s self driving comments and revenues over the years."
2021-05-18 18:53:02,stocks,"this. you cant compare apple with oranges. if you offer self driving cars, the first human response will be about the question of death by robot. if your answer to them is ""well people die anyway"" you may as well pack up. or rather, lawyer up because the first  dead kid is going to see you sued into oblivion. expectations  with  robots and safety is so  much higher than with human error. and rightly so, else why use them or sell them as ""better"" to the public thats scared of them?"
2021-05-18 15:38:57,stocks,The droids are like the most loyal computers ever what are you talking about? They were just soldiers for a different army
2021-05-18 14:45:27,stocks,"And reflections, multipath, things that don't return a signal... :-)  It's definitely a non-trivial problem."
2021-05-18 15:58:31,stocks,Engineers are effectively a form of scientists you fucking loon
2021-05-18 14:24:29,stocks,"People here are claiming Tesla's FSD is an accident avoidance system, it's pretty fucking clear nobody here has actually sat in a Tesla and used autopilot at any point, nevermind the FSD beta

It isn't autonomous, but to say it's an accident avoidance system is just ignorant"
2021-05-18 14:25:32,stocks,"That isn't evidence to back up your claim tesla has 10x more data or literally anything else.  


Nor is it evidence i'd actually accept because videos can be faked and anecdotal evidence of you being wow'd by flashy half baked shit doesn't mean it's fully working."
2021-05-18 16:38:36,stocks,"Like I said, I'm not gonna start a discussion based on emotions. What's the point?

> and revenues over the years.

Also this is not true. Tesla has a very extensive deferred revenue system for the FSD software to prevent exactly that. They have yet to recognize $1.6B of their total FSD sales."
2021-05-18 15:01:22,stocks,"Yeah totally agree and that's what I'm getting at with why it's even harder for Tesla.  


You've got this problem that even with all the robustness you get from LiDAR + cameras is incredibly difficult to solve and they are trying to do it with one hand and because they don't have many miles of LiDAR training data (I mean thousands but not millions) for their vision-only system it's also like being blindfolded."
2021-05-18 16:23:24,stocks,"That's incredibly rude, please don't call me a master of science."
2021-05-18 14:30:57,stocks,"Seriously, it’s truly an amazing experience, and quite scary the first time lol. I don’t understand the accident avoidance thing, you mean to tell me they’re programmed to not crash?? Where’s the fun in that?!?"
2021-05-18 14:27:12,stocks,"I’m sure every YouTube video of the fsd beta videos are fake! Time to sell my shares and load up on the real winner, Ford!"
2021-05-18 16:32:46,stocks,"You realize words can be used colloquially right? Did you genuinely think I meant “he has thousands of theoretician academics sitting in an ivory tower writing tomes on self driving vehicles”?

Or were you just trying to be a quippy asshole"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"I own some shares in a stock that the company decided to redeem 100% of the shares. So, I bought the shares kind of cheap and this is my first time going through a buy back or 100% redeeming of shares by the company.
I want to know how the process takes place.
Since I have the shares through TD, and this is a 100% redeem by the company, will this automatically take away my shares and corresponding share cost will be added to my account?

Is there a formal procedure that I need to be a part of to ensure I get paid?"
2021-05-18 06:03:35,stocks,"100%? because that means it's going private, you sure about that?"
2021-05-18 09:07:06,stocks,You can wait til they go private and pay out the tender amount. Or you can sell now and see if you can get higher than tender amount. It’s really not much difference. But stock prolly jumped to tender amount over night.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

When I first heard the merger news I was stoked but then as the details came out that this wasn't a merger, but AT&T pushing off one of it's most interesting set of assets into an as-of-yet-unnamed entity which won't list for probably a year, *plus* cutting dividends, I started to think hard about how much faith I have in the AT&T that remains.

I still sold at a profit, but hardly anything to speak of. Maybe I'll think about getting back in if it falls far enough in order to pick up shares of the new entity.

IPOE (SoFi) shareholder merger approval vote is next week (Ticker symbol change 3 days later)... which led to some price movement yesterday.. but will pick up today and tomorrow.

**Catalyst- The run up to Merger/ Shareholder Vote**
IPOE is following same pre-merger path as IPOB... both ran up to $26, then pulled back to $15.. then IPOB ran up to $32 in the lead up to Vote & Ticker change. IPOE is at $15, about to start the run to leading up to Merger.  This is the Catalyst than will cause a squeeze.

**4 Million May Calls between $17.50 - $22.50**
will trigger $4 Million shares to be bought (not to mention future month $17.50 - $22.50 Calls which are even larger).

**Shorts are weakened**
Also- shorts a now vulnerable. when yesterday ended, around 2,000 total shares were in the sell lines of Level 2. And no resistance over $16.50. Today should be the tipping point.

**SoFi supports a larger valuation**
Also- SoFi supports a much larger valuation. It offers a full range of banking, investing, lending, insurance and has expanded internationally.  also owns Galileo a Baas company (Fintech software, platform.. worth over $2B.  It powers Robinhood, Chime and many others). Additionally, SoFi will be profitable next year and highs higher revenues than Robinhood.. and Sofi is just starting their expansion growth phase.

In preliminary work to go public later in the year.. Robinhood is being valued at $40B.  (compare this to SoFi's valuation at current price if $15 .. which is around $8Billion). Sofi has a lit if room to run."

2021-05-18 11:46:21,stocks,My green yesterday was silver.
2021-05-18 11:43:22,stocks,Because it was in the deal. You were supposed to read between the lines. They said the dividend would be a certain amount. Which was half what the payout had been the previous quarter.
2021-05-18 11:40:17,stocks,Well an 7% yield implies the market is expecting one.
2021-05-18 11:41:58,stocks,"Worried about a spin-off maybe?

2021-05-18 12:49:49,stocks,maybe it was just insanely overpriced after a 500% run
2021-05-18 13:45:55,stocks,I expect F to pop tomorrow too. Gonna sell out my cost basis when it does and just keep the earnings in play there. I expect F to go lower when the Q2 results are announced and might buy in more then. F has already said Q2 will be rough due to the chip shortage but it will still drop when those earnings are announced.

2021-05-18 17:29:42,stocks,It’s tricky. They are all at or above prepandemic levels. I know travel is coming back but is business travel coming back?  I don’t know... I am watching Marriott but just watching for now.

2021-05-18 19:21:39,stocks,"It's trading far lower than it did last year (in a zero interest rate yolo stock market)...but at the end of the day it still loses more money than it makes and is valued at 18 billion dollars somehow...I personally would never invest in a company that isnt profitable with that high of a valuation....so much has to go right for you to not lose money, like multiple states legalizing sports betting and consistent revenue growth without any signs of slow down or competitors taking advantage"
2021-05-18 09:20:11,stocks,"They aren't really reliant on bitcoins price, if I'm not mistaken. It's their fees that make them the money. People either pay the monthly fee for free trading, or pay high fees on each trade. If the bitcoin and altcoin hype is there, coinbase does well. If the hype dies off, then so will coinbase. I think I want to stay away from the company (For now) and see what happens in the coming months as bitcoin begins to struggle. If they produce good revenue numbers next quarter while bitcoin remains down from its peak, then that would be a big buy signal for me"
2021-05-18 10:23:24,stocks,That isn't even a reason though imo. The stock isn't the company. You have to look at the companies if they are still doing well then if a bear market happens buy more shares. This goes for any stock. If the market crashed 50% tomorrow that doesn't mean APPL is suddenly a bad company.
2021-05-18 14:21:16,stocks,Please diversify a little bit more
2021-05-18 14:36:08,stocks,"Ha, I'm the same! 32 % of my portfolio currently. I feel great (since I bought recently), Most else is in ETF's, it is my only real pick. Your average is still pretty solid IMO."

2021-05-18 10:26:22,stocks,"Yes. Usually by the amount of the div. but sometimes it doesn’t happen.

Like Shell for example. It’s ex div date was may 13th. It went up a lot on may 14th."
2021-05-18 10:39:28,stocks,"I love to buy high dividend stocks like XOM, T, and MO a week before EX-Div date, then sell it the day before. They often climb from all the dividend hop-scotchers picking them up to hold for the payout."
2021-05-18 10:34:33,stocks,"yes but despite what the internet says, the drop is not always permanent.  They drop b/c the dividend but also move with the market.  So if we're in a bull market, it usually drops a tad then that drop disappears in a few days.  This is true for most stocks paying dividends except for a few telecoms that are more or less known as dividend stocks"
2021-05-18 16:12:46,stocks,The did? The top 2 moved less than a percent
2021-05-18 17:34:14,stocks,basically the whole dow30 is shortable
2021-05-18 15:54:44,stocks,market only goes up 8 percent a year on average.
2021-05-18 09:27:43,stocks,"I think TD is having issues this morning. Nasdaq shows a 295,000,000% increase on mine lol. And a few on my watchlist are off in the same way."
2021-05-18 13:57:22,stocks,"I’m a noob just learning but honestly, it looks good. I haven’t seen a P/E ratio this low for a bio-tech/pharma company with a good outlook in a long time. It’s right at the resistance level for 200 day moving average so let’s see if it can break out. I am considering waiting to see if it fails to break out. If the price is again in the 400s I think it would be a great opportunity to buy in."
2021-05-18 15:56:45,stocks,Apple has paid dividends and undergone multiple stock splits since 2001.

2021-05-18 16:19:57,stocks,Because you bought it at 3500
2021-05-18 19:10:46,stocks,That that's probably a smart move. Don't have the balls to short it but it belongs within the $5-$20 range
2021-05-18 10:27:08,stocks,Enjoy the ride but don't be surprised if it tanks. That's pharma for you
2021-05-18 15:07:17,stocks,Very bullish because the stocks in those ETFs are stocks I want to own for the next 5+ years without committing to just a few.  There’s a lot of noise online right now.  I’ve tuned it out. I do not care about a rollercoaster ride because I’m looking beyond next month. I have K and G.

2021-05-18 19:45:02,stocks,Maybe he just set up a portfolio without adding anything to it. Not a bad idea. Have several portfolios. One for growth. One for dividends. One for DCA. Etc. Try several strategies. You could have your one main account that you add to weekly so you're always buying the dips in that one but not in every portfolio.

the answer is that it's WTI front month emphasis on front month. It has high volatility and it has been bid up a humongous amount the last two months. 

There's a lot of buzz around Iran and Russian (Ulyanov is right now negotiating JCPOA). So galaxy brains are evidently getting out of the market, perhaps with some extra shorting, because they think they can predict what happens. Flip a coin, 50% of the time it works every time

If you were half right, which you aren't, you would've seen a crash through more than WTI. i.e., Saudi Arabia or UAE. We didn't. Even brent didn't crack more than a percent and change down. The reason is because WTI in particular is being buoyed by JCPOA because America is very anti-Iran oil, and a lot of futures traders are making it a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. 

Whether you realize it or not (you don't, for the record) you're just seeing some random daily futures contract because Google is tailoring search results to your location. They see American retail investor who knows jack shit, and they show him WTI front month. If you were in Canada maybe it'd be Guernsey Light Sweet or something. If you actually were in oil, to take a random example, maybe they'd show your local Wyoming Sweet. A tale as old as time. But WTI =/= the world's oil supply, or anything like that. I mean this: go back to your crayons

A 2.5% drop in a few minutes is an asterisk. Switch to candles. A smoothed/normalized line graph from whatever free daily futures chart you're looking at will inevitably smooth out all sorts of 2% drops throughout the month."

These are some highlights of the most shocking adaptations.. The tweets are from one of the writers of the story . Jack Nikas 

U.S. law has long prohibited American companies from turning over data to Chinese law enforcement. But Apple and the Chinese government have made an unusual arrangement to get around American laws.

In China, Apple has ceded legal ownership of its customers’ data to Guizhou-Cloud Big Data, or GCBD, a company owned by the government of Guizhou Province, whose capital is Guiyang. Apple recently required its Chinese customers to accept new iCloud terms and conditions that list GCBD as the service provider and Apple as “an additional party.” Apple told customers the change was to “improve iCloud services in China mainland and comply with Chinese regulations.”

China hide process’

In early 2018, Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese billionaire, was spending much of his time in Manhattan trying to broadcast his claims of corruption inside the Communist Party. His latest effort was an iPhone app in China that delivered those claims.

Before his app even became available on iPhones, the Chinese government was trying to block it. Shortly after Mr. Guo applied to the App Store, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the government’s internet regulator, told Apple it wanted the app rejected. It was unclear how the officials knew about it.

Those events and the chain reaction they set off inside Apple were laid out in court documents last week in a wrongful-termination case against the company. The documents and interviews shine a light on a bureaucracy inside Apple designed to censor and block apps, often proactively, to appease the Chinese government.

On Feb. 4, 2018, shortly after the Chinese authorities demanded that Mr. Guo’s app be rejected, an Apple manager emailed a colleague with a question: Did Mr. Guo belong on Apple’s “China sensitivities list,” along with the likes of Falun Gong — the Chinese spiritual movement — and the Dalai Lama?

The colleague replied that Mr. Guo probably should be on the list, given that he had been spreading unverifiable defamatory stories about Chinese officials. She suggested that the question be elevated to Apple’s “executive review board,” a group of executives who decide the trickiest App Store issues, including top deputies to Mr. Cook.

Two weeks later, the board said Mr. Guo belonged on Apple’s China blacklist. Apple employees added his name to the company’s internal “Chinese App Store Removal wiki page,” according to the documents, as well as a software program that would automatically tag any apps that mentioned him.

Six months later, Mr. Guo submitted his app again, with changes to elude Apple’s software. Trieu Pham, an app reviewer in Cupertino, was assigned the app. He didn’t find anything that violated Apple’s rules. On Aug. 2, he approved it.

Three weeks later, Trystan Kosmynka, Apple’s app review chief, sent an email to several managers at 2:32 a.m. The subject line was “Hot: Guo.” The Chinese government had spotted Mr. Guo’s new app, and Mr. Kosmynka wanted to know how it had gotten published.

“This app and any Guo Wengui app cannot be on the China store,” he wrote, according to the emails filed in the court case. “Can we put the necessary pieces in place to prevent that ASAP.”

Apple pulled the app and began investigating. A resulting report said the app was published because the “China hide process was not followed,” according to court documents. It said that Mr. Pham, the app reviewer, should have sent the app to Apple’s Chinese language specialists, who had been trained on which topics to block in the Chinese App Store, including Mr. Guo.

When Apple managers questioned Mr. Pham, he told them the app didn’t violate any policies. The managers responded that the app criticized the Chinese government, Mr. Pham said in court documents, and that this was enough for rejection.

Six months later, Apple fired Mr. Pham. In response, he sued the company, accusing it of pushing him out to appease the Chinese government.

Apple said it removed Mr. Guo’s app in China because it had determined it was illegal there. Apple said it fired Mr. Pham because of poor performance.

Mr. Guo’s media outlets have a history of peddling misinformation. The exact nature of the apps in the 2018 case was unclear, though court documents said they discussed Chinese Communist Party corruption.

Phillip Shoemaker, who ran Apple’s App Store from 2009 to 2016, said in an interview that Apple lawyers in China gave his team a list of topics that couldn’t appear in apps in the country, including Tiananmen Square and independence for Tibet and Taiwan. He said Apple’s policy was matter-of-fact: If the lawyers believed a topic was off-limits in China, then Apple would remove it there.

On Chinese iPhones, Apple forbids apps about the Dalai Lama while hosting those from the Chinese paramilitary group accused of detaining and abusing Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group in China.

The company has also helped China spread its view of the world. Chinese iPhones censor the emoji of the Taiwanese flag, and their maps suggest Taiwan is part of China. For a time, simply typing the word “Taiwan” could make an iPhone crash, according to Patrick Wardle, a former hacker at the National Security Agency.

Sometimes, Mr. Shoemaker said, he was awakened in the middle of the night with demands from the Chinese government to remove an app. If the app appeared to mention the banned topics, he would remove it, but he would send more complicated cases to senior executives, including Mr. Cue and Mr. Schiller.

Apple resisted an order from the Chinese government in 2012 to remove The Times’s apps. But five years later, it ultimately did. Mr. Cook approved the decision, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Apple recently began disclosing how often governments demand that it remove apps. In the two years ending June 2020, the most recent data available, Apple said it approved 91 percent of the Chinese government’s app-takedown requests, removing 1,217 apps.

In every other country combined over that period, Apple approved 40 percent of requests, removing 253 apps. Apple said that most of the apps it removed for the Chinese government were related to gambling or pornography or were operating without a government license, such as loan services and livestreaming apps.

Yet a Times analysis of Chinese app data suggests those disclosures represent a fraction of the apps that Apple has blocked in China. Since 2017, roughly 55,000 active apps have disappeared from Apple’s App Store in China, according to a Times analysis of data compiled by Sensor Tower, an app data firm. Most of those apps have remained available in other countries.

An Increasing Number of Apps Are Disappearing in China

Number of apps that disappeared from the iOS App Store in China by month through February 2021
More than 35,000 of those apps were games, which in China must get approval from regulators. The remaining 20,000 cut across a wide range of categories. Apps that mapped users’ runs, edited selfies or taught sexual positions were removed. So were apps that allowed users to message privately, share documents and browse websites the Chinese government had blocked. More than 600 news apps also disappeared.

Apple disputed those figures, saying that some developers remove their own apps from China. Apple said that since 2017, it had taken down 70 news apps in response to Chinese government demands.

The discrepancy between Apple’s disclosures and the Times analysis is in part because Apple is removing apps before China’s internet censors even complain. Apple does not disclose such takedowns in its statistics.

Mr. Shoemaker said he and his team rationalized removing apps by framing them as simply enforcing a country’s laws. Similar steps were taken in places like Saudi Arabia and Russia, he said. “At the same time, we didn’t want to get hauled up in front of the Senate to talk about why we’re quote ‘censoring apps in China,’” he said. “It was a tightrope we had to walk.”"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"How is the float 1.16m and the shares short are 925,000 with 2.3 days to cover? Trinseo (TSE) Trinseo (TSE) looks to be in the beginning of a breakout. They make one word, “plastics,” and rubber and other chemicals and materials. 

The company blew earnings estimates by 39.25% but are coming off a technical breakdown to the 50 day that consolidated into earnings. 

If you look at the EPS revisions from TSE in their earnings call slide presentation from May 6th the estimated Adjusted EPS for 2021 are 9.12-10.14 vs. analysts are outdated and as low as $4, which they already made this year 🧐, and one gave a $10.04. Comparable companies trade around 10x, and TSE closed Friday at $67.75 and today at $69.39.

There’s more...TSE is 94.77% institutionally owned and 2.2% is insiders leaving a public float of basically 3% with total shares outstanding of 38.74m as of 5/3/21. That leaves about 1.16m shares float. Now here’s what I don’t understand but find very interesting...how can there be 928,500 shares short with 2.3 days to cover and only 1.16m float? Can someone explain this?Aside from this interesting point I like the stock; not stock advice. 

https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=TSE

TSE trades an average 10 day volume of 375.79k. 

This is not stock advice, but what it appears to me is that once the analysts get off their bums and do the math, the revisions will be HUGE and this stock might be worth $90/share range relative to 10x earnings. This is not stock advice. I would be interested if anyone can explain the short interest to float here. Either way TSE seems like a lagger in the space with strong operating leverage and strong eps. 

Not financial advice"
2021-05-18 08:19:38,stocks,"Institutions still count as the float so the float is still over 38MM (38.18MM according to yahoo).  However float has nothing to do with days to cover.  Days to cover is based on the average volume which according to yahoo is 398k.  This means if the shorts bought all the shares that trade daily it would take you 2.3 days to cover all the shorts. 2.3\*398k = 915.4k which is close to the 928,500 short number you have.  Also with less than a million short on 38 million float the short percentage is not even 2.5% which is nothing."

Not diversifying at all is betting on a single company, being able to turn more valuable in the future. 

Firstly I will say that it is infinitely easier for WB to influence any single market, turning profit. Than it is for the average trader to predict which company will turn profit next.

2021-05-18 04:43:02,stocks,"I think it's true, but there's a subtle distinction that's missing. There are three options when investing in something, you can either understand a market and its companies, understand the market but not its companies or not understand the market nor its companies. By understanding, I mean you've done tens of hours of research and you know most of what's going on in that specific market and/or company.

If you understand a market, but not the companies, you should buy an ETF. For example I've spent a lot of time researching the potential of genomics and understand it's a huge opportunity, but I don't understand the companies well enough to pick one or even a few companies, so I'm better off holding ARKG. The diversification is protection against my ignorance of the companies, not the market.

If you don't just understand the market but also the companies, you should just pick the best positioned company and not diversify at all. Unless you think there's a significant chance that you will be wrong, in which case you have to ask yourself if you truly understand the company.

If you don't understand the market at all, you shouldn't be investing in it in the first place. Not through an ETF or anything else (unless it's indirectly through an S&P index fund, although doing so could again be seen as diversifying against your ignorance of the stock market in general).

Obviously you can never be 100% sure a company or market will do well, but that's a part of investing. The goal is not to get it right 100% of the time, but to get it right most of the time. If you do that, you don't need to diversify past your ignorance."

He’s got a lot of Apple right now but that makes sense they’re one of the most profitable companies on the planet, but that doesn’t even look like half of his portfolio....

He also recommends the average investor use index funds which is basically a diversification strategy.

Buffett is a confusing guy sometimes.  I think he’s saying don’t just buy anything.  Diversify but do your homework.  His portfolio is more diverse than mine and I consider myself pretty diverse with holdings in cloud tech companies, comm companies, cryptocurrency, alternative energy and electric vehicle companies (not Tesla) among others.  I wish I could afford to buy apple in volume.

I sold Netflix years ago and that sucks but at the time I needed cash, didn’t really have a choice. :/

I’m reading a book Buffett recommends, Security Analysis, they don’t really preach for or against diversification so maybe that’s why Buffett says that.  It’s just about value stocks, and if that happens to be diverse great, if not that’s fine too."

Can someone help me fully understand a trailing stop loss order. My question is that if I put a trailing stop loss order on a stock of mine at for 10% for example, and in pre-market the stock drops 15%, will it simply not fulfill my order or will it execute the order at the market value of -15% at the open?"
2021-05-18 00:08:19,stocks,"The stop is a trigger for a market order.  It does not guarantee a sale price, you only specify the trigger “price”.  Once your trigger is hit, it activates a market sell at next available.  Gapping down can fuck you."
2021-05-17 23:02:38,stocks,It should trigger at 10% less than the price when you placed the order. If you placed it the previous market day and the next market opens at -15% then you will likely lose 15%. If you place the order premarket but for regular hours then it will trigger if the price drops more than 10% from open. Meaning if open is down 15% and it keeps dropping you could lose 25%. But if it doesn't drop 10% from open then it won't trigger. Once triggered it becomes a market order so no guarantee of what price you will get.

A few things:

-$PRPL: still not really profitable. High P/E around 400?... Financials are okay for growth, don’t seem to be drowning in debt and is improving.
However according to reviews, really nice quality product with a strong patent on the tech. Expanding and look to be making decent money in a couple years. Innovative with products.

-$SNBR: stronger financials except for debt/assets. Good cash flow and a much more reasonable valuation (P/e ~19)
Reviews seem to have taken a downturn lately and the product doesn’t seem to be expanding.

- $TPX: good financials relatively speaking. Cash flow is certainly there and not a huge burden of debt relative to assets and cash flow. P/e also around 19. Even pay a dividend of .72%. 
Products range from low to high end, and demand is certainly there on both sides. Innovation seems to be there but not the strongest from what I can see.

SNBR grew immensely during COVID, when I bought it it continued to grow a bit, but then It dropped hard cause it is considered a growth stock and all the growth stocks got beaten down recently. Recent earnings report was pretty decent. It beat earnings per share, but was a little below revenue targets because of some supply chain issues, apparently foam is harder to get cause of COVID. But supply chain issues will go away with time. They increased guidance on EPS as well. I think hopefully the beating down of growth stocks is over. If the market wasn’t freaking out the last few months it would have probably continued to grow.

2021-05-18 16:32:11,stocks,"> I would love to get recommendations for any other stocks that you think fit in this category.


You won’t like this but none. 


> Like the Post says I have been steady acquiring Joann fabrics (JOAN) stocks because it is a pick and shovel stock. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, what that means is in a gold rush you don’t go digging for gold you sell the picks and shovels to dig gold. Tech stocks can be way overvalued, so instead of buying Etsy or EBay, one might buy JOAN because it sells to those who sell on those platforms. 



Yeah but people aren’t traveling 1000s of miles to buy yarn so they can knit socks and sell it on EBay. Most people sell used items on EBay anyway. 


Honestly I do not think this logic works in the stock market. It works at the local retail level or online retail level but not with stocks. Think back to where the term came from, the gold rush. People traveled thousands of miles to go mine gold and when they got to the west coast they had to buy equipment from the few people that sold them. Stuff was expensive in the west because stuff was scarce, and the people who came to the west had no other choice but to buy from the local shops in town. The pans they used cost them $8 or about $250 in today’s money. A pair of boots would go for $6 or about $185 today. Rice sold for $8 a pound or about $250 a pound today. As you can see the town shops in the west definitely had the upper hand back then. This being said, the cost of a pan didn’t go up in Virginia, it was only in the small mining towns. So it also takes into account regional aspects as well. 


TL;DR As a whole buying the latest trend almost never works out in the stock market as a long term strategy."

Proof-of-stake, likely the future of blockchain going forward, requires even less resources.

I have serious doubts blockchain could EVER be a notable driver of the storage market.

You can totally grow cannabis plants on regular nutrients tho. You just run the risk of lower yeild, and in some cases messing up PH/nutrient requirements for your plants. Seeds are expensive so going that route is usually considered a waste."

2021-05-18 10:54:06,stocks,"No. Semiconductor foundries (ASML's customers) have dedicated an absurd amount of money to chip capacity expansion in the near-to-mid-term.  TSMC is spending $100B over the next 3 years, Samsung I believe they said either $100B or $200B over the next decade, and Intel is building new fabs right now for $20B plus more investments are likely on the way. A substantial proportion of capacity expansion is spent on equipment (what ASML sells) because it's wildly expensive to get equipment that can fabricate leading-edge semiconductors. I believe one tool can cost $10M-$20M and that price goes up substantially with each new iteration of chips - look up Moore's Second Law. 

Another reason the stocks are priced like this is because semiconductor equipment is so fucking complicated that each market is dominated by one or two companies which usually combine for 90% market share, meaning hella pricing power.

$COR  - Great horizontal play, I think this is exactly where we want to be. Could be a TAD BIT lower, but this is beautiful.

$HZO  - Too rich for my blood here, but 5% pull back?! Yea then we are in business - then $HZO becomes an absolute snack.

&#x200B;

$LEA  - We need a small pullback or a 50EMA cross over to be valid. WE in no man's land, we need a value or life here.

$LEU  - Much the same with $LEU as $LEA. We are a bit too high for value, and a bit low for a confirmation. Give it a day or two.

$SITE - Not being dramatic, and it will die because I am going to say this -- probably one of the best technical setups I have seen in weeks.

2021-05-18 05:40:47,stocks,Facts
2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,Intel and Something that stands out.... The chip shortage is expected to last much longer.... Intel has addressed this issue by building several mega plants to produce more chips in the coming years.. how is this not going to send their revenue even farther ahead of AMD... what is AMD doing to address chips.... how will AMD get them in a long term shortage when their counterparts like Intel are paving the way to double revenue by having the ability to pump out their own chips... its something that crossed my mind.. but is intel not setting themselves up to literally double their revenue once these plants are complete and pumping out chips while nobody else can even get them...... what are ur thoughts on this???
2021-05-17 20:59:56,stocks,By the time they get any fab plants operational we will be past the shortage. It's not so quick and easy as you say.
2021-05-18 11:59:16,stocks,"Intel hasn't addressed jack shit. Why are you so gullible? 

By the time Intel finishes building those several ""mega plants"", the chip shortage is long gone. Those will help long term and with future chip shortages but **NOT** with the current shortage."
2021-05-17 22:05:04,stocks,Because TSMC where AMD gets their chips is also increasing their operations bigly. Intel is far behind in many other ways and losing market share so it doesn’t matter if they can make way more chips that no one will buy. This is a very bearish opinion on Intel to be fair.
2021-05-18 08:12:18,stocks,Their chips aren't as good it's that simple. Intel will end up with a surplus in chips by the time that factory is done being made because nobody wants to buy their chips unless they have to.
2021-05-18 16:17:04,stocks,"Intel is more like, Big Talk, No C*ck
AMD will surpass Intel by the time their factories are ready"
2021-05-17 21:20:39,stocks,they still guna be heavily limited because of chip demand is expected to only INCREASE in the future not decrease.. therefore intel has a major advantage having their own chips being produced and not being as limited they can make their own and make more revenue/profit long term.. in 2 years if AMD needs x million of chips they better pray they have a supplier that has them.. they cant get them now what makes u think in 2 years they will be able to?? Intel will just produce them and gobble up more market share!!! I think thats a big reason behind this 20 billion investment they did they see the demand and product availability for the next decade being problematic... idk in my opinion AMD not being more into producing their own chips is going to catch up to them and lead to major revenue set backs from Intel long term
2021-05-18 08:42:32,stocks,This. I've seen how much money the US and China have thrown at production. I've seen how much other private companies have put into this.  Were 100% going to see an oversupply of chips way sooner than anybody thinks. Couple few months to build factories and get them pumping. If both the US and China are producing more than needed for their own manufacturing than who's left to sell them to?
2021-05-18 12:38:31,stocks,Chip demand is only going to increase from every semi industry is what every expert and ceo is spouting so I disagree with you
2021-05-17 22:10:56,stocks,"Meh.  TSCM, Intel, Samsung, etc are ALL increasing capacity.  TSCM is building in AZ and Samsung likely in TX.  If they all follow through on expansions the market will be oversupplied when they all come online.  The odds of AMD not being able to get supply are quite low.  They've got a continuing partnership with TSMC that will be mutually beneficial. 

Building your own foundries also adds a lot of cost.

[https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-electronics-could-begin-construction-new-us-chip-plant-q3-electronic-2021-05-18/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-electronics-could-begin-construction-new-us-chip-plant-q3-electronic-2021-05-18/)"
2021-05-18 08:07:21,stocks,Yea but supply will increase too as everyone is building fabs all of a sudden so prices will fall. Good for AMD.
2021-05-18 09:53:11,stocks,"Months?

It takes months to build a house, not a state of the art semi fab."
2021-05-18 13:06:43,stocks,"Well, good luck listening to ""experts"" and ""CEOs"" then. Hope it works well for you."
2021-05-17 22:51:53,stocks,"So you are saying TSMC will be able to handle all of AMD, TSCM, and any other contracts they have in the future.. thats banking on a lot of demand from one supplier. Good luck with that. Shortage now... = major shortage in 2 years when computers are needed more than ever for electric vehicle and the catchup from all this bottlenecking we have had in the mean time."
2021-05-18 13:07:54,stocks,I mean it has so far look up Intels revenue compared to AMD.... amd still is a little dog compared to intel
2021-05-18 01:56:57,stocks,Its not a matter of how many suppliers. It's a matter of capacity. You could find 10 random suppliers in the industry combined together and TSMC could still dwarf them.
2021-05-18 02:01:09,stocks,"Amd's bottleneck today is all of their products being on 7nm. They have hot items on consoles, gpus, and cpus. As their gpus and cpu's move on to 5nm, this  should ease the supply issue.

From what i heard, the shortage for cars was due to them understimating demand due to predicting a recession and ordering less. This demand today looks like it is a error in logistics where they understimated demand due to covid, gpu mining, etc.

If the industry mispredicts the growth of semiconductors and produces too little to satisfy demand then there will be a shortage, if they predict correctly then no shortage."
2021-05-18 15:24:57,stocks,But isn't that part of the bullish sentiment on AMD? Best case scenario for Intel is to stop the hemorrhaging. Best case scenario for AMD is that there's a lot more of Intel's market share to eat away at.
2021-05-18 15:42:06,stocks,You must be new if you think revenue is all that matters.
2021-05-18 12:36:09,stocks,Your not comprehending can they find them now? No... they can’t what makes you think it’s going to change with chip demand rising we are in a chip shortage they are backlogged with growing demand expected to rise even more
2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,Is there a limit to how many times you can trade the same stock within a month? A family member is telling me you can’t buy and sell a stock and then buy and sell it again within a 30 day period. I looked up day trade rules but really only found the limit on round trips if you have under 25k in your account.
2021-05-17 20:40:43,stocks,Your family member is dumb
2021-05-17 20:23:48,stocks,"you can do it no problem, but it affects taxes. it's called a wash sale."
2021-05-17 20:23:36,stocks,You can look up wash sales
2021-05-17 20:25:49,stocks,Wash sale losses are not able to be deducted. Thats all.
2021-05-17 21:23:11,stocks,Your family member might be thinking of wash sales or pattern day trading.
2021-05-17 23:15:48,stocks,Your family member is confused about wash sales
2021-05-17 20:29:15,stocks,"There are pattern day trading rules and good faith violations that are supposed to be restricted to something like 2 days ish iirc one or both of those with some conditions that maybe relate to an account being a cash or a margin account. 

If you don’t get a quality answer here or want confirmation I’d suggest calling your broker, they should be able to tell you"
2021-05-17 20:25:14,stocks,Typically only 3 day trades within a 5 day period.   Correct if you have over 25k you can trade tye same stock all day everyday.
2021-05-17 21:02:51,stocks,"No their isn't you are right, they are wrong. As long as you follow your day trade limit you are good... brokers restrict users with under 25k to 3 day trades per 5 business days. Stock buys/sales only effect TAXES in a negative manner on these types of trades.. you will pay higher taxes on short term profit from trades, and they will be ineligible for losses assistance on taxes. So if a trader bought/sold the same stock 3 times in a week for example and lost 500 bucks and tried to use this as a tax writeoff of some kind it wouldn't work... the IRS would label it a short term wash sale and say screw off thats your loss :) hope that helps."
2021-05-17 21:41:46,stocks,"You can trade it as many time as you want. You just wont be able to deduct any of your loses. So if you make 10k, but lose 30k you have to pay taxes on the 10k gain and you can’t deduct the 30k loss. If you don’t lose any/much money doing it, it’s fine. But if you lose your shirt you’re fucked. If things go badly enough you could end up owing more in taxes than you actually made."
2021-05-17 20:29:55,stocks,If you're not under PDT you can trade all you want. I traded one 6 times today. The last trade was a loss so it's on the shit list for 31 days.
2021-05-17 20:46:29,stocks,You can in an IRA.
2021-05-17 21:01:08,stocks,"physically, yes, theoretically, no."
2021-05-17 23:04:20,stocks,"Don’t do it. Wash Sale will create a tax nightmare. There was a recent article about someone who made something like $10k in trading profits, but they owed like $700k in taxes due to wash sale."

2021-05-17 23:08:38,stocks,I mean.. you can rinse and repeat all you want. It will just be a series of wash sales that cannot be used to realize losses
2021-05-17 23:52:44,stocks,Wash sale make things complicated.
2021-05-17 21:06:35,stocks,Best reply
2021-05-18 00:17:16,stocks,"They must be referring to wash sales, the tax implication."
2021-05-17 20:41:53,stocks,So wash sale complicates it if you try to claim losses? Thx for the info
2021-05-17 20:26:04,stocks,Only if you try to claim losses. Typically you file only capital gains. Wash sales are considered so if you try to claim losses
2021-05-17 20:53:53,stocks,So once you sell a stock for a loss you can’t rebuy it until 31 days later? Thx for info
2021-05-17 23:01:27,stocks,I don’t why you got downvotes. Gave me a small laugh.
2021-05-17 23:55:04,stocks,"Source, please. It is impossible to grasp that loss/ gain ratio."
2021-05-17 23:21:02,stocks,Woah that's nuts and doesn't make sense to my nube brain.
2021-05-18 01:12:01,stocks,"Wash sale rules will only affect you if you are losing money on your sales because you cannot write off the losses. In your scenario the trader would have had to lose $700,000 selling stock and made $710,000 profiting from the sales of the same stock,

I find it hard to believe that any trader tossing around 1.5 million on a single stock could be such a horrible trader that he would lose half of it, and would then proceed to go buy the same stock AGAIN which triggered the wash rule.

But never say never, I’m sure there is one out there."
2021-05-17 23:07:33,stocks,Understand this or don't trade at all.
2021-05-17 21:22:40,stocks,10/10 family dumb
2021-05-17 21:07:34,stocks,"No, you can. The costs basis is adjusted as if you didn't sell."
2021-05-17 22:44:45,stocks,"Right. You can buy it but you can't deduct the loss. Stupid rule but it is what it is. The really screwy part is buying it 30 days before the loss also counts. So if traded for a gain any time 30 days before or after the loss you can't deduct the loss. If the gain was smaller than the loss you can deduct the difference. My shit list is a spreadsheet that will calculate the new cost basis if I think it's worth trading again. Like if I had a $20 loss but think I can make $100 on a trade, then it's worth it. Just an example. Also calculates the date when it's no longer an issue."
2021-05-18 11:32:24,stocks,"wash sale also applies to transactions 30 days forward and not just later, i.e. the last buy before the attempt to sell at a loss."

I would guess Burry’s short position already gave him a nice profit. Long term prospects of the company are still solid though, customers buy up their cars at their production volume and they are expanding as fast as they can. They’re doing important work around dropping battery price and have their own supply of lithium bought. They have a significant advantage still over new competitors. Competitors worth watching are Ford and VW. There’s significant long term risk from China though and ol musky’s public behavior/tweets."

2021-05-18 05:08:12,stocks,"Aa a tesla superbull, Elon Musk has never bothered me, until his recent involvement with crypto, its kind of gone past the point of being to being somewhat concerning.

Everyone is now suspicious of Elon's motives now. Is he trolling or serious about dogecoin. Was he ignorant about bitcoin's energy consumption or is playing the long con and going to introduce Tesla solar mining rigs? Is the SEC going to go after Elon again?

I gotta be honest, headlines like ""Tesla made more money from flipping than selling cars"" don't really add to investor confidence.

Elon is a brilliant engineer and yes he is one of he cofounders of Paypal. But I seriously question his knowledge on cryptocurrency.

For years, Elon was not a believer in crypto, and only changed his tune during the recent crypto bull-run.

Michael can keep ringing the alarm of the regulatory credits Tesla gets. But under a Biden admnistration,and an EV infrastructure bill under way, the government is not going to stop this practice anytime soon,and by the time they do Tesla will already be well positioned as an EV leader in a recovered economy to where they won't need them.

I used to think one of the greatest assets behind Tesla was Elon's Work ethic, but lately I'm thinking the biggest risk to Tesla now us Elon Musk himself and his antics."

2021-05-18 08:32:46,stocks,"I would short it if I could afford the interest payments for a substantial amount of time too. Who knows when the bubble is going to burst? It could go on long enough to bankrupt me.

Can anyone actually make a bullish case for Tesla at this point? Their assets are 56 billion and their market cap is 555 billion. Their revenue is 52b. They have under 2% of the vehicle market. Compare this to GM who's got over 200 billion in assets, generates 120b+ in revenue, and their market cap is a mere 86b. It's just fucking nonsense.

So what you're saying at this point if you buy Tesla instead of GM is: ""I am more confident Muskdaddy can harvest $10 of value from $1 than GM can harvest $0.43 of value from $1.""

I think Elon Musk is pretty good and GM is not great, but I don't think he's 20x better. That's a HUGE target for GM to hit. Keep in mind, when we're talking about management of very large companies it's a pretty narrow band of difference in management capabilities. Shareholders and boards will pay top dollar for management that can harvest 1.1x or 1.2x more value from a dollar than their competitors. We're talking about the Alan Mulally's of the world. CEO's credited with turning around 2 or 3 companies.

The greatest businessmen of all time such as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, Vanderbilt... these guys harvested between 2 and 3 times more value from a dollar than their contemporaries. And that made them the richest, most powerful men in the world capable of making and unmaking *entire nations* in their era. Rockefeller got a billion dollars in *1916*! Using inflation he was 2 Jeff Bezos's in his time. Just stupid wealthy.

You are saying Elon Musk is 10x as good as Rockefeller, Ford, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt. How? How can you justify that? Blows my mind."

2021-05-17 20:46:13,stocks,I hope he enjoys losing money
2021-05-18 06:46:43,stocks,I don’t know how to short it but if I could short anything it would be DOGE.
2021-05-18 07:11:17,stocks,He made the put when tesla was at 900. Its just being revealed now because of the quarterly statements.
2021-05-17 21:57:30,stocks,Theoretically he could be shorting 10-15% drop.  You can still make a ton of money that way.
2021-05-18 00:24:17,stocks,Oh no I better sell my shares!
2021-05-18 01:14:43,stocks,Que the exits.
2021-05-18 02:09:16,stocks,He’s usually about a year early. I’ll make a note to buy puts in Q1 2022
2021-05-18 03:27:43,stocks,[removed]
2021-05-18 05:33:30,stocks,It’s funny there was a guy on WSB saying he was going to short Tesla when it was still in the 900s literally right before this correction started and everyone called him crazy.  Whoever that was made big money
2021-05-18 08:07:12,stocks,This isn’t new info so the world “reveals” is a bit misleading
2021-05-18 08:07:20,stocks,He could have closed those already...
2021-05-18 08:22:04,stocks,The wealthy getting nervous because one of there rich brothers is turning against them lol
2021-05-18 08:30:06,stocks,What strike prices is he going with?
2021-05-18 08:52:05,stocks,How can you sell regulatory credits? Is it like a Gov bond? Tf always some intanagable monetary value know one has ever heard of that gets exploited. You shouldn't be able to sell or buy fucking EV emission credits. will things ever be properly regulated?
2021-05-18 11:24:46,stocks,"Someone in an FB group made a joke that the strike price is $300. Can't tell if that's better or worse than $800 GME calls lol.

Either way, this dude might be in for WSB reckoning. I have little doubt Tesla will get a rally. And the worst part is, this jackass is probably banking on that happening."
2021-05-18 11:25:41,stocks,"“He already took his profits” did you watch the big short?? He knows it’s fundamentally overvalued and probably thinks it’s worth way less, I’m willing to bet he’s still holding most of the contracts he bought. He held on his housing market bet even when it took a fat dip before the real dip."
2021-05-18 11:28:40,stocks,No other company gets the press of Tesla. Much of it negative.
2021-05-18 12:00:06,stocks,I remember when I made the biggest mistake in my life too.
2021-05-18 12:03:41,stocks,"Dude this info has been available for a long time. I mean, a REALLY long time."
2021-05-18 12:38:09,stocks,Does anyone know how one can view these filings?
2021-05-18 12:52:27,stocks,pretend I am stupid and teach me how to do what burry is doing
2021-05-18 15:33:01,stocks,If you remember Tesla before it went meteroric it was constantly being shorted. Going back and forth between 100-250.
2021-05-18 16:10:37,stocks,Smart man. It’s overpriced as hell. Buddy is going to cash even more
2021-05-18 17:16:29,stocks,534 million😂😂😂😂 more like 35 million. Does the media really not understand how leveraged puts work?
2021-05-18 18:04:04,stocks,"At the end of the movie it said Burry is now investing in water. I wonder what water positions he picked up. I'm long on PHO, so very curious."
2021-05-18 18:05:15,stocks,These articles make me laugh. Remember Cathie Wood's saying $TSLA 3000????
2021-05-18 09:29:25,stocks,Time to short this Tesla. Really overvalued bubble.
2021-05-18 03:45:47,stocks,He bets that Elon Musk will resign soon - this alone will tank Tesla to $200 ... considering also to bet against Tesla
2021-05-18 07:35:35,stocks,"There is very good justification to short Tesla. I would never do it, but it's a sound investment decision.

Tesla's P/E of 122, when the rest of the industry is around 16, at a time that the rest of the industry is also switching to electric cars indicates that the landscape is going to become much more competitive."
2021-05-18 05:00:13,stocks,Good bet Tesla is overvalued
2021-05-18 06:46:08,stocks,Burry gonna Burry Tesla 🤣
2021-05-18 06:41:53,stocks,"I love him, and he does his homework, so dont ignore him lightly"

2021-05-18 08:49:52,stocks,"He’s going to make good money , it’s been falling"
2021-05-18 09:48:46,stocks,Can somebody explain this to me like i m 5yrs old ? Just starting to understand the stock market. Why is this news so important
2021-05-18 10:00:27,stocks,"not only is this a bad time to take a bear position on tesla considering the price, but it’s also been pretty volatile, don’t know why he decided to buy puts now"
2021-05-18 10:25:54,stocks,"I’m new so I don’t understand, I have some extra $$$ Should I sell my Tesla shares it’s only 5 or buy more with my $1500?"
2021-05-18 10:36:29,stocks,Sell Tesla but BTC
2021-05-18 11:18:35,stocks,"He previously mentioned back in Feb that he was taking a short position in TSLA back when it was around $850, so I imagine since then, he's ITM"
2021-05-18 11:36:39,stocks,Ah yes of course this sub gets a boner as soon as any negative news on Tesla comes out
2021-05-18 02:34:47,stocks,"Hijacking your comment for visibility:

HE DOES NOT OWN 530 MILLION IN PUTS. 

13F reports *notional* value, meaning his puts cover *530 million worth of shares*. 800,100*667.93.

He owns 8001 contracts. We don’t know strike, expiry, or value of the position, but we do know he bought them by March 31st. If you poke through the OI on the options chain, you can narrow down where his position sits (OI>8001) if he went same strike/expiry. Position was likely a couple dozen million IMO. They are profitable now, if he held. 

This has been incredibly poorly represented in the media.

Edit: typo, some added info"
2021-05-18 04:51:52,stocks,"Yeah, this is not how puts work. The media coverage on this has been so terrible. It's not a $530 million bet at all. It could be a $50k bet for all we know, depending on the strike price. Maybe I should start a $500M bet against a random company with my $80k in net worth and hit the news."
2021-05-17 22:38:53,stocks,Three fiddy
2021-05-18 05:53:32,stocks,"Analyzed order flow and big orders / sweeps that came in, guess is June 2022 350 and Jan 2023 350 ."
2021-05-18 06:44:00,stocks,someone suggested likely Jan 22 @ 350. but cant recall their  logic of why.
2021-05-18 06:56:43,stocks,"I was watching those as I was looking for an entry point since the start of the year.  I didn't find one because they were fucking expensive.  It's impossible to say with certainty because we don't know much, but given the volume even on Tesla, I'd imagine he has spreads around the price when he bought the puts.  And from what I remember (my memory is really shitty) that would put this at around an 8 figure bet.  I'd also guess that he's unwound a significant portion."
2021-05-18 03:43:29,stocks,Yes and it a little miss leading headline the value of the shares is 534m. Not the value of the puts since the fund isn’t worth more than 150m.
2021-05-18 08:47:10,stocks,#BUY BACK IN AT $350
2021-05-17 20:30:52,stocks,"I believe he's been short since Q1 2021, possibly even before that"
2021-05-18 08:15:53,stocks,"Yes, battle of the autist’s started almost 4 months ago. It’s only getting attention again because Burry’s position seems to be turning profitable. IMO Burry will be correct in the short term but Tesla is almost certainly here to stay... especially with this new legal loophole they’ve found in cryptocurrency price manipulation. I’m going to buy the dip."
2021-05-18 02:12:14,stocks,He just had to announce it due to those american laws etc
2021-05-18 05:29:04,stocks,The Big Short 2: Burry goes Burrrrrrr
2021-05-18 07:38:49,stocks,1-2 million would be an average option price of $1.20-$2.40 per share. Those options would be insanely OTM or very soon expiry. Id guess he spent more like 50-150 per option.
2021-05-18 09:57:05,stocks,pretty sure this was just from a CNBC article
2021-05-18 01:18:58,stocks,Just goes to show that crypto is filled with emotional retail investors. I hope they don't devalue legitimate crypto projects though.
2021-05-18 01:04:10,stocks,Incredible
2021-05-18 06:57:58,stocks,"yeah ... i mean if you just glance at it... you can make that assumption.


but realistically the revenue he got from BTC was basically nothing compared to the rest of the operation"
2021-05-18 10:39:49,stocks,Yep.
2021-05-18 04:25:15,stocks,When do you predict he will sell Tesla's bitcoins?
2021-05-18 08:21:32,stocks,Who honestly gives a fuck about crypto clowns lol. Tesla has a much bigger market to sell cars to than a bunch of bag holders who were warned dozens of times that bitcoins price was obvious mania
2021-05-18 04:16:40,stocks,Burry says no u
2021-05-18 08:06:07,stocks,This quote does not apply at all for a person like him
2021-05-18 09:53:48,stocks,Cringe
2021-05-18 18:22:49,stocks,In his case he can stay solvent
2021-05-17 21:23:15,stocks,"so far it seems to be that way.

And with Elon's crusade against bitcoin, it seems he lose some followers. Yeah, i knew he is still influential even admist this controversial, but i suspect any Teslabro already max their TSLA purchase anyway. The incremental buying to carry the price up will be quite difficult this time."
2021-05-17 21:55:50,stocks,"Hah! If you followed Michael Burry on Twitter you’d know that he is one of the most consistently and predictably wrong investors you can find.  I followed him after watching the big short expecting some luminary insights...but boy was that a mistake.  He’s sorta a jackass.  Like when he regularly asks the government to regulate water resources tighter so he can make money and put local farmers out of business.  Wow such a wonderful person!

Everyone goes back to “the big short Michael Burry he’s the best!!!!” To justify that whatever move he makes is some new revolutionary thing that’s going to predict GFC 2.0, when really this same fucking headline has played as nauseum for the last 13 years.  I’ve become convinced that his call on the big short was more luck than insight."
2021-05-18 01:17:10,stocks,Yes but not ironically
2021-05-18 06:24:36,stocks,Musk is a fraud.
2021-05-18 09:55:49,stocks,"I'm sure it is nowhere near $500M, but the premiums have been and remain very juicy. He is paying GOOD money to maintain his position."
2021-05-17 21:59:42,stocks,"This dudes been short since January, I wouldn’t short it now so far off the high."
2021-05-17 20:45:15,stocks,"I thought about this when TSLA was closer to $1000, but I didn't like the premium it took to short them.  But I think it's a good bet to short them."
2021-05-18 00:21:37,stocks,"As a man of culture, I would have done 8008 myself.

Perhaps he will pour 1 out for the boys who couldn’t make it."
2021-05-18 05:15:10,stocks,"If i was the head of a HF, i would had short 6969 contracts, just for the laughs"

2021-05-18 03:54:03,stocks,"800,100"
2021-05-18 00:38:33,stocks,I mean like he definitely is up big time. He has been short since Q1 2021 and TSLA has been declining since than. So yeah he is definitely making money.
2021-05-17 21:41:20,stocks,"He'll either gain 40% by next month, or lose 40%, knowing how Tesla moves. I feel like people will buy Tesla just to spite the guy, wallstreetbets might jump on the band wagon. Should be fun to watch this play out though"
2021-05-17 21:59:10,stocks,He might pull it off again possibly via a Bitcoin miracle??
2021-05-18 10:00:45,stocks,already made plenty.
2021-05-18 02:37:52,stocks,Well its already over 30% off the highs so I guess he os already right

2021-05-18 10:42:07,stocks,"Well for one he is all those people combined. Reinventing multiple industries from the ground up. I know you’re bot going to accept this, don’t care, but that’s an element. Bet against Tesla and you can make money on short term volatility, long is a different story."
2021-05-18 09:11:55,stocks,"I mean, he called the last one..."
2021-05-17 20:51:15,stocks,"He also went long The stop of Games at $4. I don’t know why anyone wouldn’t take his moves seriously, especially with almost 40% of his assets under management."

2021-05-18 10:35:08,stocks,"My understanding is that Tesla make their money by selling carbon credits.  That's their big profit maker.  This guy was one of, if not the first, to predict the housing crash of 2008.  That's a god tier move.  So he is predicting telsa to drop in price.  They didn't say how low he predicted.  But if he thinks it will drop, he's probably right."

The best advice is buy low sell high. Right now Tesla is “low” but that’s just an opinion. Many think it’s high."
2021-05-18 11:52:08,stocks,"I give credit to Musk for making electric cars viable en masse, but other than that, any other company with his earnings reports (and how those earnings actually happen) would be slaughtered in the market.

2021-05-18 07:00:25,stocks,"> if he went same strike/expiry

No way.  He would have gotten killed even high volume like Tesla, he had to spread that.  Put premiums were through the roof this past quarter even without a mammoth order coming in from Burry"
2021-05-18 09:15:46,stocks,"The article doesn't make sense.

It says he bought *against* shares... Meaning he owns tesla shares.


He's long tesla but bought outs as a hedge and the media goes away with the opposite story."

2021-05-18 11:02:17,stocks,Well said.

2021-05-18 11:50:49,stocks,Even better start talking about how it’s a bubble at $570 a share and then everyone will praise you when it gets back there 6 months later because they hate Tesla so much.

I strongly believe it will not take long before it returns to high 700s and also between eoy and the next year I know it ll reach 1000"

2021-05-17 22:29:46,stocks,"Burry must have hurt you deep bro.

Anyone who’s been following his moves (including the big short ) knows he’s often right on his theories but is off by timing. Nevertheless, he’s hit on some of the defining trades of the last decades or so, from subprime to GameStop. 

There’s nothing personal about this move, he’s essentially betting against the Fed. With each passing week it’s becoming obvious we’re are headed for a steep inflationary period and the Fed has dug itself quite a hole that it can’t easily get out without burying itself. Tesla is the quintessential stock of the free money low rates era and the curtains of the mega multiples era is fast closing if you’ve been paying attention. Hence the bet."
2021-05-18 17:55:22,stocks,"Go read the Big Short, the book by Michael Lewis. Movie tells only part of the story. Nobody bats a thousand but Burry deserves serious attention. Do not make a habit of betting against him. He's been correct on several major moves. 


Burry called the dot com bubble (along w/Buffett, Grantham, Sir John Templeton, Dodge & Cox, etc ... all basically value investors, as is Burry)

Burry was so good he got seed money from Joel Greenblatt of Gotham capital (fictionalized in the  movie, the white haired guy ""give me my fukc!ng money"". There was an IRL dispute about Burry shorting the housing bonds)

Burry called the housing bubble

After the book was published: 

Burry stated index funds and ETFs were distorting markets. Some critics painted him as a crank for this claim, but it's been validated in part by researchers from the Fed (among others) https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3244467


Burry started shorting Tesla late 2020, early 2021 Tesla stock dropped almost 40% in a month and has flatlined since then.

he's been warning about inflation for months and he we are...."
2021-05-18 09:59:46,stocks,Yeah probably 10s of millions. An order of magnitude less than what this dumb click bait headline is reporting. Someone at CNBC also has a short position I bet lol. It’s just like one of those things that I shake my head at. I would never get my financial advice from someone who gets something so basic so wrong. Imagine if you’re reading something from your doctor and they say some zoidberg type shit like this lol

2021-05-18 05:26:56,stocks,"He could have bought anytime between Jan 01 to Mar 31. 667.93 was TSLA's closing price on Mar 31. Burry probably bought sometime before, at some other price."
2021-05-18 09:36:38,stocks,"It makes sense if you take it with a grain of salt.

He is long. But on puts. And long puts mean you are against the stock as you win when prices fall.

Didn't read the article so I can take only what you write, but they have several issues:

1: they have to disclose open positions but not when they were bought, meaning the reported number of 8k put contract could have happened anywhere between this and the last report. If reporting happens every 3 months, then this could have easily been on February.

2: the value is either way completely wrong because they assume exercising the contracts on an assumed strike price, so literally an assumption based on an assumption. There is a high chance he won't exercise and instead sell them, like most people do. IF the strike price was right and IF he excercises the contracts, then he would need to pay what they say. Though that would also ignore the premium he already paid.

Small edit: expiry of course also plays a major role for costs but also on what he can do. He could have literally bought them for 1 day right before reporting and if unlucky made a ginormous loss if he wasn't ITM, meaning he wasted the premium. And even if he is ITM it has to exceed the premium. That said I would be surprised if he went for a short term contract."
2021-05-18 13:36:01,stocks,He bought protective puts on his TSLA shares? A high PE company that would be very negatively impacted by rising interest rates and inflation? The same inflation Burry was screaming about in twitter for months? You don't say...
2021-05-18 13:22:09,stocks,"I was going to add this but didn’t want to get too speculative:

In my opinion, he did indeed buy these at the highs of January. He either left or was kicked off Twitter for tweeting about going short Tesla, and at the time some massive put sweeps had popped up on my options trackers.

Coincidentally actually went short Tesla at the time as well, following that whale; Tesla went negative gamma from that sweep alone, which coincidentally very likely caused/exacerbated the selloff. Basically, there was a massive put sweep that completely changed the gamma and thus dynamic hedging around Tesla, making it very likely to sell off, which made me take the short; would be pretty cool if it was Burry, lol"
2021-05-18 07:03:24,stocks,"Given this info, couldn't something like WSB community (or a rival hedge fund)  just do a short squeeze similar to GameStop. 

If I had such a massive position it's not something I'd be ok with the Public knowing about or am I missing something here?"
2021-05-18 08:55:39,stocks,Only lose $350  I think it's worth at least something lmao
2021-05-17 21:38:03,stocks,"Yes but if you look at the SEC filings from today, they state this is a new position so it would have been added last quarter.

2021-05-17 23:59:04,stocks,"I mean he probably called it a bubble a while ago when every other short was calling it, but he's only now taking a position, which implies he's reasonably convinced that Tesla is close to a correction now. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's right, but he does have a history of making money off bold calls like this."
2021-05-18 04:31:08,stocks,Yeah also on December 1st on Twitter #TeslaSouffle
2021-05-18 06:31:26,stocks,So he's probably lost a shitload of money on this overall?
2021-05-18 10:34:35,stocks,I think he has been short since his original GME position But don’t think he had 60% in at the time
2021-05-18 12:10:13,stocks,Wow the IV on those must have been insanely low. You’d be up like 100x if you got in at when Tesla was at its high
2021-05-18 07:01:01,stocks,How's the humidity in the cesspool?
2021-05-18 10:25:42,stocks,Surely better to have cash melting due to inflation than bitcoin melting due to his own tweets bursting the bubble?
2021-05-18 11:25:38,stocks,"Thank you grand prophet. 

I did my btc dabbling when I mined it 12 years ago as a nerdy kid and sold for like a million percent gain over the course of a decade, but what’s happening now is just idiotic mania. 

Love your crystal ball mentality though especially since both stocks and btc are already in deep correction territory. It’s easy to call out a trend that we’re literally in the middle of lol."
2021-05-18 10:48:40,stocks,"The problem with Tesla is the fact that it has already priced-in about 6 years of growth because of hype. A company like Tesla can't stay at a 600 P/E, and 70 P/FCF if the sole reason holding them at such high valuation is hype around a CEO and a social sentiment for the future. See what happened to railroads stocks in the early 1900s, and the car stocks in the 1950s. 

If you think these metrics are able to be maintained, honestly, tell me how. Even Amazon, a company spending billions year over year in R&D, was considered by many (at 100-200 PE) to be overvalued as fuck even after proving they were a cash-cow with AWS, Amazon website, etc. They are even 2x as profitable as Tesla!

 I'm far from thinking that Telsa is dying. But thinking it will become a SUSTAINABLE trillion dollar+ company while:

1. Having a 3% profitability

2. Crazy priced-in valuations (because of hype and 'a sentiment for the future

3. The need to issue 5% more share PER YEAR to sustain operations AND ALSO regulatory credits (money given by the government for developping non-polluting technology 

4. Having an almost bigger market cap than the 12 largests automakers in the world that sell over 90% of the cars 

5. Not really having a monopoly in the EV sector

Tesla is not only an automaker, but without this source of revenue, the company WILL not be able to sustain its growth. So the people saying 'your point is not relevant, Tesla doesn't only make cars' are wrong.

I'm not anti-Tesla, I'm just against betting for the future when it has been proved and demonstrated than jumping on the trend, after it has already exploded, will net you lower returns over the years. You bet money last year? Nice. Betting this year? Meh, it is a bubble only waiting to explode. In the short term, I guess it could rise. 1-2 years maybe? But give it 10-20 years and I guarantee you Tesla will not be where you're expecting it to be. 

Only a 8% compound annual growth rate would put the company at a 2.8T valuation. How would they achieve that? Hell, I think they never will. But whatever, I'm a gay-bear."
2021-05-18 09:30:53,stocks,Good luck. It's so overvalued it isn't funny
2021-05-18 04:34:20,stocks,"many rh users used to think stonks only go up, now that reality has set in and they realize stonks doesn't always go up. Won't it be much difficult to lure them back?

My original thinking is that crypto will burst first and that will led many crypto-bro to take their profit and move it back to growth stock, including Tesla. But what Elon's did yesterday leave a sour taste to many people in r/bitcoin"
2021-05-18 04:30:22,stocks,i would like to believe making any prediction on Elon's whim is a fool's attempt.

2021-05-17 23:47:34,stocks,I don't disagree with you but Burry actually sold his position in GameStop before the squeeze. [source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-sold-gamestop-stock-q4-missed-rally-2021-2-1030088508)
2021-05-18 00:15:53,stocks,Timing is kinda super important?
2021-05-18 01:44:15,stocks,Then he can't win. Fed is invincible until dollar itself crashes. But Burry didn't bet against dollar. Instead he is betting against a stock which can easily be elevated if fed prints more money. And fed will absolutely print out more money.
2021-05-17 23:14:19,stocks,Remind me when tesla doubles. Lol this guy is a joke
2021-05-18 00:14:07,stocks,"Yeah his fund isn’t even that big, it’s like $100M. This headline grossly exaggerated the amount of capital invested / at risk in this put purchase.

Edit: lol wow, downvoted for facts? Depending on what he paid per option this bet could be risking in the low millions. The $534 million is based on the underlying Tesla share value at the time of the filing not his actual options “bet”."
2021-05-18 11:27:13,stocks,"There is no maintaining position - put contracts come with expiry; they aren't perpetual like shorts. He has the right to sell at strike price, not an obligation. And the most he loses is the premium he paid, nothing more! That is unknown, but not even 10s of millions. Your first message is right; this is as click-baity as it can get."
2021-05-18 09:45:21,stocks,"the value of your option would be $100 PER SHARE (not including premium if there's time left before exp on the option) but an option contract is for 100 shares. So it'd be a profit of $10,000 (100 * 100)"
2021-05-18 14:40:01,stocks,"It’s down nearly 40%, yes from a very high evaluation, but it’s off the high a fair bit. I agree I don’t think it deserves the current evaluation - but this is just one of those stocks I wouldn’t bet against. Remember the market can stay irrational longer than you can remain solvent."

2021-05-18 06:30:55,stocks,"Then he made money on the downtick, and kept it."
2021-05-18 11:02:43,stocks,Oh so you’re talking about companies that are going to be losing money trying to sell ICE vehicles while taking a loss trying to keep up with Tesla’s.
2021-05-17 23:13:50,stocks,"If you look at his track record he’s very successful. He finds great plays. His analysis is spot on. I mean the market is irrational right now, I thought that was an accepted truth. Let’s take Tesla, look at their earnings and look at their market cap. 581 P/E ratio. Space travel/mining is a loooong way off. But again, the market is irrational ;-) so we agree in the end."
2021-05-18 03:36:44,stocks,I’d say it’s less attention seeking behavior and more to inform the public. That’s been his MO consistently.
2021-05-18 13:39:34,stocks,"Sure. I bought a few more TSLA at last dip $555 a few mos ago, I was happy. Seems to be headed up again. 

Fear and emotion should play a minimal role in your investment strategy. Have a plan and stick to it until there is a new plan. Don’t panic sell or buy."
2021-05-18 09:12:53,stocks,"Also likely at various strike prices too. We don’t know anything about his position other than size, everyone here is just guessing."

2021-05-18 08:28:37,stocks,Lol imagine the WSB community having enough money to squeeze TSLA… most in that community now could only buy 1 share if at all.
2021-05-18 10:59:15,stocks,Yes let us just yEEt the stock price of a company with a 500B+ market cap. You ape.
2021-05-18 07:43:35,stocks,WSB does not have to. The short sellers are the main reason why TEsla stock went so high.
2021-05-18 07:37:01,stocks,My theory is he holds a huge short position that he does t have to report. It’s maybe costing a lot to hold onto so he buys these puts and the news reports on it as he has to report puts. This along with his “household” name helps drive down the price.
2021-05-18 12:21:36,stocks,jfc
2021-05-18 09:21:33,stocks,I'll buy back in at 350.  I personally believe Tesla to be worth \~400

2021-05-18 01:19:13,stocks,I think he might have shorted it in q4 and lost some money so he went puts instead. Cause looks like he lost 100 million in q4. He was early for the housing bubble too. But overall he's way up rn
2021-05-18 09:26:47,stocks,"If this were revealed in a 13-F filing, which it seems like it is, he can file up to 3 months after he made the trade."

2021-05-18 13:03:46,stocks,"When I did my monthly eval to determine if I made the right choice, it wasn't anywhere near 100x. Lol. IIRC, it was under 60%. So, if your math is right, it's likely I'm misremembering the numbers (that's also likely even if your math is terrible, but it seems right. Idk?). Anyway, it did beat out my SHOP puts, but not my MU puts. SHOP's IV is always crazy. MU wasn't at all. Those were dirt cheap for some reason."

2021-05-18 10:09:45,stocks,"Ok, it was ambiguous, and you're joking, but I meant under what circumstances do you predict he will sell. The point of my question was more to get at this idea that he is really on some ""crusade against bitcoin"", without even selling any."
2021-05-18 02:22:47,stocks,I think they still made 2x their money
2021-05-18 02:21:12,stocks,because it was a value play for him and he made money from his thesis
2021-05-18 00:14:30,stocks,I think he did it so that they don't blame it on him.
2021-05-18 02:09:40,stocks,That article speaks as though the squeeze has already happened. Poor research done by the author
2021-05-18 04:49:49,stocks,"Always, but DD isn't DD just because of timing. It's because of basic market factors, research, & theories/conclusions."
2021-05-18 11:31:13,stocks,Yes good point. I didn’t catch that language in the person i was replying to. I think the premium on 8001 contracts could be more than 10milliin depending on strike and DTE? Idk honestly I won’t be wasting my energy quantifying just how wrong this headline is when it’s so qualitatively obvious nonsense.
2021-05-18 09:58:03,stocks,"But I pay 1,000 or whatever the price for that? Is that the premium?

They're also taking EV sales away from Tesla, which has build-quality and production reliability issues."
2021-05-17 23:33:33,stocks,"Oh no, like I said, I agree. I thought Tesla was overvalued at 60. It's a luxury car company that makes really cool cars. If it ever generates the same level of profits as Cadillac or Mazeratti, it will be a tremendous achievement on Musk's part and probably worth 1/10th of what it is today. 

But like I said, it's the OG Gamestop. You have tons of people out there that think Musk is going to put a Doge Coin on Mars or whatever. The CEO literally tweeted ""I think Tesla might be a little overvalued"" and it still went up. So I just think this is a random time to short it. It could tank this year or Musk will figure out a way to string people along again like he always does"
2021-05-17 23:17:14,stocks,Space travel is definitely not far off. Have you been watching?

2021-05-18 10:15:13,stocks,Even at 400$ it would still be valued more than Toyota and Volkswagen combined. I understand that there is most likely a lot of fantasy and hope of development included but still... with the figures in China it does not look that sure to me.
2021-05-18 09:26:00,stocks,Even $400 is a nice target to start a position imo Good luck

2021-05-18 13:18:52,stocks,"Yeah i was just thinking if you bough a put on tesla when it was 900 for a 750 strike 3 months ago, and it expired today, your profit is over $100 per share. 

Tbh my math is probably terrible, but I cant imagine IV on tesla has changed that much. A put with 450 strike on tesla (over 20% OTM) with 3 months till expiration is like 20 bucks right now."
2021-05-18 16:02:46,stocks,I’m sure you would think someone being pragmatic is miserable because you trade and talk with such high emotion that you see neutrality as a negative.

And colonizing Mars? I don't exactly feel like going through every single reason as to how that's impossible because there's so many. Let's just say if the Earth lost 90% of it's water and the surface was irradiated, it would still be a paradise compared to Mars."

2021-05-18 14:59:12,stocks,"List of impossibilities (A short one with ones that pop in my head): 

\- It takes 7 months to get to Mars. 

\- The ground on Mars is tougher then concrete because of a thin atmosphere that did little to stop the sun from beaming down on it for billions of years.

\- The ground is also irradiated because of the because of the previous reason. 

\- It's covered in toxic dust, which gets kicked around in hurricane level dust storms frequently. 

\- Once every decade or so the mother of all dust storms happens that covers the entire planet in hurricane force winds and clouds of this toxic dust. 

So to colonize Mars, we would need to send hundreds of construction workers with enough drilling equipment to lay a foundation in it's concrete ground and 7 months of food, water, AND AIR of all things for them while they build magical vacuum sealed buildings impervious to the Martian dust storms, radiation, and poisonous atmosphere. Plus fuel, electric generators capable of operating giant pieces of machinery, and you would have to think of every conceivable thing they might need because if some unknown problem comes up, it's going to be 7 months before you can get them the tools they need to fix it. 

Oh, and after the vacuum sealed buildings are created, now you need to ship the colonists oxygen and water periodically forever. 

I mean seriously, again it's not even worth considering. It's as hypothetical as the warp drive. Until someone stumbles across rocket fuel that's both cheap, and that can propel the rocket fast enough to cut a 7 month journey to Mars down to about 2 or 3 days, it's a delusional fantasy. Any danger to Earth that we can conceive of, a super volcano, an asteroid, anything, still will leave earth more habitable than Mars.

I would pay any amount of money for it too. 

But for the most part they are going to be limited to little day trips into the atmosphere at 400,000 a ticket unless they can figure out how to make the amenities more comfortable. And at that point, who are their customers? How many people will shell out enough money for a house just to fly over earth for a few hours? My ball park estimate is like, a few hundred. 

So, the toilet thing might be oddly specific, but it just goes to show how rudimentary we are in space travel. If we compared it to boats, we are basically cavemen still using canoes and rafts that can float down a river or to another part of a big lake, talking about traveling across the Atlantic ocean."

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp

They're similar to shorting in that they're both ways in which you profit from the price going down, however the underlying mechanism that produces that result is different. Puts are an options contract, not the same as shorting, and are not the vehicle that could produce a ""short squeeze"". However the value of puts could be affected by a short squeeze caused by others.

The value of a put contract *theoretically* loses value the closer it is to expiry, and past expiry it is worthless if not excercised, so  you can't ""just wait"" like you could with regular stocks.

So, it's still a ways off to know exactly (a) how many shares of NewCo you will receive per share of T, (b) what exactly T will cut their dividend to, (c) whether NewCo will pay a dividend, and if so, how much per share.

Whether you sell is completely up to you. I've got 200 shares of T, and I'm still sorting through what I want to do.

I'm holding a small position in **NVIDIA** (making self-driving car CPU), **QCOM** stock (making 5G chip), and one other Chinese stock (**HD map and geospatial data provider**).

I personally think TSLA is overpriced. Tesla's self-current driving is only **L2 enhanced** (not even L3). Other carmakers are catching up, some even surpassed Tesla's self-driving technology. With that being said, I still think **Tesla will be one of the formidable players in the future due to its great innovation and Elon's leadership.**

Constructive feedback is welcome

**Edit #1:**

After a good conversation with our members in this group, I have come up with the over ideas and want to sum them up so it's easy for everyone to follow.

A. There are currently two main approaches to self-learning car. Pure vision and (HD Map + Lidar).

**1. Pure vision:** This is how Tesla approaches self-driving technologies. They collect a lot of data and crunch them into a machine learning model. The more data the better becomes. This costs a lot of money and time to perfect the art. **This is analogous to the test bank crammer method.** A student purchases a lot of old tests from the test bank and studies from them only. The more the tests taken, the more confident the student will be.

**Pro of Pure Vision:**

\- Can dynamically perform better than HD map + lidar on a totally new road condition.

\-Lower CapEx- >Save a lot of money to make the car. Tesla only needs cameras, no need to use Lidar (Lidar and HD Map adds a lot of money).

&#x200B;

**Con of Pure Vision:**

\-  But is it true learning, Tesla has been crunching data for more than a decade, and it's still L2 only.

\-  No communication between cars because each car acting as an individual. What happens if each automaker comes with a different classification? Will that cause an issue of random behavior?

&#x200B;

**2.HD Map and Lidar:** This is how the rest of the world is doing. China's government gives a lot of insight into this field due to the securities issue. There is pre-defined HD map already recorded and built into each car. Each car then uses the Lidar to navigate and re-evaluates the map. The more car participates, the better resolution of the map.

**Pro of HD Map and Lidar:**

\-Perform much better than pure vision on a known road condition. If all the car uses the same HD map and there is a central sensor hub, each car will know exactly the location of the other cars miles ahead. Very precise and much less chance of accident compared to pure vision

\-This is the only way to get to L5 and smart IoT (in my opinion). There must be a way for cars to communicate with smart traffic lights, smart drones. A central spatial data bank can resolve this.

\- Lower OpEx-> The carmaker can partner with a Spatial data provider and go from there. No need to spends years, human lives and tons of money again to collect data from scratch.

&#x200B;

**Con of HD map and Lidar:**

\-Single point of failure:   If the 5G IoT goes wrong, it can cause massive accidents for example.

\-The car can only drive on known roads, it cannot go anywhere like Tesla cars.

&#x200B;

Let's talk about security here and this will give you some insight. The Chinese government has restricted Tesla from collecting data because they think Tesla is spying on them. If Tesla cannot collect data, how can Tesla finds data that fit into the machine learning model and train it? **I think Tesla eventually has to abandon pure vision in China and forced to use HD map in the future due to securities issues.**

Let's talk about the software liability issue. The question is can software determine life and death of a human. I think this question will be relevant to the short-term because there are still human drivers on the road, but once we get to the stage where human drivers are not allowed. The government can resolve this. We need some universal standardsto resolve this issue.

Let's talk about EV cars. **Do you think self-driving cars will be bullish or bearish to car makers? I personally think it's bearish** **and very few car makers will survive**. A self-driving car needs to be extremely reliable. People will purchase way less cars than before because there will be fewer accidents. EV cars are also more durable than ICE cars. The true market to self-driving car technology is spatial data, and big tech companies like Google / Apple / Microsoft/ Amazon /Tesla have a significant edge in this area. **It's just like smartphone markets, there will be a lot of phone makers selling phones but the weak ones will go out of business (LG has abandoned making smartphones for example). The true profits lie in the App Stores/ Ads.**

Any constructive feedback is welcome. Please don't downvote because you love Elon Musk/ invest in Tesla Stock and you see someone talks it down. Every comment needs to be seen and collected.

Until a car can reliable drive around construction zones, traffic wardens, small narrow streets where one has to go into the parking area to let other cars go through or nowy streets it will be not suitable for adoption.

2021-05-18 15:24:05,stocks,"This is an extremely wrong statement. Here is why:

\-most of data collected by Tesla is done by camera. Tesla is no longer freely collecting data in China due to securities concern. With this reason alone, Tesla is losing its crown to other Chinese car makers (has no data to train the model). Eventually, Tesla will be forced to use HD Map soon if it wants to stay in the game.

China is not the only country with security reason. More countries with concern about security will stop Tesla from collecting pure vision data soon.

\-Tesla true competition is not car OEM. Those will become commodities and not profitable. The true bread and butter here is HD map and spatial data. Tesla has some edge in this field, but not so much compared to Google/Apple/Alibaba.

\-Elon does not use Lidar  and boycott HD map, because he makes a big bet on pure vision and he doesn't want to be a loser. I'm not saying which method will be the final winner, but currently Tesla is not in the first position in self-driving and losing its steam quickly. Switching to HD map now means admitting defeated

\-One more thing, HD Map + Lidar is not affected by lighting condition. HD map with central spatial data provider will let smart city become true (L4-L5). Pure vision like Tesla cannot achieve this."

My point is that his pure vision approach is losing ground to the true competitors - the Chinese carmakers. I understand why Elon chose pure vision method - lack of US government insight + guidance and it costs a lot of money to overhaul the entire infrastructure ( install geo fence, smart IoT cost billions of dollars.).

2021-05-17 20:13:22,stocks,"> 1. Software has no capabilities of choosing who will die or live in a near-sighted accident situations. - Legal issue

It's not a matter of ""choosing"" (we're not talking about ""artificial intelligence"").  Employing software, which is inherently flawed, for the task of piloting vehicles, in which a natural person has typically been assigned legal liability, means that software will assume that legal liability and this removal of liability prohibition will translate to **all** software. 

> To encounter point 1,

I'm going to assume that English is a second language.  Software is flawed.  Data is incomplete and inaccurate.  Connectivity is spotty and highly latent at best.  You are chasing a pipe dream.  Mixing software piloted vehicles into a massive population of natural person driven vehicles means that all the algorithmic perfection in the world will not prevent software piloted vehicles from having their occupants killed.  Obvious situations were imperfect software results in humans dying at the ""hands"" of said software will not allow the natural person piloted vehicles to be blamed and will result in software liability becoming standard tort law.

> I think car insurance companies do not contribute to the growth of society.

They contribute **HEAVILY** to the capital markets and are an inherent part of growth and societal progress.

It will be all but impossible to tell if software reduces crashes and death rates because you're mixing it with a population of natural persons driving cars.  Yes, the industry will do everything in its power to spin those outcomes so that the average uninformed person will assume that the human drivers are the ones causing the accidents, but there will be a natural frequency of accidents that can't be explained away by interactions with other human drivers on the road.  That is when lawyers and insurance companies will demand that liability be assumed by the software and the companies that produce said software.  It's already happening.

The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of Merrill Lynch, along with a liquidity crisis of American International Group, all primarily due to exposure to packaged subprime loans and credit default swaps issued to insure these loans and their issuers rapidly devolved into a global crisis, hence the market crash. 

There is absolutely no similarities between now, and then as far as what I can see. In fact, the fed slashed rates in 2008 following the aftermath, and look where that got the market.

You can try to pin blame on whatever you want in 2007, but ultimately that was a tailspin from a liquidity binge that started with massive monetary easing after 9/11. They tried to reign it in and the banks that were leveraged to the hilt got shaken out. The banks are not as leveraged, but there are massive asset bubbles out there today. Bitcoin is currently worth more than JPM, GS and XOM combined. Come on. Will it pop tomorrow? Probably not, but I've staked my bet on oil because it is a highly price inelastic commodity that takes off when the economy is hot and the money supply explodes like it did in the post 9/11 era.

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 17, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 17, 2021**

The market fell modestly on Monday, as concerns over rising inflation, marked by a higher than expected print in the April Consumer Price Index (CPI), continued. Technology stocks continued their volatility, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going as low as 1.42% down intraday before recovering and closing 0.59% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.26% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed.

Stocks are coming into this week on the heels of an extremely choppy trading period recently, which saw the SPY pulling back 4% before recovering Thursday and Friday of last week after the April CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. Market participants are concerned that high levels of inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. 

While the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents. 

There are several factors, in my opinion, contributing to the rise of inflation. First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. One prominent example you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

2021-05-17 21:25:25,stocks,"In certain context it looks worse then it really is, not saying we don't have inflation cause we do but from what data points are we referencing from? If we take numbers from last year and try to apply them this year its going to look way off.

The biggest thing that caught my mind was the CPI number, not because of the number but because it came in lower then it did in 08 the next highest, we didn't even break 08 and look at the amount of money we put into the system and its because before Covid, there were rumblings about deflation and our money supply was getting tight.

Remember in what Nov/Sept 19 when the Fed had to step into overnight lending markets? Yeah..its just my opinion.

I don't blame you one bit for wait for a dip you feel conformable getting in on, that's just being smart man.

I'm a Bear long term, IMO waiting to see how the world reacts after this black swan event. Huge Bull the next year and a half two years, don't see anything that's going to stand in the way of this wave of economic stimulus around the world."

Big buyers outside of ARK ETF haven't yet bought into $COIN. $COIN has been volatile and will continue to be so, but there is no denying the amount of market traction and market share it is gobbling up at exponential rates.

Buy $COIN now at a discount and sit on it. Institutional buyers will need to get onboard if they want exposure to crypto, and they will want to buy the biggest market caps on the block."
2021-05-17 21:03:09,stocks,"I am bullish on COIN long term, but very long term. I wouldn't be surprised if it continues to drop lower but now that it's lower than its reference point of 250, I think it might be at fair value for right now. But there are some major risks and uncertainty. Competitors that offer better deals and more coins will likely go public as well and bring competition COIN probably can't handle. I think as crypto market continues to grow, coin will definitely gain apart of that growth, however I really can't see any coin being mass adopted until a few years out, maybe a bit sooner.

Elon is definitely not helping right now. Most people still think all crypto is a scam and worthless, it'll take a while before most people even understand what blockchains are and what they're used for. Every person I know is scared of crypto for all the reasons they should be scared of cash and in favor of crypto.

I used to think COIN was a better investment than I do now but I'm still bullish, come 2025-2030 and after. Wouldn't be surprised f this gets hit hard by insiders dumping and short attacks, followed by crypto uncertainty and bad press because of Elon pumping and dumping his coins. I think it'll take a while and for those reasons, I'm sitting on the sidelines for now."
2021-05-17 21:05:55,stocks,"I am super bullish on COIN! Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Amazon Gains As Morgan Stanley Paints Bullish Scenario With $6,000 Target 'Investing.com – Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares rose in a weak market after Morgan Stanley 's (NYSE:MS) latest bullish target for the stock: $6,000 by 2023.

According to StreetInsider, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak reiterated his overweight rating on Amazon with a target of $4,500, while going on to make a case for the $6,000 per share mark.

The online retailer and cloud services provider currently trades at around 1.2 times 2022 earnings on a PEG basis, an approximately 30% discount to its median tech peer group.

Nowak believes that with Amazon’s scaling profitability and given its discount relative to the peer group, the stock would warrant a $4,500 level at even 1.7 times PEG, according to StreetInsider. But this may not be enough.

Factors like a large addressable market across Amazon’s business lines, including retail, advertising, logistics, healthcare, cloud, autonomous driving and the rising user base of its Prime service all combine to ask for an even higher target for the company’s stock price, the analyst believes, as per StreetInsider.

""These factors could justify a higher PEG, and a PEG of ~2-2.5X would imply a ~$5,000-$6,000 share price within the next 12 months (potentially a double from here),"" Nowak wrote.

2021-05-17 22:06:52,stocks,"A little off topic but I was going through Amazon’s financials yesterday - for trailing 12 months they spent $45B on R&D which is great! None of the other mega caps were even that close (Google had $28B, the rest - eg Apple/FB/MSFT were closer to $20B). Feel like this eventually pays off, especially with Amazon. 

I don’t doubt the $6K target. Worked at AWS, crappy place to work but there is no place I’d rather have my money invested in from a shareholder perspective."

Dominates e-commerce, dominates cloud services, massively growing ad business, runs a highly successful grocery, the top user content streaming service and top 5 TV streaming service, expanding into pharma distribution, all wrapped in a recurring revenue subscription model with an unmatched logistics network (also a service), and hired over half a million people in the middle of a pandemic with 75k more announced to boot.

2021-05-18 11:59:10,stocks,"Isn't it because a lot of their value is derived from earnings a long way in the future and as interest rates rise the discount rate increases, so the present value of future earnings is decreased.

Brad Stone just released his second book on Amazon which is spot on, I’m only 1/3 through. All that said they move incredibly fast for a company their size and make very sound business decisions due to some of their internal mechanism (eg six pagers, customer focus, data, etc). The people at the top of the company, at least AWS, are brilliant. Unimpressed with much of the rest (mid and lower level employees) though Jeff’s model is churn and burn and, to his credit, it works."

2021-05-18 12:47:13,stocks,"You are correct because you need a DCF and you use a safe rate of return which is a T-Bill. With higher rates it means that the safety of return is higher meaning Apple or any company needs to return more to be worth the risk. But in my opinion, that’s needed more with a company one will consider speculation and you have to make insane measures to assume income. With the big tech, you can safely assume and most likely get right what they will revenue. 
It can also be taken into account that higher rates eats into these estimates as smaller companies borrow money to invest in growth, meaning they now borrow at higher rates and that eats into profit which also goes on the estimates. This is something that can be disregarded with big tech considering that they have monstrous cash balances and do not need to depend on borrowing. 

It is due to this that I believe people sold off big tech to just cash in on profits that they got during the bull run. It can also be said that they expect earnings to fall as the economy opens again. I am bullish on these companies and think that’s not the case especially with Apple and Facebook but I am also just a random dumbass on the internet so."

I know that not everyone has a precise method to do DDs and research about a company or a stock, but maybe someone does.I'm  from Europe, i'm pretty new in this world and i'm trying to be as more informed and smart as i can.

So, there are some things you have to do if you want to become a successful investor / trader, one of the most important is certainly to research and understand the company you're investing in and the financial instrument you're about to use.

When it comes to do some DD about a stock, i understand there are multiple things to look at.What are the most important in your opinion ? What instruments do you use and why ?

Heres what i'm doing for now:

I usually start reading about the company, its core business and the news about it, then i try to understand what is the financial / economic condition of the company and then i do some technical analysis on the chart, focusing on the price and the value i think the stock could have, and also using MA, EMA, MACd, RSI indicators.

I use mostly Yahoo Finance and [Investing.com](https://Investing.com) for the economical and financial part, and mostly WeBull for the charts.

Finally i try to find some smart opinions on Reddit and maybe discuss the stock with someone else.

Any suggestion ?

Thanks"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"$BCEI DD -- No Moons or Rockets, Just Classic DD About an Undervalued Energy Company If you are looking for moons and rocketships this is not the due diligence for you. This is the due diligence for those who want to round out their portfolio with an unexciting albeit profitable upstream energy stock that won a huge race for something you likely aren't even aware of: the highly profitable DJ Basin. 

BCEI's current price is 41.90, and its forecasted range is 47.00 to 66.00. [Forecasts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=BCEI), and more [forecasts](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/bcei/analyst-research).

Importantly, they have recently participated in a 1-for-1 with another company and I believe the market simply hasn't internalized their new size.

2021 estimated EBITDA puts them at 3.4x as last Friday's close. This is inexpensive vs the greater U.S. upstream peer group and, importantly, compares to 4.1x standalone BCEI. In other words, if the new company is simply valued in the same ballpark as BCEI alone there's significant upside, and there's nothing about the upcoming merger that should indicate a discount. In fact the opposite is the true, consolidation demands a premium.

A similar conclusion can be reached from a DCF valuation, but given the recent merger I think it's more useful to observe pre-merger 10-year free cash flow is a hair under 1 billion. The target should be 50 regardless of the merger, so depending on how you peg the risks with the merger, well, it's up to you. There is a world where BCEI is like an upstream energy company of this size and trades at 70 with a DCF like all the rest. 

**Who Should Get This Stock?**

If you're looking to get rich fast, the NBA and NHL playoffs are just around the corner and sportsbooks are taking bets 24/7. If you're looking to invest, consult with your financial advisor about BCEI. 

I invested because it is something I can forget about for a few months, and when I come back after the ex-dividend date I accept the five or six percent growth, the three percent dividend, and before I know it I'm up 50% and I want to share some good news about a stock that defines the unsexy, good business practices of upstream energy in Colorado. 

**What's BCEI?**

BCEI is a pure-play rural DJ Basin operator. ""Pure-play"" as in they focus solely on extracting oil and natural gas from Denver's Denver-Julesburg (""DJ"") Basin. The tl;dr is BCEI possesses a lot of rural Colorado acreage plus very low operating costs plus significant free cash flow. Combined, it equals it's still undervalued compared to peers in spite of the run up the last few months. 

They will also be the first net zero upstream Colorado company, using offsets to become carbon neutral. Aside from being just good stewards of the environment, they are able to do this because of the fundamentally sound structure of their company. Compared to peers they have less wellheads that make more money. In the DJ Basin, if your wellheads make a lot of money it's because they produce more oil than natural gas. Natural gas is typically put right into the atmosphere and uncaptured. Because their wellheads are more oil than wasted natural gas, they cost less than their peers and they can afford to invest in these fixed wellheads rather than running from spot to spot letting natural gas get fired off into the air. [Source](https://ibb.co/5krgsGP)

**Upside?**

The reason I love BCEI is because consolidation is the name of the game in the DJ, and they have the best chance to be the big fish that eats all the smaller fish. Whatever company is able to gobble up the other fish the fastest is going to make a lot of money, partially because the DJ Basin is already profitable and partially because increased oil prices are going to push margins up.

The reason BCEI is going to win consolidation is because they developed zero debt during the downturn, and they are already swinging their free cashflow and zero debt around in a huge way. 

They are going to combine with a smaller, more debt-heavy, competitor and the combined company, to be named Civitas, will create the largest upstream player in the DJ Basin. It's going to be a 1-for-1 merger. This follows after the outright purchase of Highpoint several months ago. [Picture of acreage](https://ibb.co/yRNSXnR)

The annual dividend of $1.40 recently announced by BCEI will be increased to $1.60 as soon as the deal closes. Notably, of the significant expected free cash flow for the combined company, the dividend, at the new higher level, only represents an annual outlay of just under $100 mm.

**Downside?**

Downside is that they go sideways, maybe lose their luster, and go back to being severely undervalued rather than their current ""normal"" of simply undervalued. This isn't financial advice, good stocks go tits up all the time. Shit happens.

**Conclusion**

What are they going to do with the rest of the cash? In the past they've played it smart buying high quality companies in their market, like HighPoint Resources, and used these synergies to grow YoY. For example last quarter, with quarterly earnings of $0.88 per share, they beat estimates of $0.73-.76 per share. Their forward looking guidance indicates continued success. Chances are there is a special dividend and/or continued consolidation, which is where the upside comes into play."

Going forward, I think Apple will be fine, and will once again outperform, but beware of recency bias. Everything that hit it out of the park in 2020 is doing poorly right now, because the companies pulled their earnings and goodwill forward so much.

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Help Me Understand CME Futures And Inflation So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why apparently, tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example). 

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.  

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html). 

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html). 

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?"

So i'm asking if you have any ideas on what can be a good index fund or etf that can meet these requirements. It seems as if the only ones i can find that meet my ethical requirements also exclude a lot companies i would like to be invested in."
2021-05-17 21:17:07,stocks,"If it’s profitable, it will probably be in some ETFs.

You might have to just stick to individual companies or look at ETFs that don’t involve retail/manufacturing/distribution since they pretty much deal with the sell of alcohol, weapons, and gambling.

I guess since tech companies provide the infrastructure for hosting gambling sites you might be at a loss on that sector as well.

Unless you want to get some people together and start one through some investment firms willing to do the research, but there is no guarantee they will be competitive."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"MYOV - Back To Back Catalysts Hi all, going to keep this short as there is already some great DD on Myovant Sciences out there on Reddit and some recent articles, plus I’m not a financial advisor. 

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company’s end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment* 

&#x200B;

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe  

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)  

By July 1:  Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application  

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant.  Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner  (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:** 

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

**Positions**: 22.5k shares, 275 calls (mostly leaps)."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Can someone explain what is happening with my High Tide Stock I have 300 shares of HITIF which I bought and hold through TD. Last week the stock code disappeared and displayed as random numbers and letters and TD showed my stock as a total loss but has no data on anything else. It still shows I own 300 shares. 

I know HITI took a big step into getting listed on NASDAQ and went into consolidation. The way it was explained to me is that every 8 shares you own you get 1 in return after consolidation. A friend of mine uses another trading service (fidelity) I think and he said in Sunday his listing displayed as normal. On TD it still shows as a total loss and random numbers/letters for the stock code. 

So do I need to be patient? Did I lose all my shares? What is going on here?

Edit: I called ameritrade and they explained that the reason I haven't seen an update yet is because they wait until their brokers receive some sort of transaction receipt or confirmation. Once that is received my account will display the proper figures. It can apparently take up to 2 weeks for this to occur."
2021-05-18 15:19:17,stocks,Can you explain this more? Does this mean we lose money?
2021-05-18 16:57:48,stocks,Typically it will switch after close.  I'll use a simple math example.  You own 100 shares of stock X.  Current price is 0.50.  When the 10 for 1 reverse happens you would then have 10 shares at a current price of 5.00 each.

2021-05-17 20:21:00,stocks,"Perhaps, I'm not completely sure myself. There may be different rules depending on how you're acquiring the shares. I would ask your boss or a co-worker."
2021-05-18 13:13:27,stocks,"Sounds like youre still learning valuation and perhaps you dont have a lot of time for research. If that is the case, definitely move to ETFs. If you find the time to do your own research and learn, then go back to stock.

The most common recommendation for ETFs are VOO and VTI. 

I personally prefer BKLC to VOO because its zero fees and more concentrated (200 stocks vs about 350 for VOO) thus bigger chunk of the top 200 stocks.

For diversification I would stick to VTI (3500 stocks) but note that this is currently riding a high. So for me, I would do something like $2 BKLC to $1 VTI. Once VTI flattens a bit I might change that allocation.

Again, its all about knowledge. The mistake young people make (myself included 20 years ago) is they do things in reverse. When your knowledge is low, you should start with low risk then move to more risk as you get smarter. Not the other way around. 

The idea that young people should gamble and take more risk is terrible advise and only helps fraudsters and thieves more than anyone else."
2021-05-18 01:55:59,stocks,"ZEV is another EV company that has actual revenue, but a much lower valuation compared with LEV. 

LEV vs ZEV Q1 2021 revenue: $6.2M vs $4.6M  
LEV vs ZEV current valuation: $3B vs $0.5B

Granted, the two aren't exactly comparable, since one is more of a pure EV manufacturer, and the other operates in the Electrification as a Service (EaaS) space, but even if we compare ZEV with its main competitor in the electrification space, XL Fleet, ZEV seems like a grossly undervalued company:

ZEV vs XL Q1 2021 revenue: $4.6M vs $0.7M  
ZEV vs XL current valuation: $530M vs $867M

So I've been collecting unemployment and have been able to save a good amount. A majority of my savings has been able to go into the stock market. I'm thinking about liquidating everything so I can have that extra cushion though.

I've been trying to change my career since this started and might finally have my foot in the door to work IT at Amazon, but I'm unsure when the actual position is opening up. I only have confirmation from the IT manager at my warehouse that they are hiring soon, but he doesn't know when for sure. And, I'm also a little worried that I don't have enough experience as someone else,, although I do have the A+ and am working on the Net+ certifications. Unfortunately, the warehouse i work in doesn't offer full time hours, but I can pick up extra shifts. What do yall think I should do?

2021-05-18 02:01:00,stocks,"Let's simplify the issue to a basic example. This is usually a good way to get the crux of the question.

Let's say I establish a shell company and I contribute 100k in cash to shareholder equity. Nothing else. If I were to sell this shell company, I would always receive 100k for that company, as it has 100k in cash in assets and 100k in shareholder equity (let's not assume transactional costs, value of the name or anything else, let's just look at the balance sheet). Any owner could immediately reduce the equity by 100k and pay himself 100k in cash. Therefore the company is worth 100k. Owning the company is essentially the same as owning 100k in cash.

Now let's say that instead I use the company to buy back 50% of the shares from me for 50k. I will receive 50k in cash, the company receives 50% of its shares. If I were now to sell the company, I would get 50k for it, as the company has 50k in cash in assets and 50k in equity. The fact that the company could sell 50% of its shares means nothing for its valuation. Just as the technical fact, that the company could raise 1M or 1B does not make the shell company worth 1M or 1B. If it did raise 1B in cash, yes its valuation would go to 1B, but not just because it owns its own shares.

If in this example the company had retained its valuation of 100k after buying back 50% of its shares for 50k, I would have just made 50k out of thin air. As I physically received 50k for selling my shares to the company, yet still own the entire company. It's not logical that I just increased my wealth by doing nothing else than exchange shares with my own company.

Honestly this is beyond ludicrous where this sub has gotten to. If a company uses its cash to decrease share holder equity, thereby returning wealth to its shareholders, fundamentally the valuation of the company goes down. How could anyone think it wouldn't? If a company pays dividend from its cash, their valuation goes down. If a company pays wages to its employees, the valuation of the company goes down. It's a cost to the company. Money leaving the company. It's a 1-1 change between cash outflow and valuation.

Now, obviously investor sentiment and other factors not fundamentally tied to the balance sheet of the company have an effect on valuations on a stock market. Raising cash could scare away previous investors or it could create stronger belief in its growth. Paying investors through dividends or share buybacks could both improve the return on assets or it could put the company in trouble (liquidity issues, hamper growth etc). But what I am assuming here is that board decisions regarding capital allocations are (near) optimal and marginal changes in capital structure do not have a fundamental underlying impact on the company. All that changes is cash on hand."

You can't add Drupal and Wordpress into the same bucket as Squarespace. To use Drupal you need dev skills, and WP has it's own issues. What's different with SS is the ability to have a professional looking website without any code or the need for hosting. And Shopify is e-commerce focused. While SS does have e-commerce, I think the focus is for business web presence."
2021-05-18 09:12:30,stocks,"Shopify is heavy on e-commerce. So if you need just a website, there's no reason you need Shopify, which BTW is more expensive."

2021-05-18 16:46:52,stocks,Thanks
2021-05-17 20:25:49,stocks,"Yeah I could have maybe gotten in at $5,300 if I had waited it out but I decided to just be happy with the win I had and set a limit at $54 at 9:40am and it executed immediately. 

I feel more confident in buying Apple cause I have a long history of realized and unrealized gains with this stock. I’ve probably traded it dozens of times and by some miracle always been able to get in at a lower price than where I sold except for one time, which was when stocks sold off in March 2020. I could have gotten in lower but a “friend” convinced me that the sell off was nowhere close to over and I waited too long before buying back in. 

I currently have a January 2023 LEAPS in ICLN that I’m down 70% on (-$830). It was deep ITM when I bought it but it was really bad timing, right when all the clean energy and growth stocks started crashing. I thought I was buying the dip but it just kept dipping. Luckily it’s the smallest LEAPS I ever bought and it’s not a big portion of my portfolio but it is still annoying. I’m just going to hold in case it comes back. It needs to get back to $32 in order to just break even, which I guess isn’t totally out of the question, so I don’t think all hope is lost just yet. 

What’s the strike on your DIS LEAPS and what premium did you pay? I own 45 shares of the stock so I have a good amount of faith in the company."
2021-05-17 21:34:53,stocks,"I sold my ICLN Jan 2022 $35 LEAPS all most at 99% loss, there's was no point of selling but they were eye sores to me. I discovered reddit at the worst possible time, was up 100% on my DIS LEAPS,sold a few, bought back in way too early, Jan 22 $200 DIS LEAPS bought for average like$1,650. Could be higher than that, I try not to look back. They were like$530 today. I sold some today, will probably go up now. Also bought LEAPS for all the memes like NIO, XPEV, AMD, PLTR, worst possible time, all sold at steep losses. My portfolio is still down like 35%. I'm facing the losses and trying to start over, cautiously."
2021-05-17 22:10:15,stocks,"Ouch yeah that's pretty rough. I discovered deep ITM LEAPS a year ago when my dad told me about the concept and went in with a lot of caution since I was new to options. SPY was around 300 at the time and everyone was leery that it was a fake out recovery and there would be another crash.  I never heard of LEAPS before that and what's weird is like 6 months later they were being talked about all over the place like reddit and youtube. Ironically if I had gone all in right away I would have made a killing lol. I was considering doing them with ""safe"" stocks like apple, disney, IBB, SPY, QQQ, etc. 

I've learned reddit can be a great contrary indicator. The reddit hivemind is usually wrong based on the principle of being ""greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy"". A lot of new investors pile into the trends and don't really know what they're talking about. 

My stock portfolio is only down like 4% from it's ATH so I feel like I'm doing pretty well. I never got too into the meme type stocks but put in maybe less than 5% of my portfolio into stocks like NIO and ICLN. I started selling a lot of these types of stocks as well when I was at an ATH as well so I have plenty of cash on me now. 

I talk about this a little bit in this thread from 3 weeks ago:

2021-05-17 22:52:55,stocks,"Wow, so far you've been spot on on the inflation. But you bought some AAPL LEAPS you must think we're close to be at the bottom for tech? I find myself keep buying the bottomless bottom for tech, I'm selling out of my LEAPS trying to find the still undervalued stocks. banking stocks and oil seem high to me. I sold travel stocks too early but still have some airlines and cruise stocks. I used to be heavy in large cap tech before reddit, now after my meme crash I don't have money to buy them all back any more. Yeah, now I'm trying not to be sucked into the reddit meme. Had I stayed with my own stock picks, I would have been much better. Lesson learned. So glad you can keep your portfolio calm in all these craziness."
2021-05-17 23:28:34,stocks,"I think AAPL should be viewed more as consumers products company rather than a typical tech stock. Plus I'm prepared to keep buying the dip if it were to happen. That's one of the reason I sold the 70 call to buy the 75 call, so I had another $500 cash to put toward Apple. I don't want too great of a percent of my portfolio to be in one stock, but I'll buy it one more time if we see another significant dip.  If that were to happen I would probably go for a cheaper but more risky call with a higher strike. For example, if it dipped to 100 I might buy a strike of 125 which should be really cheap if that were to happen. Because at that point I think it would have dipped so much that it would have a really good chance of seeing a recovery. 

I was trying to figure out what stocks would benefit most from inflation. I noticed XME, the metals and mining ETF, is doing really well. Up nearly 5% today alone. I'm kinda pissed cause I started watching this one at 35 and never jumped in and now it's 47. I hate buying things high, feels like I'm submitting to fomo. I'm in SLV and GLD cause I thought those would do well with inflation but their not doing as well for some reason as XME."
2021-05-18 09:00:22,stocks,"Thanks for sharing, I like your moderate approach. I can see why you were hesitant on XME, it's at ATH. I did look at Nucor but again ATH. I almost wanted to fomo back to banks but again ATH. someone told me that they follow the trades of smart money, look at their 13F filings, Berkshire's most recent 13F revealed they sold a lot of Wells Fargo shares. So I thought that was interesting, maybe a confirmation for me not to fomo."
2021-05-18 13:55:22,stocks,"> Again, enjoy your worthless Puts.

This feels like it's supposed to be some sort of a ""gotcha"" but I doesn't resonate with me so I think you must care about whatever it is more than I do."

I've made all the mistakes and keep making them. If you are persistent and don't panic, you will (in the long term) make money.  But now you have an opportunity; Sell the big losers and harvest your losses.  Reinvest in ETFs or whatever has also taken a big hit (and won't trigger Wash Sales);  Ask someone with a wrinkled brain.  Your losses are as valuable as your gains."
