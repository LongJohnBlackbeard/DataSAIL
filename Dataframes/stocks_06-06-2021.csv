2021-06-06 17:53:31,stocks,Number 3 makes most sense. Doesn't matter if the stock is red or green at this point because you are in a situation where you have to liquidate. Sell the ones you feel will grow the least in the time it will take you to take up a new position
2021-06-06 18:10:10,stocks,"Time for DD on all you hold.

Q: would you *buy* it now?

If no, put it on the short list to  sell, regardless of current price."
2021-06-06 17:53:19,stocks,Don't sell off winners and keep holding the losers hoping they will come back. Every time I have done that its come back to Bite me.
2021-06-06 19:26:55,stocks,"You should aim for the lowest tax liability possible - if you have multiple lots of something, trim the lots you've held for >1yr and pay LT gains as opposed to ST.

The trend is your friend - avoid selling anything that's performing really well, especially if it's netted a lot of gains.  Do the profit taking when it stalls out. Conversely, anything heading down, might be time to dump.

The worst thing to do is cash your biggest winners because you'll have the most capital gains to pay next year, and if it's ST gains especially, you'll need to sell quite a bit more stuff just to make the tax bill, compared to mixing in a lot of losses to keep your tax bill as close to 0 as possible.

Solid mix of 1,3,4, avoid 2 until it makes sense to sell those big winners."
2021-06-06 17:51:23,stocks,I would liquidate anything that isn’t close to the 1 year mark to be considered a long term investment. Get those investments to 1 year to avoid the short term capital gains. If you have things you want to get rid of already over a year or things you know you won’t take to the 365 mark then get rid of those. If you have longs above 10 months you know you will hold for another 2 months keep em. Long term capital gains is a millions times better than short term.
2021-06-06 19:09:13,stocks,3
2021-06-06 18:36:15,stocks,\#3 seems like a sound strategy.  You'll be trimming the fat off your portfolio and only keeping those positions you really think have a good future.
2021-06-06 18:25:51,stocks,"You need to stop investing in great white sharks. 

I use to get bit by my investments all the time till I stopped investing in things that bite.(sharks, crockadiles, mosquitoes) It has been life changing."
2021-06-06 18:35:07,stocks,"Yea, the first year's of investing are full of pitfalls but letting winners ride while cutting losers is still a legitimate strategy. It's helped me craft a portfolio since I started investing where most of my individual stock picks have increased multiple times. Taking loses of a couple thousand is painful at first but it pales in comparison to watching a stock you sold increase in price 20-50% after selling for a small gain."
2021-06-06 19:12:51,stocks,"Yes. That absolutely sucks. I'm still very new to investing, but I'm happy and excited to learn. 

I'm taking it very small and learning. I hired a financial advisor to guide my main portfolio while I get experience with my own personal portfolio."
2021-06-06 19:52:29,stocks,I'll tell you a funny story. When I graduated high school in 05 my father gave me $1000 with the stipulation that I invest at least half of it. Well I did. I took $500 and bought AAPL stock with it. (I don't remember why I did this but I think it had something to do with liking the ipod) And I took the other half and bought an XBOX 360 when the came out later that year. I'll let you guess which one I still have today.
2021-06-06 19:33:00,stocks,"I wish you luck. I have been investing since I graduated highschool in 05. I have watched my account drop in value by over 30% multiple times and still held. Good stocks and and nerves of steel are a great start. Plus it helps that in 08 I only had like $20,000 in the market lol"
2021-06-06 17:51:15,stocks,"I'm in Maxeon Solar ($MAXN). Their stock is beaten down right now because they issued an SPO to fund production of their next gen solar panels, which are thinner and frameless (don't require aluminum or steel for production, which seems pretty good as metals prices are through the roof right now)

Anyway they've been turning around the last week or so and I don't have a price target because I'm holding them as an investment for a very long time.

to be clear: I'm not bagholding. Most of my holdings were from the spinoff, and I bought more after the SPO. 140 shares with average cost basis in the teens."

2021-06-06 18:16:14,stocks,I'm longer investor in Solar Edge. It's a excelent company in this sector.
2021-06-06 19:05:58,stocks,Doesn’t Tesla own a solar company? I don’t know if they actually make the panels though.
2021-06-06 17:51:17,stocks,Come hold a bag of VVPR with me buddy!
2021-06-06 18:06:59,stocks,A S T I    Is a solid play with high end benefits.  Started moving last week
2021-06-06 18:29:56,stocks,"I also have MAXN. Unlike you, I Am bag holding at 29 and 18. Also got in at 15.65. Will continue to purchase this stock as I believe it can only go up."

2021-06-06 18:33:07,stocks,"Sorry about your bags, but I agree it's mostly up from here. But I'm not watching it that closely, I'll be holding for a long time."
2021-06-06 19:27:26,stocks,"Quick Google search:

SolarCity Corporation is a subsidiary of Tesla, Inc. that develops and sells solar panels and solar roof tiles. It is headquartered in Fremont, California. After its acquisition in 2016, effectively all products and services are sold through Tesla's website."
2021-06-06 17:56:40,stocks,"High risk with these investnent companies is more about equity allocation. Than it is risky stocks or sectors etc.
They often have some small cap exposure etc. Which right now is good.
You can look up your fund and print it out. It'll be 10-20 funds wrapped into one package. I'm assuming this is an employer matched program as well."
2021-06-06 17:26:37,stocks,If you’re young just do the maximum risk... they aren’t buying penny stocks regardless. They are investing your money in strong ETFS and Bonds most likely
2021-06-06 19:40:33,stocks,"yes exactly it is through my work where they are matching contributions. I have it in the moderate/ to high risk but would it be worth it to bump it up to the highest risk?

 I've looked all day and never saw a way to personalize/ invest in stocks that I chose. does this mean they only have the pre set packages??"
2021-06-06 19:43:24,stocks,"so its worth it to bump it up to the highest risk?

With these programs is there anyway for me to personalize my own portfolio? everything I could find were pre built portfolios."

2021-06-06 16:45:51,stocks,AMC doesn’t own any of the content. The content creators already separately sell rights to streaming services.
2021-06-06 16:50:20,stocks,thanks for the fan fiction I guess
2021-06-06 16:50:49,stocks,"lmao too late into the game. IF AMC takes this route, they have to compete with Disney Amazon and AT&T. IMO smells like a disaster, if the company wants to improve it better give customers something that most Movie theaters goers has never experienced."
2021-06-06 17:15:56,stocks,"> This is a paid service with cable providers and online streaming services. There is an App, their could be a few channels, AMC Western, AMC Prime and AMC Sci-Fi etc . The idea is to make it a premier channel like HBO.

They'd definitely get into trademark issues with the existing but unrelated AMC channel."
2021-06-06 19:53:49,stocks,"I went to see Quiet Place 2 at an AMC last weekend and was trying to think about what they could do differently. I think they have to create synergy with the existing streaming services rather than trying to compete with them. Imagine if you came out of a screening of Quiet Place 2 and there was a Paramount Plus table set up with two knowledgeable employees. They could talk to you about the movie, sell Paramount merch, with a few small giveaways, and sign you up for Paramount Plus, which would be exclusively streaming Quiet Place 1. It benefits AMC, benefits the studio, and gives the moviegoer another experience they don’t get at home."

Time and valuation @ entry matters!"
2021-06-06 17:45:22,stocks,"I know more about Amazon than you even know. I gave a brief glance of balancing my portfolio and which companies weighting’s I already have. Imagine jumping to conclusions about shit you have no idea about. Amazon is my retail consumer goods play AWS is a bonus. When I got into Amazon they were just a retail logistics play. My cost basis is $400 I know enough about Amazon strictly from being invested for so long.

2021-06-06 19:48:06,stocks,"Waiting around for a $200 drop on GOOGL that is never gonna happen.  Time IN the market is better than timing the market.  The best time to buy any stock was a year ago not 6 months into the future when it's most likely more expensive.

That’s the one to buy into regularly, whereas these two stocks would be a buy and hold alongside, but wouldn’t be adding to the position really unless gains are secured on those owned. If that makes some level of sense for message."

2021-06-06 14:37:43,stocks,"gme or any meme stock for that matter doesn't have the capabilities to bring down a bank. What is really dangerous is derivatives, derivatives are what caused 08 which is something many don't understand, derivatives are very dangerous because they can get very very complicated and  very difficult to manage. Archegos is way more of a scary event than gme or meme stocks, in fact wall street and the financial system get hurt when banks get far to long not short, as if right now tye banks are pretty healthy, they have lots of capital and aren't really at risk of collapsing, now if archegos wasn't a one off event we could be in trouble, but this has nothing to do with meme stocks or short selling."
2021-06-06 15:57:30,stocks,"My man.

Yes, 2008 never ended in some monetary policy aspects.

No, the chances of a repeat of the 08 systemic collapse is unlikely given the banking controls implemented since (I was in banking in that decade).

Yes, there will be a bear market and a recession at some point. If someone tells you exactly when it will be, they should comfortably be the richest man/woman on earth. If they’re not, you should have more questions for them.

No, the global markets are not going to collapse because of a $20B store and there won’t be newly minted trillionaires in the process.

A priest and a pastor were fishing on the side of the road. They thoughtfully made a sign saying, ""The end is near! Turn yourself around now before it's too late!"" and showed it to each passing car.

One driver who drove by didn't appreciate the sign and shouted at them, ""Leave us alone, you religious nuts!""

2021-06-06 14:41:34,stocks,"I understand this but I think the thing a lot of people are missing with specifically GME is that if it is shorted over 100% and falls into an infinity squeeze is that when those who are short it are liquidated, all of their long positions will be sold off, resulting in massive deleveraging IMO. On top of that, because most of the market is rehypothecated which would basically create a chain reaction if a few funds are liquidated entirely."
2021-06-06 16:06:55,stocks,"I appreciate the insight and I do agree you can’t accurately predict a market crash. However, I would recommend reading the DDs on superstonk. The whole meme portion and people saying price targets isn’t for everyone and it’s kind of a shame that those posts get so much attention because the DD on the sub is tremendous imo. Even if you don’t believe in any of the hype, there’s some pretty insightful stuff in the DD section"
2021-06-06 15:00:05,stocks,"This is far from related to TINA or media FUD.

The only thing that I find interesting here is what's going on with the repos, but then...

- You are in full on GUESSING GAME MODE on when this is going to become an issue, if it even does. The reason why it's interesting for me personally is that you had repos spike in the fall of 2019. But it would be months before something actually occurred. So, if this is even an issue, this is a case where it could become an issue tomorrow, next week, next month, or next year. You simply just don't know.

- It's apparently not the same problem that was an issue back in 2019.

As for the Gamestop part of this, I'm fairly certain that you're going to still be hearing the ""squeeze hasn't squoze"" in September at this point.

If r/superstonk actually happens to be 100% correct here, I'm fairly confident that the results would be nobody getting their money considering what happened back in January. You would have brokers and market makers going bankrupt...honestly, them going bankrupt is probably more likely than Gamestop to a million."
2021-06-06 19:31:54,stocks,We have mods here ?
2021-06-06 15:00:05,stocks,"I see where you’re coming from here too. For example indicators of 2008 were evident in 2006 and it took time for things to catch up. I’m just curious, do you own any meme stocks or GME as a sort of, “just in case they’re right” hedge? At this point I can’t help but feel somethings coming as we’re seeing a huge resurgence with no notable news creating fomo along with spikes following these T+21 and T+35 cycles. Seems like for $200 some odd dollars it’s worth the ticket to ride even if it’s one share, speaking for myself at least."
2021-06-06 14:46:10,stocks,"An infinity squeeze is not possible, how the market works is that you need someone else to buy your shares, if gme ""infinity squeezes"" and you set the price at 1 million a share, who is going to buy it from you, the answer is your share will be worth 0 unless someone will buy. Plus gme is not as shorted as you think, the market cap is under 20 billion, the total market cap of US stock markets are like 80 trillion. Short selling isnt really dangerous like you think, sure a few funds have gone bust but the overall market and banks have never been affected by short selling because its not a very complex prosses."
2021-06-06 19:34:18,stocks,What is your ability to analyse and understand the DD that is given to you. What is your ability also to make your own DD and how many years of experience do you have with it ?
2021-06-06 15:17:59,stocks,"I do not own any meme stocks no, and I think this whole thing is ridiculous. Those money are better spent on real investments than on whatever it is you guys are doing"
2021-06-06 14:52:31,stocks,"I respectfully have to disagree with the idea that an infinity squeeze is impossible. If there is a price there is a buyer and seller. That’s just how our markets work. And in the case of an infinity squeeze, it won’t be funds decided whether or not to close a short position out at x price, their positions will be force closed by the DTCC liquidating them to balance their books. If they have to close 100 naked shorts and the cost of doing so is $10 million, the automated system will do so to make sure their credits equal their debits. I’m just curious, have you read the HOC DDs over on r/superstonk? I know the place is full of memes and seems conspiratorial but the research is astounding in my opinion and clearly proves that GameStop is shorted well over its entire float. If you disagree I respect that but I’d recommend at least reading the DD on it because it’s air tight honestly and is truly eye opening"
2021-06-06 19:44:57,stocks,"I became infatuated with the stock market in March of last year and dove in head first. At this point I’d say i personally have done hundreds of hours of research into GME but the broader market as a whole. I am not a professional by any means but I understand synthetic longs, short interest, naked shorting, married puts to hide FTDs, etc. I personally haven’t created any DD on GME but I consider myself extremely skeptical and my identity as an investor prior to this debacle was based around typical moves on r/stocks and looking for long term investments that would allow me to retire comfortably. I think there’s a lot of hatred toward GME because of what it stands to potential reveal about the broader market in general and it’s is inherently frightening. I genuinely believe that if someone reads the House of Cards DDs and sets their biases aside, it will leave them disturbed. If you come to the same conclusion it would likely lead you to as long as you understand it, GME appears as the ultimate hedge to a market crash due to its unique situation."
2021-06-06 19:48:01,stocks,I’m not here to shill GME even if it appears that way. Im here because there’s definitive evidence that our market is propped up on the abuse of derivatives and is set to come crumbling down at some point in the future. This obviously isn’t something people want to hear but the data is right there for anyone to see. Rehypothecation in the market has quite literally created a house of cards
2021-06-06 15:01:03,stocks,"It's not air tight because most gme shorts have closed, these funds are not stupid, the reason not many hedge funds went bankrupt is because they hedged their position, do you really think retail is buying all those options, no, it's the hedge funds  buy these to create synthetic longs to hedge. That's why when gme or anc goes up 100% no hedge fund goes tits up because they have a long position to hedge, hedge funds are not stupid they know how to wiggle out of situations, dtcc changed the rule like 3 months ago if this had a possibility of happening it would have happend already, but it didn't."
2021-06-06 15:30:10,stocks,the co founder of ortex disagrees with you about the shorts closing
2021-06-06 15:05:56,stocks,I think it’s a bit disingenuous to assume most shorts have closed out on GameStop honestly. It’s actually mathematically impossible that they have considering the amount of short positions they would have had under $10. The fact that GME has been continuously rising with incredibly little volume for the past three months is telling that their reporting of short positions is blatantly false in my opinion.
2021-06-06 15:32:34,stocks,"Yes and I disagree with him. Most of the people who report shorts disagree with him, yes ypu can call them all corrupt. But honestly at that point your just picking and choosing which data to use and which not to use."
2021-06-06 15:11:07,stocks,"The short intrest is 21% dude. A stock rising on low volume dosnt have anything to do with shorts covering, stocks do this all the time.  I worked at a fund, when a short position goes bad they take out an options combo known as a synthetic long, this emulates a long position and as the stock rises they reape the premium on the options, this allows them to cover easily, retail is absolutely not buying most of the options. This is just one strategy of the any they use to close a short even when it hasn't gone well. You just assume these funds that have Harvard grads working for them are just stupid which is just nieve. I mean hedge funds are smart no two ways about this, start reading about all the loopholes and tricks they found and you might think again."

What the fuck are you talking about ? Its literally mathematically possible that they closed their short positions, they had endless windows to do so."
2021-06-06 18:16:36,stocks,"If shorts have covered, why the flash crashes in January and in March? Hedge funds admitted live on TV that the price would’ve hit in the thousands before squeezing, meaning the price run up in January to $483 was pure buying pressure. Knowing this, if the shorts actually did cover back in late January, the price would’ve risen, not fell. Also, the fact that restrictions were put on GME for weeks also proves shorts never covered. OBV levels also prove no one was really selling when the price crashes from $483 to $126, and it would not have dropped so quickly naturally. (My background is finance and I have family that used to work on Wall Street.)

EDIT: Also forgot to add, have you checked the numerous rules being pushed through by the DTCC, OCC, and ICC that pertain directly to this situation?"
2021-06-06 15:16:15,stocks,"Trust me man I’m familiar with synthetic longs and how they hedge their positions. But if you genuinely believe the reported SI of 21% is real then I can’t help but feel that’s a naive, especially for someone who claims to have worked for a fund. With the short interest in December being over 200%, there’s mathematically no way for them to have lowered it to 21% legitimately with the price going to 350 then now being back to the mid 200s. Blindly trusting FINRA reports that have been falsely reported in the past seems like you’re setting yourself up for failure"
2021-06-06 18:24:30,stocks,"The flash crashes were caused by liquidity loss, similar to what happened on black Monday. Options also have a huge role is causing price movements. The short intrest is 21% nowhere near enough to cause a squeeze. 483 was not pure buying pressure as the SI went down considerably during that time, also every hedge fund is diffrent, one hedge efund on TV cannot speak for everyone, having a background in finance you should know this."
2021-06-06 15:22:42,stocks,"It is absolutely possible to bring it down, first the short interest was never 200% it was around 120%. And also you know it possible to short over 100% without it actually being a naked short https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/28/yes-a-stock-can-have-short-interest-over-100-heres/ read about it. I belive most of the above 100% came from this, in the case of a naked short the broker would need ro rebuy the shares, however when they do this they would most likely go to a asset management firm like blackrock or fidelity and buy from them, not on the market."
2021-06-06 15:29:56,stocks,"And in many cases of a FTD they just create a synthetic share or phantom share, this dilutes the price of the stock by artificially increasing the float. Yes this is illegal but it makes it so the broker or fund dosnt have to buy share, it's actually ironic because the only way they would face accountability from these fake shares they now own is if the stock started to fall, but thanks to you guys you keep it up for them, yes this charade will eventually end, but the fallout will be very small as again gme has a market cap of under 20b."
2021-06-06 18:31:24,stocks,"SI is self-reported. Let’s say you’re a hedge fund, and your short-interest is so high that the refusal of people to sell is only digging your hole deeper. If you report your true SI, you give more fuel to those buying into GME and you head towards margin calls. You have no choice but to lie in order to save your company. Knowing the sheer amount of people that did not sell, how did institutions short on the stock cover their shorts, especially with the OBV level not dropping at all during the January and March flash crashes? And I know that options/FTD’s are playing a huge role in price movement, and also watching the borrowed shares and the ridiculously low interest to borrow coinciding with the flash crashes also are peculiar...

EDIT: The flash crash in January was partially caused by Robinhood and others literally taking away the buy button that one day, then restricting the amount allowed to buy over the next two weeks. That was blatant price suppression for a reason...

EDIT 2: Another thing about SI is the chart showed a continuous drop in SI at the same time that the price was dropping during the flash crash. Now, there is literally no way possible that covering causes a price decrease; instead the price should have literally skyrocketed during that small time frame of supposed covering, and OBV should’ve dropped with the price but it instead stayed a straight line proving barely any sells occurred at all. None of this happened, proving shorts weren’t actually being covered. Based on those facts, current SI is a self-reported lie."
2021-06-06 15:28:57,stocks,"I’m aware that that’s possible but it’s pretty evident that prior to Ryan Cohens involvement in GameStop, hedge funds seemed to be going for the “bankruptcy jackpot”. That can really only be accomplished by piling on naked shorts to drive a company to bankruptcy i.e. toys r us, blockbuster, etc. it just so happened that they got caught this time in over their heads. 

Also, for the record I really do enjoy hearing your stance on this because you are clearly educated on the topic but have a differing opinion. I’ve been in GME since last September as a value play but have ended up holding my shares because there’s clearly something sinister going on with the stock in my opinion."
2021-06-06 18:35:35,stocks,"Dude what you are suggesting is illegal, of course it happens like fraud sometimes happens, but what you are saying is happening is a huge conspiracy theory because you have no proof, it like me saying that all of the banks are faking their earnings, if course it's possible but it's highly illegal and dosnt happen often at all.

Edit 1. That locks have been explained time and time again 

Edit 2. Have you consider that maybe more people were selling that covering causing the stock to fall?"
2021-06-06 18:38:37,stocks,"Also on balance volume is an indicator and is not right in all cases, what caused the flash crashes were a lack in liquidity, when robinhood stopped buying, this disrupted the order book and liquidity crashed, same thing that caused black Monday."
2021-06-06 15:38:40,stocks,"Trust me I love a good conversation as well. But honestly shorts aren't as evil as you think, most of those companies had to go they were un innovative, I'd argue this helps the market function, also you don't note all of times short sellers were the food guys, world com, enron, fin crisis.  Plus on top of that shorts actually are very good at mitigating market crashes, when they cover they push the price up, this helps make market crashes far nicer, main reason why bubble pops are so nasty is because there are no shorts left to cover."
2021-06-06 18:45:21,stocks,"Look into how much market makers have been fined for these illegal acts, just look it up and count. It’s not a conspiracy. If the punishment for breaking a rule/law is a small fine but the profit far outweighs the fine, there is no incentive to follow that rule of law. People break laws all the time, especially if the punishment is weak. Are you saying Wall Street is a beacon of honesty?"
2021-06-06 18:40:45,stocks,"OBV is an indicator, but that OBV indicator worked well in all other charts, but all of a sudden is wrong when it comes to GME? There is a ton that is being overlooked in this conversation, and you haven’t explained why SI dropped with the crashing price which is literally impossible...

EDIT: You keep pointing to a liquidity issue. If this were truly a liquidity issue, then why was the buying only stopped for specific “meme stocks?” And why was buying restricted for the next two weeks? As I recall, liquidity affects more than just a handful of stocks; it affects the market itself, so liquidity in this situation doesn’t fit. Also, Black Monday was caused by selling, not buying, so you cannot compare that event with GME that day."
2021-06-06 15:42:50,stocks,"I agree that shorting has its place in our markets but that naked shorting doesn’t. I’ll just ask, would you confidently say with 100% certainty that you believe there isn’t an issue with naked shorting occurring with GME? I think the reason it differs from other meme stocks is that it was being driven to bankruptcy but they now have zero debt, over half a billion cash on hand, and clear path for continued growth in the future. Other meme stocks would be crushed back down after hype dies out but GME makes a great case for a growth stock even now if you believe they’re going to corner the gaming industry"
2021-06-06 15:49:16,stocks,"I have lots of friends who game and I do sometimes on my free time as well. I would never buy something from gamestop and it's not cause I hate them, it's just steam works so well and I would never switch, epic has come the closest and they lose money to try and get customers, the only reason they can do this is because of fortnite. Gamestop even without debt is a company I don't believe in because I personally see the industry moving in a completely online direction and a more exclusives focused direction, sure gamestop is trying now but it's to little to later, remember ypu could have made this same case with blockbuster as well. Also like I said in another comment in the case of a naked short a phantom share is created when they cover, the only way this is a problem is when the stock falls since they now own a share, if the stock keeps going up they won't have to sell or realize the loss, pretty ironic because all the people buying into gamestop what these guys to have accountability but if the stock keeps going up they will face none. And if the stock falls, the market cap is under 20b the fallout from the losses will be badly enough to bring down a fund, let alone the whole system."
2021-06-06 15:51:29,stocks,What’s your opinion on GameStop’s NFT website that would potentially allow for the buying and selling of digital game licenses? I agree brick and mortar is a thing of the past but that seems pretty revolutionary to me
2021-06-06 15:55:07,stocks,"I'm not in the gaming industry so I'm not the best person to ask, but just from a quick Google search it seems that other, companies in the sphere are doing this since around 2018, and again I'm not very well versed in this space so correct me if I'm wrong."
2021-06-06 15:56:43,stocks,My understanding is that others have tried something similar but doing so using blockchain would be a first and would potentially open an entirely new sphere of gaming exchanges that allows developers to continue profiting on game licenses while players being able to recoup money on games they’re finished playing
2021-06-06 16:00:46,stocks,"I see, what I don't get is why Microsoft or Sony or steam wouldn't do this and just integrate it more seamlessly with their platforms, this idea also dosnt sound extremely profitable for gamestop, the problem is that the larger companies like epic and steam and Microsoft can just do this same thing at smaller margins as they have other revenue streams, which gamestop does not have."
2021-06-06 16:08:45,stocks,I’m pretty sure Microsoft and GameStop partnered in late 2020 following Cohen joining the board so there may be some sort of furthering the NFT business alongside them
2021-06-06 16:11:59,stocks,"That's deal was very microsoft based, it was basically a deal where gamestop uses lots of microsofts services to get into online and e commerce. Microsoft is a very aggressive company and I dont see them giving a potential revenue stream away."
2021-06-06 13:50:49,stocks,"Good post, thanks for the good analysis.

I think it’s clear that this company was shorted for good reason - they have misled investors a couple times already by failing to disclose an SEC inquiry and then overstating their contracts. A quick look at their financials shows revenue growth, but it also looks like their claims paid is higher than their premiums received in the recent quarter - that doesn’t seem like a recipe for a profitable insurance business. 

You can get lucky trying to trade on the short squeeze momentum, but the company itself seems like a dud."

2021-06-06 13:49:39,stocks,"Here is what I did after saving enough for an emergency fund..

1. Contribute enough to match what my employers 401k can match. i'm contribute 5% of paycheck, and employer matches that 5%.
2. Set up a Roth IRA with Vanguard (or your borker of choice). Max the annual contribution. I prioritized Roth because of its tax free growth. Allocated funds to S&P 500 fund.
3. Now that I have maxed my annual Roth contribution, I then did some math and found out I can raise my 401k contribution to 20% and still have plenty of living expenses on the side. Pay attention to which funds you are allocating your 401k contribution too. I'm still in my 30s and i'm mostly on growth funds. 
4. Stay on course. Keep on learning.. Listen to a lot of Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch and Jack Bogle.

You can prioritize either 401k or the Roth.. I personally like Roth because of the benefit of having the growth tax free.. Youtube finance guides have been helpful to me.. The most important part is that you are saving for your future. You cannot go wrong with either one."

I'd invest 80% in the SP500 (ETF like VOO) and 20% in the NASDAQ 100 (ETF like QQQ).  It's slightly redundant because the SP500 has tech, but it's a tech world and you should have more.  

Aside from this retirement strategy, open a non retirement ordinary brokerage account and invest part of that in a similar way.  This will provide you liquid funds if you need it without the restrictions of a retirement fund.  

If any of your stuff is in an IRA.  Invest in a Roth if you expect to be in the same or higher tax bracket AFTER you retire.  Use a Traditional IRA if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket AFTER you retire (most of us).  Don't fall into the ""you need a Roth"" pitch without doing research on the tax benefit.  The whole strategy with an IRA choice is to pay the fewest taxes.

2021-06-06 14:40:58,stocks,Thank you. Many questions about to come your way.
2021-06-06 13:58:52,stocks,"Tax free growth is good but keep in mind there are income limitations to the Roth. Also, with a traditional IRA and 401k, you don’t pay tax now, so that money that would have went toward taxes can grow over your lifetime. And assuming you don’t die broke, it’s possible you never end up paying tax on some of that money (compare to the Roth where it’s taxed first before going into the account).

Both types of accounts can be good or better than the other depending on your personal circumstances."
2021-06-06 16:11:51,stocks,"Common misconception.  If you retire at a lower tax bracket, a Traditional gives you even more growth.   Why prepay income taxes at a higher rate with a Roth while you are working when you can wait with a Traditional IRA and pay a lower rate when you retire.  You get to keep some of the governments tax money and all the gains."
2021-06-06 15:13:03,stocks,This is pretty solid advice. Go with this guy. 6-8 months seems a bit much tho. Probably could get away with 2-4 months depending on if you have family that could help you out in an emergency. You want as much money while you’re young going into investments as possible. Not when you’re older.

2021-06-06 16:02:46,stocks,"With a Roth, you are pre paying your taxes while you are most likely in a higher tax bracket because you are working.  With a Traditional IRA, you postpone paying taxes until you retire - usually at a lower rate.  You get to keep some of the governments share and all of it's gains.  

I was in a 25% tax bracket working.  And I put my money in a Traditional with no taxes paid.  Now I'm taking it out and paying 12%.  

Roth IRAs were invented by the government to get your retirement tax money decades in advance.  They are great if you move to a higher tax bracket after you retire (like if you inherit money that provides investment income)."
2021-06-06 13:55:44,stocks,"You’re not wrong. Roth can be better, depends on your situation.   At a young age it’s often a good choice, but also depends on if your employer has a match, what your income level is (there is a limit for Roth where if you make too much you aren’t eligible to contribute), etc."

If you were in a car wreck today and couldn't work for a few months to a year how would you pay bills between the time you get your next paycheck and when insurance starts paying out? What if there is a delay? Also consider your cost of living in that situation will rise dramatically so what would have lasted 6 months might only last 4.

2021-06-06 13:53:24,stocks,"Inflation means that the dollar loses purchasing power, and as such that dollars of earnings have less value for publicly traded companies.  In an inflationary environment, the costs of commodities and common goods will tend to rise.

So pretty darn easy when you actually frame the question relative to what inflation is.  When the value of the dollar declines, you want to own companies that can pass through higher costs to end consumers fairly easily (pricing power exceeding the rate of inflation).  You’d like to avoid companies that can’t adjust their prices but are dependent upon commodities (earnings compression).  You’d like exposure ideally to companies that both benefit from higher commodity prices and can also pass higher costs through easily with pricing power.  This is why people like the energy sector.  If the price of oil and natural gas goes up, ET for instance (my personal pick for the space) will see higher production volumes which leads to increased earnings.  If the dollar devalues they can easily pass their higher costs onto the users of their infrastructure which simply gets passed down to the end user at the gas pump or on their energy bill.  Positive correlation to rising commodity prices plus dominant pricing power by rote of their industry, combined with a yield that is significantly higher than the rate of inflation as well.  Just about everything you could ask for.

This is why you keep hearing people say energy, energy, energy.  It’s a perfect setup for this type of environment and it only gets better once infrastructure spending kicks off.  Good luck!"

2021-06-06 15:39:48,stocks,"The USD’s value waivers due to two obvious primary factors: our inflationary/deflationary growth/bust cycle, and other foreign economies’ growth/bust cycles.

https://www.macrotrends.net/1329/us-dollar-index-historical-chart

(this graph only goes through 2019 but is nice because it includes recessions)

Here’s another one that can include the last year and a half if you set the filters:

https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy

What you’re asserting are two different things:

1 - the USD has lost value as a reserve currency over the decades. This is false, it’s actually only been about a decade now. That’s not a good thing, but it’s also not a bad thing. It does hint at inflation (not a direct or great hint), but so far nothing that isn’t manageable and cyclical. In fact, your assertion that it’s at an “accelerating rate” is also false: it’s actually a pretty normal rate.

2 - the USD has been inflating. Undeniably true, but again: is it dangerous? Economists wrestle with the idea, because in order to grow you often have to reinvest (spend).

My only point is that everything happening right now is actually fairly normal and cyclical. Does that mean it’s good? That’s debatable, but there’s no reason to panic as of right now.

The gray bars in that graph represent official recessions, so there both are and aren’t direct correlations.

What is true is that as of available data right now, the dollar has lost value in the last few years (you’re right on that). It’s not accelerating, though. It’s a pretty normal decrease. It was worth far less back in 2009/2010, yet we maintained global reserve currency status. It’ll (probably) go back up."

So yeah, I have explained what I feel is going to happen. Your question was strategy with high inflation on the horizon. My argument is inflation will be transitory as feds have already started reducing liquidity in the economy by something called reverse repo. So while everyone is focusing on interest rates being low and that leading to high inflation in the long term (not transitory), I believe people are missing the point. 

If you want to have safe assets in times of high inflation land and real estate are the only ones that perform better than anything else during such times. You can argue that the real estate boom or bubble will be inflated even further if that were to happen ( growing in periods of high inflation) in such scenario I am quite sure no strategy can work better than the other as we will probably have a real fire sale like 1929."

2021-06-06 11:46:51,stocks,"Note the difference in management of a loss depends on whether you are talking about “making 10k” by investing or through earned income. 

Loss as you described can:

(1) Offset capital gains (investment income) that same year only.  Meaning if you had $10k losses and $15k gains (ie from investments) your overall net is $5k gains

(2) Offset earned income to a max of $3k that year and yearly afterwards until the $10k loss is completely accounted for. Meaning if you had $10k losses and $63k income for 2021 - you pay taxes on $60k for 2021.  Similarly you could offset $3k for 2022, 2023. Then $1k for 2024."
2021-06-06 12:15:46,stocks,"If someone loses 10k the year before, that can be used to offset 3k of ordinary income that same year. The remaining 7k is carried over to the next year. 
If next year, you have a overall capital gain of 10k, that 7k carried forward loss can be used to offset that, so you will only be paying taxes on the 10k-7k = 3k. However, lets say you did not make any capital gains the next year, in that case, you can only offset 3k from your ordinary income, and the remaining 4k (7k - 3k) carries forward to the next year."

2021-06-06 12:31:32,stocks,"Just having losses does not make it taxable you would have to sell in the two years to generate taxable events.

So going that you are in the USA, that both sales were long term, you are not a corporation, no wash sales in this, and that you have an income of over $50k(so you have to pay taxes)

Year 1) You sell for a loss of $10k; and this is your only sell of the year and no other long-term capital gains.    You would have long-term credit of $10k, since you cannot use it you can instead use a max of $3K a year from ordinary income until it is used up.  So you offset $3k from your ordinary income.

Year 2) You sell for a profit of $10k; again only sale and no other long-term capital gains.  You have $7k long-term credit so you would have to pay long-term capital gains on the $3k."

2021-06-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Shift technologies - An online used car sales company &#x200B;

DISCLAIMER: I am a holder of SFT stock. Not meant as financial advice, just trying to provide some information and create some discussion around this company.

Positions: 210 shares @ $7.06 and planning on buying some longdated slightly OTM calls.

Shift technologies, ticker $SFT - Current share price: $7.57 - Market cap: 636.973M

So, before I start most things I could even write here are covered by an excellent DD video found on youtube by TheWalrus Street (I highly recommend his channel). I can't post the link but it's easy to find on youtube and provides all the basic information you need about this company.

Recently there have been quite a few developments for the company.

Shift technologies released its 1st quarter earnings report on May 13th and it was pretty damn good.

\- Revenue grew to $106.0 million up 254% YOY

\- Gross profit grew to $7.4 million or 6.9% of total revenue, up from $3.3 million.

\- Gross profit per unit was $1,655, growing 255% from $466 in Q4'2020

\- Net loss was $42.8 million as compared to net loss of $12.3 million a year prior.

Increase in net loss is mainly attributable to an increase in marketing expenses and slight increase in SG&A expenses. However, margins are increasing significantly (255% increase in margins on vehicles quarter over quarter) and revenue is as well. It makes sense that their operating expenses are increasing as they will have to act aggressively in order to be able to take market-share from both Carvana and Vroom.

So this quarter was pretty good, but I believe that the next quarter will be even better considering that according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics April saw the biggest increase in inflation for used verhicles, going up by 10% which is the highest it has been since 1953. See the link below for a bloomberg article covering this:

[Bloomberg article on Inflation in used vehicles](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/record-surge-in-used-car-prices-is-key-culprit-in-inflation-jump)

More recently on May 24th an offering of senior notes of 75 million was announced, which they increased to 125 million the next day. The share price dropped as low as $6.26 intraday on the 24th but has seen a steady climb back upwards ever since. With this happening I'm also pretty confident that further offerings will not happen in the near future.

There has also been some insider purchasing of shares. Just 4 days ago Oded Shein the CFO of the company bought $70k worth of shares at $7.00. Although this seems insignificant it's generally a bullish sign for insiders to be purchasing shares.

Finally, $SFT will be added to the Russell 3000 on June 25th. The list of companies that are going to be uplisted was announced 2 days ago. For the full list see the link below so you can check it out for yourself.

[Preliminary additions to the Russell 3000](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf)

This isn't a major catalyst or anything but it does mean that funds tracking the index will have to start adding some shares in order to rebalance their indexes. This could already have happened in anticipation of the uplisting ofcourse, so I wouldn't put too much value on it.

In general my outlook for Shift is very bullish. Considering the inflation statistics in used vehicles from april and their rapid growth trajectory I can see their revenue increasing even more over the next quarters. Even if they have four consecutive 106.0 million revenue quarters that puts them at a P/S ratio of around 1.5 (P/S ratio using sales last year is currently 3.5 for SFT). Their main competitors, Vroom and Carvana have P/S ratio of 3.75 and 7.01 (based on revenues of last year).

To me SFT seems undervalued, but I would love to hear your thought and opinions. Also, sorry if there are any formatting errors and any possible grammatical mistakes (am not a native English speaker)."

2021-06-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about stocks and the money supply Is the growth of the US stock market more or less dependent on a growing money supply in the US?

It has to be like that right? Because if the money supply isnt growing then we will reach a cap of how much money can be added to the stock market.

Now i know that money from other countries is flowing into the US stock market but that cant be the driving factor for the stock market growth, right?

Second question is if there is a guarantee that the money supply will Continue to grow in the long term future? 

And if it wont, what would happen to the stock market?

But if it will continue to grow in the long term, could one say that we have more or less secured future growth in the stock market also? 

Happy for answers :)"

2021-06-06 10:33:39,stocks,Themselves. A country’s national debt is the amount of money they have printed that is not backed by securities such as oil or gold. America is simply printing more money than we have in value and that’s what raises our national debt. We are borrowing against ourselves. Kind of like when you pay off a credit card debt with another credit card.

2021-06-06 12:40:45,stocks,"This is so wrong.  The national debt is money that they have borrowed that they have to pay back.  They accrue debt by spending more money than they bring in though taxes etc.  The most common way countries borrow (like the US) is by issuing bonds which they have to pay back with interest when they mature.  Buyers of the bonds can be individuals or other countries.  Printing money does nothing to raise the national debt.  As a matter of fact some countries will print money and use that to pay off their debts.  When done at a large enough scale it devalues their currency and causes massive inflation but it has been done by countries in the past..  

Printing more money theoretically leads to inflation which is why there are currently so much inflation fear.  The US got off the gold standard back in 1971 and the value of the dollar and the national debt has nothing to do with how much gold or oil the US has."

2021-06-06 12:33:18,stocks,"Made most of my money from SQ at $17 and ENPH at $19

Currently holding: CRSR, PLTR, WKHS and smaller positions in RIDE, AZRE, ICLN. 

Not sure id recommend WKHS right now, it’s extremely risky, I regret buying, but I don’t panic sell, so I’m selling CC’s against my shares at break even to collect premium. 

CRSR and PLTR seem like sure multibaggers, IMHO and premiums are juicy.

I highly recommend learning options (to sell, NOT BUY), but you’ll want a year or two of gains before you have enough cash power to sell options. 

Im really loving EDR as a stock, but don’t own any sizable amount worth noting. I also love COIN as a long term boring hold and I also like PCT as another boring hold. 

I’m starting to scale down risk and invest in more quality long term multibaggers. The 3 I just mentioned, I feel are good long holds. Full disclosure, don’t own COIN or PCT, and I only hold like $500 in EDR."
2021-06-06 14:29:33,stocks,"Youre absolutely right but my point was that the feeling you get from losing money hurts, and it sucks to see your hard earned times investment dwindle. Those feelings can cause people to panic and pull out near the bottom, these are emotions new investors feel and just because you and I know its temporary, because we've seen those lows they haven't, so don't dismiss it because you've already experienced it"
2021-06-06 19:08:30,stocks,"You're right, it does hurt and emotion gets involved and panic can be a possibility. It's not bad to go through a correction early in your investing career and get used to it so one doesn't panic as much when they have a significant nest egg."
2021-06-06 00:00:00,stocks,"What kind of stocks should a 40 year old employed person be investing in? Growth or dividend growth stocks? I'm currently holding mostly growth stocks just wondering if dividend paying stocks would be better 10-15 years from now. Oh I forgot to mention in the title. For a 40 year old person with 50k to invest with. 

I was thinking growth stocks give more returns but you have to sell the stocks to realize gains. And dividend stocks are more stable but you don't see much growth. And you have to have a lot of money in dividend stocks just to even try and live off the dividends."
2021-06-06 11:01:30,stocks,"There’s no one right answer I’m sorry.  I’ve done very well investing for about ten years now, and you need to be comfortable pursuing opportunities wherever they present themselves.  That comes down to understanding valuation and the markets themselves and fundamental concepts like competition and growth and macroeconomic forces and trends.  The only real answer is to buy good assets at great prices, or great assets at good prices, and that can take the form of any number of stock types.  If you want to pick individual stocks you have to decide that you love doing analysis, and if you decide that you don’t you are better off keeping your money broadly diversified in ETFs like SPY or taking “hot tips” from people you trust that love doing analysis themselves and have great track records over many years.  If you want to get started get the audiobook on iTunes “The Little Book of Value Investing” and I would follow it up with “The Little Book of Behavioral Investing”.  If you just mastered those two books you’ll know a lot more than most investors.  Then comes the fun part, hours and hours of analysis and searching for good candidate investments and then hours and hours more once you’ve honed in on a target investment.  Best of luck!"
2021-06-06 09:24:30,stocks,With dividend stocks you can put them in a DRIP and you also get the power of compounding over the years. But being 40 you might want some of both to realize higher gains but nothing is guaranteed. If it was me I would go 50/50 to add a bit of stability to your portfolio with some blue chip dividend stocks.Thats what i would do.Right now Canadian  energy stocks offer growth potential and pay dividends while you wait as some of them have still not fully recovered. This is not financial advice.
2021-06-06 10:17:25,stocks,"Growth vs Dividend debates are nonsense. All investing is value investing; you start buying stocks when they are undervalued and you start trimming stocks when they are overvalued.  The fact that a company is growing faster than others or the fact that a company is paying a bigger dividend than others are both in itself minor in the overall valuation process. 

I love dividends and glad when I find a great undervalued company that happens to pay a dividend; yet the key is not to buy a company just because it pays dividend or more importantly don’t buy regardless of price just because it pays dividends.

However; dividends become extremely important once an investor starts to make monthly withdraws to live off of, to the point that focusing a 100% on dividends is viable.

Annually growing free cash flow trumps annually growing dividend every time. Arguing that the dividend is a guaranteed return ignores the value that is created with all the other options a company has available to do with its Free Cash Flow that will also compound shareholder value going forward.

If you don’t have a researched price in mind that under which you should start acquiring a stock and a researched price in mind that over which you should start selling a stock, then you should stick to only investing in ETFs or Mutual Funds."

I took advantage of the blue light special last year and bought up a bunch of shares and some stocks that I was watching. That has paid off.

2021-06-06 09:52:47,stocks,"There are always lots of factors to consider. Is 50k your retirement money? Do you need the 50k later? Are you ok loosing it? Etc. 
Typically as you get older, your risk tolerance is lesser. You have less time to come back from a mistake. Hence they recommend that as you get older, lower your risk profile. 
If you’re a typical 40 yr old then you need a lower risk profile - global equity, bonds, dividend etfs. Just US equity is not low risk. 
If you want to be risky then look for 5-10 year growth. Renewable energy sector will continue to boom. AI sector, space, ARK type companies."
2021-06-06 14:59:50,stocks,Dividends can easily get 8%return. 8% 10 years is double plus whatever it actually gains also.  I would say dividend.

And you'd likely find XOM attractive. 

I avoided dividends alone in my 40s, but the economy was close to trash, so the picking was a challenge.  Took Ford from 2 to 12, and GE from 7 to 24.  There's almost always something oversold, but this economy is camouflaging it."
2021-06-06 13:47:52,stocks,"I will over-simplify, but dividends stocks grow slower over time because companies use the free cash to pay dividends to shareholders (while not using it to expand the business). And usually dividends stocks have already a big market cap and less room to grow. 

Growth stocks might grow faster because they have more business oportunities to ramp-up and they might use their free cash to buyback the stock and make its price go up, directly benefitting their shareholders."

If you believe in an investment, you’re not shaken if it ‘dips’ or goes down. Warren Buffett says- I buy a stock & assume the market will be closed for 10 years. This ^ is a long term mindset

SeekingAlpha. Follow the authors with a history of being right & right for the correct reasons. It shows u their picks & returns. Meaning look for an author who said XYZ is a great LT stock several years ago. Then look at the returns. I follow a ton of 10 bagger authors. I picked a 6 bagger last year, even wrote about it.

If it’s lower than 1, it’s undervalued, if your projections are right. If it’s higher than one, probably it’s currently expensive right now.

This is not just a set-in-stone. You have a project and calculate your numbers to know what the stock should be worth by its market cap, ignore the price per share, and how the company’s business performance will take you there."
2021-06-06 07:06:50,stocks,"If you are a long term investor then you should buy a small amount on a slightly down day, then continue to scale into the position on more down days. There’s always a chance you’re buying at the top, that’s the risk of investing."

2021-06-06 07:19:18,stocks,Sell some puts at a price you're comfortable owning the stock at. You can collect premium and if the price dips then you own the stock at a cheaper price.
2021-06-06 07:10:07,stocks,I think the classic DCA (dollar cost averaging) is a great method of adding to a position which you are comfortable holding. That way you don’t miss any major dip as you’re adding to every dip.
2021-06-06 12:38:23,stocks,Just buy it
2021-06-06 16:45:39,stocks,"I don't.

I focus on the quality of the company and their long-term growth potential. Once I find those quality companies, I then dollar-cost-average into them every time I get a new paycheck.

I don't care if I have to pay a premium price for the company right now as the best companies almost always trade at a premium in the modern market and I would rather pay a premium for the best quality companies with great long-term potential rather than a fairly priced company that is just average and doesn't have as great long-term potential. Over time, quality companies will grow into their valuation while probably continuing to trade at a premium.

And it is impossible to time the market so I'm not going to wait around until the quality company that I believe in for the long-term is more fairly priced because that could take a really long time and a lot of growth could happen in the meantime. If the stock goes down after I buy, great; now I can dollar-cost-average more into it for a cheaper price. If the stock goes up after I buy, great; now I'm making money with a quality long-term hold rather than just sitting on the sidelines with regret. If I waited for a fair price, I would have never been able to invest in great companies like Amazon."

Remove the emotion, remove the dividend yield, remove what the price has done recently, is it under priced, fairly priced or overpriced today? And don’t buy in or sell out all at once, always dollar cost average.

I use many factors in my evaluation; Free Cash Flow Yield, PEG ratio, Debt to Equity, etc; however I almost never start buying a stock if it doesn’t have a 4-5 Star rating from Morningstar and I almost always start selling a stock it’s rating drops to 2 Star.

I have two concerns with your response:
1) You should not be paying transaction fees when buying stocks, I would reevaluate your brokerage company.
2) Morningstar is a paid service for their full package of resources; yet the basic star ratings for stocks and funds are normally available within your brokerage company; if not I would reevaluate your brokerage company.

Through my rudimentary research, I don't think there are other companies out there capable of doing what Palantir can accomplish. Am I wrong? I truly believe the saying that data is the new oil and I have been following the lead of Cathie Wood and her ARK Invest team into snapping up shares of PLTR. What do my fellow Redditors think? Is PLTR a great long-term investment? 

I have read quite a few articles from naysayers who said PLTR is too expensive based on valuation and that their very extensive stock-based compensation will dilute shareholders value. But I disagree with all these articles on the premise that they basically just ignore the growth PLTR has been and will be enjoying and the technology and AI that underlie the business of PLTR. Various US government departments have been signing contracts with PLTR. They can't be wrong, can they?"
2021-06-06 06:03:59,stocks,"I think many people don’t really understand what Palantir actually does. Based on my previous interview experience at Palantir and talking with a few friends who previously worked there, Palantir at its core builds data analytical/visualization software. 

The biggest issue with Palantir is their product doesn’t scale. To onboard a new customer, Palantir needs to send engineers (also known as forward deploy engineers) to the client companie to integrate their data and maintain the software. Since each client’s requirment is different, forward deploy engineers often times have to build many customizations on top of their software"

“Growth vs value” is honestly a bit of a false dichotomy that gets thrown around as if your investment is based on one or another. A reasonable investment should involve projecting future growth in an attempt to derive the inherent value of the company today.

I understand the desire to invest in a company that you are aggressively bullish on. You may have unique insight in a company's business, or you may simply have a gut feeling. That's perfectly fine. However, I would only allocate a small fraction of my portfolio into those kind of investments. 

You mentioned you have limited resources to dive deep into stock valuations, reading financial statements, etc. There's a solution for this as well. A common strategy to protect yourself from ignorance is to simply invest in the market - broad market indexes like the S&P 500. There's tons of ETF's and mutual funds that can provide you with excellent diversification.

Whether or not Palantir becomes a $1T+ market cap company is beside the point. In my opinion, an entire portfolio that's dictated by these kind of investment decisions is more likely to underperform the market than it is to outperform in the long term."

Then there's the stock price. Not even taking future cash flows into consideration, most of these high growth stocks trade at P/E or P/S ratios far above what they should be.

Even under the scenario where they do become some of the biggest businesses in the world...let's say $1-2T dollar companies in 5-10 years, do you think they're still going to be priced at such high multiples? Absolutely not. Growth is not infinite and it becomes increasingly difficult as a company grows. Whether this bubble we're in pops or the company actually meets expectations and grows into its price, future growth won't be reflected in the share price as much as you think it will be.

I have been thinking about buying at the money SPY calls expiring in either a year or two and then selling calls against it as much as possible. My understanding is that the nearest to expiration options lose money the fastest because of IV. I believe this means with spy I can sell 3 a week. 

Wanted to know if this was a good strategy. If there is any risk I am not seeing other than SPY crashing. Also what kind of gains I could expect. Not sure if this would end up being no better than just holding spy in general. I am understanding options much better but struggle to estimate how much I can make off of one. 

Also is it worth it to buy vxx calls as insurance. This is an area I totally don’t understand but am interested in even if I never use it."

So when you buy SPY LEAPs you're paying maximum Theta. The value of those calls will decay. 

Meanwhile, you can only sell 1 call for every 1 call you purchased, because otherwise you'd be naked. 

My point is, you need to understand you're still staking a directional bet on SPY when you do this. If you're wrong, you lose money instead of making money."

2021-06-06 06:12:07,stocks,You're going to end up paying a ton for the LEAP and making pennies selling the calls. What if the second week you do this strategy the call you sell ends up being ITM? You will end up having to exercise your LEAP call to cover for it and as it has tons of extrinsic value remaining from theta you will end up with a net loss.
2021-06-06 03:15:54,stocks,Yeah you might average out just fine. Have you backtested the strategy against the last year yet? If you include the COVID crash you're pretty well-insulated against market volatility :D
2021-06-06 11:18:46,stocks,"Yeah this it right here ☝️. But there are two things to avoid this. You would have to sell your covered call above the break even price(strike+premium) which will likely be super high so your premium collecting from covered calls will really be nothing. 

But a better way to offset this is to buy a deep in the money leap with a high delta around .9. Your extrinsic value or time decay will also be fairly low. Obviously the issue here would be the capital needed to put up, but cheaper than buying 100 shares outright."
2021-06-06 11:55:21,stocks,My understanding is you never excerise a call before it’s expiration date for that exact reason. I always assumed I could just sell the LEAP to buy the call and then get back into my position. Realistically I’ll probably keep some extra money floating around that I can use to buy back the call if I need to

2021-06-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Covered Calls on x3 Sector ETFs - Aggressive Strategy Outline For the last few months I've been holding 100 shares of some of the  Direxion x3 leveraged sector ETFs and selling covered calls. The leveraged nature of them means they maintain a high IV which results in high premiums. 

Now x3 ETFs aren't without their risks. If a stock goes up 10% and then down 10% it will not be back to its original price due to the nature of percentages. This is commonly called volatility drag. A second risk is that due to the way the fund achieves the leverage, if the underlying index drops by 33% in one day the fund will drop to 0. Lastly, and probably most importantly, if you can't handle massive swings in price these probably aren't for you.

I'm assuming you already know the basics of selling options, if you don't I would checkout r/thetagang. I started this strategy by looking at the all time history of the 24 x3 ETFs I could find. Then I eliminated ones with too low of volume for this type of strategy such as MEXX. I looked for ones that were reasonably priced. Buying 100 shares of DPST would cost about 27k whereas buying 100 shares of YINN is only 1.8k. I selected sectors I believed in or that were particularly beaten down. I currently own LABU, SOXL, YINN, and DFEN with intensions of getting CURE and FAS at some point. 

If you held these and forgot about them for a year you could come back to x5 more money than you started with... or 10% of the money you started with. Now some people might like those odds, but I feel they can be made significantly better. Once you own 100 or more shares of one of these, select a 0.15 delta call for your desired time frame. I like to sell anywhere from 1 week to 1 month out depending on when the stock has options. On Friday June 4th I sold a LABU call for $95 with an expiration of June 11th. This is about a 1.5% gain on premium because LABU is trading around $62 right now. A lot of people think aggressive option selling involves moving your strike closer to the current price to get that incredibly high premium, but with leveraged funds the conservative .15 delta is going to give you better results in the long run. To use LABU as an example which is trading at $62, the strike I chose is $73. This leaves me 18% worth of capital appreciation potential. If this happens over the course of the one week I have the option out for I would be thrilled. However, that is not very likely and I will instead pocket the 1.5% premium gain. 

The premium gain is more than enough to offset volatility drag and over time will create a cushion in case there is a crash/large correction. If the underlying index drops 20% over a month you can expect the leveraged fund to be slashed in half. You need to be able to handle these losses. Keep selling calls, track how much of a cushion your premium has given you. This is not a strategy to do with your entire retirement fund. If any of the underlying's you own drop 50% or more don't panic sell, don't stop selling calls because the strike is below your average cost, just buy more. **If you're willing to bet your life savings on the stock market going up over the long run, you should be able to have the same conviction in leveraged funds with a portion of your account**. 

Because I know it will be brought up, no this is not the wheel and you should not be wheeling these. Selling puts on these funds closes off your access to the 18% appreciation gains. With the calls I'm selling you have high risk and high reward. With CSPs you have high risk and a very minimal reward, even if it's a conservative strike.

If your shares get called away, use that as a moment to reevaluate. Do you still believe in the sector? Does it still have a lot of potential? As an example, NAIL scares me to death. If housing prices start to drop back down for any reason that one is going to nosedive into the ground as it has done multiple other times. If my shares got called away it means the underlying went on a strong rally and I have made a lot of money off of it. I would wait at least a week or two and see what happened to all of that momentum. Maybe it kept climbing, who cares, you already won. If I have evaluated it again and decided it is still a good stock to be in, I will simply rebuy the 100 shares on the next decent sized red day. It is more likely that I will move on to another one though because it is unlikely that the one I just sold after a rally is still the best of the 24. 

Thank you for reading, I encourage you to ask questions. If you want to critique it please be as specific as possible and provide outside sources for any claims that contradict anything I've said that you believe to be wrong. 

TLDR: If you're not willing to read a post this short stay away from x3 ETFs even though they are great."
2021-06-06 02:56:56,stocks,What options strategy would you recommend for index etfs like UPRO and TQQQ?

2021-06-06 10:12:41,stocks,TQQQ is one of these so you would do exactly this. I think UPRO is only x2 leveraged so it’s the same idea just less volatile.
2021-06-06 10:45:34,stocks,"They're both x3, my question was does this also work with such etfs since they're not sector etfs (for which you wrote this guide), but rather index etfs. Sectors are a lot more volatile so I thought this might make a difference. But if I understand you correctly it works for both then."

What apps should I be using to buy stocks? (I was thinking of robinhood but the whole debacle I decided it was untrustworthy)

What's commission fees? (I heared that in some apps there's no such thing)

2021-06-06 19:27:32,stocks,"I'd recommend using Robinhood to start. If you're not an active trader you don't need anything fancy yet. Get to know how buying and selling works, different types of orders ECT...

And if you're not actively trading just get an ETF and keep adding shares until you know what you want. Lots to choose from, different sectors different risk levels ECT. Gives you more exposure with less risk. 

It's all risk reward. Focusing your money into a few bigger risk higher growth equities will grow wealth faster. More diversification will protect your money. All depends on what you're looking for and it will take a while for you to decide what your risk tolerance is.

Best of luck to you and great job getting started young."

1. Seeing as you are not a US-resident, be aware of the 30% dividend witholding tax for all non US-residents investing in US stocks. To get around this, people will buy an Ireland-domiciled fund that tracks the same index. You'd still be hit with 15% dividend witholding tax, but you'll have to take what you can. Ireland has a tax treaty with the US to have this rate. Example, VOO is Vanguard S&P 500 ETF domiciled in the US. Buy VUSD instead, it's the same Vanguard S&P 500 ETF but domiciled in Ireland.
2. Buy a fund with an 'Accumulating' dividend distribution if you want to have a more hands-off approach. Dividends are automatically reinvested into the fund. 'Distributing' funds channel the dividends back to you in cash and you'll have to manually reinvest them."

Asked whether the two companies would be covered by the proposal, Yellen said: ""It will include large profitable firms and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition.""

The joint statement by G7 finance ministers earlier on Saturday said it would tackle tax avoidance by ""the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises"".

Amazon has lower profit margins than most other tech companies, and European countries had been concerned it would escape extra taxation under initial U.S. proposals to the G7.'

2021-06-06 02:57:27,stocks,"nope! I’m inactive on Instagram and a lot of my friends have deleted their accounts, including my younger brother. Instagram seems to be dying out for my age group, this is based on my social circles but I’ve seen similar sentiments in mass being voiced on other platforms like TikTok (ppl not liking the algorithms, superficial content). 

Tiktok will be surpassing Instagram for gen z users... not saying they cannot exist in tandem with eachother. However, in my last course of my commerce degree I learned that aside from just the Instagram aspect, gen z is ALSO spending significantly way more hours on the clock app than on Facebook.

To me this indicates that trends are changing, and new and more innovative apps are clawing away at social media usage share for the upcoming generations (gen z and alpha). 

Like for example, if Facebook is planning to incorporate e-commerce into Instagram, how impactful will that be when many of us our migrating to other apps and shop from tons of other sites anyways?

Ad revenue is one thing (highlighting this stream bc it’s a crucial part of their business model), but if they don’t make strategic acquisitions and/or develop their more notable platforms to better address younger users, I could see the company losing steam in the long term. 

I would agree though that WhatsApp has a promising value prop and user base, especially in international communication spaces. I do have a couple channels from conferences and a family group chat, especially useful for ppl w diff phone types.

As mentioned, I have a commerce degree. I know that Facebook has more business lines than ~just Facebook~, but my comment was more directed to the whole “Gen-Z” aspect of that person’s comment, and I stand by my opinion that in many of their major business lines Facebook is losing some of their younger users."

That's not entirely true. The tax reforms mean tax will be paid where the service is provided, not just where your HQ is. Meaning there would be no tax incentive for a company to base there HQ in Ireland, even if the corp-tax rate is lower, they will just pay a top up tariff somewhere else. Ireland estimates this could cost them €2 billion a year.

And lets be honest here, our government has been bought by corporations and Wallstreet for a very long time. There’s nothing moral or fair about one of the wealthiest companies in the world, Amazon, paying a smaller percent in taxes than middle class America.  The tax system is broken.  Nobody in power will fix it because they’re all dirty. 

I guess you’re also good with companies moving jobs to third world countries where they can pay taxes to China and India and employee workers there. Did you ever consider what a global tax means? It means more jobs here in America! If tax havens and cheap labor no longer exist, the incentive to move jobs over seas is gone. More Americans employed making more money means more money in your pocket.

Imagine going to high school or middle school & everyone is constantly using slang or weird catphrases that you’re not in the loop about & are always several months late to. 

I don’t see that social impact on the youngins from reels. Like even the music industry is heavily influenced by tiktok. Show me 5 songs that exploded in popularity due to reels, similarly to those from tiktok (ex: the backyardigans castaway song hitting the charts)

For example, cutting the spending in youth centres/ activities accross the Uk, cutting the spending on NHS, employing subcontractors for works that are not necesary or over paying for works (very common). These are just a few off the top of my head. 

My main point is that government doesnt spend the money efficiently so why should they get more of it for nothing?

2021-06-06 07:33:06,stocks,"I would love to get more Google.    They have some incredibly valuable assets yet to be fully monetized. Plus adding new ones.

So for example Google has shared they now have over 150 million active users with Google Classroom.   

But the share price is at all time highs.  Up over 40% so far this year.    There is this mental thing with buying something that is at an all time high.

Google looks to be finally looking at monetizing some of these assets.  Take Google Photos.  They have finally ended the unlimited.  Which had to be a material expense when you consider there is over 1 billion active user.   Turning it into a revenue stream with Google Cloud.   So double whammy good.  Lose and expense and gain new revenues.

One that I think they will do in not too long is stop the ad blocking with YouTube.    YouTube TV it is not possible to block ads.    Google has the technology to end blocking of ads.   It is just a matter of time until Google uses.  Like it was only a matter of time until they ended the unlimited storage with Photos.

I would expect Google to do it gradually.  When they do it will drive more to YouTube Premium."

2021-06-06 04:20:54,stocks,"I don’t understand how anyone can think that Ford will grow as a result of electrification. Every EV sale they make will cannibalize one of their ICE sales. They don’t magically make more money if a customer switches to EV. If anything Ford will lose money because they now have to divert funds into battery research and manufacturing. 

Furthermore there is no way Ford can keep up with demand for the Lightning. It uses too many batteries (4x as many as a Tesla) and Biden’s EV subsidies are going to make it very attractive from a price standpoint. People will stop buying any trucks at all while waiting for Lightning supply to catch up. Full Osborne effect. Fewer sales means that Ford will have less money to pivot their product lines to electrical. 

The stock price is being artificially propped up by hype and will come back down next year once the supply issues reveal themselves in Ford’s quarterly results."

1. As the other commenter said below - they're potentially adding customers that would normally have chosen a Tesla or Prius vs a Ford but now will see an electric ford as a better option
2. They've already spent money on battery research and manufacturing and are planning on doing it in-house
3. I don't think 'people will stop buying trucks waiting for the lightning'  is a realistic scenario. The current f150 is the most popular vehicle in america they will still sell tons of them. 
4. Ford's p/e is still under 20 and market cap is still less than it was in 2014. Like I said, room to grow. It's not hyped at all compared to tesla. 
5. As an established car maker ford is more likely to actually hit their manufacturing target and deadlines."

Similar to Visa/Mastercard business models where they exert their fee on a ton of transaction volume. And yes, it can easily be translated to WhatsApp - which will be huge in unstable currency countries where FB stablecoin could easily be the most trusted currency/store of value. Silvergate will profit off that dynamic as well."
2021-06-06 07:41:09,stocks,Facebook is already a large core holding of mine. Diem is not a public company (yet). Facebook is almost a 1 trillion dollar market cap company while Silvergate is only a 3 billion dollar company. If an investor is seeking alpha then Silvergate is the play because its market cap lends itself to being able to double many more times than Facebook.

Is it easier for a stock or security to tank in price than to grow, or is this just some weird artifact of math that is confusing my brain?"

2021-06-06 06:21:06,stocks,"The answers here are at best misleading. The mathematical models for the average motion of the stock price tend to think of the likelihood to an increase or drop in price in terms of logarithmic increments relative to your initial price. What this comes down to is that on average for some unknown stock a 200% growth is equally unlikely as a 50% decrease. Now of course there are possible refinements to this idea. If you start talking about companies that have market caps the same order of magnitude as some countries, some types of events are ruled out just because there isn’t enough money in the world. Then you can also account for inflation, or variable volatility and so forth. So this is definitely not the whole picture. However, the core concept upon which you can then build refinements is indeed a 5x increase is as unlikely as a drop to 0.2 decrease."

2021-06-05 23:52:30,stocks,"Great explanation. One quick correction - thats not how market caps / buying work with price movement. If the circulating volume is low (order books are shallow) then a rise in market cap could happen pretty quickly with far less capital inflow. Look into the concept of a “bonding curve.” Its important to understand that price movement is a direct function of the depth of the order book (which is linked to volume).

The rest of what you said is great though and well explained."
2021-06-05 20:18:44,stocks,Well said
2021-06-05 21:35:08,stocks,Never understood this. Great explanation. Thanks
2021-06-06 03:21:42,stocks,"Your entire premise is wrong though. Sure total amount of dollars it takes to move the price matters. For example, for extremely large market cap companies such as Apple you can almost literally rule out a 10x event in the next 2 years, while a drop by a factor of 10 is still in theory possible. So the point you are making starts getting some importance at for extremely rare events for large companies. 

However, this is not at all the most important process. In mathematical models the stock price is modeled as a random walk in logarithmic space. For an average company where we know nothing about, a 50% decrease is equally unlikely as a 200% increase, if we do not account for inflation."

2021-06-06 14:41:43,stocks,Stock defenestration.
2021-06-06 02:23:05,stocks,"Also, order books are not symmetric.

If there are very few asks and lots of bids on the margin, then it can be very cheap to move the price upwards until you find the level where ask volume is higher. Whereas lowering the price would be more expensive. And vice versa.

In terms of energy, the order book volume can be seen as potential energy, whereas actual Price x Volume is the money that actually moved (kinetic energy).

And finally, there is only one more thing: manipulation. If you buy and sell to some other entity you control or with whom you conspire, then moving the price is basically free, since you're not actually interacting with the market. Within the bid-ask spread this is easy to do. And since market players on the margin will respond to price movements, it's a free way to influence momentum."
2021-06-06 00:47:57,stocks,"Appreciate the correction, and you’re absolutely right.  It wouldn’t really take the full amount to move the stock up or down, but the conclusion I was trying to draw is that with a balanced book it’s more dollars inflow to move the stock up x% than it is outflow to move the stock down 1/x% amount.   

It’s all dependent on what the books are like of course, but it’s mathematically a fact for an abstract ideal market just due to the way percentage math works, and I believe it applies in many real life scenarios as well, although never perfectly and it’s not a model I’d write a quant around."
2021-06-06 10:18:16,stocks,"I think we’re agreeing… there’s no conclusion drawn aside from that mathematically in a hypothetical balanced market it takes more dollars to go up 300% than down 75%, or up 200% vs down 50%.  It’s not a suitable model for a real market, although it does represent a limit of sorts."
2021-06-05 20:54:13,stocks,"If it's not happening instantaneously, but over some interval, do you think the numbers would play a psychological role? like, as one is watching a $1 stock as it raises to $4 the percentage number will be growing faster per unit time, potentially leading to more fomo? Likewise, a 4 dollar stock lowering to $1 will have lower % number per unit time maybe leading to less panic selling than respective fomo on the other end?

Not related to my initial question just a thought."

The mid price is now higher but the last traded price is still the same. If someone places another offer at $1, the next last traded price

Dividends are a fantastic long term growth option, and in many cases, if done right, can be a sole passive income source. 

Go to r/dividends and you'll see a ton of posters showing off their $50,000+ yearly dividend income. 

I'm not saying growth stocks don't have a place in someone's portfolio. If you're young, and building a portfolio, growth stocks can help with that, but I believe that the ultimate goal should be dividends. 

Of course, that's my opinion. And not everyone has, or should have the same train of thought, it takes all kinds to make the world go round. But I'd certainly like to hear your opinion."

2021-06-05 21:18:33,stocks,"Those few month old accounts just keep coming.

I am going to be blunt, investors that came this year from ''short squeeze'' craze needs to read through investopedia, basic terms, definitions, just the basics itself.

Only then we can have a start at proper conversation. If you do decide to put the hours in, you will start to see what is everyone here talking about.

Ability to do your own DD is also a basic necessity, though i honestly gave up on this years traders about that. What people mostly do is take each others word for it, they read a convoluted post with 50 awards, all comments agree on it, read like 10 of these and everyone is sold on it.

Then they go to other sub reddits and tell others that this is respectable place with great DD made by veterans, when its clearly never ever been made by veterans to begin with, the actual veterans sometimes come in there and get bashed as hedge fund sell outs. On top of that check the reaction towards AMC run and their attitude towards r/wallstreetbets and you will clearly see where the bad taste comes from.

Your inability to conduct a DD and belief that it comes from '' some very educated individuals that make a lot of excellent points'' is what makes it so cult like.

On market you should be able to understand every term used and recite the definitions of it, you should understand how, when and why all the market forces are working as they are, if you are lucky you should have historical experience with all of this, hard to ask for that last one. Don't just believe that someone has properly done all the work for you, take your own dozens of hours, make your own paperwork and due dilligence.

I been asking a lot of people what is their ability and how many years of experience making DD they have, how well they can analyse DD others have made, i have never gotten satisfying answer. There is this sub reddit r/pennystocks, which is stock market version of gambling all your salary on lottery tickets. Why i mention them ? Its because even there people are miles ahead on understanding and being able to conduct their own DD, and its a damn shame to be below them.

It will all run its course, not the first time all these things happen. Good luck in future."

2021-06-05 21:33:36,stocks,"I agree with what you are saying. One thing that came to my mind was really simple really, people there don’t want to be wrong, that’s it, many there i know is not even familiar with the idea of risk versus reward, and why you want to value stock at a certain price to buy. People screaming all markets are overvalued are short sighted at best and just about everything else at worst. Investing is always a bet, actually doing anything is a bet, so the fact that i see people in there trying to diversify with 11 different etfs is just mind-boggling to me. When i started i joined it because well, it sounded legit, dumbed it 1 month later after learning through the sidebar(this is actually the only good content they have, really recommended for new investors), wsb pre gme squeeze was THE place for DDs and good infos, if ones can get their head out of their ass and separate between playful/dumb/meme and actual good info."

To this date, i have not seen DD on this sub that comes anywhere near as good as the DD done on the big ""meme"" stock. If you think about it as as a stock, look at trends, look at fundementals, down to basic supply and demand, and do your research, it really all makes sense. Same with if you look at company innovation and potential behind the innovation.

If you want, you can ask questions about why people have faith in the stock, related or not to a squeeze, and ill do my best to provide a good and well founded answer. That or you can just call everyone a nut and ignore it.

Alternatively, you can provide solid evidence as to why you think it is a bad investment. Id be happy to read some DD that goes contrary to my current opinions"

The people who invest with 11 different ETF have no reason to actually hang out in investing reddits and other places. They are just there because of the insecurity and trying to convice as many people as they can to join in on investing in the entire market.

Imagine devoting yourself to 40 year plan, giving up entire control over everything, just investing in entire market every single month sacrificing part of their salary for the rest of their lives. Can they really mentally afford to be wrong ? This is why there are such a hot takes, everything except what they are doing counts as gambling.

One guy came to talk about his 5 year old portfolio, picked out around 10 stocks, 9 of them pretty average nothing special, one of them was Nvidia, which of course over performed like mad and not only beat the market with having it in, but pretty much destroyed it performance wise. The reception was extremely salty.

Of course same week discussion with ''hey guys i bought stocks at top and sold at bottom, but let me tell you now i am fully in ETF and i give the same advice to others'' and everyone is cheering.

Wallstreetbets before ''short squeeze'' craze was definitely place to mine some gems, if you are good at mining the information presented. Sadly now its all a cult but in opposite direction from ETF cult. Even if a good post happens there, i am not likely to notice it in all that noise."

2021-06-06 00:17:19,stocks,He’s likely not talking about the quality of the stock or whether it’s a bad investment. People don’t think r/gme is nutty because of their opinion about an investment

2021-06-06 06:34:49,stocks,"Why not ? Long term value got nothing on growth stocks, and before many realized value was already over pumped, but tech is getting beating after beating. Technically its time to sell value you had and buy tech that took a beating."
2021-06-06 15:22:57,stocks,"Yeah I've fucked up I started trading a little over a year ago but I've gotten better and will keep getting better. Idk what specific picks you're even talking about though. If you're mentioning blackberry yeah I bought it for the squeeze and got out quick. I ended up with a good profit but probably not the best decision but that's hardly something something to bag me on since I didn't even lose money. And I don't consider wallstreetbets a good forum to go to either I've just been on recently to see what they're saying about the squeezes going on recently. Also I'm not sure about my next bets but my current holdings have don'e well so far. Next ones I'm thinking of are TIGR, ASO, DKS but nothing is a guarantee. Other ones I'm looking for entries to add more to my position are RBLX, NVDA, SE and MRVI"

2021-06-05 22:24:48,stocks,The price increase is due to FTD options on a T-21 and T-35 cycle due to hedge fund manipulation not due to hype in fact all meme stocks follow this cycle because hedge funds have been illegally naked shorting these stocks and have been hiding these naked shorts in deep Itm call options that then become FTD...this is why the dtcc has been updating many rules and regulations

2021-06-06 01:30:14,stocks,"But the thing is that it has been academically researched that ETFs are generally the way to go. The French-Fama 5 factors are heavily researched and shown to have had a big indicator of alpha no matter the time period or which country. Over 20-30 years the best way to accumulate capital are ETFs that capture these 5 factors. Not saying stock picking is bad, it's fun and it helps you learn more about the world and you CAN beat the market often. But for risk-reward, ETFs capturing the 5 factors are the way to go. Low-ish risk and moderate to high reward.

And regarding the guy who picked 10 stocks with 9 of them having average returns. I think that is an example of a good portfolio tbh. It's not very smart to base your decisions purely on outcome. Sometimes you make the right decision but the outcome is bad, or you make the wrong decision and the outcome is good. Don't mean you should pick the wrong decision the next time. Also assuming you mean average returns as 3-4% annually, having 9 stocks return that while one mooning would still result in a portfolio that massively beat the market.

2021-06-06 04:02:32,stocks,"Yea I never said Etfs are bad, but look at it this way, what is your purpose for joining the market? Some treat it purely as the only channel to store wealth, but as for me stock market is part of my cashflow. I do my investing not only in stocks, there are arts, real estates, private equity, so on. I 100% do tell people who shows no interest in learning the market to just all in on etfs, yes lowish risk to moderate reward, which is great. However, we ảre specifically talking about a place to learn about investing, and i mentioned r/bogleheads , because r/investing is too focused and proud of etfs. You do have to remember that etfs do have survival bias first for example, many etfs busted too. I do etfs too, but it’s more so I’m looking at promising sectors for example, and many times I’m not confident on me choosing the right stocks that others think is good and put money in. I’m not from the US however, in my country i put money where I think I have an advantage in, and I’ll tell you this, there are ways to mitigate risk and keeping the same reward if you look beyond the surface, there will be winners and losers, coming up with your own strategy and not getting complacent is how you actually manage your risk, stocks are just 1 part of a portfolio, I actually would rather market going bear or sideways than bull, because the money to be made during that period can be crazy, and these kind of markets will show why having knowledge profits."

You're the one making the argument that it's more than just a meme stock, so let's hear what your support is.

But to answer your question, yes, if a stock is mentioned enough online, it can become a meme.

2021-06-06 06:41:21,stocks,It talks mostly about stocks because the sub reddit consists of ETF cultists and novices that only care about stocks. Not because other investing renevues are so hard to talk about.
2021-06-06 11:59:25,stocks,"Let me rephrase it, i personally think r/investing is the same as what is called a “value trap”, it looks okay, it seems cheap, decent content.

I never said r/investing is like a bad sub or anything, I’m just saying, if you look for a place with discussion or ideas, it is not the right place. I agree with you about what the sub bring to the table, however, the question was finding a place of discussing investing and methodology, so I highly suggest people who want to look deep into investing to think r/investing is a good place. if the question was to find a place for newbie to start and ask question, i guess yea r/investing is good enough, but if one want to develop and learn from different perspective of investing and lookbfor improvement tips, stay away from there, complacent kills competitiveness."

I don't know exactly how to do it, others with more experience have in the past and pinpointed the share price at around $600 if gamestop was valued along with other E-commerce based companies in a related market. That's why I ask, but so far I've only gotten opinions."
2021-06-06 12:46:28,stocks,Okay in that case I can't really argue with you because in this it becomes a subjective thing. So fair enough!

2021-06-05 22:07:47,stocks,A short squeeze is one thing but that has little to do with the fundamentals of GameStop as a company.
2021-06-05 22:06:33,stocks,"I am not a professional analyst who knows how to calculate the a stock price's value, although if you look around you will see that professional analysts all have different opinions of every company on the planet and valuations can vary widely based on a number of assumptions.  

I get the concept behind ""valuing it as an e-commerce or technology company"", but if you believe that, you're paying a premium for something that may not ever happen with any level of success.

Now I know there is always future growth expectation built into any company's stock price (which is why we see companies with crazy P/E ratios) but those are typically not companies who have yet to fully pivot into a new business model."

If this was a new company with a relatively new leader and no prior experience to building and transitioning a company to a new model, then sure, the business is overvalued. But this is someone that built a multibillion dollar business to combat a saturated market dominated by Amazon and other pet store giants. In other words, people are betting on him to revive this company and make it the top gaming company. Well just have to wait and see what he's capable of."
2021-06-06 09:40:05,stocks,"Big difference betting on a company’s growth and innovation within an existing business model vs. betting on a company to successfully pivot their business model. 

Normally I would say it’s a risk/reward payoff but in this case GME is already priced like this new business model will be successful, so there is little room for new investors to make money compared to the risk they are taking. Not saying it’s impossible of course, but it’s not a great bet (at the current price)."
2021-06-05 22:33:29,stocks,"That is factually correct. But there’s a lot more complexity behind the movement of the price. 

Yes, of course the price is going to be a mutually agreed upon price between the buyer and seller.  That’s kind of obvious.

But you’re overlooking WHY someone would buy for $X.  That’s where the complexity is."
2021-06-06 11:05:48,stocks,No it’s priced like it was naked shorted. You got an excuse for everything
2021-06-06 12:03:25,stocks,"Correct, that is the reason people are speculating and the price is rising, they are expecting a payoff from a short squeeze. Has nothing to do with the future of the company itself."
2021-06-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Banking with stock brokers? Can anyone give advice or have experience with banking with a stock broker like Sofi? What I'm hesitant to do is change banks and not have a separate account that does not have a risk of losing principal but gains some interest. What I'm trying to do is get my money in one place. I currently have money scattered across Wealthfront, robinhood, and my bank."
2021-06-05 21:23:13,stocks,"My primary bank if Bank of America and I use their brokerage, Merrill Edge. They have separate websites and function as different institutions, but transferring money between the two is streamlined and I can see my assets from both in the same place.

The holdings in my Merrill Edge Accounts count towards Bank of America rewards tiers, so it is easy to keep bank accounts free without direct deposit and all that.

Bank of America has been ideal for me, because I travel frequently and extensively. There are branches or ATMs in most major cities in the US.

&#x200B;

My secondary brokerage is Charles Schwab. I use it to mainly buy Schwab ETFs. You can open a Schwab FDIC insured checking account as well. You view both through the same website and can instantly transfer money between the two. They, of course, do not have physical branches. I mainly use Bank of America for my main banking account.

You can deposit check's into the charles schwab account via app/photo, mail-in, or transfer funds from other external accounts. This would work for most people, but you don't have access to a branch if you ever need it.

They will pay for ATM fees for you to use outside ATMs. A few perks is that includes ATMs out of country and they do not charge foreign transaction fees."
2021-06-05 21:40:09,stocks,Yeah customer service is big for me. I lean away from robinhood because it would be nice to have bank features if ever needed like auto loans or mortgages.
2021-06-05 21:36:26,stocks,Thank you for the information. I was looking at Charles Schwab because they now own TD Ameritrade. I have seen good reviews for them so that was the direction I was leaning. Bank of America doesn't have a branch where I live so that part wouldn't do me much good. But I haven't looked into them that much either.
2021-06-05 21:43:19,stocks,"I looked on robinhood website but don't see features my bank currently has like budgets, cash flow, net worth, ect. Does robinhood offer anything like that with their checking currently?"
2021-06-05 22:11:31,stocks,"Schwab is worth considering. It works just as a traditional bank account would. I only use their checking account as a secondary checking account, but it seems to work.

One thing I will add here is Schwab bank is an FDIC-insured member bank. Schwab bank is the actual FDIC member bank for that checking account.

This is different from many of these new internet accounts. They call themselves ""cash management accounts.""  What you should know is that RobinHood or Sofi are not actual FDIC member banks. They are working with outside banks that are. They move your money into that bank (or multiple banks) and they are an intermediary between you and them. When the money is being moved, for a brief period it is actually no under SIPC protection or FDIC protection. I'm a little more skeptical on this for the long-term.

Sofi and Robinhood are trying to be the best of both worlds. They want to be an investing account and bank account in one and simplify the user experience, but they are making the behind the scenes more complex and moving ""sweeping"" money into multiple places on your behalf.

My problem is what happens when we go through periods of bank closures/failures again or Sofi/RH falls a part.  When I move money into a FDIC insured account, I know what it is, where it is, how it is insured and have all the information I need should there be a bank failure of that bank.

With Schwab on their one website you have 2 accounts, checking and brokerage. They are actually different Schwab institutions, the FDIC insured Schwab Bank, and the SIPC protected Schwab brokerage account. You move money between the two accounts yourself, but they let you do that quickly and seamless. You know where your money is at all times between the accounts and what is insuring/protecting it... FDIC or SIPC.

The Schwab checking account is a full checking account, so you get checks and you can send large amounts of money in the future through wire transfers.

I just haven't honestly heard much good about its brokerage. They only have about $250 billion assets under management (AUM), which is actually small.

Merrill Lynch/Edge is close to $3 Trillion in AUM.

Charles Schwab has $4 Trillion in AUM.

TD Ameritrade has $1.3 Trillion in AUM.

Fidelity has $4.9 Trillion in AUM.

(Robinhood is $20 billion in AUM and; Betterment is $20 billion; Acorns $3 billion, Sofi is still below $1 billion in AUM) These new social media based investment options just don't managed that much. It might be good when you're starting out and starting small, but the larger platforms are going to have more resources and more options."

Non registered account. Can claim capital loss against gains. Good for some risk.

If you start looking into US stocks that have a higher dividend, 2+ % you should hold those in your RRSP over a margin, even if you are not getting much benefit from the RRSP contribution, as not being hit with the 15% tax, and that compounding over the years, is a great benefit still."

2021-06-05 23:31:22,stocks,"Even in the lowest bracket, you'll typically want to do registered accounts first. So TFSA, RRSP then finally non registered.
Apple stock I'd most likely keep in my TFSA due to growth.
TD stock suitable in any account as a blue chip.

US ETF's totally depends. I have VTI and VXUS in my RRSP.
Because I want currency diversification and to collect the full dividend. As well as the lower fee and they are core longterm holdings for me. Where as a growth ETF such as SMH, QQQJ, VTWO are better suited in a TFSA even with a small dividend. 

Honestly though if TFSA is your primary you want diversification and growth before worrying about taxation.
So either an all in 1 fund such as XEQT, VGRO.
Or a bundle of ETF'S. 
OR ETF'S and Canadian market in bluechips.

If you know of the best Canadian based ETF's focusing on emerging/frontier marktes, please let me know. I am only interested in Asia (China, Vietnam, India, Indonesia) not Japan, not South Korea, and I am also interested in Russia (but not Europe). I want Africa as well. Given that information, it will be hard to not get involved with US ETF's. And since I hold a lot of ZGRO (I already have the ZEM within it) but it's not enough for me. I want more emerging markets as ZGRO is really heavy on North America (which interests me less, although I realize NA can't really be ignored/avoided). I still want to focus on emerging markets. And yes I am going to get individual REIT holdings rather than the ETF, so I can focus on residentials, and I hold 20% bonds in my ZGRO. I have Questrade as well as WealtheSimple Trade. I have both US and CDN in QT and CDN in WS Trade."
2021-06-06 07:37:16,stocks,"You control the timing of when you withdraw, so you have a ton of years to earn tax free gains, and dividends that will compound. So the RRSP is still better then margin or non tax account. TFSA > RRSP > Margin (RRSP can be equal to or better if you are in high tax rates)

You should look to your TFSA first, your thinking is correct. The point being be careful what you invest in. Put growth stocks (Apple is a growth stock) and growth EFTs, and Canadian dividend companies or Canadian dividend ETFs in the TFAs. That way you avoid much of the dividend withholding tax. 

Good news on that, most of the Canadian top companies have pretty good dividends."

2021-06-06 00:00:00,stocks,Anyone worked for a Broker? Educated in Finance? Interesting Question for you I have always wondered.. When a trader pressing to sell short a stock say 10 shares for example.. instantly you get a -10 on your screen and if its decent volume u get filled right at the market price easy.. but is their actually a process or is this all digital? Like does the broker ACTUALLY borrow shares and start transferring them around  or is it a automated process that just when you cover you buy back at hopefully a lower price and that's it you are done and the broker does no work... because it seems like a pain in the A$$ if they actually have to locate shares and send them to you to borrow seems weird...
2021-06-06 05:57:13,stocks,"Depends on the firm. Everywhere I’ve worked (the BBBs, you’d recognize them) it’s been *mostly* automated.

The basics is that there’s a huge “house” account. When someone buys a share stock, the firm will grab a share of that stock, put it in the house account, and then “assign” it to whoever bought it. 

The house account is really concerned with net positions. It’ll shuffle around which shares are assigned to who, but its primary focus is to always have the right *totals* for each type of position.

If the house account doesn’t have any of the shares you’re looking to short, that’s when things get tricky and usually you have to get the desk to hunt it down. They’ll usually complain or have a minimum order amount because doing it this way really eats into the profits. Usually they’ll just say no unless it’s at least $ 1-5 million.  It’s much easier to short stocks that are already in inventory"
2021-06-06 11:55:56,stocks,"Yeah sure, my broker said the shares can't be located tho."
2021-06-06 07:02:27,stocks,"These days its all pretty digital, when you short sell, they don't specifically look at the exact share and sell it.

For example 1 mil shares are in share lending program, that means we can give shorters 1 mil shares to short. If you lend your shares, you don't specifically directly land your shares, otherwise when you want to sell your stock you owned, you don't get notification ''David borrowed your share, should we ask him back for it ? lets wait until his answer'', you sell it instantly and number of shares that can be shorted decreases.

Its all pretty automatic and streamlined.

''Naked shorting is the illegal practice of short selling shares that have not been affirmatively determined to exist. ''

We don't actually ever look do they exist or not, we know there is 1 mil shares in pool and like half a mil shorting the stock, everything is fine.

Shares get taken and return to always moving pool of shares that can be short selled.

You could argue all the times there was no illegal short selling, and nobody has ever been accused or convicted of it, broker has determined that shares that are being short selled does exist, except for one instance.

That instance was GME before January mess, 140% of float was short selled, anyway you look at it the whole system has participated in naked short selling, 40% of the shares short selled are not even in the fucking float, that is the only reason why so many people went into GME play half a year ago. If the stock price would happen to rise, it would make quite huge mess as if you started buying up float, it was already impossible for them all to cover at the same time without a mess, and a mess it did made. Short sellers lost 70 bils in their arrogance. I mean every single person that looked at numbers asked what the fuck is going on, this can't be real can it ? But one could argue they simply lost money due to rapid price increase that just kept increasing, that they never had a problem to actually cover those shares and system was working fine.

That is most probably the only clear example where the shares obviously affirmatevilely doesn't fucking exist, not that many to short. Sadly nobody went to court or jail for that. The system is pretty weird to be honest.

Otherwise when 10 - 20% of the float is being shorted, good luck making a naked shorting case, some of these stocks anyone can easely borrow million shares to short and the shares available to short and the ones that are shorted affirmatevilely does exist.

Gotta say on reddit half the people using term ''naked shorts'' have never read the definition of it. Also a nice detail is that almost every brokerage automatically enlists your shares to be able to be shorted, that means a lot of shares to short are available for the ones that wishes to do it."
2021-06-06 07:25:31,stocks,"The comment warrants 2nd part.

Brokerages are probably greedy, since short selling nets them a lot of profits, so have you heard about how airlines sell more seats on the plane that there actually are ? Because nobody will show up.

I speculate same things happen with brokers, they are lending more shares than they should, which would make it kinda naked, but since everything is digital it was never known to cause any problems, even now it has never known to cause any problems. And there is probably nobody even checking that up in first place, all the agencies are underfunded after all.

We have seen a brokers do a lot more crap than that, but sadly the system itself works without a hitch, you could lend people way too many shares, but what is the worst that is going to happen ? Even in January example there was always like 50 mil shares to buy and cover. All of the problems that we ever had this year was actually only because of the stock prices and some sides not being capable of paying off their bets and margins.

So yeah i am indicating that shorting is not exact, its highly unregulated, and nothing will change because this part isn't causing anyone problems, the system functions just fine. Not good news for some stock prices for sure.

If we want more out of this topic, we would definitely need to get inside of how brokerages are run and how do we control and regulate them."

It’s actually been surprising stable, consistently trading between $19 - $21 for the duration of its existence. It’s also had remarkably low volume (less than 200,000 per day).

When it comes to capital gains taxes, how would it work in this scenario? I'm trying to make sure I'm right before I explain this to my friend: 

Let's say I buy one whole share of Company A for $100 per share. The stock price goes up to $200 per share. I decide to sell $100 worth of the stock (so 0.5 shares). What would I be paying taxes on? Would I pay no taxes since I put in $100 and then sold enough to get back that $100 and technically made ""no profit or loss""? 

OR would I have to compare the price of 0.5 shares when I first bought the stock ($50) to the price of 0.5 shares now ($100), which would mean I made a $50 profit and should therefore get taxed on that?

I'm a noob, and I only go off basic numbers, but it seems to me that Coinbase is a great bet as a company.  Down 33% since opening and has a decent revenue stream.  With ETH going to proof of stake, Coinbase can make truckloads off of stake-mining while continuing to charge an arm and a leg in fees for the ever growing group of people becoming interested in crypto.

I read some articles that the price is still far too high because the original valuation already assumed ridiculously high profits.  And a quick Google shows P/E of 97.88 which is kind of insane.  What does everyone here think?  A bad buy?  Their business model seems to be insanely scalable.

Fees are high because people will pay them. People will pay them because there are very limited options for a US-based exchange that's trustworthy and doesn't go against banking industry and the gov. Coinbase has done a lot of work to position itself this way and there's not a lot coming behind it.

By the time there are 2 or more same-level competitors, Coinbase would have released an assortment of additional products/services. It's going  to stay ahead for a while because it has started ahead already."

I'm a little ignorant on the ETF side... I guess the major ETFs hold $NVDA, $PYPL, and $SQ, (as well as $COIN) which means maybe less risk and (possibly, but unlikely) less reward.

Not totally sure,.. I think the ETF route is actually probably the best if we're choosing between all three.  I was just curious about $COIN specifically because it's very unique as a public company that's both legitimate and all about crypto specifically."

2021-06-05 23:31:59,stocks,"> be Google 

I have a question for you.  How much profit do you expect the average consumer will provide to Coinbase annually?  Start with yourself.   How much revenue is reasonable for you to provide to Coinbase every year, and how much profit will they make on that revenue?

For companies like Google and Facebook, you generally don't pay them anything directly but you can calculate their average revenue per household or per user, and their net profit from that based on their profit margin.

For companies that directly sell products or services to consumers or employees at companies, it's a little easier to figure out how much revenue and profit you are contributing to them.

So back to Coinbase.  How much money do you currently spent per year in transaction fees and commissions, and how much of that can Coinbase capture?  

If cryptocurrencies provided a cheaper and more scalable transfer of value than say ACH transfers or debit cards or checks or wire transfers or *literally anything else* then there's a lot of revenue currently flowing to other industries/companies that they could capture.  

But it doesn't.  Cryptocurrencies are the least scalable and most expensive way to transfer value.  Everyone using it is either speculating that the price will go up (most people) or people needing obfuscateable (with some effort) ways to move illicit funds around."
2021-06-06 10:34:13,stocks,"In the article you link it literally leads with the fact that the CEO sold 1.5% of his stake,  hardly dumping, he kept 98.5%!  Besides, insiders selling always happens at these kinds of liquidity events.  These guys have been holding shares for years, it would be financially irresponsible not to liquidate at least some of that new wealth and diversify it.

As for VCs selling, VCs don't tend to have a mandate to hold significant positions in large cap public companies, hence the venture part of the name.  They sell out of their success story to redeploy their capital taking positions in small private companies and try and replicate the whole process again."

2021-06-06 08:34:24,stocks,It's not actually that high but I can be that high. I think the highest is like 4 or 5%. and to make it clear they take it out of what you earn from staking. But you're missing a key feature. Once you stake you CANNOT move your coin for 2 years. That's 2 years of guaranteed revenue.
2021-06-06 02:38:17,stocks,"Yeah, very good point.  I guess it feels like I pay tons of fees, but in reality I don't see that revenue stream growing very much or at all if competition has better fees like many have noted.

Not sure on Culper, but Hindenburg Research seems to have a decent track record (though it's a rather short record with only a few stocks).

Stock manipulation only applies when the information being published is false. Though admittedly, I've had a hard time finding evidence that short sells get pushed for false reports.

As for what you can do about, probably class action lawsuits. Though it's unclear if it should be against the research companies or the companies themselves. It depends on how accurate the short reports actually are. Perhaps both."

When I see the same comment posted time after time that “corporations don’t pay taxes and I pay more than they do” all I see is media brainwashing. 

Educate yourself. Better yet, start a small business and make it a year. Finish all the tax filings required monthly, quarterly and yearly. You will see how the media lies to you.

This is why I believe no one should be a career politician. They need to know what a business pays before they make laws to tax it. That comes through education or real world experience.

Yes, Senate Dems have been pushing to get rid of the filibuster. Of course, that has its pros and cons, but only without a filibuster would they be able to pass things. A few of them, reportedly more than just a couple, are against removing the filibuster. Thus, as it stands, no they cannot pass anything they want. They can only do so much within the framework of the Senate, and with a narrow majority, they need total buy-in from all members.

2021-06-06 03:18:34,stocks,"Just because there isn’t an agreement right now doesn’t mean there aren’t any proposals that the Biden admin has put out. Check out the made in America tax plan that was detailed in April and check out Treasury’s “Green Book” that was released the Friday before Memorial Day. They discuss this mechanism in detail. They just say “if a global rate is agreed upon, we will follow, but until that, min rate is 21%.” I literally did a presentation on this last week at a conference. Yes, that means I’ve spent the better part of last week learning this stuff. So yeah, although an agreement in principle is nothing in that sense, we already have our own proposals out. 

So those 7 aren’t concerned about lowering their rates. It’s about a one stop way to ensure that companies based in those jurisdictions aren’t effectively eroding their tax base. 

The dynamic changes because you will have to move some of your cost centers from certain low tax jurisdictions. Note - because the way this is drafted, it effectively only hurts non US parented companies. 

So transfer pricing principles are always there. This won’t change that. My transfer pricing study may tell me that I should allocate 30% of revenue to cayman. So I will - but I may not get the requisite deduction that I had planned into because cayman doesn’t meet the min rate. Does that make sense? (Plus, transfer pricing and profit allocation (nexus) is addressed in the Pillar One proposals. What we are talking about (min tax) is part of the Pillar Two proposals. 

So the TP thing still matters, but it’s a completely different concern. 

Hope the above is helpful."

But the fact of the matter is they can, it's simply that they won't. No one ever talks about the reasonable hold out Republicans and the things that they would be willing to do but they can't.

2021-06-06 04:33:36,stocks,"I understand what you are saying and thanks for taking the time to explain it. This said, yours is still pure speculation and only concerns the USA - which, back to the point on my first comment, do not need any -global- tax agreement to have companies pay more taxes. They can simply enforce it unilaterally.

On the other hand, how a global agreement would even be enforced is all to be seen. We are talking about sovereign states that have no interest to accept an agreement and in most cases are well respected on the international scene (not the Cayman Islands). 

In your example, even the Cayman Islands could nominally raise their tax rate to 15%, but then find ways to make companies pay way less. Similarly to how Ireland did with Apple in the 1990s, when the official corporate tax rate was 15% or something like that, but Apple ended up paying 2%. Or how Luxembourg does today, or how Cantons in Switzerland do as well. 

Ultimately, a sovereign country can always force companies to pay more taxes. How it’s just a matter of tax codes and legalese. For a country like the US, which is the first or second economy in the world depending who you ask, this is an easy task. You pay how much the IRS wants or you don’t do business in the US. Why this doesn’t happen today all boils down to political will and lobbying. 
For a country like Italy or France, there is a point at which international companies would rather decide not to operate at all in the country rather than paying too much to do so. This is why in Europe what it’s needed is European coordination on tax matters - unlikely to happen. 

In China international companies do not ‘optimize’ taxes with subsidiaries. Why? Because it’s a dictatorship and if you don’t pay how much the regime deems proper they kick you out of their market and put you in jail. 

So, again, corporate tax avoidance issues can be solved unilaterally by countries or block of countries without the need of any global tax agreement. This is just PR to hide the fact that there is weak to no political will to make it happen."

2021-06-06 11:18:32,stocks,"These are all fair and legitimate concerns. But let me address a few of your technical concerns. 

Yes, the USA doesn’t need any global agreement - but it is certainly helpful. Just remember, current proposals have a clause saying “to the extent a global rate is agreed on, we will lower our threshold.” 

Enforcing it unilaterally is tough. Keep in mind that the principle being followed here is to capture under taxed income. That framework/proposal really is based on a global min rate. But I understand you are saying that the Us could just say “f it, we are just going to disallow everything and force you to pay more here.” Realistically, that’s a tough sell. And there’s more bite to this proposal if all parties agree. We’ve seen that most recently with mandatory disclosure rules in Europe as well as anti-hybrid legislation as well (with various degrees of complexity amongst jurisdictions). 

Ok so one technical correction. The proposals talk about an effective tax rate, NOT a nominal tax rate. It basically tells you to look at “total taxes paid” in computing your effective rate. So you can’t do the “oh the stated rate is 15%, we good here.” You are right about how nominal and effective rates are very different - and this is clearly addressed. 

If you think people aren’t doing tax planning in China….

There is a surprising amount of support behind these proposals - and these aren’t new. The framework has been worked on for years and countries are finally expressing support. Treasury secretary yellen expressed her support a few weeks ago. And even the Trump administration was in favor of a global minimum tax."

This stock is doing well so selling it seems like dropping your winners to buy losers.  On the other hand the valuation is high, so adding to your position feels risky.   But I don't follow this stock that closely so I'm hesitant to scream ""buy"".  

I read a thing a long time ago by some random dude on the internet that totally made sense to me and has worked well with a bit of fudging: when a position rises by \~50%, increase your basis by 50%.  So, say you bought $1000 worth of  MRNA and it's now worth $1400, buy another $500.  His suggestion was to hold for a loss of up to 30%, but I would say hold as long as the fundamentals are in place.  

I adjust this somewhat to my perception of risk.  For NKE, which I initially bought at a split-adjusted price of about $30, I was less aggressive and I earned less than I could have because of that.  For SHOP, I bought first at $60 and had high confidence in the business model, so I added more frequently and it worked great.    For some other stocks recently I added too slowly at first and too quickly later, but then there is still time for those things to play out, as the fundamentals are still very strong.

2021-06-05 21:15:46,stocks,"Any laptop or desktop they sold until the last year or two. If you spent the same $ with other providers you'd get superior specs 9/10 times.

For example in college (2010+) I used an Asus G73jh for school and gaming. $2k sticker price ($1,600 MSRP plus add-ons), which is about what a [MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp583?locale=en_US) went for in those days.

- Inferior cpu (2 core Intel duo versus an i7-720QM)
- inferior resolution (MacBook 1280x720 max, Asus 1920x1080)
- inferior GPU (NVIDIA GeForce 320M with 256MB of DDR3 SDRAM **shared with main memory** vs. ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5870 1GB GDDR5)
- Inferior storage capacity (256gb HDD default, can customize up to 500gb, Asus cames with two 500gb HDDs for 1TB total)
- Inferior battery lifespan (63.5-watt-hours vs 75)

The only specs where the macbook is superior is single-charge battery life (my Asus chewed thru it's battery charge in 2-3 hours depending on my usage, Apple lasted 10 hrs) and possibly audio quality? Oh and Apple's came with a free display cleaning cloth.

Their hardware has only become price-competitive recently and even then there are still plenty of alternatives.

**Edit:** oh and regarding software, yeah it's not bad from the consumer perspective for sure (though that's arguably a matter of taste) I have seen few negatives about their end user experience.

From the developer perspective, their software ecosystem is a nightmare - pain in the asshole to work with, adds bloat (DRM) to your apps unnecessarily, and requires a friggin apple machine to publish with (FYI despite my obvious bias against them, I own both a MacBook and an iPad, notebook to publish apps with and iPad was a gift)."

2021-06-06 07:22:20,stocks,"Nuclear is actually not clean at all compared to solar. Better than combustion? yes without a doubt but not better than wind or solar when it comes to cost or waste.

Uranium must 1st be mined and then refined. Mining it alone in any quantity is not trivial. Refining creates toxic and radioactive waste as does the resulting waste after its been used. The kind of waste that can wipe out populations if not disposed of correctly or if owners get lazy and cut corners or if Homer Simpson is an employee there... Further, the reactors are insanely expensive to build, and have very high maintenance and employment costs.

Last and most laughable of all, solar energy is already cheaper per kWh in many regions. This is exactly why many utilities stopped building nuclear and just put up solar farms. Not only are they much cheaper to build, its much easier to train workers and you need far less of them to keep a solar farm working.

Nuclear no longer makes sense. Commercial scale solar generates energy for sub 4 cents per kWh in high sun hour areas. In less sunny you are looking at 8 cents given half the sun hours (around 2.75 instead of 5.5 which is places like Alaska).

By comparison, nuclear is anywhere from 4 cents to over 12 cents per kWh depending on build costs, cooling/storage costs, general maintenance and worker salaries. In terms of pollution, nuclear is much worse due to the waste being radioactive for thousands of years. Waste from solar is insanely overstated in terms of toxicity. Its really not very dangerous except (compared to nuclear waste at least) and most can be recycled."
2021-06-06 07:58:10,stocks,"I didnt read them because I already have a general idea. They are too long winded and the one you linked is literally titled ""thin film"" which is not very useful so it got skipped automatically. Thin film promised cheaper panels at low efficiency. They were never cheaper thus they are gone. The problem with thin film is requires a lot of chemical based processing to recycle them. Normal panels do not. They do have some chemical based stuff with the cells but just common practices we do with all electronics.

Recyclers dont recycle them because they arent set up for it and because they require more labor. There is no technical limitation otherwise. Traditional panels can be recycled by anyone who does any electronics. Problem is, none of them want it nor accept it because it is not profitable. Poly/Mono panels have to be separated by hand. They are like computers or monitors but they are more cumbersome thus harder and more costly to work with.

End of the day however, this is not a major issue because there is no technical barrier. The solution is a recycling fee per panel either at time of purchase or at time of disposal. Recyclers will be more than happy to take them once its a money maker."

Then you aren't really worth discussing literally anything with.  Ever hear of the Dunning-Kruger effect?  You clearly don't know what you're talking about, you don't comprehend, or possibly aren't even reading my comments, and you don't read the sources, nor provide your own.

The article you didn't read not only explains the difficulty in recycling solar panels, all solar panels, not just the thin ones, and further explains that a company in the US does recycle the thin ones, while also producing them.  So they are not 'gone' as you say.  The first half of your comment is completely misinformed.  I work for an electronics recycler, as I have stated.  I have worked for 3 different electronics recyclers over my lifetime, been sent to industry shows, and have had to work with many other electronics recyclers as a part of my job.  Not one of them have had the capability to deal with PV cells. We could, however, process most other electronics.  It's common knowledge in my industry, and if you took a minute to actually check you could confirm it as well.

If it were really so simple, to just charge a fee and be done with it, then this issue would have been addressed years ago, but that is not the case.  Nothing has prevented recyclers from doing so, so why isn't that the norm?

Furthermore, your idea that it's not an issue is because there is no technical barrier is absolutely asinine.  Nearly every modern day environmental problem aren't caused by technical barriers, but financial ones.  Plastics & plastic pollution, carbon emissions, chemical disposal, e-waste, & the like are all issues entirely because it's cheaper or too profitable to continue what they are doing the irresponsible way.  It doesn't change a thing, to have the technical know-how, when no one is willing to foot the bill for it.  Each of these issues and others remain despite awareness of the fact.

That being said, sometimes admitting you made a mistake and cutting your losses is the right choice instead of bleeding all of your money.


But there is a fine line between admitting a mistake and panic selling.


I think the best question to ask yourself is ""Would i advise someone else to buy this stock at the current price?"". If your answer is ""HELL NO"", then yea maybe you should cut your losses and get in a better stock.


But even then sometimes its an issue...

This is also why there is no OI on $GLD, no one trades gold that way everyone is trading the futures directly.

You could however look at options on gold miners and gold miners ETFs. This is an indirect play but can work.

Stuff can't just go up because ""economy will run hot! weeee!"", that only fucking works for the first few quarters because of base effects and euphoria. Don't follow into these trades now, they were good trades in November if you buy now you have a decent chance of ending up with bags.

I don't know about you, but the price have risen and seems to be telling people that maybe just maybe those so called bagholders are on to something.

Pull up a chart of the WTI (Oil). Going back to when Oil was last $80 which is the expected price of going forward, possibly higher

Now pull up a chart of the OIH and see what it traded at at that time. The entire industry trades on the WTI price

Now realize the P/E or whatever you think you can base your thesis on is incorrect since their P/E is 100% dependent on the WTI price

Next.  Save this comment and come back and talk to me about the QQQ when the 10yr bond yield is so much as a single basis point above 1.75. If you think it's beat up now you're gonna be blown away by what ""beat up"" looks like

Finally.  Watch what price the banks (XLF) trade at when the FED releases the final stress test results ( a few weeks from now) and they in unison reinstate/raise their dividends and do monster buy backs while interest rates go up by even the tiniest tick

They current trade at about 50-75% of tradition Price to Book (P/E isn't how you value banks)

2021-06-05 21:54:43,stocks,"Don't do both VTI and VOO. They overlap. So 16% VTI. SCHD better than VYM for a high div play. PBW/Clean energy is going to be choppy for a while. QQQ is fine, but I personally don't like the idea of investing in a specific stock exchange instead of an industry or factor. Would suggest VUG over QQQ. If in doubt of what else to buy, invest more in VTI."
2021-06-06 02:20:28,stocks,I have AMD and have been selling covered calls for months. Great long term play with income potential due to its slow burn
2021-06-06 11:25:38,stocks,Yes you can transfer traditional to Roth but not the other way. You’ll pay taxes on any trad IRA money that hasn’t already been taxed (pro rata rule). You’ll file form 8949 to capture the transaction.
2021-06-06 03:43:23,stocks,Lol I hope it's true

Investing just for a dividend is a waste of time. Dividends are irrelevant"
2021-06-06 06:23:17,stocks,"Well if I'm not mistaking some index funds do so, but I just started so I haven't had the time to think about this. But yeah could be great to reinvest dividends monthly in addition to the amount I monthly add to my portfolio.
Btw advice is welcome, I think that the S&P 500 doesn't pay dividends but I might as well be totally wrong since I started 3 weeks ago."
2021-06-06 09:20:28,stocks,"Sounds like a smart strategy. AMD is easily worth $100+, and probably $200+ years down the line."
2021-06-06 15:58:35,stocks,That's good information to know!  Thank you much!

2021-06-06 12:36:16,stocks,Can you read? That's why I said the word also.
2021-06-06 10:08:53,stocks,Have a look at DIV superfund. Pays out >5% and diversified risk over many dividend paying stocks
2021-06-06 10:36:52,stocks,Oh ok thank you very much for advice
2021-06-06 03:56:51,stocks,You'll get better results buying full stocks.
2021-06-05 21:44:35,stocks,"I notice you have a large concentration in small and mid cap companies, especially in single stocks. So like having nearly 12% of your portfolio in LUNA, which just barely qualifies as even a small cap, is very risky. There's going to be a lot of luck involved. I would suggest balancing out your portfolio with some broad market exposure, some larger companies to balance out your small cap bias, maybe some more mature companies."
2021-06-05 21:54:15,stocks,"Yes, I will be building my large cap exposure going forward. I'm thinking of adding one of the FAANG stocks just haven't decided on which yet."
2021-06-06 02:54:29,stocks,"It’s truly good for playing the stock market and retiring. It’s very good for investing at a young age. 

I tell all my friends who are into stocks about Roth IRA"
2021-06-06 14:16:23,stocks,"Honestly, the price could be 10x lower and it would still feel overvalued. They are priced like a tech stock but are not in the tech sector. I can see the competition catching up soon or at least eventually, so unless they can pivot into other areas I don't really see much room for growth. It's like bitcoin or Tesla - they are top of their fields currently but haven't really got that much of an edge to sustain that in the longer term over their competition.
However the market is irrational especially now with increasing inflation. So, if it hits something like 12 - 14 it could be a buy."
2021-06-06 14:51:38,stocks,Your the guy that told dfv to sell his shares lmfao 😂😂😂
2021-06-06 07:14:30,stocks,"You need to report them to Costco about that, and it breaks their contract with Costco"
2021-06-06 07:17:45,stocks,"Their debt is from lending, which has made them an insane amount of profit...."
2021-06-06 08:45:12,stocks,Enjoy cheap cars
2021-06-06 16:08:47,stocks,Citadel isn't a bank
2021-06-06 16:10:55,stocks,Yeah I made the correction. Thanks though.
