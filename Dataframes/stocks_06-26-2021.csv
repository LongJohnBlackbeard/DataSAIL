2021-06-26 18:35:19,stocks,I moved my spy allocation to vt.  Tribute to jack boggle.  0.08% expense ratio. 43% non us.   But as much Europe as Asia
2021-06-26 19:00:41,stocks,"IMHO
International of all types is a huge part of all big companies.  Starbucks for example has more international stores than American. Not emerging perse but all big companies are like that."
2021-06-26 18:35:19,stocks,"Nah, the problem with emerging markets is that you have to take into account other factors outside your control like:

1. Indebted government defaulting on loans and cratering your stock value based on exchange rates (looking at you Argentina...).

2. Geopolitical situation, lots of frenemies to friends to enemies and back in the developing world.

3. Not one basket, even if there are a few bright spots global economies are rather fragile and you'll often find the overall dragged down by the bad apples.

4. Lack of oversight--you REALLY sure in that company that SWEARS they totally have 100% no fraud in their financials? Companies in the developed world do it, just often hide it better with expensive accounting."
2021-06-26 18:43:03,stocks,Emerging markets are about 15% of world market. Adds volatility and risk adjusted expected returns to your portfolio.

2021-06-26 18:29:18,stocks,"Like it or not, depending  on what formula and data you use China is already the second largest or largest economy in the world. It’s the world leader in manufacturing simple goods and is closing the gap in more technical manufacturing.   
They dont care about the environment, manipulate their currency, don’t  care about patents which gives them huge advantages over competition. America had its time in the sun now it’s China’s time so you would be foolish not to hold some Chinese stocks in your portfolio."

2021-06-26 19:59:29,stocks,"chinese stocks are dangerous, as you dont really hold them cpp can remove your ""ownership"" at any second. also fraud cases are more rampant."
2021-06-26 18:34:57,stocks,"Yeah you bring up a good point, roughly 1/3 of VWO is Chinese. 

I think something like EEMS (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Small-Cap ETF) is more so what I’m looking for. Only 10% China and more weighting towards underdeveloped countries like South Africa, Malaysia, Brazil, etc, plus small-cap so super high growth potential companies."
2021-06-26 18:17:07,stocks,That MSCI all-time chart makes me hesitant to put anything into it right now. Exponential growth since early 2019. Plus fuck China.
2021-06-26 19:44:54,stocks,"Not expecting it to beat those indexes, but I want to use this almost as a bet hedge in case America goes to shit (which isn’t too far fetched with the way things are going)."
2021-06-26 19:47:45,stocks,My personal opinion and not financial advice is if America goes to sh*t then emerging markets goes to sh*t steeper/faster/longer and has a harder time pulling back up as evidenced by the charts on this fund

2021-06-26 18:10:33,stocks,"## General investing wisdom:

These are classics, with a broad scope of generally useful knowledge. 

- The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need by Andrew Tobias

- Craft of Investing by John Train

- The Money Game by Adam Smith. 

## Stock Selection: 

How to pick winners.

- Peter Lynch - One Up on Wall Street, followed by Beating the Street. Everyone refers to these, so you need to read them to speak the language. Easy listening by audiobook, non technical, teaches how to pick good stocks. 

- Growth investing: How to Make Money in Stocks by O'Neil. 

- Value investing: The Acquirer's Multiple by Carlisle (deep value, more modern). Little Book that Beats the Market by Greenblatt is simplistic but also worth reading. Value Investing by James Montier.

## Stock Valuation: 

Regardless of what style of investing you do, buying at a good price matters.

- Pat Dorsey - Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing. Written by a top guy from Morningstar, it walks through valuation in a more modern/applied way than the old books by Ben Graham, and has a lot of applicable knowledge for specific industries.

- The Intelligent Investor, Ben Graham, is the classic. People feel obligated to recommend this but it's old, a dense read, and very long. If time is limited, skip it and read Dorsey instead.

## Portfolio design and risk management
- To get the industry-level standard, read The Four Pillars of Investing by Bernstein (more technical) or Winning the Loser's Game by Ellis (shorter). 

- To understand the gaps in that approach, read Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb."

2021-06-26 17:53:55,stocks,"Honestly at this point in time, I would recommend opening an account with someone, Tdameritrade for example, and delve into their learning resources. Each brokerage will offer slightly different stuff but you can get a solid grasp by using those tools. This also allows you to familiarize yourself with the platform of choice, and you can set your account to paper trading, which will let you try different things, and see what becomes of it."
2021-06-26 17:41:09,stocks,"Learn to read charts. A million words can leave you holding a lie. Charts do not lie. The story, the cycle, the promise ... maybe these work out.

2021-06-26 16:40:43,stocks,Thank you
2021-06-26 15:21:38,stocks,So you have to watch a 30-second targeted ad in the back seat before the trip starts and another before the doors unlock at the end but the ride is free?
2021-06-26 15:26:15,stocks,"Sure, why not. Big tech companies have so much money and resources so they can reinvent themselves however they like."
2021-06-26 15:50:29,stocks,It's Google. They'll do anything for a couple weeks/months and then quit once competition is forced to step up
2021-06-26 16:19:17,stocks,"My first reaction is that Google could compete with anybody they want to. They have perfected the business model of giving away free services and monetizing them later. 

My second thought is… why wouldn’t they just buy Lyft, the smaller of the two, roll it into Waymo, and then use them to compete with Uber?"
2021-06-26 15:59:35,stocks,"I think Google is underestimated overall. Regarding ride hailing services, they have maps, waymo, cashflow, and are strongly investing in AI."
2021-06-26 15:43:20,stocks,"With Waymo, yes. Both Uber and Lyft's end game is driverless cars. Google is investing heavily into Waymo to get to that end stage right away. And this is why Apple is also supposedly getting into autonomous vehicles. 

We are slowly getting into an inflection point where the demand for ridesharing is increasing while the technology for autonomous vehicles is also becoming more realistic at the same time. These companies do see a future where people typically don't buy cars any more. Already fewer people are buying cars in cities like NYC, and SF. And they are depending more on Uber/Lyft. A typical Uber ride is $20-$30 on average, approximately 50% of which go to drivers. If the cars become driverless, that extra margin goes straight to ride sharing services (Uber/Lyft/Waymo)."
2021-06-26 16:31:07,stocks,"This isn’t about the tech part of it, any motivated software developers can build the service, the servers don’t even cost that much.

The problem is the liabilities of it, and the background checks on all the drivers, and providing the customer support that requires hiring a large number for people to answer phones, marketing, HR, lawyers, etc"
2021-06-26 18:17:02,stocks,"I doubt it. Google has no customer service, car rides apps get lots of calls for customer service, bad drivers, bad passengers, arbitration, disputes, refunds. I don’t think they want to get into that. Plus I think Uber has huge legal department of lawyers to get around all the local restrictions and labor laws. I just don’t see why Google needs to bother with all those headaches - they can already collect all the location data they want to feed their ad cash cow. They are not in legal or customer service business, they are a data collection shop."
2021-06-26 19:04:31,stocks,"Technologically, yeah. But I don't think they can do this themselves because of anti-trust concerns."

Google already has the software in maps and ads, all they would need to do is build the dispatch side into Google Maps. They already have the harder side done in terms of mapping and audience - just add a Google Maps for Drivers app and it’s done."
2021-06-26 18:14:23,stocks,"Maps - everyone sees as a utility and can't even put ads in it or people will drop it. Just a tool to gather data.

Waymo - great AI research which has so far produced zero successful products.

Cashflow - doesn't mean much in a world where everyone has access to infinite cheap credit. Let's discuss if Fed ever stops propping the markets.

Investing in AI - zero successful commercial applications so far except search which could be said to be successful because of its monopoly status, not because of the quality of the AI.

Google isnt' underestimated. It's a monopoly that practically will never go away from search and are using their dominant position to prop up some mediocre products in connected fields. Let's contrast that with Apple which has several products which can stand on their own: phones, laptops, earbuds, music store etc.

I haven't so far mentioned Google Play  - if they try and monetize that too much there are other stores waiting in the wings to take over: Amazon's and Samsung's for example."
2021-06-26 16:19:17,stocks,Uber and Lyft both sold off their autonomous driving divisions though (and probably at a discount compared to how much they invested into those efforts).
2021-06-26 18:26:05,stocks,">Google is investing heavily into Waymo to get to that end stage right away.

Yeah, this is it. Google is not interested in competing with Uber. Google is skipping over Uber and inventing a whole new class of service, with a robot picking you up and driving you around.

And they are not far either. It's a couple years away from going national, but it should be a decade away."
2021-06-26 19:58:09,stocks,"Waymo is am already dead idea, and only a company like Google with so much cash and revenue could afford to keep that turd alive. It's actually a great example of being too big for your own good.

Edit truth hurts. They took the wrong approach and they're too stubborn to change direction."
2021-06-26 18:05:47,stocks,"> If the cars become driverless, that extra margin goes straight to ride sharing services (Uber/Lyft/Waymo).

They could do that right now by making the car be remotely driven by someone from a low cost location. They don't, becaues they have enough political backlash as it is. That's why driverless cars are a long way from now - tech barriers are considerable, but the political barriers are insurmountable for now."
2021-06-26 17:31:01,stocks,So doesn’t Google have most of that done with Gmail? Just read their emails… they’re already doing it to deliver targeted ads into your inbox.

2021-06-26 17:43:14,stocks,Good point. I was thinking about taking another player off the board. I guess it depends on the transation to driverless cars. Not every customer will be comfortable with that right away.
2021-06-26 16:28:48,stocks,"Both Uber and Lyft had massive losses in 2020 - $6B for Uber and $2B for Lyft. They sold their autonomous driving divisions to regain control of their profitability, at least for a short term. Besides, Uber's ATV division was sued by Waymo for trade-secret theft and all. 

I see two course of actions by Uber/Lyft:

1. Focus on profitability in the short-term for next couple of years and then kickstart the ATV division again. OR,

2. Focus solely on ridesharing component, and then partner with Aurora or another ATV-third party startup/company to provide its driverless cars.

My bet it's the second option they will go after, because building autonomous cars are extremely expensive, and not to mention, have potential regulatory issues in the future as well."

2021-06-26 16:51:11,stocks,"> most widespread heritable diseases cannot be treated that way

I am not sure if you are referring to things like diabetes or Hypertension or to more genetic diseases like achondroplasia.

But either way gene therapy can play a huge role, for example in diabetes, genetic modification to make people produce more insulin can help a lot. Adjusting metabolism can cause non surgical weight loss, etc 

Also for cancers, gene editing to knock out the cancer causing genes like BRCA can make a huge difference for both the people with cancer and their families.

One particular point not often discussed now is aging too, that is very complex but many certain effects of aging are caused by the slow turn off of certain genes, giving people mRNA infusions of certain under functioning genes can reverse certain aging related changes and extend human life. 

Tech like CRISPER  and mRNA is about to make a huge difference, we may not be there yet, but we are now at an infliction point that is no less important than the discovery of penicillin or vaccines or safe surgery. Remember that less than 80 years ago having an infected wound or appendicitis can easily kill you but now these are minor problems. 

It will be an incremental change and most likely the bigger companies will absorb the successful start ups, but with how science is accelerating, we will probably get to a point where cancer treatment is going to be as trivial as getting a couple of infusions."

My gut feeling would be that its highly polygenic with lots of nasty gene-environment interactions.

2021-06-26 18:03:04,stocks,Big pharma is so big that the gains they would get from a blockbuster drug barely impact their bottom line.

Helen Hobbes, about 15 years ago, discovered that 1/40 people in a minority population have a gene mutation in PCSK9 that reduces their risk of heart disease by 86%. 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa054013

Regeneron showed antibodies to PCSK9 could lower blood cholesterol.

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1105803

Verve wants to introduce that beneficial mutation found in the human population into individuals without it. Thus, a permanent reduction in cholesterol.

Their data in monkeys shows this is feasible.

£12K S&S ISA: all in V00 

£10K Lifetime ISA

Took a big interest in stock investment a few years back and started buying shares - managed to do ok (largely luck tbh), then did very well last year (like everyone did) buying the March dip and buying more tech stocks. Over the last 6 months I sold all my shares as the market went crazy. GME saga really put me off ever picking individual stocks again ( FYI I never bought any WSB stocks, but seeing how crazy valuations became - nothing made sense to me so sold it all). 

As a result I have about another 10K cash but don’t want to put it all in with V00, any suggestions of trackers/ETFs to ‘diversify’ a bit?"

Mostly doing this out of curiosity as well as thrill seeking. I'm gravitating towards under-hyped, value-oriented stocks, perhaps as a cheeky act of defiance towards the 2 most commonly seen investing strategies online (tech/hyper-growth and index funds)."

2021-06-26 12:58:01,stocks,"I bought my first property very early - around 25 years old.  I only lived in it for about 3-4 years before making it an investement property and moving overseas.  It made things a struggle as it didn't start generating income for 10 years.... but it did go from $350k - $900k in those 10 years, so on paper it was well worth it.

My biggest regret is not focusing on investing or saving until 30's.  I always had decent jobs (work in tech consulting/resell) but was enjoying champage and sushi too regularly.  Never lived beyond my means, but didn't put anywhere enough away.

3 years ago I started my own business and took a real focus on investing.  Cut back on everything - I think I'm spending less than $60k a year including my mortgage payment.  Really focused on passive income and compound interest on stocks with an ultimate goal just to live off them.... or work selectively."
2021-06-26 14:02:30,stocks,"The capital growth on the property alone was $550k/10 years so $55k + $25k in income p/a.
That’s based on an assumed investment of $350k which was the purchase price.

As for the current $700k, sure it might make sense now but I’d be up for a shit tone of capital gains.

Lastly there are a lot of tax benefits to an investment property, not sure the exact figure but factor in another $5-$10k

That’s what your missing.


If you just look at $700k and say do this or that, sure, it might make sense if that was cash and my goal was to invest it in a property now, but your better off doing the math on $350k to compare the actual investment."

You mentioned one already - a less diversified more risky investment will theoretically appreciate faster if things go well. Another is the ability to get a mortgage loan which is a safer form of leverage than margin, but doesn’t really apply here because OP is close to full ownership. Another reason is some people just find it more fun. You can do whatever you want to the property, like renovation projects to increase its value. If you want a passive RE investment that you don’t have to think about ever, then reit is the way to go."

in short, owning land or property makes you seem really really cool. and a lot of people want that status of a ""cool"" person. when it makes just as much sense to dump that money in an ETF and get passive gains. without having to stress or worry about all the bullshit that comes with finding a property, owning it, learning what the fuck the tax benefits are and actually taking advantage of them

I never got in debt for college. I worked overnight and could hardly stay awake in class. I did well, but not useful degree - film, but didn’t get any experience due to work.

Bought house at 21 for ~$120k making less than $10/hr. Paid off before 30 working hard. Never made crap, hit $50k once with tons of overtime. Paid off like ~$60k with an accident settlement. But I have chronic pain, so that sucks.

Got Master’s degree after a year off from college doing what I would be doing without a degree at all.

Bought S2000 w/ ~28k miles around 2010 for $15k cash. Ended up driving beaters and letting it be a garage queen, they have appreciated considerably. Just hit only 28k miles recently on son’s bday.

Financially shitty for a while with kids’ mom being a drug addict, etc.. Only really started saving money since 2017 without another adult to support.

Wish I got into investing earlier. People shit on Robinhood, but it’s so damn easy. I wouldn’t be as into it on other platforms without such a clean U/I.

I make under $50k to be in a job that allows me to be flexible to kids’ needs. I’m also one to stay where things are comfortable… I’ve been in my house for 18 years next month, which is insane, especially at my age."

Yes, ditch the target date fund and find a total market ETF, like one of these:

VTI, Vanguard Total Market Index; Expense Ratio: 0.03%

SCHB: 0.03%"
2021-06-26 10:47:11,stocks,usually those target date funds are too conservative for me. id go with a total market fund rather than nasdaq 100.
2021-06-26 10:58:28,stocks,"If you want to stay in the nasdaq 100 then I would look at Invesco’s QQQ. The expense ratio is 0.20% and it out performs VCNIX. 

If you want to get into some really risky yet high performing ETFs you could look at Proshares leveraged ETFs. They offer 2x (QLD) and 3x (TQQQ) performance of the Nasdaq 100. I warn you that while they have super high performance they also can quickly lose all you money in a market crash. They also say don’t hold on to these long term. The reason is they are designed to be used by day traders. But you can still get some really good returns if you buy at the right time. But if you are strategic and only buy say 10 to 20 % of your portfolio in those you will be ok if you can stomach occasional wild swing day. 

Also those funds do splits and reverse splits all the time to keep the prices somewhat reasonable since the have high rates of return and lose. So in a crash you could see your shares suddenly shrink in number and value at the same time depending on what they do with the fund. 

I put all my money into a triple leveraged etf after the 08 market crash and did really well. Then blew it all on chasing VIX. Easy come easy go."

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Barrick Gold ($GOLD) lagging competitors YTD. Short term opportunity? Now I’m not going to pretend that I’m an expert with gold miners (honesty I don’t think anyone can accurately value this industry, just read [Barrick’s](https://s25.q4cdn.com/322814910/files/doc_presentations/2021/05/Barrick-Q1-2021-Results-Presentation.pdf) latest investor presentation which goes into detail about their mining process, it’s extremely complicated) or here to present a 10x opportunity. I’ve been closely following gold prices for a few months now and have seen a lot of discussions around the relationship between inflation and a potential increase in interest rates which would negatively impact gold as investors seek better risk-adjusted yield opportunities in bonds.

Despite interest rate concerns, I still believe gold is a decent hedge given the S&P hitting new all-time highs. The Fed continues to reassure the market that interest rates won’t move until late 2022 at the earliest. In my opinion, inflation may run hot for the next year giving gold a decent tailwind. I know this is a simple macro overview, but let’s move on to the trade opportunity.

I have noticed that Barrick has been lagging its major competitor Newmont this year, why? It already traded at a lower multiple compared to Newmont at the start of the year which makes sense as it has lower operating margins/growth expectations. There doesn’t appear to be an explicit reason for the relative dispersion between the 2 companies’ share price YTD when they have historically been very correlated.

Here are my 2 potential strategies:

#1 Target Price Realization: Go long common stock while selling monthly calls 5-10% above purchase price. Current monthly implied volatility shows about 2-3% monthly premium. Not bad. If I get assigned first month, would re-enter.

#2 Pairs Trade: Go long Barrick ($GOLD) and short Newmont ($NEM) until both securities revert to their mean averages of the past 5 years (89% correlation).

In summary, I strongly believe there is a 15-20% short term opportunity here which may not be groundbreaking but still outperforming the broader market if this happens in 6 months. Which strategy would you implement?"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"$EAF an entirely overlooked play on steel $EAF, GrafTech International, is one of the largest players in the electric arc furnace (EAF) game. EAFs are used to melt scrap steel, a cheaper alternative to freshly smelted ore made in a blast furnace. 

As steel prices have skyrocketed, big players like $CLF have followed suit and likely have more upside. Between the massive economic growth predicted and infrastructure bill being passed, steel prices will remain elevated. However, $EAF is considerably downstream of the demand. Steel is heavy and  usually not all that expensive, making it a last choice for scrappers in normal times. With a huge lack of supply, scrap prices have gone up considerably. This will increase scrapping volume, and as such drive demand for GrafTechs furnaces. 

Additionally, as countries scramble to curb emissions, more emphasis will be placed on replacing aging blast furnaces with electric arc furnaces that run on electricity in combination with petroleum coke, rather than exclusively coke (which is usally coal coke), making them both more efficient and more environmentally friendly. It also cuts out the need to mine new iron ore, a process that entails it’s own emissions and environmental damage. China has already stated their intent to move away from blast furnaces and increase EAF capacity. As electricity becomes significantly cheaper than coal as the world (and especially China and the US, two huge scrap markets) scales up renewables, EAFs will become increasingly attractive. 

This is a long term play and I encourage you to do your own DD. I believe the company is very fairly valued at a ~8 p/e and 7.23 fwd p/e. Financials are alright but improving, with considerable debt which is being paid off aggressively. The last earnings call noted they are beginning to see increased demand as they come out of a lull from the pandemic. The dividend was cut significantly to a mere .33%, a show of fiscal responsibility that has hurt the share price. 

The EAF market is highly competitive and it will depend on scrap volume to increase significantly in order to get out of the pricing wars the industry is likely engaged in currently. However, EAF produces great ultra high powered furnaces and are also vertically integrated with a petroleum coke producer, making them my pick for the industry even as petroleum coke remains in short supply. 

Analyst PTs range from 14-16 with an average of 15.25, indicating 27% upside from current levels. This stock is beaten down and I’m here for it.

My current position is in Jan 22’ $10c as it provides pretty cheap leverage, however I will likely be adding shares and if you have the capital that is certainly what I would recommend. This will take many years to fully play out. GLTA."

To me it doesn't really seem worth it to buy stocks purely for the dividends. Games WOrkshop ( a miniature company) lists its stocks at around £113, and its dividends are around £0.45 and they give it out 4 times a year. so thats only like £1.80 a year, it would take like 60 yrs to even break even with that. Even longer if you bought multiple shares. Wouldn't it just be better to keep the money and not buy the stock? Am I misunderstanding something important here? I've used Games Workshop as an example since its a company I'm familiar with and I understand the market far more than something like cars or pharmacuticals.

At least if you're investing and not just trading. If you're trading then forget dividends."
2021-06-26 09:20:10,stocks,You’re forgetting that even after they pay the dividend you still own the stock and any gains in value you keep. Dividends are a nice sweetener for those looking for income
2021-06-26 10:13:49,stocks,"You're forgetting about compounding and reinvesting the dividends.  It takes less than 60 years for a full return.  Every year on that stock, you'd own 1.5% (roughly) more shares, which pay out more dividends.  It'd be about 40 years to double your shares (probably not exactly accurate, I'm not doing the math.)

The idea is to buy a completely stable company when you're in your 20's that has a nice return. 1.5% isn't all that nice but if you get around 3-5%, you'll double your shares about every 12 years.  By the time you're 60, you'll have about 8 times the shares, which you'll make that 3-5% on and can pull the money out.  It's not about the cost of the base shares if you invest in dividends, but how many shares you can compound for a higher dividend and pull that money out as steady money when you retire.  When you start taking the money out, you'll take out your original investment in like 5 years, while still holding all the shares to give to your kids.

If you're trying to flip stocks or aren't looking at steady retirement income, dividends aren't the way to go though.  The high dividends mostly trade sideways because of the money coming out."

2021-06-26 09:39:58,stocks,"Dividends are only a part of the total return. In almost all cases, when you buy a dividend paying stock, you’re expecting it to increase in value over time as well. Not only that, but many well run companies increase their payouts regularly. 

Look at Apple, when it began paying dividends again it started out paying a (split adjusted) quarterly dividend of around 9.5 cents per share. Now it’s 22 cents. 

Look at the historical payouts of many other dividend paying businesses, Verizon. Microsoft. Target. Home Depot. The dividends grow over time. 

But yes, overall, the payout is only a portion of the total return. No one is evaluating Apple and saying “and look at that juicy 0.66% payout!”  But Apple holders (like me) are still happy to see that payout get increased each year."

2021-06-26 13:12:05,stocks,"Dividends are a a must in every portfolio. Games Workshop may not be attractive to you, but it depends on what you're going for. 

Consider:

1. dividends compound when reinvested, there are plenty that pay a relatively safe 5%. Compound that out over 30 years and thats a 450% gain on your initial investment JUST FROM DIVIDENDS. That's completely ignoring 30 years of growth AND ignoring dividend raises along the way. Which brings me to my next point:
2. Dividend raises. There are companies that have RAISED THEIR DIVIDEND EVERY YEAR FOR OVER 60 YEARS. Coca Cola (KO) was trading for $6 a share back in 1991 and had 3 splits since then. Today each share is up roughly 700%, you would have 6 times as many shares, and you would have been collecting dividends the whole time. KO now pays $1.68 per year, per share. YOU ARE NOW MAKING MORE IN DIVIDENDS EVERY YEAR THAN YOU ORIGINALLY PAID FOR THE STOCK.

&#x200B;

Scenerio:

Its 30 years ago, you have $1000 to invest, you stick it all in KO at around $6 and get 166 shares. First year pays you a meager 3.6%, enough for 6 shares of stock. You now have 172 shares. next year they raise their dividend, this year you made enough for 7 shares of stock. fast forward 3 years, you're now sitting on 208 shares of stock, and getting 12 shares per year. The stock splits 2 to 1, you now have 416 shares. fast forward 25 years, 2 splits, and 25 dividend raises later, you now have over 4800 shares of KO, worth $250,000, you are now making $10,008 per year JUST FROM DIVIDENDS, Turn off DRIP and live off the dividend income in retirement. Not bad for a $1000 investment. Imagine putting $1000 a year into different dividend stocks over the course of a 30 year long career in investing.

&#x200B;

There are different types of dividend stocks, typically the lowest quality ones yield the highest, and the highest quality ones yield the lowest. There are companies (Apple, Microsoft) that pay a dividend but still have some phenomenal growth ahead of them, and there are companies that wont grow much but pay a strong yield every year. There are companies that never raise their dividend, and companies that have raised it every year for decades.

To summarize my advice: Yes, dividends are a powerful compounding tool and NECESSARY in a balanced portfolio. I wouldnt want to be 100% growth but i also wouldnt want to be 100% dividend/value either. Both are necessary in my opinion. I would pick quality over yield, and pick a few companies that you can diversify into dividend growth (companies that increase their dividend), safe dividend payouts (companies that have a safe track record of dividend payouts), and low yield high growth (companies that dont have big dividends yet but still have a lot of years of growth ahead of them). There are plenty of ETF's that will do the thinking for you as well."
2021-06-26 09:23:08,stocks,"You have wrong perception about dividends. You want to buy stock with a good dividends, but steady growth. So you would hold for 2-10y, get the price grow and get dividends as a bonus on top of it."
2021-06-26 09:43:26,stocks,"You can also get compound gains on dividend funds. Unless you need the income set it to auto reinvest those dividends into more of the same dividend stocks, then the next time you have more dividends which you can then reinvest for more dividends and so on."
2021-06-26 09:43:04,stocks,">it would take like 60 yrs to even break even with that. Even longer if you bought multiple shares. 

Each share pays out, so even if it *did* take 60 years for the dividend payment to equal the purchase price it wouldn't take longer for multiple shares. 

Of course, the time to get your investment back isn't the point of dividend investing, the point is income. One metric to use when considering a dividend stock is **yield**. In the case of the minis company you mentioned the yield is (annual dividend/share price)=£1.80/113=1.6%. That's a pretty anemic yield. I tend to discard stocks that pay less than 3% and more than 9% but YMMV."

The beauty of dividends in the ability to compound gains. While adding more with your own funds on top of it. Now 53.98 is not going help me retire just yet but it's not bad for just a 100 shares. More than I would have made having that same money in a savings account. And that does NOT include the slight increase in the value of those shares since I bought. I try to add on dips.

2021-06-26 10:01:15,stocks,"Personally, I'm not a fan of dividend stocks unless you're heading towards retirement age and want the extra income/reduced risk.

Most dividend stocks are from stable companies that have a track record of generating cash but their business doesn't grow as much internally. The problem with this is there is a lack of appreciation in stock price and the reason dividends is even issued is to keep investors happy.

If you're not anywhere close to retirement age, IMO, it's preferable to focus on the appreciation of a stock than dividend generating stocks. Reason being is when you're young, you're less likely to generate a significant amount of money from dividends alone due to having less capital. When you're near retirement stage, you should probably think about liquidating some riskier stocks and opt for dividends. $100,000 invested into Verizon would generate roughly $4,500 every year. That's nothing to sneeze at if you're retired. But let's say you are young and only have $10,000 into Verizon, that would only generate $450 every year. If you're young, there is no need to opt for that kind of yield with the better opportunities elsewhere. Focus on adding more to your wealth and when you're older and should limit risk, opt for the safest investments. The last thing you want to do is be old and retired, lose your money in a stock market crash, and then have to unretire. Dividend stocks are generally more stable/suffers less during a crash."
2021-06-26 09:27:42,stocks,IMO dividends are only worth it if your portfolio is at least $1M. With 5% dividend you could at least get a significant amount of fixed income ($50k/year).  I don't get the appeal of receiving an $8 payout with a small portfolio. You might as well just go with quality growth stocks and enjoy the capital appreciation in that case.

I’m not saying your stocks won’t grow if you go down this path but even reinvesting the dividends you won’t see anywhere near the growth of just doing a simple growth ETF or two or buying individual stocks.

If you’re young or young-ish just put money in good growth stocks and ETF’s (QQQ, FAANGA etc.) and then play around with a small % of your money on anything you like after that.

Dividends are just less controlled, less tax advantaged, stock buybacks. Less controlled, because it's dictated by the company when any individual has to sell (in this case receive a dividend distribution). With a stock buyback, you can decide not to sell. Less tax advantaged because it's taxed whenever dividends are issued (even when an investor is in an accumulating phase), and is taxed at the qualified dividend rate, not based on whether or not there were gains/losses in asset value.

Dividends are trash for anyone who actually wants to maximize their returns. The only reason why intelligent people put up with them is because the available alternatives are worse. But the current asset they are invested in that pays dividends would be better if it didn't."

Factor in 401k contributions and company matches, or the massive bull run we’ve had for 10+ years and  becomes a lot more attainable.

There are some that don’t have the money and still pay dividends which is why you need to do research and watch out for these companies. Some companies will pay high yields to attract new investors and they will take on debt to pay the dividend because they cant afford it. Some companies that dont pay dividends because they are not well established and are more focused and putting back in the business than paying shareholders."

You might also get more money as you change jobs or grow older etc so you can adjust what you put in as you save more.

The only thing I would do is a) settle on an amount you’re willing to invest every month and b) make a schedule and stick to this.

E.G the first of every month I’ll put 100 dollars into my account and then divide that between the stocks or ETFs I want.

It will be slow at first and as you’re not investing in meme stocks like GME AMC etc you won’t be like, 200% returns or anything but typically just following this method will get you 10% returns year on year on average.

So in 30 years time that will be pretty fucking nice for minimum effort on your end."

Qualified divs work a lot like long term capital gains. No tax up to $40k for singles, and $80k for married. Then its 15% till you reach a much higher amount. So on $60k they will pay about $3k tax for single and nothing for married. Again assuming no other income."

2021-06-26 15:36:50,stocks,"Probably the wrong sub to post this, but we talking about it here so here it goes: The harsh reality is that over 90% of plastics aren't being recycled. 

Here in the US we pay other countries to take our recycling and ""recycle"" them. Unfortunately, these countries take the money and just dump in the sea or landfills. 

The US doesn't even have recycling facilities anymore. We used to, but because it was cheaper to pay some other country to do it there want enough profit in it they went belly up.

But beside all that, plastics aren't that recyclable. Their chemical composition makes them weaker/less stable if repurposed. So really, we've been sold a feel good story and stamped that recycling symbol on them just to ease our guilty conscience. We simply are not, as a world recycling plastics!

That being said. I offer a solution which is better than complaining and not offering a fix.

Here's the fix: government needs to regulate our packaging.
Aluminum DOES get recycled and can be used over and over indefinitely without becoming a useless product. Glass does as well, but, imo, it is a heavier material and I believe in efficiency (less weight thus less cost to transport etc - perhaps at a more local level it would make more sense). Paper is a renewable(if done correctly) resource and biodegrade. I've seen beer sold from 6 to 24 packs in paper boxes and imo is fine.  

To finish my point: governments around the world can force companies to use a standard bottle and boxing standard. No more plastic window in a box to see a product. Companies will complain about wanting to differentiate and stand out in order to beat their competition. I say tough cookies, hire good designers and make it work with the standard approved packaging. With a streamlined package, this will make it easier to create machines to automate the recycling process. This is important because, currently recycling machines simply aren't designed to handle the myriad different shapes we see these days, so they fail, or get clogged which is costly and time consuming to fix. Once this all comes together we can achieve actual recycling at a cost that should be completely achievable. 

Tldr: we are lied to about recycling. 90%+ of recycling is actually getting dumped in landfills or the sea. govt around world come together to standardize bottles and packaging so they can recycle moar better. Aluminum, glass, paper should be materials used, not plastics (or if they can develop a material/polymer that can be reused indefinitely)."

2. They usually allow you to vote on company policy. However, unless you own a double-digit percentage of the votes, your vote is essentially meaningless, and even then it's meaningless if any other person owns more than 50%.

3. In the future someone may choose to buy the company outright, and you will receive what they pay for it. Historically they offer about 50% above the market price, so that means on any given day you could see a 50% windfall drop in your lap.

4. Every day there are people who are willing to buy the shares you own, and there's a good probability that you will be able to sell for more than you paid.

But they aren't without risk:

4. The information you have about the company is innately incomplete and old. The company never says everything they know. Sometimes the company doesn't know everything about itself. Others will have acted on information by the time you receive it. It could be false in the first place, misrepresented by the people telling it to you, or made obsolete at any time after it's made public.

A share of stock is a percentage ownership in a company. This company has intrinsic and extrinsic value, and the stock’s intrinsic and extrinsic value is directly derived from it. For the purposes of this conversation we can remove extrinsic (perceived value) from both sides of the equation.

A stock / company has assets (physical inventory, intellectual assets / IP, cash ) that directly translate into its intrinsic value.

A baseball card’s intrinsic value is the raw material it’s made of.

A company (and by relation, it’s stock) can increase its intrinsic value by making money through providing goods / services, and in doing so acquire more inventory, cash stores, and intellectual IP.

He has an interest in that price representing value and it does as well as to everyone else who would have interest in buying large sweeping parts of the company. It holds an interest in all those assets and the company as a whole.

The fact that you hold only a fraction of what he has, doesn't matter the same way that holding one dollar and spending it doesn't effect the currencies value because large stakeholders have an interest in the dollar representing value (the US govt for example).

Sure, you are paid $1 per share of stock you own, but now the stock you own is $1 per share less valuable.  Realized gain (in situations without DRIP) goes up while unrealized gain goes down.

Frank: Oh, forgot to mention... I could decide at any time to sell off another part to someone else.  
John: What happens then?  
Frank: Well, I own 75% of the business, right? And you own 25%. That means there are 4 shares altogether. So if I take money from someone else, I'll issue another share and there will be 5 shares. So your share will only be worth 20% of the company at that point.

So until you are a large shareholder you are powerless, but the fact that other entities may or may not want to gain control of the company means YOUR one little share is worth $ because they may want to buy it to increase or get control. For a worst case scenario think corporate raiding.

So this basic principle applies to all stocks even those that pay no dividends.

Ffs the hit/miss ratio of the responses you got really indicates not many in here know even the f'ing basics!

Now what the cost basis may end up being is where all the math and corporate value, profit, growth, etc. get used. But don't confuse all that for the real, basic foundation that allows a share to be worth anything at all: held in the aggregate YOU control the company. Want the majority stake, BUY other people's shares. Even from Podunk retail holders like you holding one whole share because a share is a share."

While a company could cut their dividends,.it would generally not be in the Executives best interest because Executives generally have vested shares.

All this crap about ""the stock represents a piece of the company and therefore has value"" doesn't mean shit. Like that sentence literally doesn't mean anything. I'm sick of reading it. Aside from the dividend OR the belief that someone else will come and buy the stock from yoy for more in the future, there is zero reason to own a stock. Stop this ""your shares represent a stake of the companies value"" yea no shit that's the definition of a stock. That doesn't explain why it has value or why I would want to buy it. 

And yes there are some stocks that do not pay dividends where the ceo has publicly announced that it will NEVER pay dividends. I don't buy those stocks. As soon as people stop putting money into these growth stocks with 0 dividend yield there is absolutely nothing to keep the stock price from dropping off the face of the earth."

2021-06-26 11:34:37,stocks,"If by ""intrinsically valuable"" you mean physically useful, they aren't. Like fiat currency, other currencies, at least part of what makes a stock valuable is based off of law, social contracts, market forces, consensus, supply/demand, symbolic ownership, and other intangible things. Unlike physical materials like gold, silver, iron, uranium, etc., which have physical properties that make it inherently capable of conducting heat, electricity, holding a certain shape or being durable or moldable or resilient to physical forces of stress or pressure, and which carries these properties regardless of whether human society even exists or not. But even materials like gold have a value relationship with other asset classes which is also partly influenced or based off of intangible things like market forces, supply/demand, laws, consensus, etc., so it is not as though there is any single asset which derives its agreed upon value directly from the mouth of God or something."

If your question is what is in the intrinsic value of a share certificate, than just the cost of the ink and piece of paper it's printed on. If you're talking about the stock, then it comes down to what is the intrinsic value based off the rights of being a shareholder. Which will be limited by the class and type of shares you hold, and further limited by the % of shares held, which overall determines your rights and leverage as a shareholder. The extrinsic value is what people would be willing to pay above that value, so if the shares get delisted are they worth nothing, the answer is no...there's still intrinsic value, just might be more difficult in extracting value."

If you can't sell your shares, you'll take a loss or enjoy sitting around thinking about how you have shares.

Theoretically, the company could have $10B in cash with a market cap of $5B. You can't force them to pay you your fair share of that $10B. There's nothing you can do besides find another sucker.

2021-06-26 12:23:37,stocks,"In the old world, what made a stock valuable was its dividend. Most portfolio managers and individual investors were active owners and they basically bought shares of a company 100 at a time to get the dividend every quarter, and if the shares went up in value, that was icing on the cake.

In the new world of near-instant liquidity on most companies (you have to remember, there are millions upon millions of people trading these names. There's always somebody who wants to buy your shares of $TGT or $MCD, if for no other reason than as arbitrage to create shares of an ETF or something), dividend isn't the only factor. Market perception of growth prospects, earnings quality and other things influence the price people are willing to pay.

What makes a stock intrinsically valuable? The company is profitable. Anything else is basically the market assigning extra value to a company because of its prospects. And that's ok - but if something is trading at 55X next year's expected earnings or at 20X sales, the price will be volatile for basically the same reason leveraged positions are volatile."

understanding this fundamental - you can look for companies that are set up in ways that are guaranteed producers of capital (do have intrinsic value) - manufacturer's that have automated/factory warehouses that can produce non-stop - always moving. Money is just a by-product of influence really look for companies that understand how to utilize real world resources - if you own oil/gold/land/transportation/health/etc - there will be value in the company despite its ticker price at all times.

2021-06-26 13:37:58,stocks,"In short, supply and demand gives a stock its value.

I like to think of it by giving extreme examples. Why does a badly performing company's stock lose value? Say in the extreme case, the company is in much debt, and losing money year after year. Eventually, the company goes bankrupt leaving its share holders with nothing. As this realization gets closer to reality, more shares are sold then bought and the stock price approaches 0.

Then we can look at the opposite extreme. A company is doing incredibly well and making great profits every year. In fact it has so much money, it starts giving some of that money back to shareholders as a dividend. This company may even be bought out by a larger company who sees its value and shareholders are rewarded even further. In this case, the company's stock has a very high demand to buy, raising the price up.

There is an argument that if a company does not pay dividends and is too large to be bought out, does it hold no value? The answer is no and the reason being is the expectation that this will change in the future. The best example of this is Apple, which returned no dividends under Steve Jobs but years later with Tim Cook at the helm is providing dividends."

2021-06-26 13:45:33,stocks,"A share of stock is literally a share of ownership of the company.  It has value assuming the company itself has value (which it would, unless the company is in bankruptcy.)  

As a part owner of the company, you can vote at the shareholder meeting for the things they put up for a vote, usually things like hiring a new CEO, board of directors, and so on.  One share = one vote.  Now, granted, your one share/vote out of the millions of ""Outstanding Shares"" isn't going to change the direction of the company, especially if the founder of the company retains more than 50% of the shares, which they usually do.  

The total price of all the outstanding shares is known as the ""Enterprise Value"".  This is what the stock market thinks that company is worth.  If the company is *actually* worth more than that (which can be a highly subjective judgement that even the pros get wrong sometimes) then the stock would be considered ""undervalued"" and therefore a good buy.  And the opposite is true.

The job of the stock market is to provide ""liquidity"".  At any point in time, you will be able to buy or sell your stock at the current market price.  (You might not *like* the current market price, but that's another story.)  The stock market does this by continuously adjusting the price of the stock until buyers and sellers are equal.  So if everybody sells and nobody is buying, the price will crash down until people start buying.  (You saw this in March 2020 when Covid first hit.)  And the reverse is true:  If everybody is buying and nobody is selling, the price will shoot up TO THE MOON!!! until people start selling.  (You saw this with, for example, GME.)"

If that house was instead owned by a company that owned the house do you see how the company has about the same value as the house itself?  Now imagine the company has 100 shares and you only owned one of them.  Do you see how you still have 1% of the value of the whole thing?  Now imagine instead of sending the rent to the shareholders the company just collected the rent and bought another house when it had enough money to do so and does this indefinitely.  This is analogous to never paying dividends, but the shareholders still own all the properties.  The company could be dissolved and all the properties sold to the shareholders, so the company's value is highly related to the value of the assets held.  Finally, there's nothing special in this scenario about the underlying assets being houses.  They can be businesses, intellectual property, mines, etc.  The assets have some value they can be sold for, they generate some amount of revenue, and require some amount of upkeep.

Management and board who do not have a solid plan for that eventuality will find themselves without a job. Now, in theory, whether a company use the profit it made to bb, dividend, pay its debt, or capex SHOULD HAVE NO effect on its stock price. But humans are emotional creatures and just the news that a company will issue dividend and bb tend to be a catalyst for an undervalued company to revert to the mean.

This is actually one of Buffet's tried-and-true tactics. He bought companies with solid cash flow, befriend management, and gently ""nudge"" the company toward share bb. This usually serve as a catalyst for the company's stock price to appreciate, and if the stock price substantially overshoot its mean, at which point Buffet would exit some of his position. Rinse and repeat (eg., AAPL, supermarket, etc.) 

Note: this only applies to robust capitalist systems where the equity investors actually hold sway and their votes actually control the company in a literal sense. In the US market, just the fact that a company is making more profit is enough to push the stock price higher because of the implicit understanding that eventually management would return capital to shareholders. This does not apply to quasi-capitalist systems like China, for example, because that implicit understanding is not guaranteed (hence the discount that stocks like BABA have compared to its US counterparts)."

For stocks without dividends, the value for a common person investing comes from the expectation that the stock price will rise, meaning it can be sold to other investors at a higher price.

Arriving at such an opinion (or hope) can include analysis of the company, their metrics and so on.  But it's only relevant to the individual investor in the sense that others will also hopefully make the same conclusions and also want to buy the stock.

2021-06-26 15:56:05,stocks,"The whole concept of the stock market can be really hard to understand.

Summed up, as stupid as it sounds, it's belonging to the economical sector and originated in raising capital while others that were wealthy now had a share (meaning a literal share, not a stock share) and profited off of that. It's the same concept as paying money into a company trying to raise capital, and now you are entitled to a part of the earnings, and you can affect certain decisions.

In my opinion, this is fully lost nowadays. With the stock market, you pretty much have an entity behind this entire process that allows you to trade it. That means the process can exist without a stock market, but the stock market can't exist without the process.

When you talk about intrinsically value, you talk about ignoring everything belonging to the stock market and only consider the actual company - so everything that belongs to inside the company. While it's still very important, the backbone of the stock market is obviously the players that play it. Without them, nothing would happen any more.

Edit: The reason I mention both sides only matters if you control a majority or even the entire company, because you could buy equity worth way more with way less money and technically sell the company or forfeit it. But realistically speaking, a company won't allow that to happen by holding a majority if possible, unless they are in real trouble. But if they are, then you wouldn't want to do above mentioned."

For example, let’s say someone was selling there were local entrepreneurs selling their small business. This local small business has net assets of $100k, and annually earnings of $20k. How much would you buy this business for? $10k? Probably too low. $1m? Probably too much. Maybe $200k? Whatever it may be, there is some sort of sweet spot someone would buy this business for based on xyz criteria like desired retune on investment so an on.

Some thing goes for publicity traded companies - it’s just that it’s literally imperceivable to imagine buying a company for $2 trillion.

So you have to think about it like this: if you owned Apple in its entirety - how much would you sell it for? Now take that price, divide it up in a bunch of pieces and sell some of your ownership pro-rata relative to the total amount you’d sell it for. And the thing is, you’d HAVE to sell each piece at the same amount - otherwise for obvious reasons it wouldn’t any make sense whatsoever. 

So this basically why each small piece, even if it’s .00000001% of ownership has value.

This in turn gives you an indirect way to control whether or not those eventual dividends might come as well as to indirectly fire CEO's that aren't managing the profit growth of the company. Yes, one singular share doesn't give you much \*actual\* control in this regard, but it is at least as equally proportional as your \*actual\* share of the profits and therefore theoretical dividends."

2021-06-26 19:33:16,stocks,"what drives value is the present value of future cash flows a shareholder expects to value. I wrote this long ago:[The Concept of Valuation.](https://budgeting.thenest.com/concept-valuation-32138.html) (Neal Stephenson fans will recognise my pen name there)

All assets can be valued, be they stocks, bonds, derivatives, real estate, personal property and many others. It can be difficult to reconcile your own ideas about the market value of a security with other ideas you may hold about what the asset is worth to you. You may have heard other people say that an illiquid security, such as privately held stock in a small company, is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. In a sense this is true, although a hypothetical deal price is only one of many baselines for determining the value of a security.

Purpose And Standard Of ValueThe purpose of the valuation typically determines what standard of value is used. Standards of value include fair market value, fair value, investment value and orderly liquidation value, among others. Fair market value is a notional value. If you purchased a minority interest in a closely held company that has never distributed earnings to shareholders and never intends to, you may feel strongly that the value of the interest is zero. You cannot sell it, because no secondary market exists for the company’s stock. However, the company may still be profitable and growing, which is accounted for in a notional value. A hypothetical strategic buyer of the whole company may estimate the company’s investment value to be higher than its fair market value due to expected synergies, financial benefits generated by increased scale, it expects to earn post-transaction.

Cash Flow And RiskUltimately, all valuations are driven by cash flow, risk and growth. This applies across all asset classes. Real estate, equity, derivatives and fixed income securities are all valued based on the present value of the cash flows it is expected to generate during its lifetime. Cash flows are forecasted and the present value factor is determined using an appropriate discount rate reflecting the risk associated with an investment in the security. The challenge is to accurately estimate future cash flows and the uncertainty associated with the accuracy of the estimates.

Universal MethodologiesThree basic approaches are used to value all securities: the asset-based, income and market approach. In valuing real estate using the market approach, cash flows are represented by dollars per square foot, and comparable property sales are obtained to determine the average market price per square foot. In valuing stocks, comparable transactions of similar companies are used to develop valuation ratios applied to the subject company’s financial metrics such as earnings and cash flow. Valuation ratios such as price to earnings used in the market approach are used to convert income streams into value. This is the same purpose discount rates are used for, to calculate the present value factor applied to future income streams.

Net Asset ValueIn certain cases, such as in real estate, the reproduction cost of a property can also be considered a proxy for valuation. A property is generally worth the approximate cost to build it. Similarly, if a company is not profitable, investors may find that the most value that can be extracted from an investment in the company may be via its orderly liquidation. If the present value of future cash flows is lower than the book value of a company, this demonstrates that a low return of assets is being generated and the value of the company is captured within the liquidation value of assets it may hold such as cash and real estate."

my personal answer i tried to test here: you cant get to the company's cash/assets etc with one stock but you can with a lot of stock. So someone will pay for your single stock in order to get a critical amount. (in an imaginary market situation where all supply/demand rules are removed)

THAT imo is the ultimate intrinsic value mechanism of a stock."

Dividends never need to be paid to make shares valuable - this is a common fallacy about investing.  Most of what makes companies valuable is the value of their assets - not future dividend growth."

Take an example company $XYZ that has a market cap of $10M, and earns $1M each year which it pays out in full as dividends. So by your logic, the company will have a market cap of 0 after 10 years, and a negative valuation after more than 10 years?

Clearly this is wrong. If giving money out decreases the valuation, then earning money also increases the valuation. Or really, both are priced in ahead of time."

2021-06-26 15:51:11,stocks,"It’s not a wash over time though. A stock that pays dividends won’t eventually fall to $0 just from paying dividends, and if you stay in long enough, eventually you will have received more in dividends than you invested in the stock. For example, you bought $100 worth of a $5 stock that pays $0.15 quarterly dividends… after 13 years, even with no reinvesting or buying any additional shares, you would have received $104 from dividends (more than your initial investment) and still own the 20 shares you originally purchased. That is not a wash, and definitely not “worth exactly nothing”."

Owning an equity portion of a business that owns physical things is literally intrinsic value. There is basically no business on the exchanges that doesn't meet this bar.

2021-06-26 11:34:02,stocks,"Not necessarily.  If a company doesn't pay a dividend it's most likely early in its life cycle and is still growing/maturing.  As a shareholder/part owner of a company you would most likely prefer that this young company would retain those earnings and use it to reinvest in itself, expand or take on additional endeavors.  So that in the future when it is a mature company it's making more profits and therefore can yield  larger dividends as well as would have grown further in market cap.  

Remember dividends reduce a company's ability to grow.  And a company that gives dividends too early could hurt the share price or market cap of a company if investor sentiment is that it's way too early for dividends and they're shooting themselves in the foot by doing so."

I remember when a Dennis Rodman rookie card would increase or decrease in value based on the color of his hair any given day, but the price of his card did nothing to make him a better rebounder or look better in a dress. However, a higher stock price can be good for a company for several reasons, which in turn increases share value and investor interest. Higher share prices could mean retention and productivity of employees who are sometimes incentivized with shares, or it could mean better borrowing ability for secondary offerings (usually not good news for traders but long-term investors don’t mind), and either protects against or favorably leverages takeovers, acquisitions, buyouts, etc.  Otherwise, after the initial capital raised from publicly issuing shares through investment banks, a stock’s share price is largely a capricious popularity contest subject to the devices of MMs and investors.

2021-06-26 14:21:28,stocks,"Exactly, if the company does.t pay a dividend the stock is basically just a collectible. Alot of people try to argue that this is advantageous to the investor because the company can reinvest those dividends into the company, but reinvestment into the company is a moot point if you don't get a dividend. There is nothing sitting behind your shares to give your shares value if there is no dividend. The only way for your shares to have value at that point is for you to sell them to so.eone else who believes they have value.

If the company doesn't pay a dividend then as soon as people decide they don't want to hold their shares, there is absolutely nothing to prop up the price of the underlying.

I never buy shares of companies that don't pay dividends unless I'm selling covered calls against them."

Until then because theres limited supply, the price can rise with demand. At one point Amazon had negative income but share price increased because a lot of investors (correctly) felt that they would one day dominate a market, print literal money, and start returning it to investors."
2021-06-26 13:47:09,stocks,"No, it literally gives you claim on a portion of the company and by extention, it's cashflows. You can't necessarily decide what the company does with the cashflows but you have a stake of whatever they decide to do (hopefully use those cashflows to make more)."
2021-06-26 14:27:42,stocks,"Companies hold assets. Examples of this are anything from factories, inventory, patents, stakes in other companies, and cash or other cash like securities. Theoretically if the company were to dissolve and liquidate the value of those assets would be passed to the shareholders (assuming more senior debt holders, such as bond holders, did not get everything).

An example, Facebook as of the end of 2020 had a tangible book value of $108,617,000,000. It also has 2.4 billion outstanding shares. Meaning that if Facebook were to decide to shutdown today shareholders would theoretically get about $45. Now that clearly is a lot less than $341.37 per share that it closed at on Friday. The remainder of that ($341.37 - ~$45 = ~$296.37) is due to the fact that people expect that Facebook will continue to grow, increase their assets, and continue to put out a dividend. But if we were to pretend that everyone believed that Facebook would not make or lose any money going forward, and thus be unable to pay a dividend and have no change in their tangible book value, the stock would be worth ~$45 per share. 

Obviously Facebook is not going to just shutdown and probably won't liquidate all of it's assets to payout a massive $45 dividend to shareholders, so shares is what allows a shareholder to realize the value of the equity they have."

Then the value clearly decreases, potentially to 0. However, if stockholders of a company decide to do this, you could buy up all shares for 0.0000000001$ per share let’s say, and you will end up owning a company that is generating revenue, maybe even making profit, which you can pay out to yourself as dividend."

2021-06-26 12:57:22,stocks,"The intrinsic value is the value the object is worth. For a stock, that takes into account the number of available shares, the cash holdings, the annual revenue, etc, etc, and returns a value that each share is worth.

This value is not necessarily the same as the trading value, which is the speculative value that buyers and sellers have, based on many of the same factors.

If the intrinsic value, the value based directly on the company data, is above the trading value, then the stock is said to be ""undervalued"" and pressure comes as people buy more shares to try and reach that value.

But if Rich McCompany is worth a trillion dollars and it has a billion shares being passed around, then each share should be worth about $1000"

2021-06-26 14:57:10,stocks,"GME was an example of how hype can overwhelm intrinsic values.

Gamestop was **never** worth $20,000 (going with your example), and the increase in share price doesn't change its real valuation. It still has the same $3000 worth of assets, which does not change with the stock price. A little more than what the stock level suggested because of the short selling, and a lot less than what it suggests with the overinflated price.

The overinflated price of $200, suggesting $20,000 value, represents a bubble that will in time pop, causing the price per share to plummet. And *for the most part*, this all doesn't affect the day to day of GameStop stores or employees.

2021-06-26 19:18:39,stocks,"> Is stock price purely based on supply and demand?

Pretty heavily, just like any other thing. But the supply is based on how many people want out of the business, and demand is based on how many people want in.

In the GameStop example, there were a lot of people short-selling, which is when you sell shares you don't have in return for a promise to buy them back later. Regular people got wind of the move and bought up the outstanding shares, which raised the price above the point where the shorters sold.

The buyers then refused to sell and get the money out, while the shorters refused to buy back until the price went down. The only trading that happened after these moves were based on the higher price levels, as there was effectively no supply and high demand.

As for the prophetic aspect, the intrinsic value of the company acts as the way to stop the prices from rising or falling too far, and to correct overshooting of the prices, given enough time."

Let’s pretend we have two companies, X and Y, who are exactly the same.

Company X, valued at $50, pays out a dividend of $1, they’re now valued at $49.  So on the dividend date you’ve got $49 in stock, and $1 in your pocket.

Company Y, valued at $50, doesn’t pay out a dividend and remains valued at $50.

So tell me the difference between those two companies?  (Spoiler: there isn’t one).  Company X didn’t lose valuation.  They chose to pay out their shareholders which readjusted their price.  Company Y chose not to pay shareholders, which maintained their price.

A dividend is not an advantage to non dividend stocks.  Nor is it a disadvantage.  Two equally valued companies are still effectively worth the same whether they pay a dividend or not.  You totally misinterpreted the entire point of my post."

 Now, obviously there are a myriad of circumstances that would contribute to the stock price raising or lowering over your time period.  But the dividend alone would have absolutely no bearing on how much you’ve made from the stock.  That $104 will either be reflected in a payout for dividend stocks or in an increase in share price for non-dividend stocks.  The dividend itself has not made you money.  Period.

A dividend is the company passing on its profit to shareholders.  A company that doesn’t pass it on to shareholders instead sees its share price increase by the amount that would have been paid out by a dividend.  This is an important concept to grasp when choosing your style of investing."

There are plenty of stocks that have 1-2 Price-to-book ratios - value stocks. Their cash flows aren't discounted so far out into the future.

&#x200B;

For how the future cash flows of the company will pay out, you must use a forecast model such as [discounted future earnings.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discounted-future-earnings.asp) Growth companies (such as Amazon, or more egregiously Tesla) have their earnings discounted waaaayyyy out into the future, barring extremely positive surprises in their earnings.

&#x200B;

It literally does not matter if the company just sticks the money it makes in its balance sheets and buys treasuries, pays out dividends or buys back shares. It does not matter. The only things that change this expected return is how much the company expects to earn on it if it reinvests in itself (which they usually do), and taxes on dividends paid or future capital gains taxes on shares you sell to realize profits. Either way, money is money, regardless if it's in the company's balance sheets or in your brokerage account.

2021-06-26 12:58:22,stocks,"> The reason stocks are intrinsically valuable is because the company, if its making enough money, may do things to reward investors like dividends or stock buybacks.

This is totally wrong. Stocks represent a portion of ownership in a company, which either makes money or has a theoretical plan to make money. Stock prices are a reflection of expected earnings. Expect earnings to rise? That means the company will be worth more, so ownership (stock) in the company will be worth more.

It has nothing at all to do with dividends or buybacks; these are just potential side effects of a company making money.

2021-06-26 16:03:58,stocks,"If the company does have positive net assets and make earnings, and appears likely to be able to continue that, then unless there's some big problem lurking (e.g. large lawsuits against it) I'll probably gladly buy all of the company's shares for at least $1 (in total).  Someone else would probably outbid me, and so on, and so on.  It should converge to something at least as high as their net assets plus some multiple of their future annual earnings, as one could get more money than they put in from those two sources.  Sure, if there's a lot of uncertainty then that multiplier might be low, but there should be a positive value for owning this positive income source.

For this reason, in practice a functioning company typically won't get to $0.00.  It might get to $0.03 or something, and with enough shares that could still be way too expensive, but $0.00 times a lot is still $0.00, which is cheap for a non-bankrupt business.  And delisting doesn't mean it's worth $0.00, just that it doesn't meet the standards of the exchange it had been on."

They are not by default intrinsically valuable.  Valid arguments are that you can accumulate enough to sway voting decisions, you can collect dividend, you can expect stock buy back, you can expect company buy outs.

But barring these mechanisms, they don't hold value IMO.  All value on the market derives from expectation or speculation on the above events taking place.  A company never needs to pay dividend, perform stock buybacks, may never be purchased for cash, and doesn't even have to issue shares with voting rights.  In this case, I would say their shares offer no intrinsic value"

The key with value investing is to only buy at a discount so even if future earnings do not grow you still have upside potential, especially over the long haul. 

I guess it depends on the company/sector. Some you may buy because of the value of the assets and others you may buy because of the cashflows.

As for stocks worth, you don't even need to have potential dividends and buybacks I don't get why Reddit is so stuck on that every time this question comes up. A company can promise it will *never* return cash to shareholders yet the market will give it a (more or less) appropriate valuation. Another way to look at it would be ""what would it be worth for a private acquirer"". A stock won't stray too far down (more or less) from it's fair value as it just creates arbitrage for an acquirer to come it and buy it as a whole, hence a company promising to never return cash will still get a significant stock price. You have a legal claim to a part of a business, market will do the rest and value businesses as wholes and you get to buy or sell your claims at its price.

**Edit:** I'd add, returning cash to shareholders is not fundamentally different from reinvesting it in the company, it's just a choice of capital allocation. From that premise, the ""promise of future dividends/buybacks"" is not different the ""promise of reinvested earnings"", hence cannot be what gives worth to stocks if you agree with the statement."

More commonly, AFAIK (which is not that much), you'll make deals with large shareholders to buy their (cumulatively controlling) stakes in a single transaction, with a built-in premium of course. 

As for the other shareholders, it's not like you rip them off either, when you liquidate the company and split the proceeds they get their due, which'll be worth more then their stock was (why else go thru the hassle and nasty business of firing people otherwise).

As for Buffett, you can Google around ""cigar butts"" or ""Graham"" related queries, maybe with Munger too as he's the one which got him to change his approach (from fair business at great price to great business at fair price), I recall a Munger video interview specifically on the topic.

Usually in these situations where someone is interested, the investor just makes an offer for 20-30% above current market cap to buy the entire company outright and the board votes yes or no. This is usually the most cost effective for everyone as the shares aren't liquid enough as you suspected, and current shareholders might like an instant 20-30% return. 

Another option is to buy up 10% or so, then you can possibly get a seat on the board of directors or have the board of directors take your phone call. They'll often listen to a super rich businessman shareholder giving them advice on how to grow the company."

OJ Simpson football cards skyrocketed in value when he was arrested, along with a lot of his other memorabilia. Same with Mike Tyson after the Holyfield incident.

But if Bill Gates were to kill his wife, it would probably hurt the stock price of Microsoft, because the CEO is going to be caught up in legal troubles, not running the company.

Generally, if stocks are underpriced, companies should be doing share buybacks. In fact, investors can even force this on the companies if the companies are not doing this. If the stock is too undervalued, investors can just directly sell the stock to the companies. After all, the company is getting more money per dollar on the trade and is also benefiting the investor who is getting screwed by the unfairness of the auction market system. In that sense, you know if prices are too underpriced, you have a near guarantee (the company you own) of a buyer of your share,

&#x200B;

Also, how do you think companies buy off other companies or form relationships with other companies? They do so by buying/selling the stocks.

And stocks have value because of the big players. If the price is too cheap of say Microsoft, every institution would buy off as much shares as possible and take control of that company. Likewise, if the price is too high, every institution will wait out because it doesn't want to overpay.

Shareholders with significant holdings of a company has huge influence to the company. And it's because of those major players that everyday people like us benefit from the price discovery.

Don't forget on top that the true value of a stock is the current assets + all its future cash flows. Because one day, at worst case scenario, the company can be liquidated and you will receive exactly that. So if Microsoft was declared out of business tomorrow, then you will get all the underlying parts of Microsoft as a shareholder. This includes the cash portion too. So stock by its intrinsic price CANNOT be zero (cause you are GUARANTEED to receive money when the company closes). Ideally, stocks should be priced by current assets + discounted future cash flow. Unfortunately, figuring out the discounted 'future' cash flow is very difficult and in a day to day, people are voting with their beliefs that the stock price will be worth more in the future.

Short term is like a voting machine. Long term tends to be more of a weighing machine."

2021-06-26 13:14:58,stocks,"True.  By my definition, a share which provides no voting rights has no intrinsic value.  But if it provides reliable dividends, then maybe it has a flavor of speculative value that is ""high probability"".  If it has been reliably climbing in price, then maybe that's worth something too.  It is worth distinguishing between levels of probability, when speculating.  Too many people hear the word ""speculative"" and react gutterally.  They say ""I'm not speculating; it's a sure thing!""  And maybe that's mostly true.  But risk is risk, a tiny amount is a tiny amount, and it's worth remembering that it exists.  Any amount of future prediction of risk constitutes speculation, by definition.

A bucket of pebbles doesn’t sell products. It doesn’t earn money by selling things. And it won’t start selling things or earning money at any point in the future. You could buy a bucket of pebbles for a million dollars, it would be a bad investment because they have no intrinsic value. The value is wholly dependent on finding someone to pay more for them... but that prospect is very very dim. 

When you buy a company, it is earning money. Or, at the very least, it has the prospects of making money in the future. You could pay a million dollars for some very shitty stock, that would be a bad investment. But the stock wouldn’t have zero intrinsic value. The value is quite literally what is on its books and what it’s earnings are. That’s people, real people, paying money for products, real products, and the company making money, real money. That is intrinsic value. And it’s reflected in the stock price. 

Now there’s a caveat to this. People overpay for stocks all the time. They might do this because they don’t understand the stock market. They might do this because they believe that the company is going to do much better than people expect, and the price will rise accordingly. Nevertheless, a stocks price can rise far beyond its instrinsic value if there’s enough speculation. That doesn’t mean there is no intrinsic value. It just means that you’re paying a lot more for less."

Nonetheless, it's from the same tree of value investing. 

You might enjoy reading early BPL and Berkshire shareholder letters, they're obviously aged but it's interesting to see the man's thought process.

And that head of lettuce doesn't even have the staying power of a baseball card. The lettuce is made to be eaten, and if it doesn't, it expires.

Any thing, tangible or intangible can be put through such analysis and determine an appropriate cost. That is what people do when they play the stock market. They see good news coming from Amazon, so they buy, which raises the price. They see bad news coming from Tesla, so they sell, which lowers the price. Generally because that good or bad news will be reflected in the overall valuation.

The speculative aspect comes into play when a stock gets overvalued or undervalued. There is a bunch of hype for SpaceX, which brings a lot of buyers to Tesla, which raises the price a lot, but the company ends up not making money on the project. The stock ends up worth more than the company, and people sell off based on that.

Or the other way, people might sell McAfee after the founder's apparent suicide, lowering the stock price, but because John McAfee isn't part of the company anymore, it doesn't mess with their sales at all. So the people buy back in."

Also think of stock as ownership in a business. If i and 3 friends opened a business abs each had 25% stake, and i know the business was worth 1 mill in fcf meaning we all get paid 250k each just for being equal partners, i wouldn’t sell my shares to someone offering me a lumpsum payment of 100k, but i would consider someone offering my 5mill because that would be 20 years worth of the income i generate on owning my shares in the business. 

That’s what stocks are, a tiny fraction of ownership in a business, and you evaluate buying or selling based on how it pays you. Market price are the offers you get for your ownership stake. 

So if i own 10 shares of Ko at $50, and based on the dividend, buybacks and growth of the company i know it’s worth $55, and someone in the market offers to buy it for $60. I would have to evaluate if that “cash out” in ownership for me is worth more than the “income” i could generate from owning the shares.

If my neighbor gives me a document that says I own 10% of his assets, it's only a fun paper exercise unless he provides me a way to eventually get the value of 10% of his assets.  I need to be confident that at some point he'll pay out a dividend on his assets, or that someone will buy his house for cash, or that I can vote on his spending and have some control.

Consider you owned a share in a private company, there is no market to value your stock at a daily basis based of demand, so the price is dictated by the underlying books. You wouldn't care if someone came and bid you 5 dollars for a stock if you know its worth 10 instrinsicly. And since banks, pension funds, anyone with money basically is seeking returns higher than inflation so their savings don't erode, there is a buyers market for anything which provides good return. and if that market dissappears there must be an underlying catalyst or a better long-term investment."
2021-06-26 15:18:13,stocks,"This is a simple example, as most companies do have future earnings. In my last example, I tried to capture the value of expected earnings. 

The $110 valuation is assuming the company doesn’t perform into perpetuity. If the discounted cash flow of future earnings perceived by the market of the company is $550 in today’s dollars, then you would add the value of the equity/retained earnings to the discounted cash flow of all future earnings.

The fair value and drivers of supply in demand aren’t arbitrary. Supply and demand are driven by what the value or utility of something is.

Valuing a company involves several estimates and assumptions, and that is why the value of almost any company will fluctuate a lot. Each difference in assumption and estimate can change the value of the company because we don’t know with certainty about the technology in the future, interest rates, the amount of money supply people have, etc.

If a GIC returns 2% per year at the risk free rate, then a GIC that matures at $1,200 in one year should go for $1,000 today and people wouldn’t arbitrarily pay $1,500 for this GIC and rational investors or banks wouldn’t sell the GIC for $800 just because they supposedly perceive more value in the GIC akin to the baseball card example. The supply and demand will converge on the fair value of the GIC ie $1,200, and market makers will exchange this instrument at this price.

With equities, there are inefficiencies and several more assumptions and risks compared to the GIC, so “perceived value” will be different based on each rational investor’s assumptions. Over time, as earnings materialize, we have may have less uncertainty over the earnings and the equity of the company, and thus the price that people will pay for the stock will converge and approach its fair value.

This is pretty bare bones, so there are a ton of exceptions where this won’t hold true in the short term."

If I was a huge company, and had the capital to buy this company, I could take a public company private and sell all of their assets and pay out a one time dividend out to the owners.

And history has shown that not to be the case in reality, especially so with recent events. Doesn't that prove that the link to fair value is purely speculative?"

So…a dividend?"

I am saying the value is pure sentiment.

Buybacks and dividends are the only concrete values of a stock."
2021-06-26 17:58:56,stocks,Let me ask a question that I already know the answer to. Have you ever taken a course in finance? YouTube videos don’t count. We’re not arguing philosophy here. Just because you don’t understand the concept doesn’t mean everyone who does understand it is wrong.
2021-06-26 16:12:31,stocks,"Well it depends what you mean. In the short term, I believe there are tons of inefficiencies and there is less overall volume in a few days to few months span of time. In the long run, I believe the average will be pretty close to the fair value, just as the more earnings that are actually capitalized, the more of an asset base there is to base the valuation with certainty. 

What I mean by this, is that if you earn $100 per year in net income, but there is a new product line that you speculate could either produce $50 more per year or $1,000 per year. After a year, if it actually produces $1,000, then you have capitalized $1,000 into the company and now this has increased your floor price valuation by $1,000 because you will materialize this $1,000 and you now “own” a portion of this $1,000 that has materialized"

I don't know why you're playing this angle though.  You haven't contributed to the OP's original question.  Just saying that by buying stock you own a portion of earnings isn't what was asked.

You can try to discredit me, or you can say why I'm wrong.  I've said why I don't think your explanation is correct, but I haven't seen you directly address my perspective.  I'm fine with being wrong, but I don't respond to your ""appeal to authority"" fallacy.  I expect to understand the perspective before I'll just say that I'm wrong.

The question was ""so what can a single stock do that gives it intrinsic value""."
2021-06-26 11:58:04,stocks,"The staying power of that object is probabilistic, not realized, and is therefore a factor in its speculative value, not in its intrinsic value.  The intrinsic value of an object is about what it can provide you physically, here and now.  Here and now, a head of lettuce can provide you with sufficient nutrition for a few hours (maybe a few days) of life.  And if you ask any life insurance company, that is actually translatable to a specific sum of money.  What is the equivalent sum when you're talking about a non-dividend-paying stock?"
2021-06-26 12:15:37,stocks,"Life has value, even just a few hours worth, and just a little bit.  What you're realizing is that intrinsic values of many things, in the world, have separated widely from their speculative values.  The intrinsic value of a stock is a debatable definition.  The simplest is current company assets divided by number of stocks in circulation.  But if you do that calculation for pretty much any stock in the world today, you'll come up with a number that is shockingly low compared to market prices of that stock.  So people justify purchasing those stocks anyway with speculative predictions.  Some of those predictions have an extremely high probability of coming to pass, and therefore a lot of those people will take issue with me for using the term ""speculative"" at all; it's kindof a pejorative in many investor circles.  But hear me out.  Getting back to predictions... For example, if the company is making money at all, then next week's income has a very high probability of looking like last week's income, and similarly, next week's expenses have a high probability of looking like last week's expenses .  So high, that many people would argue that it's a given and it's part of a company's intrinsic value.  But it's not a given, and that's why when black swan events hit they hit so hard.  And as you look further and further into the future, the more and more likely it is that reality will diverge from this pattern.  And then of course, investors realize that, so they try to predict what that change will look like based on world market conditions and trends and directions that the company is taking.  And some folks factor all of that into a company's intrinsic value too.  But at that point, the intrinsic value has become such a debatable thing that it is no longer intrinsic.  It is, by literal definition, speculative."
2021-06-26 13:27:36,stocks,"No.

But the value of the stock is."
2021-06-26 18:15:49,stocks,"Sigh. I’ll answer again. Stock is real ownership of a company. A company has real value. That value is based on real assets and cash flows. If those real assets and cash flows increase in value, the company increases in value. And if the company increases in value, then the stock, which is ownership of that company, increases in value. Doesn’t matter if it’s one share or a billion, every individual share costs the same price. Even if you don’t have a huge ownership stake, it’s still a stake and your share has the same value that each share held by the majority owner has. 

If a company has zero assets and zero cash, it might still have a stock price. But it would be a bad investment. In that case you could say it has no intrinsic value. 

But for stocks for real companies with real assets and real cash flows, that is intrinsic value. If you want to put money in your pocket, you have two options. Buy a stock that pays out dividends, or sell a stock after a few months, years, decades has made the stock more valuable through the company’s growth."
2021-06-26 13:29:28,stocks,Yes. Put far more eloquently then I ever could.
2021-06-26 14:35:12,stocks,You are asking the right questions here. Thank you. I'm hoping for an answer to this as well.
2021-06-26 18:29:04,stocks,"I don't think saying the same this is working well.  You're definitely giving the econ 101 answer which obviously has it's place.  The op asked what a single share can do that gives it intrinsic value.  My previous argument was that your single share holds value for events such as dividends, buy outs, and whatever other causes result in liquidation.  There's also value in holding it hostage against entities which might actually want a controlling interest.  All shares cost the same because of these things.  Of course your explanation is correct on some level, but I think the OP is asking about the mechanisms that directly link the shares to the theoretical value you keep talking about.  What would you say about shares issued against a company that stated they would never offer dividends and in which those shares had no voting rights?  If you're saying there's intrinsic value outside of all the mechanisms I discussed, please tell me how to get that value without actually talking about perceived value on the market.

Yes you can always sell it on the market for the market price, but what is driving that market price?  I would argue it's more than just the theoretical idea that you have a portion of the company, since that's unactionable."

It's a valid point imo, but with streaming they can go global (and will hit 22 more counties by 2022)

Pluto does look good so far tho.     
I'd still say even with risks a PE of 11 would make more sense personally and honestly the next 1 or 2 quarters will define if they should be a PE 20+ company as it will give clearer picture of subscriber growth which can be mapped with the future expansion plans."

The screener actually has a ton of data you can look at once you run your screen also, but I like going to the filings bc you can find unbelievable data there you won't find anywhere else."
2021-06-26 14:01:13,stocks,"Hi Friend, 

Rather than doing deep dives I strongly suggest you focus on historic revenue / profit growth and future revenue / profit projections.   These are by far the most reliable indicators of future performance and the easiest to learn.

Projections are extremely important.  They represent the combined knowledge of the ""deep dives"" of several or even dozens of highly trained analysts.   Any one of these analysts may have strong biases that would lead their analysis astray (note the wide spread in projections for many companies).  However, combining their projections into mean and median projections tends to counter the biases and give a moderately reliable indication of future prospects of a company.  And in fact these combined analyses are the standard by which all stocks are judged on earnings day, so it pays to know them.  

Stick to companies with a history of >15% annual revenue growth over the previous five years and the same for the future 1-2 years.  Always look at the 5-10yr price chart.  The last few years at least should be a solid uptrend. 

I suggest before investing you do a stock screen for ""mid cap"" companies with >15% revenue growth over the last five years.  I just did one and it gave 121 companies.  Now look at the 10 year chart for every company.  Set the chart axis to ""Log"".  Make a list of the companies with a strong, solid, continuous 3-5yr uptrend.  This indicates that the company has a product that can drive increasing sales.  

Here are some examples of great charts: PODD, CHGG, RNG, SMAR, PANW, PEN, PAYC

Here are some examples of shitty charts: TAP, APPN, PLAN,  LNG, BMRN, BERY, ATHM

Here are some examples of ""tweeners"": ALNY, ANET, CZR, DBX

The ""tweeners"" are on an uptrend but the ride is pretty wild.  Avoid that until you get more experience.  

Here are two other interesting charts: FATE, ENPH

Look at each with the linear and log axis.  See how changing the axis to log shows you the growth trend better?  With the 10yr chart in linear mode, these look like companies with a wild recent price spike.  With that same chart in log mode, you can see the company has a very strong growth trend.  IMO you should avoid these until you get more experience because they can turn around very rapidly!  But keep an eye on this kind of stock and see how it plays out. 

After you cull out companies by the charts, start looking at the revenue growth.  Cull out the companies with recent downturns or flats.  After that, look at the forward revenue growth.  Choose the companies with the strongest projections.  Then look for a price point - even if you have to wait a month or two - and buy.  Start with small positions ($0.5K-$2K)and work up as you gain confidence.  

Remember that big companies that have made hundreds of billions of dollars for their investors took many decades to reach their current size - don't listen to this bullshit of ""don't follow trends"".  In fact you \*\*MUST\*\* follow trends - at least if you want to be a successful investor.   It's true that ""past performance doesn't guarantee future performance"".  It doesn't guarantee it, but it's the best indication available of future performance.  

Good luck man!"

Some people believe you can win by using ""fundamentals"" and they say ""if a company has assets of x value, the stock can't fall below y"" but they conveniently leave out that the supposed assets are actually very volatile.

Think about it. You can make trades off single tweets, off news, off your own personal convictions. The more information you have, the more informed your decision is. You can call an online company and find out that their customer support is the worst thing ever and that can count as DD for both a bear or bull case depending on how you perceive it to change. Or you can read through a companys financial statements to find out they are accumulating debt but at the same time investing the money into a growth scenario that is, in your opinion, ready to boom. Or you might read a wsb post that is ""DD"" and see the growing enthusiasm of a thousand people making it a possibility that it's a short-term options play.

I like seeing debt. Cost of debt is super cheap right now. Fed fund rate is around zero! That's why you see huge companies with tons of cash still issuing debt. If a company has not debt or low debt, that probably means no one wants to lend to them. On the other side, you also don't want to see too much debt! 

Synergy based M&A is when Company A buys Company B for ""synergies"". Most studies on M&A have shown that these ""synergies"" are never realized at scale.

That said, if the company buys another company for IP, to add a business line, or acquiring a new market then I'm more likely to be on board"

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"The outcome of our current market cycle The market has experienced many important financial events including recessions and bubbles, but when do we know when those events occur and how do we profit from them? According to [fidelity,](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/sector-investing-business-cycle) there are market cycles that impact different market sectors differently. The different stages cycles are the following; the recession, where the sector loses value after some sort of financial crisis, the early rebound, where the market strongly rebounds after the recession causing a jump in value, the peaking stage, where the sector rises and reaches its peaks, and finally, the moderation cycle, where the sector’s price moderates and consolidation occurs. 

&#x200B;

After understanding the concept of market cycles, we need to find out where we are now in terms of them. It depends on the sector, but let's just look at the Nasdaq and the s&p 500. These help quantify the market trends so we can find out what stage of the cycle we are in.

&#x200B;

Both the s&p 500 and the Nasdaq mirror each other in their graphs so we can assume that they are affected by the same events in the same way. We can also see the previous market cycles that have played out through the years including the financial crisis of 2000’s recession, gains, peak, and moderation followed by the real estate crash in 08-09, leading up to the gains and peaks before the covid crash. If we are considering the covid crash a recession, then we are in the first stage of early rebound and gains with the possibility of peaks being reached. The growth of both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are exponentially greater than the gains of the other first-stage rebounds despite the crash sizes being comparable in size. We can also entertain the possibility of the next crash being much bigger than the previous ones. According to Fidelity’s chart of sectors that should do very well during the rebound stage, healthcare, energy, and utility sectors tend to underperform.

&#x200B;

We can see that these sectors mirror each other in the sense that they are underperforming in regards to both the S&P500 and the Nasdaq since the Covid crash. This checks out as it is stated in Fidelity’s chart that these sectors(Energy, Healthcare, and Utilities) tend to underperform post crash. Stock sectors that, according to Fidelity’s chart tend to perform very well post rebound, are in fact doing very well. These sectors include financial, real estate, consumer discretionary, materials, industrial, and information technology.

&#x200B;

Now that we can validate Fidelity’s graph more, we can be more sure of the coming trends. In the event of this current stage being the peak of the market in this cycle, we can use this information to find stocks that perform the best in the following stages. The sectors that perform well during the peak and moderation stages are consumer staples, communication, healthcare, and energy. According to Fidelity, recessions generally negatively affect sectors so it is best to take a defensive position on the sectors that tend to underperform in a recession situation. The stock sectors that underperform during a recession are real estate, information technology, industrials, and communication services. 

Conclusion:

We are at the peak of a stock market cycle after a recession and the stocks that are going to underperform are *x* and the stocks that are going to overperform during the recession are *y*. Regardless of how well a sector could overperform, it is generally a good idea to take a defensive position during a recession."
2021-06-26 07:13:24,stocks,"IMO depending on what your timeline is and what your you need the money for, I think that it is best to be aggressive during a recession. Technology has made things move so much faster, the traditional market cycle idea doesn't seem to hold up. We have flash crashes now and rapid sector rotation. We went from worst economic and stock market crash to fastest economic and fastest stock market recovery all in less than a year."

2021-06-26 10:09:56,stocks,">best to be aggressive during a recession

100% agreed. Recessions have a 100% recovery rate. Either we recover from recessions, or society as we know it gets up-ended. Much more practical to prepare for recovery."
2021-06-26 12:29:56,stocks,">aggressive during a recession

Definitely. Defense comes in preparation for a recession. Not during a recession. 

They say not to sell your winners but you can definitely trim tiny positions off your winners to build up a cash position in preparation of a correction. 

I trim into strength and buy into weakness. 

If I trim into strength and th stock keeps going up I'm happy because my trimming is very small. I try to have no more than 5% in any one stock. If it grows to 6-7% of my portfolio I can start trimming and even knock it back down to 5%. It still has the opportunity to grow but now I have cash to go shopping."

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Company valuation. Especially when its private/starting up. I was wondering how are valuations of a company determined for a start up and/or up and coming company?

the reason why i ask is, i like to watch sharktank segments once in a while. 

and obviously these companies are all currently privately owned.

However, whenever they go on the show looking for investments, the company valuation seems to be done in such a linear fashion. The main (and seems like ONLY) valuation method the sharks use is simply investment * equity.

so if someone is asking for a 100k for 10% equity in the company, the sharks simply see it as them saying their company is worth $1MM.

and yes, i get that. its true asking for a 100k for 10% equity is the same thing as saying their company is worth $1MM. but what i DONT get is that it seems like thats the only metric everyone on the show is using. any other argument the person seeking investment uses is denied by the sharks. (i.e. growth potential, current market shares, sales, moat, etc)

Is this correct that that is in fact all that matters for a startup/private company seeking investors?"
2021-06-26 00:49:12,stocks,"1) If you listen closely they'll always ask for LTM revenue, gross margins, owner compensation and profitability (which I believe is typically stated in EBITDA? Maybe pretax?). Then they'll ask for NTM revenue and profitability. 

I believe they capitalize the NTM metrics at a high discount. I'm guessing at least 20. Probably 30-40% range (or higher for some companies). Some industries are easier as they'll commonly sell at a multiple. (Like a book of business generally sells for 1x-1.5x, which is more in my wheelhouse than VC)

The valuations especially for early stage companies are more of a risk exercise than an in depth DCF analysis. 

2) The $1.0 million valuation offered by the entrepreneur in your example is a present value. So the entrepreneur themself with the highest expectations in the world is acknowledging risk with the valuation presented to the sharks. 


3) the moat thing. The company  probably doesn't  need a shark if they have a moat. Or at least, the entrepreneur would be more open to a lower value.

There are a few balance sheet items the sharks do care about. A lot of inventory is usually a bad sign, they're always happier when the investor owns 100% of the company and the company has no third party debt."

yup, they definitely ask all the standard financials of the company. but still majority of the time, its ignored and they go back to emphasize how much they are being asked to invest for. unless they are simply trying to get in for as cheap as possible since they know they have all the options in the world (being on shark tank) and holds the power (the entrepreneur needs them, not the other way around).

>I believe they **capitalize** the NTM metrics at a **high discount**. I'm guessing at **least 20**. Probably 30-40% range (or higher for some companies).

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Getting assigned a stock Well, that happened. I sold a cash put on SOFI earlier in the week, and in premarket on Friday, it was reported that SOFI’s lockout period ends Monday, which means insiders can start selling. Lo and behold, SOFI took a tumble and fell $2 under my put’s strike price, so I’m getting assigned (and if the stock doesn’t move between now and Monday, I’m starting in a -$200 hole).

This is my first assignment. I’m curious if this has happened to you before, and if so, what were the results of you holding that stock. Did you sell quickly? Did it become a long term hold?

As for me, I plan to covered-call the @$%# out of my shares every week until they turn profitable and get called away."
2021-06-26 00:15:48,stocks,If it’s not a stock I’m comfortable actually owning and holding over the weekend then I roll the put or close the position out for a loss.
2021-06-26 07:54:48,stocks,"Wait - are you saying you’ll get assigned just because the put is in the money? Or does it expire on Monday? And do you have the cash available to take assignment?

Even though American options can be assigned as soon as they are ITM, I’ve never had it happen to me. I have been assigned at expiration plenty of times. 

Here’s a bit of my experience:

Selling naked puts OTM:

I sell naked puts all day long. I only write them at prices (after you account for the premium discount to basis) that I’d be fine buying the stock at. 

In the last year, I’ve been assigned:

AAPL at prices between 115-124 (sold all shares profitably or at still holding at a profit on all)

ACB (aurora Cannabis) at 7 (sold all shares for a small profit and then watched it soar to $9..)

CGC (Canopy Growth) at 26 (sold all shares for a small profit)

SPXL (triple leveraged S&P 500 ETF) that I exited two days after assignment for a profit

YOLO (marijuana ETF) that I still hold since it’s about 3% below my costs basis, and I’ll wait a little to see if it goes up)

Coming up on July expirations, I have some ALL (Allstate) at a net assignment price of $131.50 that may or may not get assigned, and about 17 contracts of BGFV (Big 5 - a sporting goods retailer) at net assignment prices of $29.30 and $26.20 I’ll get punched in the mouth with (it is trading at $25.65 now), but I will stick it out for a bit and see how it does like my YOLO etf.

Selling naked puts ITM:

And I wrote in the money naked puts as well. Including Leaps. So, for instance, with AAPL at $132 right now, I recently wrote (on June 14) a January 2022 put with an strike price of $140. But it had a $17.20 premium, which would mean worst case I buy it at $122.80. 

Rolling puts when concerned about assignment:

The other thing I have done is you can roll your put options forward a month or two. Close your current put at a loss, and buy a longer duration put (which will come with a larger premium). Now, this just kicks the can down the road and don’t do this if it’s throwing good money after bad. 

Anyways, good luck!!"

2021-06-26 02:39:34,stocks,Yeah. When you do a call secured put you put up the value for 100x the strike price of the stock. If the put gets exercised you are typically assigned the stock but I see no reason a broker would just deduct the loss from the secure down payment and let you have cash (in other words they could just automatically the sell the shares instead of actually assigning them). I haven't had a put expire like that but I think that's reasonable

UMG owns one-third of the music IP on the planet. The revenue is growing, the margins are growing (from a shift from lower-margin physical media to higher-margin streaming), and it’s expanding into emerging markets that have a fraction of the smartphone and streaming penetration of developed countries. UMG’s next closest competitor is 10 points behind it in market share, and UMG controls 10 out of the 10 highest-grossing artists worldwide.

PSTH shareholders get a pro forma ownership in UMG, plus (since Ackman isn’t using all of the SPAC’s cash for this transaction) another company yet unknown (""Remainco""), plus dibs on Ackman’s next instrument, called a SPARC. The SPARC is similar to a SPAC, except no investment is required upfront. I call it a retrospective investment, since SPARC will allow shareholders to invest at a predetermined price *after* the target has been identified.

These guys are small cap <10B, generating positive free cash flow and EBITDA, and only have positive catalysts from this point forward. Each state that legalizes adds ~2B/year matured to the TAM of the entire market and most states limit licenses so it's not like competition will be fierce until we see how federal legalization plays out.

Insurers (ALL, PGR - they trade at less than 10 P/E’s and stocks have done very well with low volatility historically. These mint money). Another great long term buy and hold category. 

Ford (although that’s an EV play). 

ASO. Love it. 

Do big banks count as FinTech? (JPM, MS - low P/E, nice dividend. Smart leadership). 

AMGN - dominant company. I buy on dips. 

Do semiconductors count as “tech”? (Numerous chip makers look very good right now)

Homebuilders and Airlines are reasonably priced, but are we entering a boom economy or will Covid-hangovers drag us down for the next five years? (Or are we permanently K-shaped in our economy and outfits like KB Home only need the top 30% of households to do well in order to crank out inventory?)

Supermarkets. Good isn’t going out of style. Albertson’s (ACI), B&G foods (BGS), Spartan Nash (SPTN 10 p/e, 4% dividend) are my favorites.

Marijuana stocks. We are seeing rapid legislative legalization at the state level (as opposed to ballot initiatives). Almost every month a new state passes some legalization/medical/decriminalization measure. Feds will follow suit soon. There is no mystery here. Weed will be a HUGE industry in 5-10 years. The only difficulty is picking the winners from the current companies out there. But weed is here to stay. 

Those are just my random picks off the top of my head. I own a bunch of those mentioned. This ain’t financial advice. Do your own research folks."

FLR is digging itself out of a nasty hole it got itself into. It started it's regrowth by getting back to its roots in infrastructure. It's also pretty involved in the nuclear industry worldwide and is well established with US government contracts. Still getting contracts (infrastructure and nuclear related across the globe) and has a lot of potential if the U.S. infrastructure deal is passed. 

NXE is ramping up mining operations next year for uranium. They're planning on a demand increase and I don't think they're wrong. In the US alone, the DOE and DOD are tossing funds at SMR companies for new designs or unique nuclear energy applications (think portable reactors for remote energy or heat production, new reactor designs, etc.), on new fuel designs (TRISOs, etc.), and even construction of new plants (NuScale SMRs for UAMPs).

(KKR), the firm didn't actually pay for the company; the purchase ""price"" was taken out as debt leveraged against the company.  Ten years later, of 2021, ASO is still $300 million in the hole.  ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Sports_%2B_Outdoors)) ([2](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/academy-sports--outdoors-announces-99-million-paydown-and-refinancing-of-its-term-loan-and-upgrade-to-credit-rating-301299241.html)).  

$300 million of debt vs. $2.7 billion in annual revenue shouldn't be a huge issue, except that KKR has no incentive to stop looting the company, and they have [an extensive history of doing just that](http://www.stephenhicks.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/forbes-kkr.pdf).  

IMO, ASO is doomed in the long run, just like Toys R Us (another KKR leveraged buyout).  The moment ASO hits a period of unprofitability, it's in KKR's best interest to declare the business insolvent and write off the debt.  If you think the company will keep expanding in the short run, you can still profit from it, but this is a stock I would not feel safe owning and I would feel compelled to check the news on it *daily*.  I'm certainly not a stock expert, but history tends to repeat itself."

Given the really big jump so far this year... I wouldn't bet against against further pullbacks and then 'middling' in that area for a good while.  

Many people hear Berkshire and think 'rainbows, puppy dogs and guaranteed daily/weekly/monthly/yearly returns'.

2021-06-26 08:05:23,stocks,"Sears was owned by ESL Investments not KKR. That was their mismanagement not KKRs.

Did you read any of those links? None of it was bad. Leveraged debt in a growing, positive cash flow company doesn't hurt the company but can actually save it and help it prosper such as in ASO's situation (using this money to open new stores, buy product in bulk, pay off other higher interest debt, etc). Debt may look scary on a balance sheet but if it puts the company in a better position to succeed long term then it was worth it. 


 KKR has done a leveraged buyout (LBO) on several very successful companies that are still doing business today. ASO shouldn't be any different. The article stated KKR has a hands off approach and has lost money this way through incompetent management - see Toys-R-Us. KKR was not the only investment firm in TRU. TRU was split between 3 of them including KKR.


ASO has solid financials and financial ratios that do point to the company being undervalued at this price point. The debt from KKR will be paid off. In the short term the stock price may suffer as KKR fully/mostly exits their position in ASO as they've been doing the past several months."

Going plant Based is on the rise in almost all western countries. Their customer base is loyal - not sure of any other milk product with that kind of loyalty (it's definitely up there with Coke brand or cigarette brands in terms of people passionately preferring one company over another). They have a leg up in the consumer space with name recognition and partnerships.  So yeah, 15 years? Maybe not so much.  But next five years?  I think they'll be fine."
2021-06-26 12:50:48,stocks,UMG is a great find at the valuation he got it for is excellent. Remainco + Sparc have the opportunity to be big winners as well but I don’t mind that they are tied to Ackman’s legacy if he doesn’t provide.

2021-06-26 08:03:05,stocks,"It’s different in America tho- we’re still in the early stages of legalizing sports gambling nationwide because it was prevented by Las Vegas until our court ruled it legal for other states to have it.  It seems like there’s an Oligopoly (in terms of competition) shaping up between MGM, Penn/Barstool, Fanduel, and Draftkings. Companies will have many hoops to jump through to join this group and have to apply in each state. Draftkings operates in the online gambling sphere in only 10/50 states (Per their most recent 10k- penn only does in 3 as of 12/31/20). The upside is on the number of states it can operate it’s Sportsbook online doubling or tripling over the next 5 years.

I like  DraftKings app and UI a lot more and DraftKings  promos are better IMO. You can argue that DraftKings promos give too much money away, and that is fair, but it also keeps people coming back to the app as there is a lot of turnover in sports betting. The biggest reason I am big in sports gambling companies is FL, NY, and TX haven’t made it legal yet and that’s 1/3 of the population and Canada just last week made it legal."

2021-06-26 16:58:13,stocks,"I like GME and have a small number of shares, but they still have a ways to go before they're considered a safe company by normal investing standards. Again, I have some, because I believe in the company, kind of want to say ""fuck you"" to the big money boys with my wallet, and like games; but the stock is no where near close to being a sure bet on return.  
  
The fact that GME might briefly jump to the moon due to hedge funds being collective dumbasses isn't an actual indication as to the long term viability of the company. All that new stuff GME has been doing is still new. We don't know if it works yet. New CEO, CFO, NFTs, etc are great but we don't know that it'll make a profit yet, and that's the whole point of a stock, is to invest in a solid company that will keep growing and be around for a long time. Until GME pulls in actual profits off of its businesses for a few years, it's not going to be mainstream, nor should it be. Currently, they might be losing less money on business per quarter, but they're still losing money. They also still have to try and wrestle for market space with steam and amazon, and many companies have tried to compete with both and have failed.  
  
I'm young, I can take a little risk and see where GME goes over the next 10 years. If GME goes to zero, I will say, ""Holy heck was that fun, I have a great story to tell"" and move on. Other people might not be able to take that risk. If someone is tight on money and really NEEDS that invested money to work for them and be there without a shadow of a doubt in 40 years, then GME isn't a safe bet for them. It's the same with an investment that I can't mention on this sub due to autodeletion of any comment with this word in it. It has amazing potential, and I have some money in it, but it's not an investment for the average ""I want the biggest return possible with the least possible risk"" person."

2021-06-26 19:12:09,stocks,"Younger generations seem to have redefined ""growth"" as share price not actual fundamentals. In the past, when we said growth we meant rev and earnings.

You are correct about Apple. They havent grown much since 2015. Their share price has gone up but their rev and earnings have not. The prior 5 years were obviously stellar and thats the thing with tech. It comes in spurts and sometimes they sputter.

A lot of young investors are going to be disappointed when valuations start to flatten out on tech. Apple, has been struggling with hardware margins for a few years now. They sell plenty of phones, but margins are dropping fast. So dont expect much growth from phone sales going forward. If they want to reinvigorate retail margins, they will need to find a new market to chew into. Some have suggested eV's. I think thats a horrible idea but thats just me. Its all about the Apple store from here on out. I am not sure how much more they can get out of that but anything is possible. Overall I think Apple is overpriced until they start to grow again.

MSFT on the other hand is a growing like a beast and there is likely no slowing it down the next 3-4 years due to converting legacy customers to cloud.

COST also has been growing at about a 10% clip consistently for a long time and they can pass inflation costs on to customers if that becomes an issue. I wouldnt say they will grow better than Apple but they are definitely safer. Apple, for all we know, might  sputter for a while. You never really know with tech."

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"I invest based on quantitative sentiment score on Reddit - I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since inception. Last week's numbers and positions: Hey guys! Posted a little while ago about my project that invests based on sentiment analysis (I know you've seen sentiment trackers abound) and wanted to give an update and some new numbers. Long story short for the week -- you'll $WISH you had $AMC in your portfolio last week, and...eh I got nothing. **IMPORTANT:** Most of the below is a repost of stuff I've posted before (other than the new numbers), but I've added/trimmed down as I get better at explaining the right stuff.

I rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a **2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for SPY and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the VanEck BUZZ Social Sentiment ETF**. Important to note that not every week is a breakout win (even if some member stocks in the ETF are), and not every week is a win at all. I've had some weeks where I've trailed both SPY and BUZZ by a lot, but overall I'm beating SPY YTD and BUZZ since its introduction on March 4. This algorithm has returned 52%, compared to SPY's 10% and BUZZ's 7%.

Your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. I do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks I pick doing it most weeks, so thought I'd share. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. In addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post.

&#x200B;

**How is sentiment calculated?**

This uses VADER ( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. In some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “I LOVED” which is pretty cool. Phrases like “The turkey was great, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. There’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. There’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that.

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. **Although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like BUZZ and FOMO (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term SPY-beating strategy.”** I’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from GME and AMC (and more recently, WISH). These tickers do show up in BUZZ, but after they do on Reddit and at a lower weighting.

So, the data from last week:

2021-06-25 21:39:38,stocks,"Judging by your post history, I can tell you eventually will be advertising your startup on these subs. I have no problem with that. In fact I think it’s great that you will eventually try to monetize your project by selling us the dream of automated riches. Capitalism is great. However, I would warn you that posting “phenomenal” results without actual proof or detailed track records never leads to good places. And even if this strategy does work, due to the law of reversion to the mean, it eventually won’t and anyone who deposits money into your project could lose money. Nonetheless, good luck on your startup."

2021-06-26 08:03:41,stocks,Is this  sentiment analysis why there are so many “new traders” asking for stock tips or for people to judge their stock picks?

I got an email that my account was negative. So i looked and saw i had a $40 cash call on my account. This sent my net worth from $5 to -$35. (yeah my stocks didnt do well). Whats a cash call and how could it be double my total investment?

Edit: I learned that the stock I invested in did a reverse split. I don’t know if and why that would have caused my problem"

I had something like $50 in vivant solar (I forget the ticker) and was charged $30 for a reorganization fee. I called them and threw a fit and they did reverse it that time, but I'm now warned that they won't reverse it again."
2021-06-25 21:04:16,stocks,Ask them to waive the fee and to close the account. Usually big financial companies will cut you a break if you ask (can't hurt to try). Learn your lesson and stop messing around with penny stocks.

Have them waive any fees and tell you if it's a glitch"

2021-06-26 01:08:19,stocks,"In my experience (semi minimal having interacted with 3 brokerage companies)… Schwab is absolutely hands down the best. Fee reversals is one thing, but their customer service is amazing. 100% the best customer service I’ve ever interacted with, in any industry."
2021-06-26 19:00:56,stocks,Confirmed. I have E*TRADE and was charged a $38 reorganization fee for a reverse split last month. Sounds like there wasn’t cash in the account to cover the fees
2021-06-25 20:18:02,stocks,"He said there was a reverse split. It's possible he didn't own enough of the stock to make up 1 total share after the reverse split, and etrade loaned the money (The $40) to cover this shortfall. 

But now he's 200% on margin, $40 borrowed on $20 down. So he's getting the lowest value margin call we've ever heard of.

Is that possible?"
2021-06-25 20:28:39,stocks,Sounds plausible enough.  Doesn’t sound like a fair resolution of the situation if you ask me but that sounds in line with what I’ve heard about Etrade
2021-06-25 20:40:46,stocks,Could also just be a fee for handling the reverse swap transaction that cost a lot? idk man I'm making shit up.
2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 28th, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

# **The jobs report will move markets in the week ahead as stocks enter the second half riding high - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/25/the-jobs-report-will-move-markets-in-the-week-ahead-as-stocks-enter-the-second-half-riding-high.html)**
*****
> The monthly jobs report is the highlight in the coming week, as June winds down and markets start the second half of the year.
*****
> Economists are expecting about 700,000 jobs. That’s better than the 559,000 in May but below the forecasts of several months ago that payroll creation would be rolling along with monthly gains of at least 1 million.
*****
> The report is a key read on the labor market, which has replaced lost jobs more slowly than expected as companies complain about worker shortages and difficulty finding help. But it is also being watched as a gauge on how sticky the current jump in inflation might be. Rising wages are one thing to watch but also worker scarcity, since that can make goods and services more expensive.
*****
> Stocks have turned in a mixed performance for the month of June so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.8% as of Friday for the month, and up 7.7% in the second quarter for a 15.6% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq was up 4.4% in June and up 8.4% for the quarter. The Dow, meanwhile, lagged in June with a modest 0.3% decline, but it is up 4.4% quarter-to-date.
*****
> The S&P 500, ending Friday at 4,280, has already edged slightly above 4,276 — the average year end forecast of Wall Street strategists surveyed by CNBC.
*****
> For the most part, strategists expect the market to continue its upward trajectory into the second half, although at a slower pace. Some have also said the second half could bring a pause in the rally before the market ends the year higher.
*****
> “I think it’s been very good for the stock market that long rates have stopped going up in the first quarter and are going down, taking the pressure off,” The Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said.
*****
> “Meanwhile earnings have continued to climb unabated, and if you think about it the vast majority of stocks didn’t go anywhere in the second quarter,” Paulsen said. “What we’ve got is a cheaper market than we had in March and we had one where rates are lower and we’re still getting unrestricted policy help from both monetary and fiscal authorities.”
*****
> Paulsen said he thinks the S&P 500 could hit 4,500 before pulling back later in the year to finish at about 4,100.
*****
> “My attitude now is it’s a very hard tape to fight, and it takes a lot of fortitude to do so, but you’re at a point where it’s a lot cheaper to hedge than it has been,” Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick said. “It’s a lot cheaper to hedge and a more opportune time to do so. It’s always cheaper to buy an umbrella when there are no rain clouds on the horizon.”
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, despite the turbulence the week earlier after the June Federal Reserve meeting. The Fed laid the groundwork for its ultimate step away from easy policies, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying Fed officials were considering tapering their purchases of mortgages and Treasury securities.
*****
> “There seems to be a greater complacency,” Sosnick said, noting the market reaction to the Fed’s potential unwind of easy policy was calm.
*****
> If the Fed announces it will taper its bond purchases in the next several months, it would be expected to wait several months more before it starts the process. Then it could take many more months to take the $120 billion in monthly purchases to zero. The unwind of that policy is especially important since it could be a precursor to the Fed raising interest rates.
*****
> “Underlying everything, there’s a huge faith in the Fed, that they will do the right thing, and they’ll continue to do the right thing,” Sosnick said.
*****
> Sosnick said he’s watching the bond market going into quarter end this week, after the surge in yields last quarter end. The relatively tame behavior of bond yields, which move opposite price, has been a hallmark of the last part of the second quarter.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury was yielding 1.52% Friday, up from 1.45% a week prior.
*****
> Sosnick said if the 10-year yield does remains contained, that should be good for tech. “Right now, it appears there’s that kind of relationship between the 10-year and NDX. If 10-year yields are lower, people are using it as a buy signal for the Nasdaq 100. Is that fool proof? Far from it, but people are using it,” he said.
*****
> Tech stocks were up 2.4% for the week and 9.4% for the quarter so far, after being out of favor when yields were moving higher in March.
*****
> “The advice at the end of the first quarter was that [10-year] rates were going to 2%. Rather than going up, rates went down and as a result growth beat value and techs beat financials,” The Leuthold Group’s Paulsen said. “Now everyone thinks rates are going to stay low longer. I think value, cyclicals and small caps are going to win this quarter. I think we’re going to have a correction and end the year around 4,100.”
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> The payroll number Friday morning is by far the biggest economic event of the week.
*****
> “We expect next week’s June employment report to show that nonfarm payrolls expanded by 800k, pushing the unemployment rate down to 5.5% from 5.8%. Strong demand and weak supply should continue to put upward pressure on wages,” wrote Bank of America economists.
*****
> According to Dow Jones, economists expect 683,000 payrolls were created in June and the unemployment rate fell to 5.7% from 5.8%. But the market is also looking to see if the data reveals anything new about inflation and whether it could be transitory, or temporary, as the Fed has stated.
*****
> “The problem is because the markets have tended to surprise us, it’s tough to figure out what the trade is,” said Sosnick. “There’s two components of it. It is the unemployment rate, or the labor force participation, the stuff Powell is really looking for.”
*****
> Wage data could be hot with the Dow Jones estimate at a 3.7% year-over-year gain in average hourly wages, up from 1.98% in May.
*****
> “Are we approaching full employment? With non non-transitory inflationary affects?” Sosnick said. “You’re seeing companies giving signing bonuses. Those are transitory but if you have to raise wages and if wages are going to go up, that is non transitory.”
*****
> Besides the jobs data, there is ISM manufacturing data and monthly vehicle sales Thursday.
*****
> OPEC also meets on July 1, and market pros are watching to see if the OPEC and its alliance in OPEC plus will continue to add oil to the market.

> # July has been Top Month of Post-Election Years

> July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&P 500 both gained greater than 6% and strong performances in 2013 and 2018 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2021).

> July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the fifth weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.6% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and some strength towards the end.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/24425b5573f14df7e7f5039ac0dd34f4/01813a8e14a72b86-9a/s400x600/8951bac1faa8d0887549c23fc161e859a01787fd.jpg))**

> Post-election year Julys rank at or near the top of all post-election year months. DJIA, S&P 500, and NASDAQ are ranked #1. Russell 2000 ranks #2. Delving deeper into this data revealed that many of these past “hot” Julys were preceded by a flat or down first half of the year so there is no guarantee that this July will live up to its historical post-election year record again this year.

*****

> # Bears in Hibernation

> The S&P 500's dip below its 50-DMA and the corresponding rally to new all-time highs did little to dramatically change investor sentiment. This week's survey results from the AAII saw bullish sentiment fall slightly from 41.1% last week to 40.4%. That is once again within the past several weeks' range at the lowest level since only two weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Bearish sentiment was also lower this week, falling by 2.9 percentage points to 23.3%. As with bullish sentiment, that is the lowest level in two weeks. From a longer-term perspective, bearish sentiment is more than 7 percentage points below its historical average of 30.5%. In other words, while sentiment is not exuberant, it continues to skew optimistic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The historically muted level of bearish sentiment also shows up in the Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers. This week, that reading fell half of one percentage point to 15.8%. That is the lowest percentage of respondents reporting as bearish since March 14th, 2018. Over the past 30 years, there have been only a handful of other periods with lower levels of market pessimism.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/062421-II-Bear-2.png))**

> Pivoting back to the AAII survey, with bearish sentiment historically muted, a larger share of investors are reporting as neutral. 36.6% of respondents reported as such this week, up 3.9 percentage points from the six-week low last week.

> # Manufacturing Activity Indices at Historic Levels

> As recent economic data shows, the robust post-COVID recovery has brought about a historic rebound in U.S. manufacturing activity. Pent-up demand and low inventories of capital goods have caused companies to fire up their machines at record levels, and manufacturing supply management professionals have responded with relative delight in recent surveys. Both the IHS Markit and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Indices have been robust across the board, as new order growth, hiring plans, and the backlog of orders point to better health in the sector. The downside…higher prices, as purchasing managers’ queried in the survey pinpointed high levels of input cost inflation brought about by a broad-based spike in raw materials prices. The latest survey results show the June IHS Markit U.S. Manufacturing PMI at a new all-time high of 62.6, which compares to the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 61.5 and May’s reading of 62.1.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.24.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

> “The demand for goods and the rebound in manufacturing activity have been remarkable as folks seem determined to get on with their lives. We know that U.S. consumers like to spend, and it seems like they are more than willing to make up for lost time.” explained LPL Financial Director of Research Marc Zabicki.

> We believe the latest IHS Markit manufacturing readout may foretell a good result for the ISM benchmark’s expected release on July 1. That index series has also been near record levels, although just below its all-time high. The long-term ISM chart paints a fairly good picture of past peaks and troughs and the roller-coaster of activity that can occur in the manufacturing sector. In fact, the recent highs in the two manufacturing indicators we have mentioned have us looking ahead to an eventual deceleration in activity, which could come later this year. This deceleration could be brought about by the ultimate slowing of demand for some of the hottest items of late: automobiles, appliances, and technology devices. This doesn’t mean we are souring on the prospect for economic growth in the U.S….only that peak activity, as we are witnessing now, which is usually followed by an eventual slowdown in demand. We should see some of this become visible via U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth that is expected to advance at a slower pace in late 2021 and early 2022.

when a short seller borrows a stock that he thinks will go down he has a couple of things in mind 

1 - target price and exit if the stock goes against and or when the price reaches their target. 

2 - find borrows from their broker or use options such as buying puts, sell calls.

Yes, $PYPL and $V have had good run ups recently, but $PYPL hasn't hit a new 52 week high yet. If you have FOMO, buy half (or 2/3 or whatever) now and see if it makes a 52 week high or pulls back 10% and then buy the rest in either scenario.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 25, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 25, 2021**

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 
* Panasonic, Tesla’s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company’s latest regulatory filing. 
* Starbucks CEO denied a Wall Street Journal report that the company was running low in supplies of cups and coffee. CEO Kevin Johnson told Jim Cramer, “there is no shortage of cups, no shortage of coffee”.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written pre-market and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* Accenture (ACN) with a host of target raises. Average price target $330 at Buy. Stock currently around $292
* Analog Devices (ADI) target raised by Bank of America from $178 to $200 at Buy. Stock currently around $167
* Carnival Cruises[ ](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CCL&src=cashtag_click)(CCL) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $37 to $39 at Buy. Stock currently around $27.5

   * BMO Capital Markets from $140 to $150
   * Credit Suisse from $364 to $373 
* Nike (NKE) with a host of target raises after smashing earnings yesterday. Average price target $170 at Buy. Stock currently around $152 after gapping up 13% after-hours.

2021-06-26 13:46:15,stocks,"Don’t get me wrong, their numbers look pretty solid and some are proving they could make more and more in the future, but just Roku for example: why would them being bought out by Comcast be a good thing? Comcast would destroy their whole system, add more ads and probably create a platform that people don’t want anymore. Roku was built to get away from Comcast. So the stock going up cause of that possible buyout was stupid IMO. I see them independent as fine, but their stock price shot up for a bad reason. Part of the reason why I think their short term value should come down a little to maybe the 400 region. 

And then you have Twilio who yes is good, but trading super high for their rev. At the current valuation, they need to be closing the gap on their loss not increasing it. I think they deserved to be at 360 and hover, but when it dipped and soared back to 380 from 310 in two weeks, too high too fast. 

And you have DocuSign for example which is a proven model to help in the esignature world, but it’s premiums are too high for their service. Costing 3x more than services like Adobe sign doesn’t make sense. There may be some additional features, but not enough. It’s earnings were good, makes sense for the bump, but then it soared another like 20% on no news and it’s running too much in the past month. I believe 260 short term in the next week is a fair value to come in. 

Then again, we are in a FOMO market, everyone is sinking money into tech because of interest rates, inflation, growth, rotation, you name it. When someone on the internet says they know why a stock is moving up or down, they really don’t know. They’re just following the crowd. I def could be wrong too, but when a stock trades upwards 1-5 percent every single day for like 2-3 weeks straight, I think it’s due for a semi pull back to cool off."

And what I did find, it was very broad and I still remain not knowing what it really is or how it works.

Because I've read up on what ETNs are and the foresight of coffee. But I'm not sure if a regular stock, coffee related, is the way to go rather than the ETN."
2021-06-26 09:51:54,stocks,"I haven't traded JO nor the coffee futures but here's my 2 cents.

An ETN that invests in commodity futures has to roll those positions out when the liquidity moves from the front month to the active month contract. An ETN can also hold positions in contracts with different expirations. Either way, the ETN loses some value over time due to the rolling of contracts, trading fees, and management fees. 

The ETN would also maintain positions irrespective of the moves in the underlying contracts. It's up to you to look at the different future contracts to pick an entry or exit. How do the different contracts differ in price (forwardation, backwardation), are there seasonal trends, when is the harvest season (are you trading old or new crops)? 

I wouldn't hold this as a long-term position, but it's suitable for a swing trade. You should check the daily trading volume of the ETN to see if it's liquid enough. It's also more suitable than a future contract if you want a more granular control over your trade size and no leverage."

Overall I think we can agree the market had been way up but I was looking at my portfolio and saw some that sank during this time. The main one that comes to mind is my tiny holding of $ESRT. As you can expect, tourism to the Empire State Building was decimated last year and as such, the dividend died and the price sank. However I'm still holding because:

1. It's now part of my tourism and vacation recovery play.

2. I like the idea of having an ""ownership"" interest in the Empire State Building.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, part of the European Medicines Agency, recommended granting marketing authorization in the European Union for roxadustat as a treatment for anemia symptoms in chronic kidney disease patients.

The decision, announced on Friday, and made Thursday by the committee, amounts to a seal of approval for the drug, though marketing authorization must be granted by the European Commission.""

2021-06-26 15:33:43,stocks,My apologies. I mean if you held the option contract a year and then the stock finally spiked so your option was ITM and you cashed out. Under those circumstances would I be considered holding for a year and taxed less?  Idk if the same rules applies to options as I’m uneducated in this area for sure.
2021-06-26 16:33:06,stocks,"Much clearer, thank you. There are two basic choices you can make with an ITM option. You can either sell-to-close it, which is basically just selling it for cash; if the length of time between buy (aka buy-to-open) and sell (aka sell-to-close) is a year or more than you are taxed at long term capital gains (LTCG) rate. The other choice is if you exercise the option because you just like the stock, then you'd have to wait one year **after exercising** **the option**  to get LTCG: even if you'd had the leap for a year and a half, then exercise, then sell the next day, you're taxed at short term capital gains rate. 

Sounds like what you're talking about is just selling the option to close it, which is like cash in, cash out, and in that case your idea in your most recent reply is correct, that if you held for a year, you'd be taxed at the lower rate (LTCG). Yes, as you supposed, the same rule does apply just as it would to shares.

 Aside from what you asked, there are some tiny subtleties in options which are kinda cool, like if you have a stock for longer than a year and sell covered calls on it, and the stock gets called away, that weekly call premium is taxed along with the stock at LTCG, even if you just wrote the call a week ago. A weekly premium usually only gonna be on the order of about 1% of the value of the stock so it's not much, but it is still kinda cool. There's probably some super ninja technique to take advantage of this that I don't know about yet."

For the most part I am trying to keep a decent long term portfolio with a “second savings account with better interest potential” kind of mindset, AMD and DIS leading the way for me. Still learning but feel like I’m getting more confident each day. 

The only reason I got into BB is because I was reluctant to jump on board the GME and AMC ships and after seeing how those eventually turned out I let a sense of FOMO take over and figured BB was next on the list to see the same treatment. It may have already on a smaller scale, but for when I chose to buy in it doesn’t seem too hopeful. I purposely didn’t go too crazy so I didn’t stand to lose much, but seeing as how it spent pretty much all of June falling gradually from my initial buy in, is it safe to say I should abandon this journey now and reinvest that money into something else?

Four straight quarters of positive GAAP earnings, over 500M TTM net income, 850M cash on hand, 2.5B TTM revenue, on a market cap of 44B. Around 750M in trailing free cash flow and growing. Only negative I see is that they're highly leveraged after their spin-off from IAC, with 3.8B in long term debt.

Second should be **slam dunk** and that's Zoom. Ticker ZM.

Household name. Used by every single person I know. Every single company in the Russell 2000 (probably except Microsoft and Cisco) uses it and spends a lot of money on it contractually. 872M TTM net income, 9 straight quarters of positive net income, 4.60 BILLION cash on hand which is more than Adobe (!!), zero debt, 1.58B in TTM free cash flow and growing. P/E of 127, which is less than the P/E of similar SaaS S&P component Paycom (PAYC), which has a P/E of 148. Market cap of 108B, which, if today they entered the index, would slot it right between CVS and ServiceNow in market cap. By the way, SaaS peer NOW has a P/E of 724.

2021-06-26 00:00:00,stocks,"How Burry predicted 2007, self-repost from Burryology I have been reading the book: The oil factor by Stephen Leeb written in 2004. He talks about the inverse relation between (rapid) increase in oil prices, lowering supply and high demand, but he takes a detour. The dotcom bubble dropped sp500 -40%, nasdaq -80%, 16trillion USD wealth went to 7 trillion. The fed lowered rates to 0.75%, boosted borrowing and home prices served as a healthy collateral, which can only go up right? US was highly in debt before the bust, but after… oh with low rates causing booms in home prices, more debt. In this 2004 books he says, if home prices would fall it would be taking down the banking system (1:6 leverage at that time so 18% default was needed to make the banks insolvent, we know later the leverage was 1:20 so 5% default was enough). What would cause home prices to fall? Policies to curb inflation, aaaand when did the fed start to raise rates? Yes, early 2007.

2021-06-26 02:28:42,stocks,Isn’t that kind of similar to how borrowing works now though? There’s a lot of margin and loans just being handed out to individuals with minimal requirements. Could cause something similar down the line.
2021-06-26 07:46:04,stocks,"The reason so many of the mortgages were 5/1 and 3/1 ARMs and even ""interest only"" loans was because Greenspan was so keen on those.  Greenspan was an economic doofus.

My sister and brother in law are *still* in an interest only loan from near the top of the bubble.  She asked a few years ago after dinner when her loan would be paid off.  You should have seen the look on her face when I told her ""never"".  She was absolutely shocked and refused to believe me because ""mortgages don't work that way""."

Seeking Alpha tossed a tidbit that Berkshire was eying them for an acquisition. Stock did jump about 1.7%, but it's still right around it's 50-day average and current valuation is in line with it's statistics without thinking about it being a target. 

Granted, much of the speculation is based simply on a Hershey private jet being seen in Omaha. But still - not as much interest as I would have thought."

2021-06-26 06:00:08,stocks,"I often ""feel"" like that, but my normal mode of operating I've been trying to practice and develop is to use a ""math brain"" to make the exit decisions.  It considers if there are gains, or if risk can be reduced by exiting, do it. 

I never seem to sell right at a top because of this,  but it helps me to consistently navigate through months understanding the flow, and banking gains as often as possible while taking on new risks when they seem appropriate because of ""math"" and not emotion.

Math-brain made me sell options on SPCE on the way up a few weeks back, only to see now that I limited my potential. Did it limit my gains? Yeah, but it also  locked in gains. Yesterday the ""math brain"" said, ""theres no more gains to be had here, its shot over the CC far enough that only tiny incremental gains are now possible"".

So I just closed all calls, short puts, shares, and kept the close to max-gains, and will look ahead to something else or maybe a fresh angle on that, whatever.

Every single decision I make, every trade, in and out, is logged into a custom made app I made that will create a report at month end, or whatever date range I want to show. It tells me percentages of good decisions versus bad, percentages of gains on good decisions versus losses from bad ones, gains from short-moves versus long-moves. Basically it's an auto-critisism report. Since subconsciously I always want to have a good report,  even though nobody is seeing it except me, the math-brain usually makes decisions to close positions when they've met different criteria like passing a certain profit percentage, or served their useful hedging purpose, etc."

2021-06-26 09:38:28,stocks,"You would think so, but there is a twist I learned in  this year's sector rotation in March. When you have an early looser you most certainly bought at the top. There is no point in holding a stock (not applicable to ETFs) if it immediately goes into -15%.   There is no guarantee to -15% doesn't go into -40%. A good stock that you've hold for a year rarely goes fast to red, you would just have your paper profit vanish but will rarely go into -15% unless there is something terribly wrong with it or in the market."

I’m still buying and holding my winners.  Even adding more to my position as time goes on.  

I end up with a super concentrated portfolio of veritable winners, each up hundreds or even thousands of percentage points from my cost basis.  

Are you really holding onto losers?"
2021-06-26 09:31:07,stocks,"That’s what “buy and hold” means. Either traditional long investors, or diamond hand short squeezers on WSB. Those two groups already claimed that term.

For your strategy, you need to call it something else or you’re confusing people. That’s all I’m saying. But now that I know what you meant, personally I don’t care. Do what you like, but people will keep getting confused when you hijack that term again and they will ask you again."
2021-06-26 09:33:23,stocks,"What are you arguing with me about?

Let your winners run and cut your losers early is a term that’s all over the internet.  

And I’m going to continue to use it because it’s more nuanced and more accurate than “buy and hold.”   I’m not holding losers, and I’m not going to wait for losers to claw back when I can cut my losses and go elsewhere sorry."

2021-06-26 09:44:50,stocks,"With this kind of temperament and deductive reasoning ability, I’ll be mildly shocked if you actually find much success in investment not attributable to luck.

If you “buy and hold”, you didn’t even describe the selling the loser part, and you didn’t specify which ones you’re holding. Stop being lazy and just say “cut the losers, let the winners run”. How hard is that?

Abbreviate if you have to, or come up with a better term. Instead of hijacking another term already in use, and then getting all pissy when people call you out for it."
2021-06-25 23:50:08,stocks,"I hold FUBO. Currently there only about 500,000 subscribers, which isn’t a lot, so it’s unlikely you’re to actually know too many people who actually subscribe to FUBO. 

However, I personally know three people who subscribe to FUBOTV. For whatever reason, these people are addicted and very loyal to FUBO. 

The subscriber growth will continue. It’s a high risk speculative play, but I think the rewards very much outweigh the risk."

2021-06-26 17:47:26,stocks,"I am long on Fubo.  I hold long shares and long calls.

Back a couple years ago, DirecTV got rid of Bein Sports.  I was pissed off.  I looked around at the time and found a service I never heard of--Fubo--and got it.  I rather enjoyed giving greedy DTV/ATT the finger as I closed my account.  I've been using Fubo ever since.  It works flawlessly through my Roku and I get virtually everything I did with DTV for less than half the price.  I'm very satisfied and I've turned a few others onto Fubo.  Most people haven't heard of it yet.  Some who do, subscribe and are happy.  I see great growth potential in this company.  Everyone knows Fubo has been talking about on-screen gaming (gambling).  We'll have to see how that works out, but I'm optimistic.

Fubo showcases lots of soccer, and the world loves soccer.  With the World Cup coming up next year, that can't hurt either!  Hopefully ""Fubo"" will become a household name.

I'm older than most people on here.  My dad taught me at an early age to invest in things I use and believe in.  After 2 years, I love Fubo.  It's a great service.  I have seen some others complain about its reliability, but I haven't experienced any of that.  I sleep comfortably at night knowing I have significant money in this company long-term.  I will be the first to admit I don't have a crystal ball--NOBODY does--but I think this could be one of those big ones you'll kick yourself for not latching onto in the early phase.

Best of luck."
2021-06-26 17:52:10,stocks,"I recently discussed Fubo with my financial advisor.  He was like ""what's that?"".  I had to laugh.  I've been using it over 2 years already.

I know a handful of people who use it, and they are happy with it.  I think that the more people who know about it, the more will subscribe.  It just isn't a household name yet.  I think it could be, and that's why I invest long in it."

Let's assume they need to make 8667 flights and they make two flights a day (refueling, doing all the pre flight checks will take a lot longer). Without expanding their fleet it will take 11 years to reach that -  and that is revenue, not profit. 

Let's say they expand the fleet. How many bookings will they have to make the costs worth it to expand their fleet. I try to be optimistic, but I doubt that they will ever recognize that worth. Also when there will be a plane that is reasonable cheap to produce and flies from LA to Berlin in an hour, every big airline will buy them erroding margins. It will be just like the airline business then. Price competitive and captial expanditure heavy -  not great for investors."

Even if you have a billion dollars, eventually someone will lose and that loss will be greater than everyone else’s gain combined. You are extremely unlikely to be the one to lose, but it will happen to someone.

If you started with a $100 bet, you would have to lose like 24 times in a row to wipe out almost a billion dollars. So that will happen 1/2^24 percent of the time.

Congressmen propose token bills all of the time to pander and feel important knowing they will never see the light of day. Then they can run home and tell their base how brave they were but the other side obstructed. The fact is none of those companies are monopolies. They all have competition. Some of them are competing with each other. Being good at what you do is not a crime. No antitrust bill against any of those companies would stand a chance when it inevitably ended up in the supreme court. 

I think people who really think this is a possibility don't know what it was like when AT&T ruled everyone. They owned every part of the telecommunications business from the wires to the phones themselves. When Amazon buys Wal Mart, Target, UPS, Google, and Microsoft, then it will be a monopoly."

But I should point out that the indices are indeed much higher than historic range. The S&P is hovering around 45! Nasdaq around 29 which is also higher than historic range and like many pointed out, it is heavily influenced by the top 10 or so companies.

I wish someone would make a speculative stock index. Maybe something that just tracks IPO's for maybe their 1st 5 years. If we had that, then I think you will find that this particular index is in an epic bubble with index PE well over 150 whereas historic is probably around 60. This is just based on my personal eye test given the flood of IPO's we had and how silly some of them are."

We need flow batteries and a lot of them. 

The EV thing shouldnt be surprising. There is absolutely no shortage in investor money for eV manufacturing and plenty in charging too. No need to spend much tax dollars on that. $15b is probably best used to install chargers at all USPS locations and slowly buy eV vans.

2021-06-25 22:36:08,stocks,"Housing has been subsidized in other ways already and much of the problem is the federal government cannot dictate building laws. Thats done at the state level and many states have indeed done things to help builders. CA, for example, reduced the regulatory barriers to second dwellings on property and it has resulted in a huge building boom the last 3-4 years or so. 

The other issue is the government isnt going to entice builders to hire more by just offering money. Builders are very cautious due to being greedy and almost going out of business in the financial crash. If you want to help them then the only real solution is going to be a financial instrument like a CDS specifically for residential construction... I cannot begin to express how bad of an idea this would be due to how exploitable it is. CDS should have been banned by now too.

In other words, there is no easy solution to housing. It costs too much and barring some sort of cheap insurance for builders against cost volatility, its hard to make them work faster."

2021-06-26 09:14:31,stocks,Fast charging requires a higher voltage then what is going to be at your typical convenience store or gas station. That is the #1 issue of EV’s is the ability to get a quick charge. Nobody wants to wait more than 5 minutes to “refuel”.  The EV market will not replace the ICE completely until these fast charging stations are available at every convenience store

The problem is you can push electrons into a battery only so fast, and that is a chemistry and physics problem and has only a partial correlation with higher charge voltage.

Secondly, all commercial properties have 480v supplied to them as a standard. The large walk-in fridges that many corner stores have are a 480v, three phase appliance. 

Moreover, the article you quoted was that someone hypothesized that if they increase internal voltage to 800, things will be better. For now, the standard battery voltage is 400v DC, and three phase 480v AC is .ore than enough to charge it."
