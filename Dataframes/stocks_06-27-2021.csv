I wouldn‚Äôt touch VG with a 10 foot pole. Only reason they are trending is because they are the only vehicle producing company available on open market. I‚Äôd wait till Astra or Rocket Lab IPO later this year and dump money there. They are actually real space companies"

2021-06-27 19:24:25,wallstreetbets,what about the low low insider holding %??
2021-06-27 19:34:23,wallstreetbets,"NNDM ü§¶

-Removed from the Tel Aviv exchange for diluting price to low.

-Moves to the Nasdaq where in 5 years diluted the share price from almost $100 to under $1.

-Diluted shares 4 times in one month in 2020.

-Over $1b from diluting within a 3 month span.

-Extremely low shares held by insiders because .... They are going to dilute this down to a penny stock again.

(Leaving out Ex CoCeo stepped down because money laundering & fraud accusations, shady acquisition with relatives garbage company and all the paid YouTube channels for pumping this garbage)."
2021-06-27 19:01:43,wallstreetbets,The ceo is a dilution machine though. If he starts seeing green he paperhands some shares for sure. Wont be participating in this one

2021-06-27 17:52:18,wallstreetbets,It actually aired on Bloomberg on Saturday. We'll see what we get out of it this week.
2021-06-27 18:12:23,wallstreetbets,"Many growth/speculative stocks fell at least 50% from February highs. Nano Dimension suffered a over 60% drop. There wasn‚Äôt any company news that would of caused such a sell of. To me, I just think the stock had such a rapid spike in the beginning of the year and people were selling off at any price that let them secure a gain."
2021-06-27 19:02:16,wallstreetbets,"It was a combination of the bond yield, and the fact that they simply have been working harder on raising money to fund the transition in their business model as opposed to focusing on what they had been doing previously. 

NNDM is going to be a success, but I‚Äôm not so sure WSB is ready for it. After a couple more acquisitions, and the new machine hits the market, (by years end, hopefully) we‚Äôll see good movement from the stock. I wouldn‚Äôt expect ti to rise much above $10/$11, but in 5 years time? If you get I now, you will easily double your money on fundamentals alone, and probably more now that the markets operate on speculation and hype from retail/social media."
2021-06-27 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is low. Two things I can say about that:

The CEO personally invested in the company when he joined.

&#x200B;

Also, many insiders/executives from the acquired companies have warrants/options to buy the stock at a specific price later on."
2021-06-27 19:42:19,wallstreetbets,"Care to show where you saw they got ""removed"" from the Tel Aviv exchange? To my knowledge, they voluntarily left and went to where the majority of their market share is, which is America. (NASDAQ)

You have four of your five points regarding dilution. Dilution isn't the end of the world for a company. 

Fundaments are good, good growth & value play. Dilution is over, money is in the company's bank. Sounds alright to me"
2021-06-27 19:17:44,wallstreetbets,He did mention in a recent interview no more offerings are needed because they have sufficient cash to do what they envision.
2021-06-27 19:25:26,wallstreetbets,"insider holdings is already low enough, idk if him selling would effect much"

2021-06-27 19:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Here‚Äôs a bonus:

Because of 90% institutional ownership, the 8% short interest is rather significant (8% is already high for an individual stock; even tobacco and oil are under 1%, and people are gunning for them politically).

Float net of institutional ownership: 58M shares;

Short interest as of 6/15: 45M shares;

One big buy could mean every available share has short-interest, and could trigger a mini squeeze.  My assumption is at this price funds won‚Äôt unload, which is why I used the 58M number to start."

Even $61 is a forward PE of 15 vs EPS of $4, which I think is quite conservative.

Edit:  Just pulled up Netflix and Paramount+ and I cannot find a discernible difference in functionality except you get live television with Paramount+ and you dont with Netflix.  Its better than HBO Max, Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon Video and equal to Netflix with just as much content.  I own them all."
2021-06-27 19:49:15,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not a good comparison and that popular comparison is why the stock has been  overlooked. 

P+ is streaming but it‚Äôs it‚Äôs own niche in streaming - not all streaming competes with Netflix and they aren‚Äôt trying to replace Netflix. Streaming is not going to be a 1 service game anymore that‚Äôs going to change and it already has started. 

They aren‚Äôt trying to take share of NFLX or Prime‚Äî- they‚Äôre after the final slice of the chord cutters from the cable tv market.  It‚Äôs much more of a cable tv replacement.  Afterall they still produce tons of content for Prime exclusive  (which viac owns, but Amazon pays for production and short term exclusivity) . Viac still needs Netflix afterall as a distribution partner and vice versa. 

What does Netflix not have that you‚Äôd still need cable tv for? 

Other than a shit ton of content News+live sports and a lot of tv-style programming would be up there as well as older kids/teen content. 

That is exactly where P+ is strongest, they have the nfl, ncaa, champions league, cbs news, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central , bet, cmt, smithshsonian etc etc. plus other big name content like movies and shows to come."

2021-06-27 18:48:52,wallstreetbets,maybe its just me but there are probably 5 decent movies on there and zero tv shows. I got a free trial to watch the new movie infinite (total garbage) and to rewatch the indiana jones trilogy. Haven't seen anything else worth while.

Also their current ratio now is 1.78 which means they are fine with regard to their short term liabilities."
2021-06-27 19:03:37,wallstreetbets,"It all depends on your taste, I enjoyed Infinite even though it had its obvious flaws because the graphics were cool and I like Mark Wahlberg.  Watch The Stand, it was an awesome remake.  There is a lot I watch but we probably dont have the same tastes, for me Netflix has nothing I really want to watch"
2021-06-27 19:14:36,wallstreetbets,"Agree about people‚Äôs tastes.

Netflix has ‚ÄúCobra Kai.‚Äù

P+ has Star Trek, iCarly, SpongeBob reboots."

Beside that there seems to be problems with the cars: autopilot starts breaking when it should't, Cost 8500‚Ç¨ to fix it. Ledlights break after 2 years ‚Ç¨1000,- each. These are 2 of the 17 complaints. They say the damage is near 30k a car. 
They are planning a lawsuit against Telsa for millions and if it spread true Europa multiple billions.

2021-06-27 17:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Transitively, are you also skeptical of the auto manufacturers who are reliant on purchasing those credits from Tesla as to not get penalized from the government? Ford, Toyota, GM, etc?"
2021-06-27 17:42:33,wallstreetbets,"Probably not, the ‚Äòrecall‚Äô was actually just a software update. Chinese Tesla owners don‚Äôt have to bring their car in for it either. It‚Äôs equivalent to an update to your phone‚Äôs OS"
2021-06-27 19:10:59,wallstreetbets,This happens with all car manufacturers. They do everything they can to keep it silent or avoid any major recalls
2021-06-27 18:39:44,wallstreetbets,"That would be braindead investors getting out, it's an over the air software update and not a recall"
2021-06-27 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Those other companies won‚Äôt need those credits for long. Once the major players come out with EV‚Äôs, there is no more need. And Stellantis already announced they won‚Äôt need EV credits anymore.

So yes, to the extent EV credits were some long term competitive advantage, there would be an issue. 

But they will be a non-factor in under three years. And TSLA will then not only lose it‚Äôs EVEN credits, but it will be faced head-on with actual competition. TSLA caught the major automakers asleep at the switch and showed the world how beautiful and powerful and advanced an EV could be. (Compare to the fucking Chevy Volt). 

Watch [this promo ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rzGlVG75kUM) for the Hummer and tell me TSLA doesn‚Äôt have legit competition once cars like the Hummer and Mustang and F150 are all electric.

TSLA has done a lot of things well, but EV credits are a blip and will end very soon."

2021-06-27 17:45:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is what I heard too
2021-06-27 18:04:15,wallstreetbets,"Some great points, and I totally agree. I just have to think Tesla‚Äôs software and battery tech is years ahead of said competition, but we‚Äôll see when everything is out on the road and reviewed. I preordered a Cybertruck but I‚Äôd take a Rivian or F150 Lightning if I could get it sooner for sure!"
2021-06-27 17:54:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, honestly I have no idea why all the headlines say ‚Äòrecall‚Äô. If you look in the articles, they mention it‚Äôs just a downloadable software update that prevents the car from activating cruise control when turning the steering wheel."
2021-06-27 18:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think these electric pick up trucks will have sales that blow past anyone‚Äôs expectations for the first five years or so. How that affects the automaker stock prices, I have no idea (although I am long a few dozen Ford deep-in-the-money call LEAPs.) 

- for rural farmers: you can power your house of the F150 for days in power outages. No more gas generator. 

- for contractors: many already operate cordless jobsites with all battery tools. These trucks will let you charge the batteries on these tools all day without needing thousands of dollars of generators on site. And if you run actual tools, you can run them off of your truck battery all day too (many job sites don‚Äôt have power during various phases of construction and trades like roofing often don‚Äôt ever enter the home and need external power)

- with home solar - you now can drive that truck for FREE (no more $100 fill ups at the gas station)

- operating and maintenance costs will be far lower than gas trucks

- federal tax credits of up to $12,500 will make $70-$80k F150‚Äôs affordable for a large portion of America. 

I‚Äôm really excited for these trucks to arrive. I drive a Ram 1500 for work and can‚Äôt wait to get solar/go electric."
2021-06-27 18:26:53,wallstreetbets,It is weird.. some miss-translation from the Chinese source maybe but nobody bothered to fix it? Anyways I wonder sometimes if there are trading bots keyed to specific news headlines like this and they‚Äôll sell on Monday even if it‚Äôs wrong and just a normal ota update. I guess we‚Äôll see Monday if coders forgot to tell the bots to ignore the ‚Äúrecall‚Äù lol

With a Forward P/E of around 18.5, you can easily argue CRSR's current valuation should be $39.69 ( +14.6% ). Throw in some multiple expansion for it's growth potential and tailwinds from the growth of E-Sports and the professional streaming boom, and I think it's an easy buy with a PT of around $47 over the next 12 months.

2021-06-27 16:55:24,wallstreetbets,"Last 10 years of money printing didn't cause inflation because:
1) Fed's QE trapped money in the financial system and it was not handed out to people
2) China cheap manufacturers were a global disinflationary force
3) Technological advancement

What's changed in 2020-present:
1) China is slowly starting to not be so cheap. Replacing countries such Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines are yet to take on the full manufacturing load of China
2) On top of Fed's QE, through fiscal spend, money is being handed out to people

Arguments against persistent inflation into the future:
1) People are more focused on paying off debts rather than going out and spending the money
2) Yield curve doesn't incentivize banks to create more loans (but it's better than how it was a year ago)
3) Supply side will eventually pick up to rising demand/prices, and will bring cost down

Arguments for persistent inflation:
1) Continuing fiscal spend into the future
2) Supply side might not be able to pick with demand in time

Rising shipping cost might not go down. Oil prices not go down because of less Capex spend in the area as part of the greening initiative. Dollar devaluation might continue if Fed doesn't choose to tighten and continues to monetize debt.

Edit: sticking wage inflation might have a ripple effect"

These engines are supposed to save the airlines $1 million in fuel per year/per plane. I personally machined hundreds of these parts over the past few years for their test engines. I watched the test flight they had online in January of last year. I was working 10-12 hours a day to keep up until they put a halt on production because of covid and the FAA concerns. But they really plan on ramping up big time. Hopefully soon

2021-06-27 19:21:50,wallstreetbets,"Investing into Chinese stonks is so utterly braindead, it fits right into this sub.

For real:

* There is a *massive* currency and trade/sanction war risk. Just look how easy it was for the US to shoot Huawei at point-blank range.
* China is not a democracy, it isn't a country where you as a foreigner can expect deals to stay (the ""legal system"" will always favor the Chinese part), it isn't a country where a Chinese can expect deals to be honored (just ask Jack Ma - become a threat to the Party and you'll get disappeared)"

You are correct. AAPL sells iPhones at $1000. NIO will sell ET7 at $80,000.

2021-06-27 14:38:40,wallstreetbets,NIO could easily be kings of a lot more countries than just China. I think NIO and TSLA will fight for Europe. Should be good for prices
2021-06-27 14:46:50,wallstreetbets,King of China Yes. King of Europe in Premium Segment Probably. King in 78 OBOR Rest of the World Countries Probably.

2021-06-27 16:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Trumps policies were much more relaxed with China, look at his polices not the jibberish coming out of his mouth.  Trump would‚Äôve also entertained back channel deals as well.

The current administration takes a much more protective stance when it comes to developing certain industries within America, hence they would not want a competitor such as NIO to enter the market unless some sort of partnership could be made or agreed upon."
2021-06-27 19:46:28,wallstreetbets,"well Tesla was not. Giga press is just die casting a large part, rather then smaller parts. Other companies have been playing with die casting for a long time."
2021-06-27 17:01:55,wallstreetbets,"We are literally living on two seperate planets.

I lived on one where Trump constantly pushed and supported us business (spending his entire time as president elect drumming up foreign investment in the US), started a trade war with china, pumped military spending while the navy upped it's ""freedom of navigation"" operations through waters china claims,  tried to increase local medicine production during operation warp speed, and explicitly blamed china for covid via leak from the wuhan lab (which is suddenly no longer a conspiracy) 

Most of the ""covid relief"" passed under the current occupation has been to foreign nations.  The best he has done is try to claim credit for the few trump policies he didn't undo. 

So really, where have you been the last 4 years, because it certainly wasn't the US"

2021-06-27 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,Keep the squeeze glasses off Clov is a long term play that should have a fair value of 20-30 dollars by next year. They are doubling their geographic footprint and consistently gaining members and contracts year after year.

If you look at the trend, we‚Äôre still seeing GME rise. Obviously there was a huge sell off around 300-320ish, but people are buying the dip. My target price is around 400, a number we all know is not at all out of reach for this stock."
2021-06-27 16:00:35,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs all just speculation though. Are we just expecting it to go up based in volume?

2021-06-27 16:32:36,wallstreetbets,The recent investors presentation has invalidated the bear thesis; addition to the Russell index; shorts doubling down to save their position. This is going to get very interesting.

2021-06-27 16:39:23,wallstreetbets,I'm going to double double down in GOEV again this time in stocks.
2021-06-27 13:52:25,wallstreetbets,Good analysis. GOEV definitely looks like it's being manipulated.
2021-06-27 15:06:33,wallstreetbets,Love Canoo. If anyone‚Äôs interested here check out the website and watch some of the latest videos of their upcoming vehicles. They are amazingly well thought out. Honestly think this is going to print.
2021-06-27 13:23:18,wallstreetbets,"This is a great in depth analysis, thank you man."
2021-06-27 14:04:59,wallstreetbets,Canoo will moon this week. The price has been heavily manipulated to be under 10. I feel a short squeeze coming.
2021-06-27 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,I see myself whipping a Canoo; they‚Äôre different.
2021-06-27 16:24:08,wallstreetbets,"20+ class action suits + SEC ‚Äòfact finding‚Äô investigation which hangs over $GOEV is to some extent a cause of substantially different market valuation. When, if, sky clears up for Canoo, the SP will pop"
2021-06-27 19:14:10,wallstreetbets,I'd take the F150 Lightning over the Canoo pickup any day.. I don't think they will be able compete with legacy EV pickups or newcomers.
2021-06-27 13:12:22,wallstreetbets,"This is FSR‚Äôs second kick at the can. They‚Äôve done it before and I think that warrants a premium compared to GOEV.

2021-06-27 19:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Definitely. On Friday with over double the average volume the trading range stayed so tight....no other explanation but manipulation.

2021-06-27 17:17:39,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think you understand how a class action works. 20+ ambulance chasing firms with no lead plaintiff is what it is.
2021-06-27 13:16:29,wallstreetbets,They have not done it before. They went bankrupt before.
2021-06-27 16:12:26,wallstreetbets,They have done it before by making an exhaust that points forward.
2021-06-27 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,"They're definitely different. New things often look ugly at first, but they're growing on me."
2021-06-27 13:28:05,wallstreetbets,For clarity what I meant is that they‚Äôve navigated bringing an EV from concept to market. Yes they went bankrupt but there were other factors that led to that.
2021-06-27 15:52:18,wallstreetbets,Hasn't their CEO bankrupted several businesses and had to pay massive fines for ripping off other designs for vehicles? I mean look st the Ocean its basically a RangeRover but not...
2021-06-27 16:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes he was sued by his former employer because his designs looked similar to HIS designs that were done for Aston Martin. The previous failure was also due to battery suppliers going bankrupt. 

Again, I‚Äôm not shitting on a bull case for GOEV, just pointing out why I think FSR is trading at a premium."
2021-06-27 17:01:33,wallstreetbets,"They are at the same point basically in their timeline and have ~30% more cash, I'd expect a 30% premium at the most. So IMO either FSR is overpriced by about 50% or GOEV is underpriced by about 100%."

2021-06-27 13:43:57,wallstreetbets,"It is indeed unfortunate. The problem with tracking WISH in the current version of the tracker is that it would mark posts saying 'I wish I was rich' as a post mentioning WISH. That is a problem with the problem so far and in future versions I am trying to fix it. Hope you understand the problem, but thank you very much for your comment!"
2021-06-27 15:48:54,wallstreetbets,Because it‚Äôs getting spammed by bots constantly. It‚Äôs the most obvious and fake pump I‚Äôve seen on this sub.

2021-06-27 16:08:06,wallstreetbets,Buy 1 more GME share
2021-06-27 13:49:40,wallstreetbets,"I do understand the problem. But it still deserves to not be ignored from the list. I would include it where it belongs and just mention that 10-15% of WISH mentions are potentially from use of the word, and not of the stock. Then the people reading your post can make their own decisions based on its position on your charts.

IMO, most people saying WISH mean the stock and people who hate the ticker go out of their way never to say the word WISH. The fact it's not on the list at all kinda makes me feel like the list is not based on reality, I think it should be revised cause it feels disingenuous to the amount of love WISH gets on this subreddit.

Also, 90% of the time people say I wish I was rich, they are intentionally mentioning the ticker."
2021-06-27 15:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Just because you believe everyone is a bot other than yourself, doesn't make it true. The amount of times I've been called a bot for liking something others don't is incredible. You guys are out of your minds and are full of hatred. Imagine being triggered by a ticker name, you guys are definitely special folk!"
2021-06-27 15:53:44,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve clicked on a fair number of the WISH posters, and their accounts have never posted anything else before. All they have done in their history is mention this stock. That seems pretty fake to me. No doubt there are genuine people interested, especially now after the bots did their work, but it has been fishy as hell."
2021-06-27 16:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Fair, but it's all ass backwards. The people bashing bots are bashing plenty of real people and calling them names and fakes. When you all keep crying wolf no one can be bothered to believe you anymore. Everyone is tired of hearing you cry fake at every living person and pump and dump at every corner. Also WISH ain't that bad. If you can't see the upside you're just blindly following other bashers. It's like you've unknowingly become a bash bot yourself."

2021-06-27 13:32:14,wallstreetbets,I have 16 of those contracts too.
2021-06-27 19:43:44,wallstreetbets,Its only going red on Fridays because idiots keep trying to scalp on 5DTEs. If they bought out a bit in August and October they'd be building positions as this climbs and it would smooth the Fridays out quite a lot.
2021-06-27 16:42:23,wallstreetbets,Yikes... I think if $wish breaks and holds 15 it‚Äôs game over... 15 >>> 18 >> 20 >> 34 >> 6Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£
2021-06-27 16:39:06,wallstreetbets,Good shit! I started buying at $11 and got confident last week with the volume. $wish 69
2021-06-27 18:44:51,wallstreetbets,Both... lots of misinformation about SI but the ppl I trust say it‚Äôs a lot higher than ppl think. Beaten up off ipo debut.. deep value. CEO wouldn‚Äôt sell to Amazon/baba/etc at 10b so $30+ seems a lock.. with volume and hype $69 short term >$300 long imo for $wish
2021-06-27 19:46:39,wallstreetbets,Its longer term than a one off pump and dump. There's an options chain built out aggressively to 40 / share all the way out to December.

2021-06-27 19:18:45,wallstreetbets,how did you figure it was supposed to hit last Friday?
2021-06-27 19:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Stop selling CCs. You're selling to retail most likely and stopping them from buying from a hedge fund that will buy additional shares to leverage the gamma pumps.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'll be happy when your CC shares are exercised and the stock moves past your strikes to fuck you. If you want to make money selling options against a rising stock, do CSPs. The delta hedging helps the bulls and the CSPs give you an entry or a premium."
2021-06-27 16:40:33,wallstreetbets,You apes are savages! I hope it goes to $69 and you buy your pants. $wish üöÄ
2021-06-27 13:59:13,wallstreetbets,Lol I sold off half the other day at a 75% gain. Now I can sleep easy for these lol
2021-06-27 19:44:10,wallstreetbets,"17 is the real fight. That's where a bunch of short positions were opened. JP Morgan, Citadel etc."
2021-06-27 16:43:17,wallstreetbets,"The Volume has been very good. I think that last dip was an all time low, even down here it's severely undervalued as a company. It's not unusual for üåàüêª to pile on after an IPO but people can see its turned the corner and will have to reevaluate."
2021-06-27 18:47:02,wallstreetbets,Cool. I'll gobble up 50 or so shares and forget about it til it hits $300. Thanks for the clear response!
2021-06-27 14:54:03,wallstreetbets,well that's one option too
2021-06-27 13:45:39,wallstreetbets,Have fun being locked out of your account and losing all your money lol
2021-06-27 18:27:37,wallstreetbets,"Meh.

No cult, but i came at you wrong.

Good luck and;
A) You win: Congrats and fuck you.
B) You lose: You'll get em next time, bud. But please share loss porn."
2021-06-27 17:04:15,wallstreetbets,Exactly.. all hyped ipos were beaten up.. $wish took the biggest beating.. way undervalued now.
2021-06-27 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,Full transparency guaranteed. Hope you‚Äôre positions print.

I have not gotten in on any IPO's yet but browsing the upcoming IPO calendar on NASDAQ looks like good ole KRISPY KREME is on the list for the first of July!

I am blinded by my love and nostalgic memories of Krispy Kreme growing up in NC so I was wondering if any of you have experience with IPO's on opening day? 
 
Seems like well known, and tech companies usually do well but they can also take a dive from the paper hands making a quick buck. 

Bullish or Bearish on this one?
or any other upcoming IPO suggestions?

Navy/Marine Corps COVID-19 Study Findings Published in New England Journal of Medicine
12 November 2020
From Naval Medical Research Center Public Affairs. Please read what DARPA wants.

Implementing public health best practices on their own among young adults may not be enough to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and additional actions, such as widespread and repeated testing, are recommended to reduce risk of viral spread, according to research published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Implementing best practice public health measures on their own among young adults may not be enough to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and additional actions, such as widespread and repeated testing, are recommended to reduce the risk of viral spread, according to research published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Researchers from Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), in collaboration with scientists from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, conducted a study to understand the dynamics of viral transmission and host response to COVID-19 in young adults in order to inform public health measures in response to COVID-19 in a group setting.

The study, COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines (CHARM), took place at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, and included nearly 2,000 participants, composed mostly of 18- to 20-year-old healthy Marine recruits predominantly from the Eastern United States. Upon arrival for recruit training, they spent two weeks in a strict, supervised group quarantine that required wearing masks and emphasized hand washing and social distancing as they began their initial military instruction, primarily outdoors.

To determine asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and transmission among study participants during the quarantine period, researchers collected study questionnaires and specimens weekly and conducted both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology tests. PCR tests are the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19.

""The study hopes to improve medical readiness for the Marines and the DoD as well as inform force health protection measures,‚Äù said Cmdr. Andrew Letizia lead researcher for the study and deputy director of NMRCs infectious diseases directorate. ‚ÄúThe investigators and I believe these findings will help the DoD, other public health entities, and society as a whole mitigate the spread of the pandemic not only among this particular population, but to those they might unknowingly infect as well.""

The authors also found that nearly 6% of study participants arrived to recruit training with antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previous exposure to the virus. Additionally, at the start of the supervised quarantine, 1% of participants tested positive, 95% of whom were asymptomatic. All reported self-quarantine at home for two weeks before reporting, denied any direct exposure to sick contacts and did not have any risk factors for exposure to COVID-19. Therefore, questions assessing current symptoms or risk factors would not have identified 95% of these individuals who were infected.

According to the authors, these results suggest the need to augment public health measures with widespread initial and repeated surveillance testing to prevent COVID-19 transmission in group settings.

READ THIS PARAGRAPH AGAIN

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests.  

Hope all of you had a pretty good week in the market. After moving sideways for the last 2 months, the S&P 500 hit a new high last week (+2.7%) ([Fun fact:](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/stock-market-weekly-update) This is the 33rd time this year S&P 500 is hitting a new high - a spectacular 26% of all trading days in 2021).

In spite of the pullback experienced in mid-June following the concerns of a Fed Policy shift, both the Nasdaq Composite (+2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+3.4%) also ended the week with strong gains. Even though the overall market was green, some of the most popular stocks did end up taking a beating as shown below.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rmu6l4gc8t771.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=56048e38714148ca8c96346b391591a2148fe49f)

WISH finally overtook AMC to become the most discussed stock! This was mainly driven by the 20% increase in stock price over the last week. Investors were also extremely bullish about the stock as reflected by the sentiment. Tesla has made a comeback to the top 10 list with an 8% jump in stock price.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Globalstar($GSAT):** GSAT, an American satellite communications company gained a massive 46% this week following a [Buy rating with a 150% upside](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/globalstar-rated-buy-b-riley-likes-potential-for-return-on-assets) from investment bank B.Riley. The stock jumped \~18% on Monday following the report and has continued its upward trend. According to Riley,

>Globalstar and its sponsors, after years of development, support, and patience, are at long last starting to realize a return on satellite system and spectrum assets, making 2021 an excellent time, in our opinion, to buy GSAT

**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe jumped 9% as the company is set to join the Russell 3000 index. Most of the retail crowd is trying to front-run the purchases by hedge fund managers (Fund managers that track the Russell index will need to purchase the shares after its added to the index).

**Trade Desk($TTD):** TTD was generating discussions as Google announced that they would delay the removal of third-party cookies that help advertisers track users until 2023. The news also sends the stock price soaring as the stock finished the week with a 25% gain. 

**Purple Innovation($PRPL):** The current volatility of the market is perfectly reflected in this stock as an 8% run-up in a billion-dollar company has generated zero news! The retail crowd was hyping up the stock as the company has announced an off-cycle investor event which will take place on 6/29 and also because the company was one of the first meme stocks that were picked up by Reddit almost a year back.

*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.*¬†Hope you enjoyed this week‚Äôs issue!"

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Beginner and Intermediate Guide To Options: Everything You Need To Know To Stop Losing Money Like A Complete Tard   

**Introduction**

For those of you that are living underneath a rock, options represent the contractual right to purchase or sell blocks of 100 shares in the underlying security. Because each option represents 100 shares, they often provide volatile leveraged like returns and are often used by either professional investors as part of a sophisticated investment strategy or by retail ~~gamblers~~ investors as a way to potentially gain massive amounts of money while putting up a relatively small amount.

In this post, I will walk you through the pricing fundamentals, the Greeks, and common option strategies. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will stop losing all your money like a bunch of half-wits. Well, you probably still lose money, but at least you can act like a smartass about it.

**Pricing Fundamentals**

This section is going to be focused on the fundamentals and theoretical aspects behind what gives an option value. Aka, that boomer shit.

There are two types of options: American and European. American options give the holder the right to exercise the option at any given time prior to the expiration date (cause freedom, that‚Äôs why). These options are the ones you typically buy from your broker. European options on the other hand are fucking gay because they only let you exercise at the expiry date and since none of you cucks ever bought an option from a Europoor before, I will focus solely on American options for this DD post.

**Value Breakdown**

Every option, regardless if it‚Äôs a chad call or a gay put has two pricing components that justify it‚Äôs current market value: the intrinsic value and the speculative value. Let me explain via this equation:

*Value = Intrinsic + Speculative Value*

Intrinsic value is how ITM an option is, and the speculative value is the chances of it becoming even more ITM by the time to expiry. For example, assume a call option has a strike of $10 and the current price of the stock is $12. That would mean the intrinsic value is $2. However, the option expires in let‚Äôs say 3 months, and is being traded at $3. That would mean the additional 1-dollar difference above the $2 is the speculative value of the option. That $1 represents investors speculating the option will become even more ITM within that three months time frame.

Taking that logic further we can derive the fundamental value for a call and put option as:

Call = stock price ‚Äì strike + speculative

Put = strike ‚Äì stock price + speculative

**Leverage**

Now that you know that a single option grants you exposure to multiple shares and the returns are therefore leveraged, you might be thinking to yourself oh gosh, I hope there is a way for me to calculate exactly how leveraged this option will be. Don‚Äôt worry, there is. You can calculate exactly how leveraged an option is via this equation:

(Option Delta x Share Price) / Option price

**Volatility**

This is the big one. If the market is a casino, then this is the bookie playing around with the odds on the board. So if you want to leave the casino with money and not another man‚Äôs dick in your hand, you need to know volatility cold. For options trading, there are two kinds of volatility: realized and unrealized.

*Realized*

All you need to know is that realized volatility is the historic price movement of the stock. It is measured as the standard deviation (or deviation from average price) from the average price of a stock in a given time frame.

*Unrealized Or Implied Volatility*

This is the most important of the two. To put it in simplest terms, IV is the expected magnitude of a stock‚Äôs future price changes expressed as an annual percentage.

This expected yearly price change can be expressed as the following:

*1-Year Expected Range = stock price +/- (stock price x IV)*

What is important with this formula is that it shows the riskier stocks usually have the higher IVs which will result in a larger annual expected range. Taking this a step further we can also visualize the expected stock price changes via standard deviations.

Assuming most of you passed high school, a fair amount of you must be somewhat familiar with the normal distribution graph. We can demonstrate this with a graph of a normal distribution that shows a 1 standard deviation of the price movement of a stock that is trading at $100 with an IV of 25%. This means that with a standard deviation of 1 there is a 68% the stock will trade within the range of $75 - $125.

We can also take it a step further and do a 2-standard deviation which will give us a representation of a stock‚Äôs fluctuation with a 95% confidence interval. In the chart below, still assuming a stock price of $100 and an IV of 25%, the range has doubled to $50 - $150. Remember, in statistics, we can go all the way to 3-standard deviations which is a confidence interval of 99.7% and that will mean a range of $25 - $175.

Now that your high school nostalgia is out of the way, there is one more useful tidbit of knowledge I will show you.

We can also calculate the stock‚Äôs expected move over any period via this equation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pf729pg4t771.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f73cbe0ad10dfbfc42b4dedca03f75b8d4d93c1

\*\**19.1 is the square root of 365 or the days in a year. For Simplicity‚Äôs sake, I simplified the denominator.*

This way whenever you buy an option that doesn‚Äôt expire in one year exactly, you can still map out the expected price range as stated by option traders. That way, you know what you are getting into and be all surprised when a dick is shoved up your ass (unless you‚Äôre in to that, then call me).

**Greeks**

What you all need to know is that within the premiums of every option that you buy there are certain assumptions that are priced in, much like there are certain assumptions that are priced into a stock price. These assumptions are often represented by certain Greek letters and by understanding what they are and how they influence the option‚Äôs value, you can better understand what you are betting on and whether or not the risks are tilted in your favor.

In this part, I am going to talk about the four Greeks every last one of you degenerates must know by heart: Vega, Delta, Gamma, and Theta. And no, they aren‚Äôt the name of the fraternity your girlfriend goes to so that she can blow half the chads on campus. These guys are the ones that will determine whether you make actual life-changing money or move back to your mother‚Äôs basement while your new stepdad subtly judges you.

**Vega (V):** This represents the change in option price per change in the option‚Äôs implied volatility. Vega is highest when the stock price is at the strike price and when the option is farther out from the expiration date.

Ex: Let‚Äôs assume the premium of an option is 7.5, IV is at 20% and vega at 0.12. If the IV moves up from 20 to 21.5, that is a 1.5 increase. The option price will increase by 1.5 x 0.12 = 0.18. 0.18 + 7.5 = 7.68

**Delta (Œî):** Delta is a change in the option‚Äôs price due to a change in underlying stock price. Assuming we have a delta of 0.5, that means per every dollar the stock price goes up by, the option premium will go up by 50% of that change. Delta is often highest the farther ITM the option is and will often be the most volatile the closer the strike price is to the stock price. Call options have a delta of 0-1 while Puts have a negative delta of 0 ‚Äì (-1). The absolute delta of an option also tells you the probability that the option will finish in the money.

**Gamma (T):** Gamma is the rate of change in an option‚Äôs delta per 1-point move in the underlying‚Äôs share price. It is essentially the first derivative of delta and is used to gauge the price movement of an option relative to how far OTM or ITM it is. Taking this further, gamma is also the second derivative of an option‚Äôs price with respect to the underlying share‚Äôs price. This is because the delta is the first derivative of share price and since gamma is the first derivative of the delta, it is, therefore, the second derivative of the share price.

Whenever you long an option, you have positive gamma exposure and when you short, you have negative gamma exposure.

It is also important to note that gamma approaches 0 the farther an option becomes OTM or ITM. Gamma is also at its highest when the strike is ATM.

**Theta (O):** This Greek is probably the easiest to understand. Theta is the time decay of an option as it approaches its expiration date. This means that theta measures the constant and steady decrease in an intrinsic value for an option on a daily basis.

**Delta Curve:**

For those of you that don‚Äôt know, the delta of an option is not stagnant, and its rate of change in accordance with share price changes is represented by the option‚Äôs gamma. You can actually map out the expected change in an option‚Äôs delta in accordance with the underlying share price via the delta curve.

Let me show you the delta curve for a call option:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dxzwnvwh4t771.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dd06ce979c5d1be575cab96f5f73342519a129c

Note that the delta becomes more volatile as the option becomes ATM as the stock price rises before slowing that rate of change as the delta approaches 1 the deeper the option goes ITM. The delta will approach 1 because the absolute value of a delta represents the market‚Äôs expectation that the option will expire ITM so it makes sense that the more ITM an option becomes, the higher that percentage will be as it approaches 100%.

When you look at the delta curve for a put option, you will find a lot of similarities with the call option delta:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3i8zgli4t771.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2abacf875b84c0df9120c3950a16068839691e

Just like with call options, the delta becomes more volatile as the option becomes ATM; however, remember that put options have a negative delta and because it becomes more ITM the lower the stock price is, a rising stock price will result in a delta approaching 0.

**Equations**

\*\*\* *I got these equations from my CFA textbooks so the nomenclature for these option strategies might be different than what you are seeing on your brokerage page. Either way, you can just look at the descriptions I have made and figure out which strategies I am talking about.*

To wrap this up I am going to go through some popular options strategies that are often mentioned in investing subreddits. These descriptions will include what the option strategies entail, what will be their value at expiration, how much profit you can make, your maximum possible gain, how much money you can lose, and what price you need to be at in order to break even.

First here is a list of the variables I will be using and what they represent.

S0 : stock price at open

ST : stock price at close

X : strike price

Co : call premium

Po : put premium

XH : higher strike

CL / PL: premium on call/put with a lower strike

CH / PH: premium on call/put with a higher strike

***Covered Call***

This is longing for a stock and selling an OTM call option on it. People often do this in order to increase the ‚Äúyield‚Äù on investment, meaning they get to haul in some additional cash flow on their stock holdings. Benefits to this strategy include the cash flow you receive from selling calls and its ability to reduce the overall volatility in your portfolio. The downside is that because you sold calls, you limit your upside potential because if the stock price goes over the strike price, it would be assumed that the option you sold will be exercised; therefore, there is a ceiling on how much money you can earn.

Expiration value: ST ‚Äì Max\[(ST ‚Äì X), 0\]

Profit at expiration ST ‚Äì Max\[(ST ‚Äì X), 0\] ‚Äì So + Co

Max Gain (X ‚Äì So) + Co

Max Loss So ‚Äì Co

Breakeven Price: So ‚Äì Co

***Protective Put***

This is longing a stock and a put option on the stock that is usually OTM. The idea here is that the put option serve as a kind of insurance on your stock holdings. By purchasing puts, you limit yourself on how much money you can possibly lose which will serve you well whenever the market decides to hit the shitter and enters a correction. Another benefit to this strategy is that unlike covered calls, you still have unlimited upside potential on your stock holdings. The downside is the money you have to spend in order to insure your positions.

Expiration value ST + Max\[( X ‚Äì ST), 0\]

Profit at expiration ST + Max\[( X ‚Äì ST), 0\] ‚Äì So ‚Äì Po

Max Gain ST ‚Äì So ‚Äì Po

Max Loss: So ‚Äì X + Po

B.E price So + Po

***Bull Call Spread***

This is a directional play with options. Meaning in this case you are betting that the stock will go up. Bull Calls is longing for a call option with a lower strike and at the same time selling a call option on the same stock with the same expiry date at a higher strike. Here you are trying to profit off the deltas in which the positive delta for the option with the lower strike will be greater than the delta for the option with the higher strike and as the stock price goes up, you can profit from the delta difference. A benefit to this strategy is that because you are selling an option as well as buying one, you can limit your cash outflow. A downside is that you also limit the amount of money you can gain with this strategy. You can also do this strategy with put options in which you sell puts with the higher strike and buy puts with the lower strikes. For simplicity‚Äôs sake, I will just list the equations for the strategy with call options.

Profit at expiration Max( 0, ST ‚Äì XL ) ‚Äì Max(0, ST ‚Äì XH) ‚Äì CL + CH

Max Profit XH ‚Äì XL ‚Äì CL + CH

Max Loss CL ‚Äì CH

BE XL + CL ‚Äì CH

***Bear Put Spread***

Similar direction play just like Bull Calls but in this case you are betting the stock is going down. Here you are longing put options with the higher strike and selling puts with a lower strike. The expiration date must be the same for both options. The rationale of profiting off the Greeks and the pros and cons remain similar to Bull Calls.

Profit at expiration Max(0, XH ‚Äì ST) ‚Äì Max(0, XL ‚Äì ST) ‚Äì PH + PL

Max Profit XH ‚Äì XL ‚Äì PH + PL

Max loss PH ‚Äì PL

Breakeven XH + PL ‚Äì PH

***Collar***

This strategy is used when you think a stock is going to trade in a certain range. Here you are longing the stock, longing an ITM protective put, and selling an OTM call. The idea is that the put will provide downside protection while the call provides a ceiling on how much money you can earn. The main benefit is that it allows you to buy protection while limiting your cash outflow since you sold a call. The downside is that upside is limited just like a covered call strategy.

Profit at expiration (ST ‚Äì So) + (XL ‚Äì ST) ‚Äì (ST ‚Äì XH) ‚Äì (Po ‚Äì Co)

Max profit XH ‚Äì So ‚Äì (Po ‚Äì Co)

Max loss So ‚Äì XL + (Po ‚Äì Co)

Breakeven So + (Po / Co)

***Straddle***

This is a directional play except over here you have no idea what the direction is. This strategy is ideal when betting on the general volatility of the stock without any idea on where the direction of the stock will go. Here you are longing both a call and a put on the same stock at the same expiration and at the same strike. The idea is that as the stock goes up or down, the delta of one option will slowly go to 1 while the other goes to 0 and you can profit off the gamma. The benefit to this is that you don‚Äôt need to bet as much in a certain direction, the downside however is that you are longing volatility and if the volatility does not reach high enough to what is priced into the premium, then you will lose money on both the call and the put as they both expire to 0.

Profit Max(0, ST ‚Äì X)

Max profit = Co + Po

Max loss Co + Po

Breakeven X ‚Äì (Co + Po) and X + (Co + Po)"

2021-06-27 10:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I'm new to all of this and 1000% appreciate the above writeup.  I'm just starting to try to figure out options and calls.

I understand selling covered calls which are relatively safer.

But there is something I can't wrap my head around in terms of buying calls.  I get that it's used to leverage far more shares than you could otherwise afford since 1 call = 100 shares.

Ok, so say you buy 50 calls (5000 shares) of a stock trading at 100 with a strike of 105 because you expect it to pop.  The premium is whatever, a dollar.  It doesn't matter, using it for math simplicity.

Buying 5000 shares would cost you $50,000

Buying 50 calls would cost you 50\*100\*1 = 5000$.  You have $10000 liquid.

Less money = leveraging more shares.  I get this completely.  Sure, you could lose the premium if it doesn't pop but this is a casino.

Ok, stock pops to 115, again just illustration.

You want to exercise the calls.  But this could cost  
5000 shares \* 105 = 525,000 which clearly you don't have.

But you could then sell for

5000 \* 115 = 575,000 for a net 45,000 profit (50,000 - 5000 premium).

Ok, here's my question: How does this work?

Do I have to actually pay up the money for the 5000 shares I can't actually afford, or do I just put in the sell order immediately and pick up the 45,000?  Or do I put in a proactive sell option at 115?

Basically I'm trying to figure out how these folks YOLO some insane number of call options, that presumably they don't have the liquid cash to pay for the stock if they are assigned/exercise but still make the profit.

I've read tons of stuff online about this and it's the one question I cannot find an answer to.

If there's an easy resource to point my dumb ass to, I'm all ears."

2021-06-27 10:31:36,wallstreetbets,"Let me add this in case it‚Äôs not written here, 85% of people who BUY an option, call or put lose money, been that way for 30+ years, but the flip side of course is 85% of people who SELL an option make money (think market makers) so to be successful with options is to SELL calls (covered) or my favorite is to SELL puts (naked).  To be successful doing this 
First, find a stock you want to own so if you get put the shares you‚Äôre ok owning it.
Second, look for a chart where the shares are going from lower left to upper right.
Now here‚Äôs where you can make 20%-40% on your cash.
Example is a stock trading for $22, the $20 put 30-60 days out is selling for .80 ($80/contract) the requirement is a convoluted formula but I‚Äôve always calculated as 20% of assigned amount.  Thus for my example your option requirement is ~$400 ($2000 x 20% = $400) the premium you receive is $80 thus it‚Äôs a 20% RETURN ON CAPITAL.  The actual formula is like 20% of put value ($2000) plus the amount out of the money ($100-$200) minus the premium ($80) 
$400 + $100 - $80 = $420 approx. so u see how just using the 20% as I do is very close.  Too many say I‚Äôm getting $80 and ‚Äúrisking‚Äù $2000 = 4% net but u see how that‚Äôs not correct.  I did this exclusively for 4-5 years in early 2000‚Äôs and did extremely well and I still have a separate acct just for this.  Also, if the shares do drop you can accept the shares at $20 and sell calls vs shares or roll puts out farther in time if you expect shares to go back up."

2021-06-27 14:00:39,wallstreetbets,"A good thing to remember is that risk is not actually measured by standard deviation. 

Stddev is the ""second moment of the distribution"" which means that it will adequately describe the risk of normally distributed returns.

The issue is that returns are nowhere near normally distributed. Each moment of the distribution is important in assessing risk. I've personally only worked with data up to the 4th moment which means using the mean, stddev, skewness, and kurtosis data. 

Historical returns show left skewness and positive kurtosis (fat tails especially on the left, and a thinner body).

No institutions use only stddev unless they're passively investing, and even then they've likely got a staff going much deeper."

2021-06-27 10:13:15,wallstreetbets,Great introduction. You might consider adding a discussion of charm. Delta decay is super important and something most people don't understand.
2021-06-27 11:25:38,wallstreetbets,I read the first paragraph and have decided to double down on GME
2021-06-27 10:48:09,wallstreetbets,I do not save a lot of posts...but when I do... old meme format.
2021-06-27 11:04:27,wallstreetbets,I won‚Äôt read the smart post because it‚Äôs too long and it has no TLDR. I just spent 15 minutes reading comments posted by autistic apes.
2021-06-27 11:35:10,wallstreetbets,"I just read the Options Playbook or something I bought on Amazon the other day. This post is equally if not better informative, saved. 


IMO the most important thing is options value, and if you trade based on that reference you‚Äôll do way fucking better than random betting. 

Don‚Äôt buy options that have crazy moves priced in, lose less money.  Don‚Äôt buy big options plays until you understand what the fuck your doing, and you need to get crushed a few times to really learn. 

If a $15 stock has a $17 call for $1 next week, you‚Äôre betting the stock moves up at least 20% or you lose your money come Friday. 

And every day you don‚Äôt have big moves that possibility is smaller hence your FD drops faster. 
No Greek is needed to understand that, 

Just set a target price and only buy things with enough time for intrinsic value to reach that target."
2021-06-27 15:26:43,wallstreetbets,Can you do a tldr that shit is long

2021-06-27 15:26:36,wallstreetbets,Stopped reading when they said European options are gay. Can‚Äôt take someone seriously who in 2021 still uses gay as a synonym for stupid. Especially during pride month.
2021-06-27 10:23:50,wallstreetbets,The problem is that it's hard for us europoor to buy American options and since European options are gay it's just that most of us stick to regular stocks.

2021-06-27 13:11:22,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a pretty good guide, but it‚Äôll be irrelevant for most people here. While implied volatility gives you a measure of what you‚Äôre paying for the option premium, it‚Äôs tough to actually use in practice because most people are not going to be dynamically delta hedging. I‚Äôm a pro volatility trader, so IVs vs HVs are pretty relevant for me as my systems do gamma hedge and scalp deltas. 

Most people on WSB is using options for leverage, myself included (personal account). I think a better way to look at it is risk reward of the option or spread that you‚Äôre putting on. I do think there needs to be a PSA about how people are using options. I would never Yolo five figures into weekly expiring calls. If people are trading in longer duration options, whose expirations are more than a few months away, then implied volatility is a lot more relevant. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend people to trade GME or TSLA Jan23 options as a non-professional. There‚Äôs too many factors at play beside where stock is trading. For example, even if you buy calls and stock goes up, you could lose money on the volatility coming in."

I have googled and youtube trying to specifically understand why/how you can be in profit when the share isn't close to the strike. Is it because of the greeks?(which I still have a ton of learning and studying to do regarding that) or is it more the standard deviation that allows the profit before a share reaches the strike? I know this is a long question, but I've been trying my best with my 50 year old new-to-stock brain to learn this. A lot of things regarding TA have stuck with me but the options....well...it's all GREEK to me. (see what I did there...lol)"

2021-06-27 17:59:53,wallstreetbets,"This is a really great primer for anyone interested in options. Natenberg's 2nd Edition is the standard for anyone seriously interested, while keeping much of the reading light on the mathematics.

I'd only add that Delta can be modeled by the sigmoid function whose range is bounded between 0 and 1. The Gamma function is just the first derivative of Delta. The rate of change of an exponential function is itself exponential, which explains why options can be so lucrative. 

For round 2, you could even go into CRR trees for options modeling. The binomial model is straightforward. There are limitations to that, and Black-Scholes in general (the classical model does not account for early exercise in American options) and both assume constant volatility and interest rates. There have been extensions for dividends in the original, and variations for futures and Forex options (the Black Model, and Garman-Kohlhagen), but for basic Black-Scholes, CRR trees break this down nice visually.

Here's a widget from Wolfram Research to see how a trinomial options model works: [https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TrinomialTreeOptionPricingMethod/](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TrinomialTreeOptionPricingMethod/)"

2021-06-27 10:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Careful, you might start making money with that attitude."
2021-06-27 16:26:04,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-27 11:33:51,wallstreetbets,"You would usually just sell the options before expiration and pocket the $45k.  Alternatively, you can let them expire and if you don‚Äôt have the cash to buy the stock your broker will simply exercise them for you and immediately sell the shares on your behalf.  Either way you keep the profit.  Generally tho, I sell before expiry and make my money via the increase in the contract‚Äôs value."
2021-06-27 11:34:22,wallstreetbets,"All I've done is lose money on options, but I think in theory, the vast majority of people buying options absolutely never intend to exercise the calls. In fact, they might not even care if the stock actually reaches the strike price. All they care about is that the value of the option contract goes up.

So in your example, the options contracts were 1 dollar. If the stock starts moving up and the value of each contract goes to 2 dollars, then you just doubled your money, so you sell the contracts because as you say, you don't have the money to buy all the shares if you wanted to exercise.

Most of the insane gains on options contracts are people buying options when the volatility is low, so the price of the option is cheaper, then when volatility increases (because the stock is making an ""unexpected"" significant move) the contract value goes way up.

At least, that's my understanding, but don't listen to me."
2021-06-27 11:47:32,wallstreetbets,You can sell the calls at any time but you can‚Äôt exercise for the shares if you don‚Äôt have the cash to pay for it
2021-06-27 11:51:26,wallstreetbets,"I could be wrong (most likely am) but I believe you don't have to actually call the shares when the underlying pops. When it pops, the call options you hold pop in value too. So you can still profit the same by selling the call option itself rather than exercising it and then selling the shares."
2021-06-27 13:13:31,wallstreetbets,"You have to be very careful with this. If those options are ITM and it expires, you don‚Äôt have the money to exercise those options to take delivery of the shares. It won‚Äôt be exercised in your account on expiration and you‚Äôll lose it. Make sure you sell the options prior to expiration if you don‚Äôt have the liquidity to cover the stock"

2021-06-27 17:08:58,wallstreetbets,"Are you talking about exercising your option? Ill use call as example because what you want to do is sell the call to close it out. So if the call you bought pops you go in and sell it (the opposite of what you did to get the option) to close it out cause your not gonna exercise it and you dont want to risk losing the value of it and have it expire worthless if price starts to dip and the other question about not having the money, you won't get assigned unless you have the buying power for it. 

So the best thing to do is not let it get to expiry just sell it back before then and thats your profit. This is my understanding Keep learning man im right there with you too."
2021-06-27 13:17:44,wallstreetbets,"You can do both. If you have enough money you can simply exercise and buy a bunch of stock, after which you can either hold it or sell it back at the market. If you dont have the money, or just want to hold on to any extrinsic value, you can just sell the contracts to someone else. Unless theres relatively little liquidity, making it hard to sell the calls, I'd recommend just selling them rather than exercising, even if you have the money."
2021-06-27 09:17:18,wallstreetbets,TLDR: Buy options when their price is low. Sell them when their price is high. Make lots of üçå
2021-06-27 09:25:00,wallstreetbets,Cleveland Cliffs version.  Buy Jan 2022 calls get rich.
2021-06-27 09:23:55,wallstreetbets,"Cliffs?

All in!"
2021-06-27 10:08:12,wallstreetbets,Lol im gonna wait for the YouTube version
2021-06-27 16:48:29,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR:  If you make the wrong assumption that all price movements in stocks are random and stochastic, you can then use math to characterize those movements in aggregate.  Most people can't understand the math, let alone why the underlying assumptions permitting its use are violated; and people love things they don't understand, like mysteries and horror stories; so there is always someone talking about it."
2021-06-27 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Here's a secret, If you buy the ones way out of the money they're cheaper. Thank me later!"
2021-06-27 10:41:10,wallstreetbets,now thats how to clean out an account.
2021-06-27 19:10:13,wallstreetbets,Samsies
2021-06-27 12:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree with you. I tested also buying option, and the result is losing money. I make money only with selling option"
2021-06-27 14:23:09,wallstreetbets,Dangerous and shitty advice from a literal amateur. This ignores tail risk and doesn‚Äôt profit on a risk-adjusted basis. Selling naked puts is a good way to expose yourself to infinite downside risk with limited upside gain. ‚ÄúPicking up pennies in front of a steamroller.‚Äù
2021-06-27 11:12:18,wallstreetbets,"I agree that the odds are in your favor when selling. If a stock goes sideways or in your direction, you win. It can even go down a bit and you still win. For the other beginners reading this‚Ä¶ Selling, however, has unlimited risk unless you sell spreads. Sell a bull put spread and your risk is defined.

Buys singles. Sell spreads."
2021-06-27 12:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Lol and you do all that just to get beaten by buy and hold because you got exercised at bad times. It works until it doesn't work.

That's not to say that selling options isn't a good strategy if you know what you're doing, which few people do (I don't). r/thetagang is full of people gambling on meme stocks instead of actually maximizing their return selling theta."
2021-06-27 12:56:46,wallstreetbets,r/thetagang is for you
2021-06-27 12:47:44,wallstreetbets,Theta Gang approved strategy.
2021-06-27 13:12:39,wallstreetbets,So both buy and sell options to lose 170% money. Got it.
2021-06-27 16:36:19,wallstreetbets,"Selling naked anything is fucking retarded.  Emphasis on NAKED.  There's a reason they call it naked.  It means you have no protection from the elements (i.e. market movement).  If you expose yourself to INFINITE LOSSES in either direction, you WILL get fucked.  Buying, on the other hand, you can only lose the money you spent on the option premium.  The fact that this absolute dogshit advice has over 100 upvotes should be enough for smart people to realize that most WSBers have no idea what the fuck they're doing."

2021-06-27 12:49:50,wallstreetbets,cfa is only salary if you are a general manager. usually hourly and you have to be outside if working drive thru.
2021-06-27 10:16:55,wallstreetbets,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ironcondor.asp

Its essentially buying a call, selling a call, buying a put, and selling a put. All of these must have same expiration price. The idea here is that you are betting the stock remains within the range specified by your strike prices. You are betting against volatility. 

I do not use iron condors. If I want to bet on a stagnant stock price, I just do a collar."
2021-06-27 11:36:15,wallstreetbets,"It's like a regular condor, but tougher."
2021-06-27 12:44:54,wallstreetbets,"It's similar to a wooden condor but with more iron. Also, it's a strategy of using two option spreads to profit off the underlying stock price moving sideways instead of increasing or decreasing. Its made up of 2 calls and 2 puts. A good brokerage will let you set it up as a single trade though to reduce commission cost."
2021-06-27 10:12:51,wallstreetbets,Im saying buy american or GTFO commie
2021-06-27 11:04:05,wallstreetbets,"A strike is the price on the contract. If you buy an $AAPL call with a $100 strike and it expires in the money, you gain 100 shares of Apple for a deal. Everyone else needs to pay $133 for the stock currently.  But most options traders don‚Äôt make money this way. We buy and sell these contracts before they expire, making money (or losing) from the price changes in the contract itself."
2021-06-27 11:05:22,wallstreetbets,The strike price is the target price.  It is the price at which the option is considered ITM (in the money.)
2021-06-27 11:20:49,wallstreetbets,And how do you create a call? Can you not do it on all brokerages?
2021-06-27 11:29:45,wallstreetbets,"When you buy and sell a call, that‚Äôs it. Nothing happens besides you make or lose money. When you sell it to someone else, that other person is now on the contract."
2021-06-27 11:42:53,wallstreetbets,"When you‚Äôre buying options you don‚Äôt need anything but the buying power to purchase it in the first place. When buy an option contract and then sell that same option contract, you are done. You have exited the position and locked in your profit or loss."
2021-06-27 19:20:47,wallstreetbets,Get your money back and donate it to my OnlyFans pls
2021-06-27 13:42:35,wallstreetbets,Oh god give it to me
2021-06-27 18:54:13,wallstreetbets,thats the optimal outcome. do not exercise.
2021-06-27 10:08:30,wallstreetbets,"When you sell to close an option, if the buyer was not short that option they are now long the option. If the buyer was short that option (had written at that strike and expiration) then they close their position by buying the long side. This matters very little to you if you were selling to close; you lock in your profit or loss regardless."
2021-06-27 13:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thanks. I put down the important parts in this post. There's also other stuff I wan to add to it as well such as Black and Scholes, the math behind a gamma squeeze, answering certain questions such as buying OTM or ITM calls, volatility curves, etc but for the interest of time I decided to leave those out."
2021-06-27 10:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean to type theta decay? Theta will disappear over time and exponentially faster as the contract approaches expiration. Delta doesn‚Äôt decay, but it can get smaller as the contract goes further out of the money. This is actually a good thing when the option is going the wrong direction."
2021-06-27 11:45:25,wallstreetbets,"This is an advanced technique that requires specialized hardware, like a short ladder."
2021-06-27 11:13:21,wallstreetbets,"I think its because option value is still being effected by weekends even if the stocks aren't traded. Remember, with options you are betting that a stock is going to move a certain way within a timeframe and that timeframe is still being effected by weekend days."
2021-06-27 11:52:07,wallstreetbets,"You can buy a call at any strike price they‚Äôre being sold at. Someone smarter than me would have to explain how an ITM call would behave, but my understanding is it would generally go up & down in value with the stock price but have less volatility."
2021-06-27 11:29:48,wallstreetbets,Im doing level 3 but you learn the majority by level 2

2021-06-27 16:35:20,wallstreetbets,Not all puts are gay. Puts on Facebook and other stocks that people actually want to see fall are quite hetero.
2021-06-27 14:02:06,wallstreetbets,"People sell the price goes down. People holding short term OTM options (all they can likely afford) promptly get fucked, and not in a good way. Aka the people that bought my BB $30 weekly covered calls last month for 2.5 in premium. Price had shot up to $20 all of a sudden so people were going batshit. Closed those positions back out for effectively free the next day."
2021-06-27 13:21:40,wallstreetbets,So this is where you use sell to close after the stock has exceeded strike?
2021-06-27 17:15:06,wallstreetbets,so is this why I made profit from a call option even though the share price was no where near the strike price I bought it at (because the contract price went up)? I bought AMC a couple of weeks ago a day before expire. paid 38 at 9am and sold it at 11am for 273. I'm still perplexed as to why I made a profit.  I'm certainly trying my best to understand options..but it's still all greek to me. I'll get there eventually though.
2021-06-27 13:14:49,wallstreetbets,"You really have to be careful with this. It depends on who your brokerage firm is. My friend was using Merrill Edge and his AMZN calls expired ITM, but this was his personal account and he didn‚Äôt have the cash to cover the stock, so he got fucked"
2021-06-27 12:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I have never exercised my calls. I've made a bit on calls, and lost a bit but certainly up overall. I have an oil play I may exercise my calls in for the cash distribution when the time comes but otherwise I virtually would never exercise."
2021-06-27 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,"Ive exercised 10 options total, but they were deep itm on stocks I wanted, and low IV, making them not as profitable as holding the stock.  I now horde that stock until the IV goes up again and then will sell covered calls for maximum profit.  There are other reasons to exercise too, like to cover an assigned put, or if the option is at the money and you are able to minimize loss."
2021-06-27 13:23:12,wallstreetbets,"So as above, this is where you use the Sell to Close on the option?

You buy to open at whatever premium/strike price, once it's popped (hopefully) you sell to close to pocket the profits?  


thank you"
2021-06-27 16:49:43,wallstreetbets,"Most brokers will sell itm options for you if you don't exercise by 1 hour before close.  Robinhood, webull, etrade, public, etc etc etc all do this by default, but it's a setting you can turn off if you like being risky."
2021-06-27 19:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I finally understand where I was confused conceptually about this.  Basically the idea is to buy the call, hope it moves in the direction you want it to and sell to close before expiration.  At least unless your goal is assignment to pick up the stock.

Thanks everyone for the clear explanations.  For a bunch of crayon eaters, there's a lot of smart folks here."
2021-06-27 14:33:08,wallstreetbets,"Got it.   I am thinking (like all greedy apes) about using it to simply get short-term profits rather than increase a portfolio.

I mean logically, if the stocks are at 100, I have the cash already, it makes more sense to just buy at 100 rather than take options at 105.  I think."

2021-06-27 18:17:17,wallstreetbets,"First I‚Äôve done this since I was as ~15, I‚Äôm 60, I did it as a profession for ~20 years.  There is not unlimited risk, period.

BTW I retired at 42 with all the change I collected, have fun at work tomorrow wiping tables and refilling the napkin holders"
2021-06-27 11:33:00,wallstreetbets,"No sir, a naked PUT has limited risk, selling a COVERED call has limited risk, selling a naked CALL has unlimited risk"
2021-06-27 13:51:27,wallstreetbets,When the stock gets exercised I put in a buy order for the strike price and wait for it to tumble. I sell options at 7-10% above current with a ~6 week exercise date and get ~2.5-3.5% return with just the option value. If the stock gets exercised that means I made 10+% in 6 weeks. And we know how these volatile stocks are‚Ä¶volatile. So they just come tumbling back down for me to gobble them up again. Yummy
2021-06-27 18:17:42,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-06-27 16:54:52,wallstreetbets,"Idk what you're on about. Naked puts is uncapped downside, but stocks can't go negative lol.

2021-06-27 14:18:17,wallstreetbets,"Yup that‚Äôs exactly it, you sell the contract after exceeding the strike price and before the expiration date if you don‚Äôt have the cash/don‚Äôt want the assigned shares"
2021-06-27 14:58:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes; you can also sell to close even if the stock has NOT exceeded the strike price, because even as the stock approaches the strike your options will increase in extrinsic value."
2021-06-27 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,Quick sidenote - you can sell to close anytime. Option doesn‚Äôt have to be ITM to close it out if for some reason you were happy with gains to that point or wanted to mitigate losses etc
2021-06-27 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,Yes. As the stock price approaches the strike price the value of your option will increase and you can sell for a profit even though it is not ‚Äòin the money‚Äô.  It‚Äôs kind of the point of scalping options.
2021-06-27 15:02:16,wallstreetbets,Never heard of that happening and have been trading for quite some time.  It‚Äôs possible he inadvertently told Merrill he intended to exercise therefore they did not do so on his behalf.  Such an issue should be easily avoidable.

2021-06-27 14:37:55,wallstreetbets,"With regards to your second example, yes. The way people use options to take possession of stock is to, for example, buy a 95 call when the stock is trading at 100. In this way, you gain the exposure of 100 shares without spending the full amount. If the stock drops below 95, you lose pretty much everything you spent on the option, but cant lose more, and if the stock goes up you can always exercise and buy the shares later at the price of 95. You can do this same thing with OTM options, but if you actually want to own the shares down the line that's not as effective of a way to do it."
2021-06-27 18:38:05,wallstreetbets,"All the worst advice I've gotten in the markets have been from old, retail traders that were incredibly sure of themselves."
2021-06-27 18:51:06,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations.  You made $1mm selling Puts. They must've been the most expensive and riskiest Puts in the world.

You're full of shit buddy; If a Put pays a lot of money, then it is because the seller is being accomodated for their risk (it's very likely to pay out). If it pays very little it's because it's not likely to pay out.

Your ""strategy"" empirically falls apart if you were to keep doing it over 20 years, especially if you aren't scaling it with tons of collateral.

&#x200B;

EDIT: No unlimited risk? You literally collect a premium and your risk is to have to pay out the difference when the Put is ITM - e.g. when the market shits itself, the Put will become very valuable and you can be on the hook for the differential + continuation value, which at most can be the entire Strike per share that the contract underlies if the stock went to zero (which is probably won't, but that's technically the maximum it can go down to). That's the ""risk"" you claim doesn't exist."
2021-06-27 11:37:00,wallstreetbets,Yep. Naked exactly. Thanks for adding that.  It‚Äôs good for the new kids to read this.
2021-06-27 14:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Yea it is limited risk to sell puts or CCs, but still far far higher possible loss than buying them. I imagine that is what they meant although they didn‚Äôt use the right words but who knows. 

Just as an illustration for whoever may need it:

If you sell a weekly put at a 10$ strike for .1, you still have a possible loss of $990 theoretically while the buyer has a possible loss of 10$. 99 times the risk kind of feels unlimited in comparison though it is certainly defined. Again it is only theoretical generally unlikely that you lose your entire collateral on a weekly.

The selling and buying of CCs has a similar risk comparison."
2021-06-27 16:34:26,wallstreetbets,">I put in a buy order for the strike price and wait for it to tumble.

Lol yup, then it rockets and you're left with nothing but cash and your dick in hand. Then a week later you forgot to turn off your limit order and you catch a sharp as fuck knife and spend the rest of your days selling increasingly less otm trying to futilely to get your ""adjusted cost basis"" down...and then suddenly it moons and you're exercised for a loss, or you roll and do it all over worse.

Again, selling options on meme stocks works until it doesn't. It can be fun seeing such fat premiums and ""either I sell for a profit, or keep the premium for free"" seems to be mostly easy money, but you eventually get fucked.

(This totally didn't happen to me)"
2021-06-27 11:37:33,wallstreetbets,You basically decide the range you think the price will stay within. Then you sell a call around the top of the range and buy a call at a higher strike to cap your losses if the price üöÄ & blows through. You also sell a put around the bottom of the range and buy a put at a lower strike to cap your losses if the price plummets & blows through your short strike. All these options have the same expiration date.
2021-06-27 12:31:26,wallstreetbets,"It would be hard to make money only holding for a day or two unless you‚Äôre very close to expiration, and that makes it much more risky. Normally you‚Äôd sell a fairly wide iron condor and hold it for a couple weeks while the extrinsic value decays.

If you want to make neutral trades on a shorter timeframe, strangles are the same as iron condors but without protection (i.e. buying the further OTM options). With an iron condor, you have a maximum possible loss. With strangles you have unlimited potential loss but you make more money and you make it faster. They‚Äôre a great way to make a bunch of money a bunch of times and then lose all of that money at once."

2021-06-27 14:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Upvote for accuracy. But teaching 2nd order derivatives to WSB is like introducing physics to a kindergarten class.

I'd bet a majority here don't understand how puts and calls work on both sides of the transaction. Very basic stuff isn't widely understood. Plus charm doesn't really matter unless you're a dealer delta hedging, something else 95% of retail has never heard of. You'll know because they'll claim ITM call options are going to force dealers to panic and buy loads of shares at expiration when in reality they're constantly balancing their deltas.

Anyway good info nonetheless. Probably more appropriate for the r/options sub. I've seen a couple market makers post there in the past."

Unlimited risk is selling a naked call and having to buy the share at market value. A stock can have unlimited upside so your risk is unlimited on selling a naked call, but limited on selling a naked put."

Feeling like unlimited and being unlimited are far from the same thing.  If I sell a naked put snd the co declares BK prior to expiration I lose what I must pay for the shares or the exercise price, period.  That‚Äôs not even close to unlimited"
2021-06-27 18:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Your math makes no sense, who takes in $10 to risk $990??  Anyone willing to sell an option with a bid of a dime is an idiot, and there is nowhere in my post suggesting that. If you sell a put on a $10 stock with 45-60 days to expiration you‚Äôd be foolish to take less than .80-$1 but that‚Äôll depend on the share price vs the exercise price.  If the shares are near $18 and it‚Äôs a $10 strike price the premium will be near a dime but that would not be a trade worth doing"
2021-06-27 16:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol I don‚Äôt do it on meme stocks really. I do it on stocks I‚Äôm planning on holding that have volatility above average. It‚Äôs gotten me consistent returns. And I‚Äôm fine with it dipping below the buy order after I buy because, well, I was planning on the stock being a buy and hold anyway. I just let other people pay me a premium for my stock that I‚Äôm planning on buying and holding regardless. Then I put the premiums into index funds and let that build until I either double up on current stocks or find a new one I like and do the same thing. You have to be pretty active when your calls are expiring (or if the call loses all value quickly I buy it back for pennies and sell another) but other than that it‚Äôs just me collecting premiums on stock I‚Äôm planning on owning long term anyway. It‚Äôs hard to pass up immediate 3% returns every 6 weeks."

2021-06-27 17:10:04,wallstreetbets,"You are not on the hook, you bought the contract to open a position then sold to close. The original option writer would have sold to open a position, they can buy to close at anytime, then the liability would shift to whoever sold them the contract back.

Key things to understand are you can 'sell to open', 'buy to close', 'buy to open' and 'sell to close'.

If you write an option you are selling to open

If you wrote an option and you want to get out of the position you will buy to close

If you buy an option you are buying to open

If you want to sell an option that you bought you will be selling to close.

You have no liability on a closed position"
2021-06-27 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,"No. Not exactly. 

The breakeven price is what the underlying stock would need to be priced at *at expiration* for someone exercising/assigning  the contract to make a profit on those actual shares (x100). 

The amount you can sell the options contract itself for can be profitable at any time if the sales price of the contract > purchase price of the contract. 

The two are related (obviously) but not dependent upon one another. Two different supply/demand bid/ask markets (one for the shares and one for the options)."

2021-06-27 10:37:03,wallstreetbets,"Dont take my word for it but if I remember correctly, European options still adhere to the same information I have stated in my post. I think the main difference is the pricing models used to value the fundamental values for European and American options. 

European options are valued based on present value  of positive cash outflow( for calls ) and present value of cash inflow ( for puts ). 

American options are priced by the market makers using the Black and Scholes model. It is a statistical pricing model that covers a broad range of assumptions you can look up on your own free time."

2021-06-27 14:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Well maybe I'm a worse trader for overlooking it, but I've never used 2nd order derivatives to trade and done ok.

One thing I'm studying now is how dealer gamma can pin spy or indicate where the price will land, when it's overbought and sold, etc. I've seen some traders who use this to trade spy and when to short volatility. They use it to predict those intraday V shaped rallies we've had.

Spotgamma.com I think focuses on this. But I have a lot more learn before I start trading it. It is interesting to look at the put walls in SPY and SPX every week, which are largely just massive hedges dealers sell. Theory is their delta hedging of these walls is what sets a floor in the market and moves the index."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly DD - WISH: The shopping mall in your pocket (Full DD because nobody asked) **Overview**

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let‚Äôs go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation.¬†

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH‚Äôs focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates.¬†
* WISH‚Äôs decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

https://preview.redd.it/lazx0wzots771.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9d9b596338c225c0fb8d9dbae4579b9f84faf2e

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.

https://preview.redd.it/lv5jnzupts771.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=5489e4e7f314565eb6cd89fc599c7c50deff7bab

&#x200B;

* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%**¬†of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables‚Ä¶

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019.¬†

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

https://preview.redd.it/erjzrtqqts771.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c34dd891a3104e2fc3228d1ea78efcbb142e1f5

&#x200B;

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it‚Äôs a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash.¬†

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What‚Äôs concerning is that it‚Äôs only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

Positions: Long shares of stock."

2021-06-27 10:39:28,wallstreetbets,Best write up of WISH I've seen in a long time. Just as solid as any Seeking Alpha article. Nice to know we have smart apes on this one. Not just a meme stock. Solid fundamentals and deserves to go up on its own merit
2021-06-27 12:03:21,wallstreetbets,No one should be able to buy 10 laptops for $100.  This company is trash.  You know the saying; If it‚Äôs too good to be true‚Ä¶go ballz-deep calls.
2021-06-27 08:42:20,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúAn early amazon‚Äù. ü§£
2021-06-27 09:29:32,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt WISH just a re skinned Ali express.  I don‚Äôt see what makes them any more unique than them.
2021-06-27 16:09:41,wallstreetbets,Wish is good for Chinese knockoffs and scams. Not much more.
2021-06-27 18:50:13,wallstreetbets,Their products are absolute garbage. Don't try and play off their unbranded products as a good thing. It just means they are willing to hose their customer's with inferior products at inflated prices.
2021-06-27 10:16:13,wallstreetbets,I think it's crazy people do these mental gymnastics to find value in a company like WISH when if you ever used it you know its an awful company. Their business model is based entirely on the occasional person's occasional curiosity that I guarantee only about a third of its customers feel satisfied at all with the transaction. Analytics don't change that. Find a company thats over shorted that sells more than a disappointing gimmick. I would not want to be left holding the bag for a company like wish but I promise there are good companies unfairly manipulated by shorts out there available to help squeeze. I'm not going to list any here because it would seem like I was just trying to pump them up but I assure you WISH isn't one. The hedges want you to make WISH and GME the battleground.
2021-06-27 12:04:26,wallstreetbets,wish is garbage citadel has a big bag in the 20's they wanna dump on us
2021-06-27 10:59:13,wallstreetbets,Fuck wish u shill
2021-06-27 11:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Wish is a garbage company with garbage products. Everything on the website is super low quality, if you receive anything at all. A lot of people who are wishful thinkers (no pun intended) will downvote this comment because its negative. If yall knew anything about wish yall would stay far away!"
2021-06-27 11:37:53,wallstreetbets,WISH is the all in one scam package in your pocket. It doesn't create any value other than to ship shit from china to the rest of the world. Stuff is cheaply and badly manufactured just to get quick bucks. As long as any scammer on this planet can sell it's trash without real consequences through this casino like app I will stay miles away from this company. I just see no long term value in scamming the shit out of people. /rageOff
2021-06-27 12:00:07,wallstreetbets,This post was the motivation I needed to delete the wish app from my phone.
2021-06-27 13:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Weekly WISH shill , get the fuck outta here"
2021-06-27 13:43:50,wallstreetbets,We used to call them Chinese knockoffs and get shit on for wearing them to school
2021-06-27 10:35:59,wallstreetbets,"Good bot, get this wish shill tf out of here. Anyone who's bought something from wish knows this ticker is trash"
2021-06-27 12:23:13,wallstreetbets,The way to buy an inferior product you didn‚Äôt order.
2021-06-27 10:36:26,wallstreetbets,Almost like a bag holding hedge fund wrote it. And the million other wish posts
2021-06-27 12:44:56,wallstreetbets,In the end it doesn't really matter. Who's on WSB to support organic growth of a company. Don't care much for the multiple reasons a price moves. It's called bets for a reason.
2021-06-27 10:23:29,wallstreetbets,Because anyone who‚Äôs ordered from Wish.com knows it‚Äôs shit...lmao
2021-06-27 10:55:18,wallstreetbets,"Wish is different because getting a cheap knock off for a gift next week would take Ali Express weeks. With Wish, they can have their Uyghur slaves make it and send it to next month.

I have 0 stock and likely never will."
2021-06-27 13:42:59,wallstreetbets,"Amazingly Amazon wanted it !!!! 
And they valued it at 10 billion .


I'm not saying it's an extremely brilliant company

I'm saying there's a chance of making good gains in a relatively short time ...

Here to make $$$"
2021-06-27 10:38:28,wallstreetbets,A third seems insanely generous lol I'd be surprised if 1% of their customers return

2021-06-27 10:41:14,wallstreetbets,"Due diligence, but from WISH."
2021-06-27 17:03:52,wallstreetbets,"Idk why they are down voting you, tons of scams on WISH. It's just a Chinese scam app."
2021-06-27 10:49:50,wallstreetbets,This ape gets it.
2021-06-27 10:46:01,wallstreetbets,I meant that that a third might try it again because of curiosity. I would be amazed to learn that even 5% is satisfied and uses it regularly. Blockbuster today offers better customer satisfaction to the whole US with there one store left then the entirety of WISH.
2021-06-27 15:06:43,wallstreetbets,"I made the mistake of ordering something from wish once. Its been 16 months, I still haven't received it. Fuk wish with a rotten onion."

2021-06-27 12:01:01,wallstreetbets,Its pretty common to see a big catalyst boost 30-40% then nothing/selling dropping it about 10% till the next catalyst.  Its a pretty consistent trend with spce‚Äôs pumps.

I bought the 65 dollar call 7/16 back in March when the stock price was high,  then the 55 dollar one after it dropped some more, then the 46 dollar after it dropped even more. Different expiration days hedge risk: if the stock price doesn‚Äôt reach a point by one day then at least you‚Äôll have the calls expiring later on. I don‚Äôt buy ITM calls, so as I buy more the price changes so I‚Äôll buy higher strike prices. Don‚Äôt know if there is a known strategy; that‚Äôs just how I did it."

2021-06-27 09:52:21,wallstreetbets,"I kept buying the dip until I had put 2k into it. I was pretty embarrassed because my account was down 90 percent at one point, but I ended up getting calls with strike prices in the 20s that expired at the end of May for very cheap in the middle of May. After the flight, the calls went ITM and I sold those and bought more OTM calls at later dates. I was anticipating an announcement last week so I YOLOed a few thousand dollars for 70 contracts that had strike prices in the mid 40s. My current positions are on the last picture :)"
2021-06-27 16:50:26,wallstreetbets,there was never a gamma squeeze

2021-06-27 14:46:07,wallstreetbets,That happened a lot more than people realize. After the successful test flight a lot of people posted about SPCE but most posts got deleted. I‚Äôm surprised the mods here are letting SPCE posts be now. Very nice!

2021-06-27 14:54:38,wallstreetbets,"A pump and dump is something that rises without a reason: no good news (occasionally fake hype), no catalysts, it just has huge gains temporarily then quickly goes back to the norm. Now while SPCE very well may go back down a bit, it rose due to successful space flight, and now FAA approval. Meaning it is not a pump and dump as there were very logical reasons for its climb."

2021-06-27 10:16:45,wallstreetbets,I have been buying CROX leaps and encouraging others to do so only to be mocked and admonished. Glad to see a fellow CROX boi. If u listen to any of their earnings calls they are constantly talking about breaking into new markets and expanding in others. Pretty low float ticker as well. I have been speculating 130 after this earnings and 150 eoy but I like ur pt‚Äôs better.
2021-06-27 08:45:22,wallstreetbets,I love the play but I just sold my calls after the blowout Nike earnings. It‚Äôs still on my watch list!
2021-06-27 07:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Because you still have to account for external events in your risk-reward analysis and deep ITM calls provide the most value with the least amount of risk in this scenario. If the market took a shit in the next 6 months and the S&P fell 20%. I‚Äôm fairly confident that $CROX wouldn‚Äôt gain 66%. However, if the market is flat or positive their isn‚Äôt a single security that j would rather own. $NKE killed earnings on Friday and was up 15%. $CROX is going to kill it at the end of July and will be above $150 come mid-August. And then it‚Äôll slowly but surely cross $200 and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it reached towards my upper target for this year of $250. 

Look I have greater than $500K in calls. I also have a couple hundred $K in the stock itself in my Roth and other taxable account. You do whatever you want, it‚Äôs just easy money."

# NOKIA once had a market cap greater than Apple's

Probably the most significant acquisition was Bell Labs with Alcatel-Lucent which means NOK's R&D is unparalleled. That acquisition was for around half of the current market cap, just to put it into perspective.

NOK has a similar cash flow and revenue to main 5/6g rival ERIC but a much lower market cap. This would be an initial target.

**Summary of scope of NOK Industry 4.0:**

* **Arguably most valuable 5g patents globally**
* **Has a western duopoly on 5g deployment with ERIC**
* **EU lead for 6g**
* **NOK blockchain data marketplace**
* **NOK M2M IoT Wing**

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How can I make money from the increasing Margin Debt? For quick context, Warren Buffet stated in several interviews and reports suggesting that the near crash is going to be caused by a few factors. The largest main factor in this imminent bubble is due to the debt of Margin Lending mainly due the pandemic causing the debt to increase 49% in the year of 2020. One other sub factor is due to the low interest loans that are being tossed out to every fool who can press a few buttons on a cell phone.

Should this be of concern? If so‚Ä¶

2021-06-27 05:49:40,wallstreetbets,"Margin debt is roughly double the level of the Great Recession and dot com bubble. (850B over 400/450B respectively I believe).

 The stock market size is roughly triple, 50T as opposed to 15/18T (2000/2007)

So while margin debt is high if you look at the dollar amount‚Ä¶, it is much much lower with respect to the market size of both the last ‚Äòbubbles‚Äô. 

There is a book called animals spirits that talks about bubbles in general, but the main reason I bring it up is because it talks about why people make market predictions. Being right once is worth exponentially more than being wrong frequently. So people will always blurt out predictions on the stock market and if they don‚Äôt come through nobody pays any attention, but if you get it right once everybody thinks you‚Äôre a genius. (A great example of this is Dr Burry going way way short bonds during the last fed meeting and getting it completely wrong, did you hear about that? Probably not) So as markets approach the peak of a cycle everybody starts screaming crash and citing all sorts of reasons that are unprecedented. Doesn‚Äôt mean they are wrong, they could be right, but they are definitely not right just because things today are different than they were in the past. Best to keep things into perspective."

2021-06-27 05:17:41,wallstreetbets,I thought debt went down because of all the stimulus and free money and everyone stayed inside so they were paying off their debt and became tighter with money and made better financial choices.

2021-06-27 06:02:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes! False predictions are an entire market in their own but this really does seem like something different patterns really do not lie 

Another thing to keep in mind is that the most correct market predictions are backed by in depth market research which being the extreme minority makes this whole thing seems like a fake out. But‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm thinking we are just a little early and from all the charts I‚Äôve looked at it seems like the pandemic and the money printer saved us some time. Meaning that we were already set a course for another crash due the pattern in high level of margin debt. Although, the dollar amount is lower, the inflation rate has also sky rocketed creating a cycle of inflated debt. Like I said we might just be a little early."

2021-06-27 05:21:11,wallstreetbets,The last time the market was in the the same shape was the dot com bubble of 2000 and then 2008 all signs point to a crash on this steaming pile of debt

2021-06-27 06:22:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes maybe to all those things, but correlation does not infer causation, and while I was with you on inflation problems my opinion has changed to match that of the fed (being it is transitory and the supporting evidence for that is the decrease in commodities across the board).

The theory is that purchasers for companies purchased much more than they need trying to overcome supply chain restrictions and now that everybody is stocked up on durable and non-durable goods from being stuck at home the money will be focused more towards the service sector which makes perfect sense. The decrease in commodity prices seems to support the fact that purchasers are canceling raw material orders which would mean the next few periods of inflation will be much lower and support the transitory theory. Of course time will tell but the commodity prices don‚Äôt lie and they seem to be saying exactly what the Fed has this entire time. I didn‚Äôt formulate these opinions by myself, I obviously watched a bunch of smart people talk about their predictions of the near future and these are the ones that I happen to agree with.

There is no doubt going to be a large shock when the Fed announces it is not buying bonds at its current rate anymore, but the sector rotation last week back into tech shows that most smart money is seeing the same.

In any case, there are a lot of other variables out there that I think are a bigger concern over margin debt. Specifically the amount of bonds being purchased by the Fed every month‚Ä¶ And purchasers and commodities coming to some sort of equilibrium so we can get a true idea of what the actual supply chain restrictions are after a fully opened economy worldwide.

Margin debt being high before a crash and lower afterwards I really do not think is an indicator. I think it is a result."

I think this is mainly because al of the stimulus that happend and the low rates. This made a lot of extra currency flow into the market."
2021-06-27 05:23:04,wallstreetbets,"No, it was not sarcasm. I was speaking on the statement that the op had that the pandemic caused the debt to increase by 49% in 2020.

2021-06-27 12:46:19,wallstreetbets,I wasn't talking about either of those specifically. I was referring to the trend where Americans started paying down credit card debt and increasing savings during the pandemic. That trend has reversed.

2021-06-27 13:36:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes,  the steel hold out could be the infrastructure spending everyone seems to think will pass. If that‚Äôs the case the affect on inflation would not be as big. 

Take stimulus for example, you give $1 in stimulus, The person you give it to saves a portion and spends the rest let‚Äôs say they spend $.80. Whoever they spend that $.80 with saves a portion and spends the rest let‚Äôs say they sped $.60 this repeats down the line until one dollar stimulus has basically a two or three dollar affect on the overall economy. This is the basis for new monetary theory with stimulus.

Now take purchasers for a business. Everyone sold out of inventory they could not get their stock or supply or whatever it was to do business. Demand went through the roof. Purchasers make purchases plus a certain amount in anticipation of meeting future demand extrapolating future demand based on current demand‚Ä¶ Which was unnaturally high. This happens the same way as a stimulus dollar, the store orders more from supplier, the supplier orders more plus future anticipated increase from their supplier, on down the line until the demand is multiplied the same.

So now you have all this demand for raw materials, price goes up, inflation. The feds theory (and also some fund people like Cathy wood) is this demand is not real. Once consumer spending goes back into services/experiences this material demand will fall off and normalize. So will prices. And thus the transitory inflation. It makes sense to me and the commodity prices sort of confirm it."

I‚Äôm obviously aware of the debt and loans and credit cards a ton of people had to take and open and use to survive and had to default on them. And millions of retail investors have or will have to pull out all their money in the stock market. And the stimulus pump is gone so naturally the market should take a hit. But there‚Äôs also a huge influx of money into the economy that I thought would equal everything out or atleast make up for some of it.

Today I mowed the yard finally, and picked a bunch of harlequin beetles, squashbugs and Japanese beetles off of plants in the yard.  I got the squashbug eggs too - ripped them straight out of  the pumpkin leaves.  A couple had hatched already but I think I got them all too.  I had wanted to spray BT on everything and the mosquito/tick repellent all over they yard but I'm too exhausted to even move any more.  Maybe tomorrow.  I got some thicc hypodermic needles last year to inject BT into the squash stems so I think I'll spray and inject for the squash vine borers and all the caterpillars eating my mustard plants.  Full on attack from nature this year.

Also I harvested a ton of Sage because it turned into a huge bush and was shading out the bush beans, asparagus, carrots, eggplants, pole beans and thyme (I've got a couple patches of it planted).  Lawdy... oh and I lost the nut off of one of the bolts holding  the lawnmower handle  together so I've ordered one of those big magnet wand things roofers use to find loose nails to hopefully find it, and it'll help me get the last of the staples and nails the shed roofers left in the yard because they didn't pick that stuff up ugh.  I mowed the front yard with 2 wire ties and a rubberband holding  the handle together lmao.  If I can't find it in the yard, I'll go to the hardware store and buy another one.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TLRY to $22+ next week?  I drew some lines on a few charts and if any of the below outcomes plays out, then TLRY could hit $22 next week, and anywhere from $25+ after.

Upward channel - Target $22.50 by Friday

Note: I drew my handles uptick a bit too sharp I think.

Also an inverse Head & Shoulders forming on the 3month chart, daily candles.

2021-06-27 11:20:43,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs because this a generational opportunity. When SAFE hits soon and institutions pile in this‚Äôll be an easy 50%+ and when uplist follows it‚Äôll be an easy 2x-3x. The path forward for MSOs is coming into focus. 
Tilray right now is a bit of a mess. I made a shitload of dough on APHA and flipped it into MSOs. Tilray may eventually be a powerhouse if they can dominate Europe but it‚Äôs too early to tell how likely that is. Curaleaf, I believe, will offer them some competition."

2021-06-27 11:13:30,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs hilarious and completely ignorant. Tilray burns cash. Green thumb and Trulieve ALREADY have a positive bottom line and are growing rapidly. New York will be huge for Green Thumb. Green thumb will be close to $1B run rate on revenue 2Q

2021-06-27 12:29:44,wallstreetbets,"You're getting too deep into this. TLRY will rise just out of hype alone, I'm also willing to bet that they acquire an MSO in the states.

2021-06-27 12:45:13,wallstreetbets,Of course I do. I‚Äôm not a superficial meme investor. And I make a lot of dough by going deep. Ballz deep.
2021-06-27 11:23:47,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a lot more risky to bank on Tilray dominating Europe. I hold Tilray as well but I‚Äôm much more excited about MSOs in the next few years. Tilray is not going to take over Europe without competition. And if they don‚Äôt become a major player in Europe the company won‚Äôt be worth shit. Canadian market is peanuts.
2021-06-27 09:03:10,wallstreetbets,"Ur smoked lmao. CanLP will be lucky to even be allowed entry into the USA weed market eventually. Hence the huge arbitrage between canopy and acreage right now. That‚Äôs why you also own GTI and Curaleaf. You should sell ur CanLP positions into cresco and Trulieve. There are too many mitigating factors against the CANLPs, the federal government is even considering not letting big business and foreigners in. CBD and anything else related to weed that‚Äôs not really weed isn‚Äôt gonna matter at all soon. Sweet water gives tilray nothing. There are already companies in the states making weed drinks and shit. I also once held the Canadians, but there‚Äôs no point when curaleaf just acquired for the European market, Columbia care has had a an overseas for years‚Ä¶ I could go on and on, but that‚Äôs ok. I digress, good luck. I hope we all make money."
2021-06-27 09:48:41,wallstreetbets,Doesn't take a genius to know how big business is
2021-06-27 11:28:54,wallstreetbets,I agree with a lot of what you're saying. Good luck to all of our positions.
2021-06-27 11:33:29,wallstreetbets,I agree. I hold GTI and TLRY. But TLRY excites me more as a meme stock as opposed to MSOs being solid companies rapidly growing.
2021-06-27 09:49:53,wallstreetbets,"The second I saw Canadian LPS won't be allowed entry into the U.S I stopped reading. This is a bad take. While both will succeed, Tilray is way to big and popular of a brand to not be a clear winner overtime"
2021-06-27 10:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, don't call peope smoked when you have no clue what you're talking about lol.

CGC/TLRY/CRON will all be in the states. I'm sure you've heard of Constellation brands? Or Altria Group? Sweetwater isn't huge but it's part of TLRYs plan. They know what they are doing. 

Also, CL is cresco labs lol I don't hold CURA. Just Green Thumb and Cresco for MSOs. It would be silly to keep all eggs in one basket so ofc I'll play both sides. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the MSOs get acquired or merged eventually.

I do agree with the last part of your post, I hope we all make money. And I think we will."
2021-06-27 10:10:04,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf is a monster, has over twice the THC revenue of TLRY."
2021-06-27 11:37:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah I apologize. You clearly aren‚Äôt ignorant. We probably agree on a lot of this stuff maybe just slightly different outlook on which horse(s) are going to lead the pack. Here‚Äôs to all of us growing our wealth upon this generational opportunity!
2021-06-27 11:40:53,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah honestly seeing TLRY talk on WSB gives me some hope for a near-term meme rally. I hold TLRY too but bulk of my funds are in GTBIF with smaller positions in tier 2/3s.
I recognize you as a solid commenter on Weedstonks sub."
2021-06-27 10:08:16,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt say that they definitely won‚Äôt be allowed‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs on the table though and you have to take that into consideration man there‚Äôs a lot of talk about social equity blah blah blah they‚Äôre even considering not letting big corporations like big tobacco and alcohol get involved. it could get fuckin messy and if it does the Canadian LPs are fucked. Just saying‚Ä¶
Also USA players have first mover HUGE advantage. If tilray does not do something similar to what canopy and cron have done they will be in a very bad spot shortly‚Ä¶ maybe too late"
2021-06-27 10:17:38,wallstreetbets,"You cannot guarantee Canadian companies will be permitted to sell weed in the USA. I know everything about what you‚Äôre talking about just because constellation Brands has a 40% stake in canopy, they kicked out Bruce Linton and installed their CFO as the new CEO doesn‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll be allowed in. Bruce Linton paid a $300 million option to Kevin Murphy @ acreage (also no longer w their company) for potentially nothing‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the problem type of stuff. I could seriously go on and on‚Ä¶ I took my $15k dividend I received from acreage for that, sold my shares and bought the other companies that didn‚Äôt tie themselves up and become stagnant like curaleaf and Trulieve. 
Clearly wasting my time here üëã"

Why such slow growth and stagnation when they keep releasing new products and seem so pervasive in the market? Undervalued with the potential to go big? Or just not much there? It always seems like something that could and should take off, but never does."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lets talk about BABA. Again. Reposting this cause my last one got deleted for some reason:

Alright listen up you retarded apes. After this weeks move its time we revisit BABA.

First my personal thoughts on why the move: everybody and their mother knows BABA is fundamentally undervalued but have been staying on the sidelines like scared little bitches because of some vague China fears. Same thoughts are running on the institutional side and majority of hedge funds being the sheep they are, they‚Äôre all afraid to act first and pull the trigger. With the public news of ARKK and a couple other funds buying up BABA and other Chinese stocks this has finally signaled to the other hedgies that its okay to invest in China and now theyre all trying to pile back in at the same time. Institutional FOMOs gonna drives this beast back up.

So imo the recent moves been sentiment driven but we havent even triggered any of the fundamental catalysts yet thatll further pump this bitch to the moon. Heres some to name a few, all likely due later this year or early next:

1. ANT IPO. Lot of ancillary news coming out around this such as Ant being approved to operate a consumer finance company by regulators, working together with state owned companies to create a credit scoring company. This shows Ant and the regulators are willing and able to work together. And making headwinds fast.
2. Listing of 9988 on the HKSE Stock Connect Southbound program. This means Chinese investors would finally be allowed to trade the stock and you bet these rich fuckers wont have the same hesitations American apes will about YOLO‚Äôing into their home grown crown jewel company. This gets revisited if HKSE gets 55% share of outstanding shares traded vs the ADR. MSCI the giant index fund has already migrated their shares over from BABA to 9988 and other funds might follow suit to protect their shares in light of fears over US delisting Chinese stocks.
3. Earnings release - important number to look out for imo is BABA‚Äôs operating profits on their cloud computing arm Alicloud. They‚Äôve invested a ton of money into cloud computing and gotten huge market share. So far they‚Äôve always reported an operating loss on this but the numbers are improving every quarter and theyre on the cusp of finally being in the green now. This year might be when they finally turn a profit. For those who know, this was when AMZN skyrocketed and the same will happen to BABA when they finally get there. Cloud computing is a huge cash cow with big profits low costs that‚Äôll be a huge boon on their operating margins which has been one of the only fundamental weak points of the company so far.
4. 13F filings for Q2. We all know the stock popped when Charlie Munger disclosed a position. We may see another if we see him adding to the position or if any of his other retard boomer investing buddies like Buffett getting in on it too.

For those who are worried they missed the move its not too late. My guess is there‚Äôll probably be a pullback next week so you apes will still have a window to get in cheap. Plus this is not the type of typical retard wsb stonk that pumps one week and craters the next. This is THE stock with solid fundamentals that sets you up for early retirement. Together with the bonus of a short/mid term upward correction back to fair value. This is the next AMZN, the next AAPL staring at you right in the face. I know I‚Äôll be adding to my position and my tits are already thoroughly jacked on this one to begin with.

Lastly, just look at BABAs net profit last year: $21bn. What was AMZNs net profit that year? $21bn. Except AMZNs market cap is $1.7 trillion and BABAs is $620bn. In other words AMZN is valued 2.8x higher than BABA for generating the exact same profits. Plenty of money to still be made here.

Tl;dr buy some BABA if you want to make money you fking retards."

> 1.) The dip in Alibaba‚Äôs share price does not present a buying opportunity yet and investors should Hold on Alibaba.   

> 2.) Alibaba‚Äôs latest earnings report lowered profit guidance for next year due to reinvestment of a substantial amount of profits back into the core business as a result of heightened competition  

> 3.) Alibaba is required to adjust Ant Financial's business model, curb its monopolistic practices, and invest in technological advancements as a result of regulatory pressure.  

> 4.) Alibaba Cloud has grown slower this quarter due to fallout of a top-class customer, loss of government contracts, and a strong rival, Huawei Cloud.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PRM - residential construction due diligence 

PHM is poised for success with the current housing shortage.  They have the reserve capital and access to cheap capital from their LOC that will allow them to accommodate the inevitable demand for more housing units.  

What differentiates residential construction from riets is that Riets seek to capitalized rising housing prices and charge higher rents to maximize profits.  Residential construction is creating value and in PHMs case, doing it in an affordable way while using durable materials and strategic locations.  

The housing shortage is a part of a bigger problem - too much demand.  A shortage leads to rising prices, and in the current economy, this will work both ways for PHM.  

They will sell homes for higher, their assets will appreciate, and they will benefit from building more homes for at least 3 years (inflation and interest rates will start getting sweaty in 2024).  For a short period of time, debt and capital obligations will rise but then revenue, net income, and balance sheet size will all increase.  This probably won‚Äôt increase margins because they already have competitive margins and CAPEX will be higher anyways.  

There are a number of alternatives to PHM, notably MDC which is extremely similar but about 1/4 the size of PHM.  Both will do before inflation becomes visible with rising rates, and there will be significant growth, probably 25% YOY.  

I have about 5k cash in my investments account and $500 in PHM.  I have 3600 in a margin account.  If you guys convince me, I‚Äôll move my cash into my margin account and buy some long term calls."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"You've heard of $GSAT, meet $IRDM **tl;dr:** I was preparing a DD for Globalstar when I came across one of their competitors, Iridium. I will be opening a position with Iridium this upcoming week.

Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM)

Sector: Communication Services

Industry: Telecom Services

Market cap: [5.5B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IRDM?p=IRDM)

Iridium provides mobile voice and data communications services to businesses, the United States and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations, and consumers globally via satellite. They also provide prepaid mobile voice satellite communications, push-to-talk, broadband data, and Internet of Things services. The Iridium network operates in the [L-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_band) and has [66 low Earth orbiting satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/iridium-billing-platform/) and provides coverage to the entire globe, including the poles.

*What is low Earth orbit?*

[ Fun fact: Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station use low Earth orbit](https://preview.redd.it/579e1kqrgo771.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f1452ca0139dd7dfdd00197d7c2338a1bd7c40f)

Satellites at an altitude of less than 1000 km, but could be as low as 160 km above Earth. Travel time around the earth is approximately 90 minutes. The close proximity to earth is commonly used for satellite imaging. Although single satellites are less useful for telecommunication in this orbit, Iridium increases coverage by using multiple satellites (constellation) creating a 'net' around Earth. Globalstar is another satellite service provider with a constellation in this orbit.

*What is Internet of Things (IoT)?*

According to Wikipedia, Internet of Things is a network of physical objects (things) that connect and transmit data to other physical objects via the internet. Sensors, software, and other technologies are embedded within said physical objects to achieve this connection. For example, a lightbulb that can be switched on using a smartphone as the IoT device.

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Iridium has the largest constellation and orbits closer to Earth than any other networks. This allows for shorter network registration times and low communications latency. Globalstar only has [48 satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/globalstar-billing-platform/) and *does not* cover the poles. Iridium just secured a [$30M R&D contract](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iridium-awarded-30-million-research--development-contract-by-the-united-states-army-301318757.html) with the United States Army to develop a payload to provide more effective sensor-to-soldier data transmission when in the field.

[Rendering of the Iridium payload \(light blue\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfw5vg2s3q771.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=106ebf731779c02302041064dea70760c21ac87c)

Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium, commented on the contract, ""This is one of the largest engineering contracts in Iridium's history... It also represents another phase in the evolution of our growing relationship with the Department of Defense."" U.S. Department of Defense has partnered with Iridium for more than 20 years and is the largest customer. In September 2019, Iridium secured a [7-year, $738.5M](https://spacenews.com/iridium-lands-seven-year-738-5-million-defense-department-contract/) contract with the Department of Defense for unlimited use of the Iridium satellite constellation.

Iridium completed a [$3B multi-year constellation upgrade](https://investor.iridium.com/2019-02-06-Iridium-Declares-Victory-3-Billion-Satellite-Constellation-Upgrade-Complete) in 2019, replacing all satellites and upgrading the supporting ground infrastructure. To complete the upgrade, eight Falcon 9 rockets were used to launch 75 satellites into low Earth orbit ([66 operational, 9 in-orbit spares](https://www.roadpost.com/iridium-satellite-network)). Final payments to SpaceX for those launches were made during the second quarter of 2019.

**FINANCIALS**

[Total commercial services revenue decreased $0.6M \(1&#37;\) as a result of decreases in hosted payload and voice data revenue](https://preview.redd.it/rm6sdp9jeq771.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcd7fb3e3b2c64186b9a05cbecc14dd4744e58bf)

For the three months ended March 31, 2021:

* Hosted payload and other service revenue decreased $1.5M (9%) due to data billing settlement that results in recognition of $1.3M
* Voice and data revenue decreased $0.8M (2%) due to a decrease in usage and access fees from COVID-19
* Subscriber equipment revenue increased $1.7M (8%) due to an increase in the volume of Internet of Things

[ Total commercial revenue increased 3&#37; due to increased hosted payload and other data services revenue and increased commercial broadband revenue. ](https://preview.redd.it/84uqb0t9gq771.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=04e5b0ae51f22923d069b738c55d929749dec6dd)

For the year ended December 31,2020:

* Hosted payload and other data service revenue increased $10.6 (21%), primarily due to increased [Aireon](https://aireon.com/resources/overview-materials/iridium-constellation/) data service fees related to contractural step-up and increased Aireon power fees
* Commercial broadband revenue increased $5.5M (18%) from sales of Iridium Certus broadband services which was commercially introduced January 2019
* Government service revenue increased $3.8M as a result of the higher pricing in the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services Contract
* Engineering and support service revenue increased by $3.8M (12%) as a result of an increase in the volume of contracted work for the U.S. government and volume of work for commercial customers

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/q594apenfq771.png?width=929&format=png&auto=webp&s=924dc28f83b0e70459868e451202f81236967189)

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Iridium relies on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of the subscriber equipment, and purchases parts that are periodically subject to shortages. There is a large reliance on a few significant customers, particularly U.S. government agencies meaning a loss of that business will significantly impact revenue. Moreover, Iridium relies on a single primary commercial gateway and primary satellite network operations center.

Last, but not least, Iridium is in debt. Specifically, $1.39B as of March 2021. Iridium also has liabilities of $88.3M falling due within a year and liabilities of $1.81B due beyond that which outweigh the cash and short-term receivables by $1.62B.

[Debt in March 2021 is about the same as it was in March 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ydpi2b0j1q771.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=3eadbeb02390e2f73675bd5b946b15b37c7f8668)

**CONCLUSION**

I'm bullish on Iridium and I only see good things coming from them in the future (short, medium, *and* long term). Although in debt, I think Iridium can handle the current debt levels. They continue to be the front runner for government contracts and are the only provider that covers the entire globe. From December 2019 to December 2020, Iridium saw an increase of 176K subscribers (14%) and I believe this will continue to grow. Voice and data, and Internet of Things revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue, and this trend will likely continue. The diverse customer base including end-users in land-mobile, Internet of Things, maritime, aviation, and government will continue to grow overtime.

*I am not a financial advisor. Current positions: none, yet*

&#x200B;

edit1:

*Why Iridium over Globalstar?*

To summarize the couple points made above:

* Iridium has 66 operational satellites to Golbalstar's 48
* Iridium has full coverage of the Earth, while Globalstar only has coverage [between the latitudes 70 north and -70 south](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1023/A:1019164909332)

[70 and -70 covers most, but not the poles](https://preview.redd.it/qy88nocvps771.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=07dbff1d86f846e7f8cd268ce85cc16e8575d2cc)

[Iridium covers 100&#37; of the Earth](https://preview.redd.it/yl8w3lr8qs771.png?width=457&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afc1834f0e8bda5397169d3f2e969283fcc0b62)

In addition to having more satellites and more coverage of the Earth, [Iridium was certified](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-truly-global-real-time-maritime-emergency-service-launched-by-iridium-301193130.html) to use in the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System in December 2020. This ended a monopoly that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system started in 1999.

Iridium is already a top key-player for global maritime satellite communications. The respective market was valued at $2.39B in 2021 and is [expected to reach $3.96B in the next 5 years](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-maritime-satellite-communication-market-2021-is-expected-to-register-a-cagr-of-69-with-top-countries-data-industry-size-share-business-growth-revenue-trends-market-demand-penetration-and-forecast-2021-06-15). That is a CAGR of 6.9%. If you'll notice in the Marketwatch link, Globalstar was not listed as a key-player.

I'm not the only one who likes Iridium - Cathie does too. As of June 25, 2021, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has [8,491,509 shares at a value of $350M](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKK_HOLDINGS.pdf). **But wait, there's more.** ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ) has [3,125,565 shares at a value of $129M](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_AUTONOMOUS_TECHNOLOGY_&_ROBOTICS_ETF_ARKQ_HOLDINGS.pdf). Moreover, Cathie's last purchase was [1,478 shares](https://blog.mywallst.com/what-did-ark-invest-buy-this-week-06-18/) as of June 18, 2021. If Cathie is in, I'm in.

2021-06-27 02:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Used them all the time in the military. When people talk about having a ""sat phone"", they are talking about Iridium."
2021-06-27 05:26:59,wallstreetbets,"GSAT volume: 132 million
IRDM volume: 2 million

I think Im gonna keep playing GSAT for the time being but good luck to ya"
2021-06-27 10:14:41,wallstreetbets,I like seeing their flares.
2021-06-27 09:52:42,wallstreetbets,"Typical pump post. GSAT is a much better play, and the investors know it. Look at the open call interest and also the volume. It‚Äôs really not even close. If you‚Äôre going to make a post about a particular stock, don‚Äôt degrade another one in an attempt to make others buy the one you like. Clearly GSAT is the 3rd best 5G company behind QUALCOMM and NOKIA, which they are both partnered with by the way. Have a good day."
2021-06-27 02:04:08,wallstreetbets,I like this for a long position
2021-06-27 09:54:40,wallstreetbets,"Agreed that would be great üëç 

Gsat has been overall solid IMO"
2021-06-27 08:06:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the suggestion. I have added the section as an edit
2021-06-27 10:21:30,wallstreetbets,We literally use Iridium like the word Kleenex...as the default term for a sat phone.
2021-06-27 12:03:06,wallstreetbets,But ive got an inmarsat.... did i buy the wrong one? :(

2021-06-27 06:27:51,wallstreetbets,Same here. GSAT all the way.
2021-06-27 12:00:21,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to pump anything. There is no *we* here. 

I'm personally looking at this as a long-term play. Mainly due to the government contracts and the long standing relationship with the government."
2021-06-27 12:14:12,wallstreetbets,Seems like you know a lot about 5G. How do you feel about Ericsson? I got a couple of leaps that I‚Äôm up on. Wonder if I should reallocate? Thanks.
2021-06-27 15:04:10,wallstreetbets,I sold 12 call spreads last week. But once this thing gets over $2 and stays there Im out lol
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is TD broken or do I actually owe $1,000,000? So I got an email that said something something something all the $75P $AMC contact's you sold have been assigned. And my day trade buying power is suddenly showing up as -$1,000,000 with a cash balance of $0. Also I can't view any of my positions/balances BUT the TD website is currently ""under maintenance"" at the moment. My question is, are the rest of you retards unable to see your account balance and positions or do I need to go grab some rope?

https://imgur.com/gallery/wlVPcyH

(Insight: it was a $75/$80 put debtit spread... I think. So the $80 should have been exercised as well.. probably)

EDIT & CONCLUSION: Okay so after watching Mia Khalifa for 2 hours, I took some of your advice and logged out of the App then logged back in and all the positions/balances were back to normal. So turns out that hack does actually work. 

For those of you who are disappointed, I still have 2 naked short straddles on $AMC so there very well could  be loss porn in the future. (Proof) http://imgur.com/gallery/2PQ2TsL"
2021-06-27 02:12:50,wallstreetbets,dude...you an inverse millionaire..

2021-06-27 03:10:02,wallstreetbets,"If your debit spread was set up right then it looks like TD has exercised the long positions and the short positions aren't being reflected against your balance yet. Pretty sure this is similar to what happened with the kid that did $ROPE. 

TD certainly does auto exercise positions ITM. So call or wait till Monday. Your gain* should be the spread difference minus* the debit paid. The math for your balance doesn't make sense if you had only 100 contacts. 

Don't do anything stupid dude."
2021-06-27 02:08:15,wallstreetbets,"hey, i got a weird margin call message after i had sold positions and never used margin. it vanished. don't freak out, wait to talk to someone, and at the end of the day your life is valuable. we care about you, you dumb fuck. stay alive."
2021-06-27 01:52:39,wallstreetbets,Wait for Monday to roll around. Your long leg should be have been exercised by your broker. Might take until Monday for the balance to change to respect that. Shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
2021-06-27 01:41:54,wallstreetbets,"First calm down, you‚Äôre fine. Don‚Äôt do anything crazy like hurt yourself like that one kid. An actual broker will review the trade and exercise for your or it will do it automatically. 

Word of advice, just buy to close the position and pay the small little amount to prevent this kind of thing in the future.

Edit: if you‚Äôre still a little worried, just go ahead and google ‚Äúdoes Td ameritrade automatically exercise options.‚Äù A lot of results including td‚Äôs own website to confirm they do."
2021-06-27 01:43:05,wallstreetbets,Just wait until they‚Äôre done with the maintenance or check it from your phone. But if you received an email‚Ä¶
2021-06-27 01:48:58,wallstreetbets,Just commenting so I know how this turns out.

P.S I'd recommend against selling naked contracts. Cover it with shares to sleep a lot better at night, or just buy to close instead and pay fee to get out.

Edit: I realized it was a bear put spread 75/80. Op is probably fine."
2021-06-27 05:20:17,wallstreetbets,Just ask for a refund. If that doesn‚Äôt work simply delete the app. Problem solved

2021-06-27 09:05:24,wallstreetbets,Day trading bp is usually how ever much money you traded for that day minus what was cash. If I bought 100 shares of a stock that was one dollar  and sold them the same day then did it again for no gain or loss I would have used $200 since money doesn‚Äôt instantly clear.

2021-06-27 07:08:00,wallstreetbets,"If the contracts are purchased individually, yes.

If the spread is bought as a single unit, and some brokerages allow you to add legs and stock together as a single transaction, then the total debit (pluses and minuses) is the only collateral requirements."

2021-06-27 02:56:48,wallstreetbets,Ok then TD will have it sorted out by Monday sometimes as early as Sunday. Option expiration Friday usually takes the weekend to clear. As long as both the long and short puts expire in the money they will automatically be assigned/exercised. You should actually be profitable in the trade the width of the spread-debit paid.

Also if your lawyers are any good then they can claim entrapment via irresponsible trading ie they should never have allowed you to get into that position in the first place. Works particularly well if you are a student/younger Adult with limited income.lots of people are under the impression that companies have Zero responsibility to the clients but they are wrong, that's why nearly all companies try and settle out of court applying maximum pressure so that you settle on a deal before you ever seek legal help.

And yes, in some places owing money can land you in jail. Ex, if the hospital sues you for unpaid debt and you don't/can't appear /aren't aware of your summons, you go to jail. Being in contempt of court can get a bench warrant out on your ass (because of medical debt).

As for fraud, no your broker doesn‚Äôt have a case of fraud unless you misrepresented something. Since you didn‚Äôt it isn‚Äôt fraud. They also can‚Äôt press charges, they make
A Complaint which then has to be investigated and then someone has to decide to charge you. Otherwise they can only sue you saying you owe the money."

2021-06-27 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,"again youre wrong, sorry. extraditions are always on a type of crime basis not in general. there only a handful countries that would not have for most (but not all)( crimes. 

even russia extradites you for certain crimes, just not as many or on request.  
on the other hand even countries with extradition treatys wont if the expected punishment in requesting country would be seen as to serviere in the extraditing country.

for example, US cannot request an extradition from europe for a crime what has the possibility of a death penalty. no european court would agree to that. thats why those requests usually are for lower charges.

&#x200B;

as for the fraud, nope. in such a case where you make a contract you could never fulfill but is to your advantage couve commited fraud. if you cant fulfill the contract because something unforseeable happend then its not fraud jsut sueable. 

yes, most failed contracts are borderline to fraud, even many people dont realize that.  


however regardless how weak or good the case, if youre gone and cant defend yourself in the investigation phase it almsot certainly comes to further legal proceedings which then justify an extradition for your trial.

2021-06-27 08:07:27,wallstreetbets,"If you hold to expiry the balances don't always reflect correctly over the weekend. 

The real danger in a spread is holding to expiry and then having the price move through your strike in AH. In that case most brokers **don't** automatically exercise the long leg and you can end up fucked. This is why RH will sell your spread if the strike is anywhere near the price about 2 hours before close. It's not foolproof though. A big AH move can still screw you.

You are weighing in on the US legal system and don‚Äôt live here? Come on man, just say ‚ÄúI think but don‚Äôt know‚Äù and you would be fine.

As for fraud: your definition is way off. There has to be intent and there has to be a ( federal US anyway)

a purposeful misrepresentation of an important (""material"") fact;
with knowledge that it is false;
to a victim who justifiably relies on the misrepresentation; and
who suffers actual loss as a result.

So most failed contracts are not fraud. 

As for extradition: in almost all cases there has to be a crime which is covered by the treaty without a treaty there usually has to be a crime in both countries and then that country has to care enough to arrest you and extradite you. Most of the time you would be made to leave the country but for owing money to a brokerage firm I 100% guarantee you wouldn‚Äôt be extradited, and likely wouldn‚Äôt be charged in the US either. If you sued civilly in the US, you have to be served - good luck with that for a million bucks.

if you make a contract that might have to covered with a million but. you never had the assets to cover that you have intent. thats why, most failed contracts are BORDERLINE to fraud
 i never said they are fraud.
but very close and it would higly depends on certain details of they qualify.


if the contract fails because ur not avle to cover ur now obligated to proof that you acted in good faith and thought you would be able too.

now qould they activly search you in most countries for that, like kicking in doors? no. however you gonna be on interpols list and be arrested at any border or even hotels that require registration.

yes this happens, more than you think not only for tax evasion as recent events have shown.

now if  broker company would file a criminal complaibt or stick with a civil sue is a different topic but they could.

and yes its already fraud if you order something you cant pay for and think oh i believe my amc gonna tripple then i can pay for it. thats not good faith. however if you could pay for it with ur portfolio but there is a gigantic sudden unexpected loss then it is.

When you factor in the premium I already collected on the call calendar in combination with the short straddle I have a breakeven of $35 & $83. Whether everyone wants to admit it or not the nature of volatilty is to chill the fuck out which is what $AMC has been doing for the past 2 weeks. The 75/80 put debit spread was actually apart of a weird iron condor that paid off big for me on $AMC because of the less dramatic moves it's been having lately. I'm at my computer 24/7 during trading hours and know how to delta hedge fairly quickly if AMC gets out of control so I'm really not concerned about the naked calls. Even if it went up to $100 (unhedged) that would only be a $4K loss for me the way I when the trades set up.

&#x200B;

Can someone explain what happened in the last 10 minutes before market closed on Friday 25th?

There was no buying the whole day and then suddenly huge buying volume (i Know 90k shares in 5 minutes is not a lot but compared to the average hourly volume it was a huge spike)"
2021-06-27 12:08:51,wallstreetbets,"First, AWESOME! ‚ù§Ô∏è GME.  That being said...I'm not going to scroll through this entire thread to see if anyone else has pointed this out, but are you aware your shares in that screenshot are flagged as margin? This means your broker can loan out your shares to hedge funds (works against a short squeeze)."
2021-06-27 16:04:43,wallstreetbets,"Love to see $GME back on WSB instead of all these clown plays.  $GME is the real deal and WSB needs to get back to the way it was in January, so much positive energy."
2021-06-27 04:37:30,wallstreetbets,So it was you that caused the spike
2021-06-27 09:00:38,wallstreetbets,It does seem like it‚Äôs ready for another pop. Think I might throw a little loot back in tomorrow.
2021-06-27 09:46:50,wallstreetbets,"The consensus seems to be that if they're in a *margin account*, even if bought with cash, they can and likely will be loaned out.

If so inclined, contact your brokerage to see if that's the case.

Because the whole point is that they need them and you don't want them to have them, at least at this price point."

A $62k YOLO? Absolutely going to be let through.

The $1000 share ""YOLOs""? The TA where they just spam a bunch of rocket emojis? The ""DD"" that consists of less than 2 sentences (and in that VM even tells them why it's being autoremoved)?

Yeah those get removed.

If you have any links to posts that you feel were unfairly removed, feel free to post them. I'll take a look and either let you know why they were removed or if it was a mistake, I'll give you the option of approving it or letting you repost it and I'll manually approve it so it stays up.

If there aren't any actual links in response though, that says an *awful lot*."
2021-06-27 09:20:31,wallstreetbets,Oh sure‚Ä¶couldn‚Äôt possibly be that no one posts new YOLOs because everyone just holds. It has to be tHE mOdS fault. Got it. Îàà_Îàà

AMC lol don't ge me even started. Their CEO has become greedy and wants to dilute another 25M shares for 2022 by begging the shareholders to vote yes, after he raised already enough cash from previous ATM offering's.

2021-06-27 17:05:55,wallstreetbets,"so far Amc leadership has sold shares like 3x this year. They did once after promising they wouldnt. They sold directly to a fund (Mudrick) who then sold when it rose a few bucks and then they publically called it overpriced. 

GME did 2 capital raises. One to ensure they had capital and now another that one assumes is tied to an expansion. Cohen has assembled a tier 1 team of executives with amazon type backgrounds.


In addition, you ever see the Msm push you to buy a specific ticker before? they were literally tryna ram AMC down ppls throats for weeks. GME is the way.

edit GME is cash rich, AmC could still go broke. Gme transitioning to tech company and expanding market footprint hugely already. Difference in total outstanding share counts and floats. Gme is a relatively small share count (supposedly, ... its quite possible the total outstanding now represents a signicant number of naked shorts/synthetics/failures to deliver, etc. Still AMC total outstanding is 10x or more officially."

""It may seem counterintuitive, but the Russell 1000 ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù may actually be bad for GameStop‚Äôs stock, as Barron‚Äôs explained earlier this month. Funds that track the small-cap Russell 2000 will have to sell GameStop shares on June 28, and funds that track the Russell 1000 will have to buy them. Three times as much money is invested in funds that track the Russell 1000, but GameStop‚Äôs overall weight in that index will be much lower than it has been in the Russell 2000. In the Russell 2000, GameStop made up about half a percentage point of the index, while it will be less than 0.1% of the Russell 1000. GameStop will look tiny next to behemoths like Apple (AAPL). """

Let me tell you. People aren't posting *quality* GME DD here and then they get shitty when their poor quality post gets deleted. They're posting it in the superst0nk subreddit instead, because the mods are fucking morons most of the time. That's fine. Nobody is expected to be infallible. We all make mistakes. But they seriously let a LOT of shit slide and it'll be up for *hours* before *maybe* someone posts a valid counter DD... and then they don't even remove it. They just flair it with ""inconclusive"" or ""debunked"". But by that time, some muppets have already taken it as fact and run around half the Internet screaming about it.

In wsb, it gets nuked by the mods because it's just blatantly incorrect most the time.

2021-06-27 11:49:42,wallstreetbets,"It ended up as a meme for that actually; they try countering every piece of DD possible so that no misinformation comes through. Which is a methodology that would dim much of the posts here as pump&dump, but you‚Äôre not prepared for this conversation."
2021-06-27 13:33:29,wallstreetbets,"A) Which tickers in particular are you seeing on there that concern you?

B) Citadel just happening to have a long position on a ticker doesn't somehow mean that it's a P&D orchestrated by Citadel.

It's a hedge fund, they have shit tons of positions. Does the fact that there are HFs long on GME make it a hedge fund P&D? Or what about AMC? Was that a Citadel P&D when they had a large position on that?"

2021-06-27 14:00:02,wallstreetbets,"First time here? What was the original meme? What was the first meme you recall? Sure Citadel is likely to blanket positions, but citadel also has influence over everything including CNBC(look at their bright logo on the tv). It‚Äôs been a consistent pattern of all the tickers with professional looking Dd.       

DFV was one of the first to post technical analysis. I believe he is a financial advisor with licenses to practice. If a consistent amount of posts following the first price correction correlate with more technical analysis, it shows that the bots know what people are more likely to listen to(pattern of behavior). They can then use that pattern of behavior to fool the reader. I believe some conglomerate said they had everything and social media under control on TV in February, implying that social media could never influence the markets again.      

RKT was the ultimate pump and dump that only a market maker could do. Fill puts to drive price. Fill otm calls where gamma means nothing. Fill stock and post on social media in order to cause panic buying and essentially causing a short squeeze through volatility, and profiting from volatility on the puts on the way down if they sold it. Overall play would‚Äôve been easily worth x10-20 in a few days of trading.   

AMC was their pump and dump. They filled calls and stock. They owned a significant percentage of amc stock on the way up. I don‚Äôt know what their ownership percentage is right now, but if it‚Äôs being pumped on CNBC likely more than 1%.         

The only way they can dump or make money is by creating demand. They create demand when there are no sellers and suddenly you have a trifecta of margin calls, volatility and fomoers. You can‚Äôt sell when there is no demand or else you lose a lot of money.      

Honestly, I don‚Äôt care about hedge funds or market makers if they ran a legitimate business that was 100% legal. The fact that every clearing corp has passed multiple rules in the past 6 months would show that there is some kind of manipulation going on at the higher level."
2021-06-27 18:19:28,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea what meme I first saw here, that was 5 years ago now.

....DFV was *not* one of the first to post TA here, what the fuck. How new *are* you?


You make a shit of assertions here but still haven't backed any of them up with anything beyond ""believe me because I'm telling you"".

Where's your *evidence* that any of that was orchestrated? As opposed to being just like any one of the other meme stocks that have come through WSB over the years.

Your claims about volatility is a sign of artificial market behavior by hedge funds isn't exactly sane either. You could use this same logic to claim that the Illuminati is behind everything, and you would have presented just as much evidence for each: nothing verifiable."
2021-06-27 19:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Claims to have been here for 5 years and account shows 1 year.       

They posted their play on social media and on the media after. They created demand, and then I believe they suppressed the demand with their options+ selling of stock and caused it to drop fast.       

Do you know what a bid/ask is? Do you understand how much market makers talk to one another? Check out confessions of a market maker on YouTube. It will blow your mind. Anton Kreil also breaks down the fundamentals of a market maker pretty well. Anton Kreil is at least a proven trader with a track record of working for big banks.           

You‚Äôre telling me filling in a 20m position as a market maker and then posting through the media and social media isn‚Äôt suspect? Someone even posted their position on here.               

Give it a couple years and wait until they show all the insider trading in the future."
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What are the best ways of playing present and future water crises? The world is increasingly running out of fresh water. Many different countries around the world are dealing with fresh water shortages and are being forced to spend billions of dollars to solve this problem. For example China has spent $79 B on a water pipeline to pipe water from its northern regions to Beijing. Saudi Arabia and various Saudi Arabian companies have bought farmland in the US as it is cheaper to import water intensive crops than to waste their own water on farming in Saudi Arabia. Israel has spent billions on construction of water desalination plants and as of 2016 met over 55% of their water needs from these desalination plants. And of course there is also the hedge funds buying up water rights and land with large amounts of groundwater to sell back to municipalities in times of crisis.

[Risk of Fresh Water Shortages](https://preview.redd.it/xlkuw3k48q771.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=61158037408f52baed9bb6c9da9414b0caf24315)

So my question is what stocks or ways of playing these shortages do you think is the best? 

(Such as desalination stocks, buying land, etfs... )"

Some of the most contentious issues in the world right now are water related.   Central Valley California (San Fransisco river smelt that won out against those Mcfarland almond orchards that had to be ripped out),  Chinese dams on the Yangtze (denying water to down stream countries) and the Ethiopian dam on the Nile doing the same(Sudan and Egypt raising protests through the UN), the Dead Sea is a quarter of its original size due to the River Jordan is just a trickle because it's siphoned off for farming (a person can literally wade across it).  Access to water is creating incredible tensions all accross the entire Sahal region.  BBC was running a story last week about the issues around Lake Kivu drying out (between Rwanda and DRC) and peoples *already* moving due to water scarcity...

Any farmer (in my old stomping grounds) can tell you pricing is escalating due to scarcity of fresh water access with those quarter-sedtions that have water sources going for a premium - and that's in a non-water scarce region.

My only counter would be costs of producing fresh water and access to food.  We get away with it here inKuwait because it's a very wealthy country and can burn oil to run desalination as well as fly in fresh apples from anywhere in the world. 

The current evidence about fresh water points to both costs and access being outside the reach of vast populations of people - the UN couldn't even dig simple wells in Bangladesh without severe cultural repercussions.

* The stock has gone up consistently month over month after cyclical profit taking dips.
* It's one of the few vaccines that is being used globally and considered as the gold standard. 
* With the threat of the delta variant ever growing, MRNA tech will be all the more important. 
* Moderna is more than a vaccine play. They have projects ranging from HIV/AIDS to cancer treatments, and with the massive influx of vaccine fueled cash coming in, these projects will have an even higher chance of moving forward.
* It has not garnered much social attention (yet), getting in now before the retail social-media crowds do is always advantageous. 
* MRNA tech is still very very new, and the doors it could open in the future are endless. Moderna now being a household name means more trust will be given to them in comparison to other new MRNA tech companies. 
* Their freaking ticker is $MRNA. 

I've already made thousands on this, and will continue to hold for at least two years. This could easily jump to $400 by year end if current trend maintains itself. I really believe this company is the ""Tesla"" of biotech, and will in a few years hit the four digit mark if they manage themselves as they have been."

2021-06-27 00:23:32,wallstreetbets,I used to be in jets during the pandemic. Then I sold it all to put in meme stocks.

2021-06-27 15:49:13,wallstreetbets,I switched to French's and try to avoid Kraft products. Off brand Mac and Cheese is 10x better too.
2021-06-27 07:04:17,wallstreetbets,It's called the illusion of choice.
2021-06-26 23:11:15,wallstreetbets,Trading is not a team sport
2021-06-27 10:40:32,wallstreetbets,"I like the direction of the stock, seem to have a good upside. They've got decent financials, a decent dividend. Word on the street, too, is that Michael Burry has a large position in shares and contracts. It's also a favorite of Warren Buffet. And who knows, maybe a squeeze potential. High short interest (over 50% this past Friday alone.) We'll see."

2021-06-27 13:13:50,wallstreetbets,I only have a few hundred shares to sell weeklies for chump change. I don't care what actually happens to the stock because I'm up on the trade.
2021-06-27 15:49:52,wallstreetbets,Wow... is that $7 call an IV play or are you just COMPLETELY RETARDED?
2021-06-26 21:53:57,wallstreetbets,Lol I wish people wouldn‚Äôt buy fractional shares. I thought you had 21 million shares.
2021-06-26 22:31:19,wallstreetbets,I just doubled down on friday ! SNDL has big moves coming up !

2021-06-27 12:45:47,wallstreetbets,"All this sus names blasting fud like a chained up yard dog. If you can't make money trading sundial from the highs to the lows while continually saving more and more shares making profits of calls and puts.... that's really more of a ""them"" problem and has nothing to do sundial beating off that debt and saving up a shot ton of cold hard cash or pivoting into cannabis banking which has already profited pushing them ebitda positive all while consistently outperforming other cannabis stocks on a percentage gained/lost aspect. Cry dilution like a fuddy duddy if you want but daily trade volume has hit 3billion shares traded in a single day you either haven't been watching daily or have the memory of a goldfish and likely weak ass paper hands who don't know how to hold the rips and buy the dips.

2021-06-26 21:55:36,wallstreetbets,"I'm a big.time believer in sundial.  My position isn't as big as yours, but I believe they have huge leverage to make a difference in the financial world of cannabis.  They get my support just in that alone.  Their numbers will continue to get better as they're already a big movement maker when it comes to financing smaller collectives."
2021-06-26 22:08:06,wallstreetbets,Frustrating stock. What makes you think it will go up?
2021-06-26 22:22:52,wallstreetbets,Stock buyback planned?

Thats a LOT of upwards volume to move that at all"
2021-06-26 23:39:14,wallstreetbets,Why not the 2023 0.5s? Only 10 cents more than the $1. Pay 10 cents more to hit 40 cents less in the strike. No brainer to me

2021-06-26 22:39:30,wallstreetbets,Sundial grows absolutely garbage herb. Anyone who invests in this needs to research the quality of the product they sell. SNDL is a pump and dump!

2021-06-27 12:27:49,wallstreetbets,No debt tons of cash on hand pivoting into cannabis banking positive ebitda... all these clowns pumping other options yet sundial has been outperforming the overall cannabis market including tilray for this entire last quarter and will continue to do so.
2021-06-26 23:17:30,wallstreetbets, I remember seeing squeeze DDs about SNDL a while on break at my old job and looking like a lunatic because I was laughing so hard I was holding my sides.
2021-06-27 12:32:05,wallstreetbets,Sundial volume spike went from 1 billion to 3billion daily in the course of one week for those who have been watching long enough and consistently. So that 1.9b shares you are worried about literally got flipped almost 2x in a single day so yeah its definitely possible and with the pivot into cannabis banking and no debts with tons of cash on hand nobody is talking about how sundial could do a share buy back rewarding share holders who held during their fight for nasdaq compliance (which they did secure) as far as movement this entire last quarter sundial has been outpacing the cannabis market including tilray.
2021-06-27 07:00:20,wallstreetbets,Gotta hit .69 for me

2021-06-27 12:35:14,wallstreetbets,No debt tons of cash on hand pivoting into cannabis banking which had already pushed them ebitda positive and you expect share dilution? ü§£ more like a potential share buy back to reward shareholders for securing nasdaq compliance.

2021-06-27 13:18:58,wallstreetbets,Go douche. They literally put garbage in their weed. Fuckin loser
2021-06-27 13:20:09,wallstreetbets,Thats what happens when you dilute shareholders for 5 years. I'm in Tilray because of Irwin Simon. Not once did he dilute and I firmly believe he will create shareholder value. Also Tilray is actually cheaper than SNDL  even tho SNDL is only 1 dollar. People just look at the price of ana asset at 1 dollar and assume it can hit 10 lmao
2021-06-27 13:20:51,wallstreetbets,Float is like 2 bil shares meanwhile tilray is 440 and can easily hit a 40 bil market cap  which is almost 100 a share.

Please stop the nonsense"
2021-06-27 12:02:40,wallstreetbets,They just expanded to Europe. Tilray has had a major subsidiary CC pharma which is in Germany for over 2 years  as well as several other expansions around the world
2021-06-27 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,"If you were educated which you are not, you would know that Tilray is essentially just Aphria with a better name brand and the same management u jackass"
2021-06-27 14:51:42,wallstreetbets,This isn't even the same business... Shows me you have done 0 DD.
2021-06-27 12:05:32,wallstreetbets,I love that you try to make a point and I refute it and then you just completely ignore the fact that I just walked over your stupid points and then u mention something else that I refute lmao dude gtfoh
2021-06-27 12:09:31,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter when they did it. Emmac is an established company. If you acquire an established company you aren't starting over again.

Just like how you say TLRY will buy an MSO when able. Quit with your double standard."
2021-06-27 12:04:08,wallstreetbets,Columbia care has had an overseas contract for years now too? Do you even know that company? The point is who cares about Europe right now?? The prize is the USAüá∫üá∏üöÄüá∫üá∏üöÄüá∫üá∏$MSOS
2021-06-27 12:08:34,wallstreetbets,Well you're refuting points are invalidated by everything I say and then you bring up another point that although may be true still does not validate or give me any explanation as to how MSOs will outcompete Tilray and other global brands like CGC
2021-06-27 12:11:37,wallstreetbets,Ok but that doesn't change the fact that they just expanded their brands to Europe and are still at a disadvantage to companies that have been doing this for years... It really isn't complicated to see how Tilray will be the biggest company. By the time MSOs uplist cannabis will mire likely than not be federally legal and they will be way behind
2021-06-27 12:06:57,wallstreetbets,Europe has a larger population (2x the size) believe it or not. Also M.S O can only lose market share to Canadian LPS who have nothing to lose since they are not in the market yet. People fail to realize that market share will be lost to the major businesses once federally legal
2021-06-27 12:10:22,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at last quarters numbers yet? Apparently not lmao üëã
2021-06-27 12:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Emmac is an established company with its own brands.

MSOs are in the US. It is TLRY who is falling behind until they are able to buy MSOs for a premium."
2021-06-27 12:09:16,wallstreetbets,This is part of your problem your fundamental thesis for your investments is incorrect‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs not going to be federally legal it‚Äôs going to be decriminalized. the President of the United States is not on board with legalization‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs not going to happen bro. They can‚Äôt even get banking legislation passed lmao good luck

2021-06-27 12:24:59,wallstreetbets,Lmao!
2021-06-27 12:25:41,wallstreetbets,Or they just come in and swing their big dick all over the U.S market and take market share from M.S.Os whilst maintaining all of their Canadian leverage
2021-06-27 12:14:07,wallstreetbets,If you think they will just decriminalize and Biden won't sign whatever Schumer puts on his desk than you're delusional.

3bn revenue selling garbage products? Once they add useful products and more vendors (they've started adding European merchants) revenues will continue to grow. Premium retailers are a dime a dozen because the margins are high enough to survive as a business. If Wish builds a platform that can survive off is garbage products then they'll have tons of data to feed their algo which they can leverage like Google maps."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME building up for another squeeze? üöÄ I know i've been off of reddit for awhile but don't be worried... I am back.

Yea I know you don't care who I am so let me just cut to the chase, I think we're going to see another massive GME run again very soon. Now I don't have any crazy DDs or upcoming secret catalysts to share but the way I trade stocks in general is mostly through Technical Analysis.

*To keep this simple, if you're not familiar with Supply and Demand zones just think of them as ""support"" (Demand) and ""Resistance"" (Supply) for now...*

On the chart pictured below, it seems like GME tested weekly demand, went up a bit, then retested it again and as you see, buyers came in and bought it up once it touched demand again! I like how it respected the trend-line as well... I personally use demand zones to add on shares/contracts to my positions (which is what I did here)

[GME 1D SUPPLY AND 1W DEMAND](https://preview.redd.it/s70d479sfp771.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=40508e58a9f96133e0b0d9a52ec93f68bdd261b4)

**If that didn't satisfy you enough...have no fear because I have more TA to show...**

Chart below is showing an apparent falling wedge on the daily and 4hr, not only did GME respect the wedge pattern, we also held the 38.2 fib support from the retracement back in march!:

And my last example is more of just a slight theory but tell me if yall can also see this massive cup and handle showing on the daily/weekly or am I tripping?

&#x200B;

**TDLR: I think this is the GME bottom for awhile unless something crazy happens, if your gonna buy into GME, I recommend buying around here by demand and not being caught chasing when it squeezes again:/ üöÄ**

*My positions: 8/20 250c + shares since last year*

&#x200B;

Good luck, Happy trading!"

It could then drop back into the $300 range where it would find consolidation again before pushing up again past $1000 into the $1,200 area or higher.  Looks damn good!

The fact that we have been getting these crazy volatile run ups every months or so is evidence that there is something going on here.

2021-06-27 04:25:22,wallstreetbets,"I'd say yes... the short data indicates significant short shares on loan of approximately 10 million. The last trading day saw a net short interest gain of 2.46% which roughly correlates to 248.5k short positions opened Friday. That's good since we need more shorts for the short and gamma squeeze. 

We can win this by continuing to buy and hold. GME is relatively inexpensive from it's pre-market ATH ~500. 

Plus we can remain retarded for much longer than the HFs can remain solvent, lol.

And we aren't even talking a illegal short positions yet, since there are obviously no official count of those and we can only estimate those positions.

Buy, buy, buy. They can't keep doing this forever."

As far as the demand and supply zones, I'm curious, how do they work?

Overall, I think we are nearing the end of the handle, but could also have another week of sideways trading. and then, the price target in the first rip would likely be around 750-800, with the long term trajectory to around 3500 in an Elliot impulse 53535  wave"

Your demand/supply zones are also drawn arbitrarily in a way that fits your bias. 

Also, your trendline is connected to the most recent candle, which makes it invalid in TA - it‚Äôs pure recency bias.

This analysis is actually bearish."

Leaving aside the typical fundamental vs. technical vs. hybrid styles discussions, this is simply an oddball stock. Because of the short interest, the games, the general attention this thing gets... there's nothing normal about it.

The bizarre winds will blow here as they will. Personally, I probably won't add more. But I'm not selling anything until/unless it does some insanely, out of this world, beyond the moon and out past the edge of the solar system move. I don't own this for $$$, I own it as a political and social statement.

Whatever... whatever it takes, whatever the catalyst... I hope that something triggers another - even bigger - giant move and does damage where we all want it to. This game hasn't stopped yet, so we'll ideally see something happen soon enough. The big question I wonder about is, ""How DOES this actually end?"""

2021-06-27 07:50:25,wallstreetbets,"Check your broker's policy on fractional shares, when it comes to fractionals you don't actually 'own' the share in question, not that it's a problem, but if you're close to owning a whole share it's good to grab that little extra bit. Makes transferring brokers easier and if there is a problem later down the line (such as you forget you actually own them, which more than a few retards on here do) it can be easier to reunite you with your shares later in life. GME could genuinely be a ultra long term play, personally, I would like to have a piece of that pie when I'm 80, rocking back and fourth in my chair uncontrollably, dribbling away in the corner of a euthanasia clinic, but you know, each investor has their own unique strategy."

 https://www.businessinsider.com/amc-ceo-adam-aron-pay-bonus-compensation-pandemic-cinema-movie-2021-3?op=1

And on the other hand you have Ryan Cohen refusing pay and paying new hires from Amazon/Chewy/etc in stock while having 0 debt.

Now tell me, which one wants to see this explode and which one will use any opportunity to dilute further even if it means saving shorts?

2021-06-27 02:37:36,wallstreetbets,"‚Äúanother‚Äù yes, because when shares went up over 10,000 percent in Jan that totally wasn‚Äôt a squeeze"
2021-06-27 09:28:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you got actual proof for that? Like, anything that's not bullshit conjecture? 


You know where that BS line started? I do, because I was there. That literally started from, ""The price is dropping and there aren't many shorts left to borrow today on Fintel - *it must be naked shorting!*"" Never mind that...you know, *people sell*, and Fintel is not the only source for short shares. But the cult went, ""Yeah, that makes sense!"" and wrote a whole DD on how naked shorting happened once elsewhere, so it MUST be why the price drops now, here! 



And then it was the also excuse when there were TONS of shares to borrow for pennies, and yet the price still dropped. The price dropped? Gasp, they must be shorting, right? But with what?! It must be ....NAKED SHORTS!! WHY ELSE WOULD THE PRICE DROP??


None of that is proof, and I'll tell you why the price dropped: people sold. You can go right to a Bloomberg terminal and see that individual and institutional holdings both went down after January. Occam's razor - does the price drop the same way *every other share on the market does*, or - here's the cult line - is there a huge, vast conspiracy involving literally everyone on the markets and in government to keep one stock down?  Which sounds more plausible? 


Actual evidence doesn't lie. But your cult sure does. This post is a blatant attempt to pump the stock for another dump. And if this moron has had shares since last year and DIDN'T sell during the real squeeze in Jan, or the two Gamma squeezes since then, that's his own dumb fault. He's obviously an idiot, and you shouldn't listen to any ""technical analysis"" he offers. I can do that too with any chart before it crashes - draw lines and be like, ""See, it's gonna go up, because lines say so!"" Except, what if it drops, and now the line trends downward? It's like tea leaves, these charts are BS."

2021-06-27 09:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Your right, a squeeze is by definition when shorts been squeezed out by margin calls, that yet happened, the trend to 400+ from 40 was artificially made by hf to put a high price to make people sell, their issue started when nobody sold, and now their stuck, but they most likley gonna swing it a month to two before the big breakout.

Then just HODL üíéüôå and wait for moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ"

2021-06-27 10:48:06,wallstreetbets,Well; last time they stopped buying... they could halt trading all together.   It so long as üíéüôå when they turn it back on it will just remain high

2021-06-27 02:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I do feel like the short squeeze had just begun before the rug got pulled out at $450 on that dreaded Thursday. The restrictions got piled on so fast by RH and so many other brokerages all at once. I think only Fidelity and schwab were pretty safe. Td ameritrade only placed restrictions on options trade. 

Anyways, 450 just scratched the surface.  Gamma squeeze brought it up to like 150 and overselling on wsb, institutions, other hedge funds was responsible for much of the rest. Plug got pulled as soon as the short squeeze began. I think an actual short squeeze if allowed to play through a bit could have easily popped past a couple grand.

That is also why I'm playing it very closely this time around. Not going to be greedy or allow my emotions to decide anything. I don't trust these brokerages or sec or wsb or anyone this time around. Pulling out as soon as I feel it's timr."
2021-06-27 10:03:55,wallstreetbets,"It was blatantly a short squeeze. People are delusional if they think a gamma squeeze out of nowhere caused the stock to go up 1000% two different times. For it to he a short squeeze it would mean the hedgefunds would have had to cover a lot of their short positions, which blows apart their narrative that they never covered."
2021-06-27 16:58:35,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it‚Äôs another 150 day old bot account. The sub‚Äôs filled with them."
2021-06-27 09:28:04,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs shorted worse than ever.
2021-06-27 11:06:07,wallstreetbets,"False. Retail only increased positions drastically. Short interest is self reported and so totally useless, misleading at best. There is overwhelming evidence that short interest increased from the 140% in January. It is impossible for that 140% short interest to have been covered.

GME is the real short squeeze play right now. Or in the words of the DTCC a ""single security exhibiting idiosyncratic risk"".

Forget all these other stocks who are being pumped as a squeeze, it's all bullshit."
2021-06-27 10:13:09,wallstreetbets,Short interest reporting data isn't accurate.
2021-06-27 09:38:58,wallstreetbets,"This is vastly incorrect, I suggest educating yourself."
2021-06-27 10:58:55,wallstreetbets,Are you living under a rock?
2021-06-27 12:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Literally no one is in this stock with a ""pump it so I can break even"" mentality. I have never seen a group of investors be so secure and confident with their investment as GME holders are. Even at 200 USD there are not that many bagholders. Most shares bought can be sold for a profit at this point, and a lot of people bought more and averaged down since January.

Read what GME holders are actually talking about and you would know your point is nonsense. It's undeniable that GME holders feel the stock has massive upside potential, on a squeeze but also definitely on fundamentals."
2021-06-26 23:01:26,wallstreetbets,"GME is my main squeeze‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs reliable, dependent, long-term faithful, and goes down on me occasionally, but only often enough to make me ready to shoot to the moon.

2021-06-27 07:22:39,wallstreetbets,140% is just the maximum allowed to report. The fuck it stops at 140.

In fairness, I think at this point I would‚Äôve been better off holding AMC without selling the covered calls against it. However, if AMC stays in the general range it‚Äôs trading at and if IV stays high (which I expect IV will), this strategy will literally be a money printer.

Most of my portfolio is covered calls actually. Make fun of me all you want, but many of my positions are essentially ‚Äúfree‚Äù just because the premium I‚Äôve received the past few months have paid for them."

If they shorted Russel 2000 while it had GME, and Russel 2000 removes it from its holdings - will hedge funds and market makers need GME to cover the index/ETF shorts?

I genuinely don't know."
2021-06-27 12:09:06,wallstreetbets,"But the thing is Rusell 1000 is bigger and have more money on it than Rusell 2000 right? Like 9 times bigger.

I‚Äôm not in this for a short squeeze although if it happens, I‚Äôll gladly take it.

2021-06-27 02:55:15,wallstreetbets,"What does that have to do with anything? Puts don‚Äôt require you to purchase the shares to cover the contract, the most you can lose from an OTM put is the premium you paid for the option.

 The whole point of a squeeze is once the price starts rising you‚Äôre forced to buy the shares to cover your short at the higher price to keep your losses from rising even more which triggers the price to rise even higher and so on. 

Puts have literally nothing to do with it."
2021-06-27 01:54:05,wallstreetbets,OTM puts barely have any delta left.
2021-06-27 02:52:06,wallstreetbets,"OTM puts in no way requires you to buy the shares to cover them though.. The whole idea of the squeeze is that they‚Äôre shorts that which require them buy the shares they had borrowed at a higher price to keep their losses from mounting should the share price rise further.
 Put options don‚Äôt have anything to do with a squeeze?"

Few weeks ago GME was trading at almost $350. Few weeks later, at $200, means those new short positions taken are absolutely printing right now. 

Granted the short interest has been declining substantially so it's not the most popular move, but those with the balls to do it are being rewarded handsomely."
2021-06-27 02:44:10,wallstreetbets,"You said it never squeezed. The share price alone went up over 10,000 percent. If that happened right now it would be at 20,000 a share.

So if they sell off those long positions along with closing the shorts on the overall ETF it should mostly be a wash for those other non-GME stickers, at least in theory from my understanding.

2021-06-27 14:53:02,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is the MMs are able to disassemble the ETFs into their component stocks and then go long on all of the stocks other than GME so they are net neutral on all of the other components. I have no idea if that is really possible or just a BS theory, but it sounds plausible.

If that is true it means they have already covered the balance of the ETF, and I would assume the GME shares get added to the FTDs."
2021-06-27 11:59:39,wallstreetbets,Wasn‚Äôt this all part of Friday‚Äôs ‚Äúrebalancing‚Äù? The funds that track the Russel 2000 would have sold off their GME while those that track the Russel 1000 would have bought GME?

2021-06-27 08:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Nice!  And don't just click the Buy and Sell buttons on your watchlist, click onto the stock's page and click trade. There you can buy and also make an order to buy at a specific price.        

Then if you want to sell, you need to go to your portfolio in the settings, click the stock you want to sell, then you'll have a list of all your positions.        

You can click on a position to see the info and options to sell for it, or on the app a shorthand to sell immediately is just swipe left and click Close (selling a position is always called closing it, simply clicking sell on the watchlist is shorting a stock).          
If you swipe right you will see options to set a stop loss or Take Profit which are orders to sell that position if the price goes down or up from your opening price respectively.          

A stop loss guarantees a loss of money and is simply a way to make sure a position is closed before the price drops too low, although unless the company is failing or very unlikely to go up to those levels again you can just wait a few months to a year for the price to rebound.        
These are the so-called paper handed people, but it's a very real tactic for daytraders because they can use the rest of that money in a separate trade to potentially gain more and not be locked into waiting a long time for that money to be freed up i.e they'd rather lose $100 on a $500 trade just to be able to use the $400 left in a separate trade."

Many of the DTCC rules that have come out in the last month will prevent these practices in the future. On some level you‚Äôre right that there is no blatant red flag as all of this is illegal.

2021-06-27 03:30:37,wallstreetbets,"If you short 1% of your net worth in GME, you would be margin called when stock only went up 25x (because brokerages do not want to hold the bag \[I think margin requirement went as high as 4x in Jan\]).

So if the stock went up over 100x and shorts didn't need to cover, it means US Govt allows institutions to have negative infinity dollar net worth.

In that case, why should there ever be a short squeeze? Clearly there's nothing wrong with institution being negative 80 billion dollar net worth and still be able to print more money. Literally what's money at this point. Smooth brain much?

Use some brain. Please. I know we all love to shill here but shilling to this extent is a great disservice to the naive here."

The profitability comes from IV versus entry cost.  Do you fucking people even know what the word ""profitable"" means?

It costs you $43,000 to start selling ROKU covered calls.  The 7/16 $435 sells for $18.45 as of Friday.  That's 4% of the cost of the shares.  

For the same amount you can buy almost 800 shares of AMC and sell calls against them.  At-the-money 7/16 calls on AMC sell for $940 apiece.  Sell 8 of those and you collect premium of $7,520 which is 17.5% of the cost of the shares.

That rate of return is profitability.  You fucking idiot.

This is without considering most people who are going to do this bought thousands of shares at $10-15.

So, no, you're wrong."

2021-06-27 01:32:21,wallstreetbets,Oh youre not crazy at all. The only crazy ones are those who are still shorting everyday. I honestly think its about 2000% shorted at this point. My minimum calculation was from mid May
2021-06-27 01:37:08,wallstreetbets,I added up all the FTD's reported that have not yet been covered. The data i have is only from mid may. Then i added up all the shares that are currently being supported by far OTM put positions. Had to go through every expiration till 2023. Now 400% is just a minimum from those 2 data points. Obviously theyve can kicked more FTD's and havent covered all the ones I didnt count so thats why I say its a minimum.

2021-06-27 17:20:05,wallstreetbets,"i can't give you the most articulate answer but it relates to how market makers hedge their positions when they sell options.

in January, the gamma squeeze happened because everyone was piling into both OTM and ITM calls. to hedge their own position, a market maker will buy a certain amount of shares for every call they sell to make sure they have the shares of the security if the call goes in the money and they get assigned. the closer the call gets to in the money, the higher the Delta goes, and the more shares they buy. 

So in January the insane call volume caused MM to buy a shit ton of shares and the price started rocketing.

Buying a shit ton of puts has an inverse effect on the price.

I wish I could explain it to you better but that was the best i could do."

The only squeeze that‚Äôs happened would have been in January, but since most of the popular retail traders prevented buying it killed the momentum to drag this whole thing out."

Tons of short squeezes have happened in the past, including even two with GME, and they have never gone anywhere close to what you morons claim it will. People keep increasing the floor as a joke, and you cultists take it as fact, just as you blindly accept anything that has ""DD"" written in front of it. At this point the GME community is closer to flat earthers or anti vaxxers than anything resembling rational thought.

2021-06-27 12:27:15,wallstreetbets,Yes that's literally what I'm saying. It hasn't been over 200% since BEFORE the spike to 480. You think that was caused by nobody covering any of them? I mean it was also hovering around 60% in the months after January before eventually falling to where it is now. The most likely scenario is they covered most of them causing the spike in January then bought more shorts when the stock was over 300.
2021-06-27 12:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean that isn't all a FTD is 

>Failure to deliver (FTD) refers to a situation where one party in a trading contract (whether it's shares, futures, options, or forward contracts) does not deliver on their obligation. Such failures occur when a buyer (the party with a long position) does not have enough money to take delivery and pay for the transaction at settlement.

A failure can also occur when the seller (the party with a short position) does not own all or any of the underlying assets required at settlement, and so cannot make the delivery.

FTD are only related to naked short sells which the majority of these are not. The funds that lent the shares for the shorts have no reason to let ""ftds be hidden with puts"" they would simply have forced delivery of the shares which they could do at any time."

If it was the squeeze I doubt even the robinhood stopping the shares from being bought (along with other shitty brokerages this sub uses) would stop the the squeeze from happening. To be honest who the hell knows everything everyone says is just speculation at this point. Will it happen again? Why the fuck is the price still this high? I moved on for now."
2021-06-27 10:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Why should we start from Jan 1st? It's so arbitrary. Shorts came in starting from last year cause of covid.

Do we just ignore all that to accept your statement?

Also, premarket prices do matter when covering. Institutions don't ignore trading hours when going bankrupt. No one had any clue this wouldn't go thousands. And $500 was basically peak in premarket.

If you start from $17.25, $500 is almost 29x. Margin call for GME end of Jan was 3~5x. I'll be nice to use 3x as example.

This meant if you short 20% of your net worth, you got margin called if your margin went above 33.333% of your net worth. Meaning if the price went up more than 1.67x, you got margin called.

If you only shorted 10% of your net worth, 3.33x.

If you only shorted 2% of your net worth, 16.7x.


But short interest was high and these institutions were greedy! you say.

Wow. So if we are being super generous by starting from arbitrary Jan 1st (why not last year?) with 3x for margin call (institutional brokerages were most likely closer to 5x as big money had huge influence on price), these institutions should at most shorted 1% of their net worth to not be margin called. Wow. Almost retarded.

Also, you do realize Melvin Capital reported REALIZED losses at the hearing, right? You don't realize a loss without doing both buy/sell. Holy crap. I love to mock Melvin Capital but even I understand what realized gains are."
2021-06-27 18:24:58,wallstreetbets,"If they have high IV, selling calls (or puts too) will give you the highest premium. They‚Äôre literally the best stocks to sell calls on. As long as the stocks stay in a somewhat consistent range (as AMC and GME have the past few weeks) you literally just take in loads of premium as pure profit.

Also if you think selling a put is much different from buying the shares and selling a call, I‚Äôd invite you to look up put-call parity lol. Conceptually they are very similar."

2021-06-27 19:17:36,wallstreetbets,"My own calculation is at least 520%+ SI (50M float) the 15th February. I calculated directly with FINRA's **Days to cover** data (it was 19 days with a daily volume of 14 millions from 16th to 19th). Now you can no longer see this Days to cover data, they removed it in February. But this is a proof that shorts never covered and, instead, increased their short position."

2021-06-27 09:03:01,wallstreetbets,"But there are ways to reset FTDs that do not require the original delinquent short seller to buy back shares immediately. The bizarre options activity we see on GME (massively OTM puts worth millions of shares, among others) is indicative that this is what has been happening since January.

2021-06-27 11:53:45,wallstreetbets,"What are you all smoking.

I am so confused. Why should markets have to crash and have bailouts?

Meme stocks are NOT the market. Oh my lord.

Go study how the basic stock markets work before anything. I am worried about your financial future long term.

Only a really tiny portion of hedge funds in the industry do long/short strategies. The accepted norm is just don't touch stocks that feel too much in bubbles. That's what most sane investors do.

e.g.: I think SPCE, etc. are huge bubbles. What do I do? I just ignore. Why should SPCE mooning or crashing cause market crash? C'mon. Sure, there might be some that short but who cares. That's not the entire market. Shorting has been a thing for hundreds of years. 'Infinite short squeezes' has happened quite a few times including KBIO (< $2 stock to \~$40).

Also, shorting isn't moon or zero. You can short and cover from $254 to $253.99. Most shorts are day trades. Institutions that do high frequency trading can trade up to 64 million times back and forth short/cover in a given minute (doubt any institution does this). You make money going from $254 to $253.99. It's not $254 to $0 or infinity. That's not how stock market works. So if price fell from 300s to 200s. That means shorts that covered already made money and won. That's just it. It's all about risk management. Why should those in profit not cover? No one in the industry expects GME to go to $0 anytime in the near future. That's cult brainwashing talk. You can however, take advantage of the volatility and make money from that."

Investors who got in early on these tickers are likely living lavish. One question always lingers in the back of my mind. How did they know? Did they perform rigorous due diligence on these companies? Were they simply lucky?

&#x200B;

I wanted to pose a question for the lovely people of WSB. What companies do you have extreme high conviction on for the next 10-20 years? Why do you feel so strongly about said company?

&#x200B;

Alternatively, if you can't think of a company, what about an industry specifically?

&#x200B;

I find that investment themes including: cloud computing, robotics, renewable energy, 3d printing, and genomic sequencing are likely to be hot in the future. The question is, which companies are in a position to win market share in these sectors?"

I knew if I was playing the long game, I needed to think about this in a 2 step manner. Although I am technically ""gambling"" on the fate of these companies, I think the next 5-10 years will be splendid. Personally I like these companies, and their growth prospects in the near/long term future.

PLTR - Palantir. They have only just begun. People compare this company to Microsoft, or the ""next Microsoft"". Fuck that. They're playing a different game. I think they might get more notoriety if their software suite, was used by intelligence agencies against nation-states like Russia or China. In the electronic warfare front, I think they will be a key player for cybersecurity companies to utilize in offense, and defense. Lots of potential in every industry where information gathering puts you ahead of a competitor or a nation state.

BNGO/NNOX/CRSP - Bionano Genomics/Nanox/Crisper. I don't think this is a joke. I think their tech, with good merit, is a direct disruptor to existing devices and machinery out there. Until their business is cash flow positive, with actual customer purchases, info on whether or not hospitals would jump at the chance to grab these machines, as well as smaller firms. I'm lumping BNGO in with this because of devices, and genomics in general. I also started a small position in CRSP, genomics is relatively new. We don't know what the next decade holds for genome editing, curing diseases, identifying malformed genes and pathways. This is a bright future for humanity when this becomes normalized. Maybe I'll even throw Gingko Bioworks into my genomics port, idk.

U - Unity. Not a call for some kumbaya moment, but a way to bring players and audiences from any location, into immersive worlds, where we can get lost in the reality of our own choosing. I think video games are underrated. Mostly because software of our predecessors has been shit, and in some rare cases, actual gems of ingenuity have formed over the decades. VR might have been a flop, but its not dead. Immersive experiences are really important for a person (imo). Intimacy and belief in a different relativity is RARELY seen in video games or movies in a viewing experience. I hope to see movie theaters and home media centers really trying to draw audiences in with newer experience in the future. How long that might take, I don't know, I'm not an oracle, but whether its in self-driving automobiles, giving you a person car ride / media experience or you have goggles on at home bumping into shit, U will be right there.

ATOM - Atomera. If I were to pick some companies that were easy 10x-50x baggers over the next decade or two, then I would be mostly fucking wrong. But I believe in ATOM. From the particles of our very existence, to semiconductors which run our technologies, and gears innovation, companies like this are actual disruptors.

HOL - Astra. Fedex of space deliveries, or the USPS? Not sure yet. But with an all-star team, (keeps growing), successful launches, and forseeable goals, this is a winner for me. The CEO alone, is a rockstar. Although that could throw people off (think Elon rockstar and what he tweets/says), Chris Kemp is like if Spoc and Kirk had a baby, and Edward Snowden took care of the education. I think he's geniune article, and his experience alone makes me root for the jockey and horse. Ultimately, this is a very young company, in an even younger industry.

STEM/ITAC/ETWO - STEM/Arbe Robotics/E2Open AI/robotics and supply chain AI software, with big customers to boot. reddit buggy ass got rid of my whole section here, too lazy to rewrite.

WOOF - Petco. I have dogs, and I love animals. omnichannel brick and mortor with various subscriptions, and services ready to go? All for the well being of your animal and others? Vet and grooming services? Clothing? Medicine? Toys? All with a good customer experience? Count me in. (i have a 17 page dd on notion about woof, if anyone is interested, pm me i guess). Resides on a more safer delta.

MP - MP Materials. I like metals? Easy non-china winner for materials. It irked me that this was also a Chamath de-SPAC, but whatever. Judge by the team and merits right? Resides on a more safer delta.

SKIN - Beauty Health Company. A staple, well managed company, that's no going anywhere. Long term this is a great hold. Something I considered was Hims, and possibly mental health stocks like Mindmed. I don't know how those companies really work. But I am sure about SKIN.

I don't have fintech, yet. Still looking.

2021-06-26 23:51:39,wallstreetbets,"When I was a wee tot, I would often hear my dad talk about his investments with family. He was not a good investor, and lost quite a bit of money, struggling for decades to recoup his losses. In those times, I told him many times to invest in 2 companies: Netflix and Chipotle. Over and over I told him to buy up as much as he could. He didn't listen. I didn't have my own money at the time, or I would've dumped it all into those 2 tickers.

Often, I think about why I was so adamant that they would be successful. I knew nothing about financials at that time, so why did I have such faith? Here are a couple reasons:

1. Novelty. Both Netflix and Chipotle, and really any of the thicc boy returns, are all novel products first to market with large amounts of awareness as publicity.
2. Appeal to the future. These companies care about the next generation of consumer and the next wave of society, not necessarily the now. 
3. Focus on solving problems that don't exist. Nobody asked for a Chipotle style counter serve model. Nobody asked for Netflix. But damn if we didn't know we needed them.
4. Blueprint. These companies create the blueprint for future enterprises and companies. There are many chains now that apply the Chipotle model. There are tons of streaming services now.

Since then, I haven't felt that strongly about a company since I learned about Palantir. Now, I have my own money, and a lot of it is invested in Palantir. We'll see what the next 10 years looks like."
2021-06-26 23:47:47,wallstreetbets,"Everyone commenting here ignores that Amazon was a single digit stock, putting it at 5 billion valuation back then. Most stocks are already overvalued. Car companies that make no money? SPCE that makes no money and has a retarded business model is worth 13.5 billion? You think it's going up by 125x in 20 years? Selling what to whom?

You morons.  Amazon is up by a factor of 340x since 20 years ago. They made NO profit for most of that time. But at least they did something that made sense. Sell things that ACTUALLY exist. SPCE makes no sense. They don't have a chance at hypersonics either. No one will fly if it's 10x more dangerous than subsonic flight which is already super cheap and super fast.

Even IF you bought in back then, you would have sold big chunks many times, and would have a fraction of the shares you started with. So that 340x would be more like 34x, at best. 

And that is only IF you got lucky enough to pick the ONE company in a multitude of sectors that would come to dominate a sector like no company has ever dominated a sector.

Looking/hoping for 100 baggers is moronic."

2021-06-27 07:08:54,wallstreetbets,"NIO - A few simple reasons:

- EV is the worlds biggest consumer transformation since phones. Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares. Moon is regardless, NIO is going to help my dad retire (I told him about the moon ride at $7) and myself and siblings to have a nice head start. I‚Äôll throw a üöÄ cuz I know this is WSB ü¶ç

Tesla pioneered mass produced EV (thought I think Saturn came out with 1 in the 90s but that was more of an experiment).  So try to find an IPO that‚Äôs its first of its kind.

This is an OTC play at the moment‚Ä¶ company is primed to receive Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA in September/October this year for their cancer treatment (RadioGel).

The technology essentially enables a radioactive isotope inserted into a liquid where at room temperature is injectable directly into a tumor‚Äî upon which it gels up and stays localized to the area where it‚Äôs injected. The radioactive isotope provided highly localized radiation treatment to the tumor, while limiting damage to the surround tissue. 

With traditional chemo treatment, the whole body is poisoned to treat one area‚Äî but with this treatment only the specific area/tumor is treated while significantly limiting any radiation exposure to other tissues. 

The treatment has proved effective in dogs/cats/horses‚Ä¶ the company is aiming to start human trials and iff approved this stock could go from $0.12 to several dollars overnight. 

They are working with reputable partners such as the Mayo Clinic and have had a decent amount of success already proving the effectiveness."

first time you streamed a movie?  go by the stock

first time you read about an electric vehicle that can go 0-60 in 3 seconds, go buy the stock. 

First time you ordered your textbooks online instead of in the campus bookstore, go buy the stock. 

First Time you saw an iPhone, go buy the stock. 


So pick the things that you use daily.  As soon as you start using something new, grab some shares, especially if it isn't already a massive company owned by Disney or something that would only put a small blip on their radar. 

Facebook is another good example, totally changed everyone's lives.

That tax cut was corporate welfare while the rest the average Joe/Jane got the short end of the stick.

2021-06-27 12:28:22,wallstreetbets,"I think it depends who you‚Äôre trying to speak to. If you speak the average Joe/Jane, they would prefer it to be non-transitory because it means workers wages has to go up to support the inflation but that‚Äôs bad for business because the cost of doing business has gone up temporarily but the workers wages are higher. Which would force some businesses to go out of business (the ones that rely on low wage workers). I think it‚Äôs going to be more transitory because the feds has been trying to slow inflation for a long long time. There is going to be a point of no return and the current market is the reflection of that. They have very to little control over what the apes are doing and if they step in, this would permanently stop a generation of investor from investing in the markets because they feel it is fixed and why should they invest when they really have no control. The feds have intervened to many times to help their friends and this time because of how over leveraged they are, there‚Äôs no amount of money can help them unless they want the usd to become worthless."
2021-06-27 00:40:40,wallstreetbets,"This is true. While it‚Äôs not affordable to some investors, it‚Äôs still a bargain IMO. Earlier this year it hit $900 and last year before the split, it was over $2000. I‚Äôd venture to place bets that it will split again"
2021-06-27 01:14:31,wallstreetbets,"I mean the argument against Amazon was probably that there are a ton of internet shopping sites out there, tons of competition.  But when you're the best, you're the best."

That is not infancy pricing. When Tesla makes 50x more money then the current price only becomes reasonable. You‚Äôre already buying it paying premium for potential future income with might or might not happen"
2021-06-27 01:22:45,wallstreetbets,"True... But being the best is already priced in. Like 10x over Amazon.

2021-06-27 02:58:33,wallstreetbets,"In other words, if you buy something for a reasonable or lower price for its current performance, then it performs 50x and the reasonable price goes up, that‚Äôs when you make money long term. If you already paid the price for future performance there is less room to make profits, unless other people in the future also wants to buy at a 600p/e"
2021-06-27 10:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, exactly this. Remember, the literal number is meaningless. You want to buy a growth stock before conventional wisdom is that it's a growth stock. Way too late for that here."
2021-06-27 01:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I know Tesla is crazy overvalued... I'm not in them, in fact I bought a bunch of puts when they were over $800.

My point was just that I don't think it's really about competition.  All these companies that have mooned that he mentioned had competition and ended up with more competition.  What made these companies special was that they were *one step ahead* of the competition and *continued to innovate and stay one step ahead*. If you think Tesla can do that, and there are strong arguments they can, this might still be early for them as others are saying.

The only reason I'm not heavily in Tesla right now is because of the astronomical valuation."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF looks very undervalued.. HRC futures closed at a record again $CLF, presents an excellent setup on the chart currently. With a 10% debt paydown due before or on Wednesday and LG accepting an award for steelmaker of the year, it seems blue skies are ahead..

[Cleveland-Cliffs announces redemption of 2025 notes with a month left in Q2 to be paid with ""available liquidity"" ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210527005169/en/Cleveland-Cliffs-to-Fully-Redeem-5.75-Senior-Notes-due-2025)

[Laurenco Goncalves, CLF CEO, to be named steelmaker of the year, true champion of steel workers](https://www.nwitimes.com/business/local/cleveland-cliffs-ceo-to-be-named-steelmaker-of-the-year-hailed-as-true-champion-of/article_69e3e649-6e03-5af0-bdf8-37301024ea35.html)

$CLF seems to have a huge advantage on input costs that other steelmakers do not. Cliffs blast furnaces as do all blast furnaces use a certain amount of scrap in production. Yet for Cliffs LG has replaced this high priced scrap with HBI at a considerable cost savings versus his competitors. Even the EAF's that Cliffs acquired in the MT purchase will use substantial amounts of HBI as feedstock versus scrap. Cliffs control its feedstock thus controls its costs. Currently CLF input costs are a fraction of Nucors (NUE).. on top of this;

CLF's first guidance raise back in March was based on $975 HRC for the rest of '21 raising the consensus from 2.87b EBITDA to 3.5b EBITDA... CLF currently sits with a 3rd guidance raise on a benchmark of $1175 HRC for the rest of the year guiding 5b EBITDA as of Mid Junes guidance raise.. 

So EBITDA has doubled with 3 guidance raises in 3 months from 2.87b to 5b, yet the stock price has not doubled. Not even risen 25%. To me this screams undervalued. Especially as CLF currently sits under 1/3rd NUE marketcap. LG has said as much too, 

Here is what LG had to say about the matter on Q1 CC.. 

From April 22 2021 Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF) CEO Lourenco Goncalves on Q1 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript

 ""And we are starting to trade at the multiples that are absolutely absurd, absolutely ridiculous and this thing is not going to stay there forever. What we'll continue to do, we'll continue to move numbers from the debt side to the equity side. That's what we're doing""

Anything infrastructure is just the sprinkles on top of the sundae that is CLF. CLF does not NEED infrastructure as they are printing money. Currently HRC closed at a record Friday with $1800 printing for August. However, of note, Biden is walking back his comments about both infrastructure bills needing to be done in tandem.

['Certainly not my intent': Biden walks back 'tandem' infrastructure bill remarks](https://www.yahoo.com/news/certainly-not-intent-biden-walks-155425024.html)

Three guidance raises in three months.. the third being on a benchmark of $1,175 HRC for the rest of 2021 while guiding 5b EBITDA. Now take a look at HRC futures

[CLF news](https://www.stck.pro/news/CLF/13871860)

They have massive infrastructure projects currently underway and more planned for the future. From their belt and road initiative to their expansion of nuclear power generation, China is reaching a tipping point where, as their populace gains wealth, they need to satisfy domestic demand before cheap exports are a possibility."
2021-06-26 23:21:51,wallstreetbets,"China will reverse their position when their economy doesn‚Äôt need their supply. 

They‚Äôll go back to dumping for cheap as soon as they can sure. But they pulled back when prices are at an all time high. Tells me they aren‚Äôt dumping anytime soon."

2021-06-26 23:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I just believe they are only holding back because of the tariffs.  If they weren't in place (and I'm assuming they won't be for long...

The boom is all pandemic, government stimulus, delayed projects, etc all forming into one giant demand ball. And it‚Äôs rolling down hill picking up speed. And at that moment when China would reign supreme. They pulled back. Because they have their own delayed projects. Their own necessary stimulus and infrastructure. Etc. 

The outlook for cliffs long term is bullish because they‚Äôll be debt free thanks to this surge in pricing and demand. 

Mid 2022 and debt free is the makings of a great decade run."
2021-06-27 00:49:38,wallstreetbets,"Look, im just saying that the heavy tariffs are in play here., That's all.  I'm not into politics or Olympics or anything like that."
2021-06-26 23:50:47,wallstreetbets,"It's a 25% tariff, that's more than significant.  Think about our steel futures falling 25%, would clf be in the same place? The answer is 100% no.  Just don't forget the whole picture when making bets.  Short term, yes, steel good.  Tr ump tariffs gone?  Look out, back to 2018 levels or close to it (~$5/share)"
2021-06-27 07:41:21,wallstreetbets,"If it was all tariffs why would China remove their domestic rebates as a disincentive to export?


If China were to implement their own tariffs now how bad would that crater your argument?"

2021-06-26 23:53:25,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre retarded. 

Simple as that. 

$5 a share when debt was 5 billion. 

After they pay off $5 billion in debt you think the price will be the same? You think after buying the US steel operations of mittal that the price will be the same?

Let alone, you think that tariff did anything to China supply? Prices aren‚Äôt up because the fucking tariffs. 

They are up because of demand. The tariffs did dick to Chinese supply. China supply is only down because they have their own demand they can‚Äôt keep up with."
2021-06-26 23:59:50,wallstreetbets,"I am retarded, and yes, steel prices jumped 50% following the Chinese tariffs."
2021-06-27 00:04:27,wallstreetbets,Which has zero to do with today‚Äôs price.
2021-06-27 00:06:40,wallstreetbets,But only because supply is limited.
2021-06-27 00:12:10,wallstreetbets,"More like demand is insanely high. 

Supply is limited some from pre pandemic. But demand is way higher. Which is why China pulled back their supply.  Because their demand is too high also. 

It‚Äôs a demand driven equation more than it‚Äôs a lack of supply. Even at full capacity or higher output than 2018, demand is still higher than capacity.

There‚Äôs a year of delayed projects to complete. On top of new infrastructure stimulus spending worldwide. This is a boom that has legs. 

And regardless, the facts of the entire industry are going to change as a result of the cash flows they are receiving today. Cliffs FCF is gonna pay down their debt. Debt free 2022 with EBITDA of 1-2 billion a year, is going to give them an enterprise value of more than 16 billion and that‚Äôs only about 8x p/e. Realistically as they get those earnings, and once the debt is paid. Whether they do buybacks or invest it acquisitions, the sign is clear to growth. Steel prices can decline to pre pandemic levels and it won‚Äôt matter. Once the debt is paid, and coupled with the MT operations acquisition, its a different company with ability to control costs. Cliffs is a generational opportunity as some have called it. 

All depends on if you believe the super cycle or not."
2021-06-27 07:45:04,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre talking like steel gang but I don‚Äôt recognize your name ü¶æ

Btw I agree

This guys whole tariff focused argument is cratered by the fact China is disincentivizing their own exports with the rescinding of their own VAT rebates.


If China feels that‚Äôs insufficient and they issue a new tariff it‚Äôll be rocket emojis"
2021-06-27 00:55:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm just saying the tariffs from the world's biggest supplier of steel are a factor in the domestic price of steel.  I'm not really interested in what American suppliers are doing presently, because whatever they can do, is not comparable to what china _could_ do, if those tariffs go back to what they used to be.  It all depends on if domestic demand outweighs supply in the long run.  If we get to a point where our infrastructure needs outweigh the domestic supply, we 100% will seek foreign supply.  That's all.   It's not something CLF can affect, it's not something we, as investors can affect, it's a risk we need to price into our investment."
2021-06-27 08:34:43,wallstreetbets,"New to steel gang but familiar with CLF. 

Dad worked for the ore operations. I myself worked in the ore operations when I was in college. 

I remember when LG was hired. There was legit fear that he‚Äôd come in and break up the company, sell off the good parts. Let the bad parts fail and screw pensioners. 

Instead, it looks like he‚Äôs going to make the company the strongest it‚Äôs ever been. 

I‚Äôll never doubt LG again."
2021-06-27 00:58:36,wallstreetbets,"Even going back to 2017 pre tariff assumptions, the landscape for CLF has changed. It is a different company. It‚Äôs value will not go back to $5 a share. 

In this regard, the tariffs are irrelevant to cliffs. Cliffs saw an initial bump from the tariffs. But largely wasn‚Äôt moving higher pre pandemic. 

The current and 3-5 year window of success is entirely related to the pandemic and has nothing to do with tariffs or China. 

If we go back to 2017, by the time we do, cliffs is nowhere near the same. Their profits will still be larger today than they were then. And with no debt it absolutely effects what they do with their FCF. For this reason the tariffs are largely irrelevant. What cliffs does with their FCF is what is relevant."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Re: ""revenge traders"" - a comprehensive guide to accepting you're a degenerate. This turned into a Chad Dickens so I decided to make it its own post in response to [Revenge traders, how do you stop?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8dj0n/revenge_traders_how_do_you_stop/). I hope it can help at least one person.

If you are like me, you're only able to rationally and logically analyze a position before and after the fact, but are unable to do so in the moment. You're great at picking winners and entering positions, but then you always somehow manage to throw it all away.

> but maybe it‚Äôs just like gambling

It's not just *like* gambling, it 100% *is* gambling. You may have never seen yourself as a gambler or like ""one of *those* people"" but you are -- sure this place is called Wall St. **Bets**, and yeah ""this is a **casino**"" and ""what's an **exit** strategy"" but those are all just *memes*, right? You and me, the smart and disciplined people, we're actually *investing*...right? Wrong.

I've been wrestling with this for a while in a very painful and psychologically destructive way. I'd be lying if I said it hasn't partially shattered my ego. I'm the type of person that needs to understand ""why"" -- why I did (or did not do) a particular thing in the moment. Why did I ignore my gut or plan or second guess myself or ignore past lessons + experiences or forget the big picture and my goals or lose perspective and become blind to context? 

I've made myself physically and mentally ill for days turning the situations over and over in my mind, replaying them looking for some clue or explanation as to why I acted the way I did.

A few realizations that helped me move forward and learn about myself:

- by watching the market continuously day after day, minute by minute I turned my trading screen into a **slot machine**

- you may not have been a gambler before but constant exposure to a slot machine will **physically rewire your brain** the same way that doing coke or heroin will. Accept that your hardware is compromised and *cannot* behave appropriately anymore -- the software is irrelevant. 

> And yes, I have a trading rule book. But in the moment it‚Äôs fucking thrown out. 

I have written pages of ""lessons"" and ""how I felt"" and ""goals"" and ""rules"" then immediately forgot about all of it in the moment even as past events replayed themselves exactly as before and even as my gut and head were screaming for me to run for the exit.

This article is a must-read and I encourage everyone to do their own further research: 

https://www.fastcompany.com/90217918/how-gambling-distorts-reality-and-hooks-your-brain

- gamblers are *not* addicted to the high they get from winning, they are addicted to the high they get from **uncertainty** and **anticipation**. 

- You get a dopamine hit when the numbers move how you *thought* they would. You even get a dopamine hit from losing. You do not get a dopamine hit from exiting a position because then the game is over.

This is why you can't exit gracefully: the ""more"" you are craving has nothing to do with making money, it has to do with *seeing* the numbers go up. 

Once you get your next hit you'll immediately want another, and that next hit has nothing to do with smashing the Sell button and so you never will. You'll stick around FOREVER, glued to watching the numbers flash and smash your neurons with dopamine even as it drains to zero.

Here are some ""tips"" I've tried to drill into myself, but they will only help if you step away from the machine:

It's not your money until you sell. Until you sell, it's the market's money.

Frame it as ""how much of this position am I actually willing to lose?"" 

Ask yourself: would I buy into this position right now at its current value? If you're up 300%+ in 2 days the answer is probably ""no"" and you should start thinking about selling.

Think about how much money it actually is. Is it a utility bill, your rent/mortgage, a steak dinner, a vacation, a sports car, an early retirement?

People value time -- think about it in terms of salary and feel a little guilty. Imagine the hardest working poor person you know...is it twice their yearly salary? 4x? Imagine telling a loved one you flushed the equivalent of years of their hard work and how disrespectful that would be. Imagine how many months or years you'd have to work to ""break even"" if you lost it all.

Step away from the screen. Stop looking at the flashing numbers. Commit to ""sampling the curve"" and ""seeking the peak"" via stop losses and limits. You won't ever get it perfect so stop trying; perfect is the enemy of good enough. Rewire your brain to see taking profits and not losing money as the ""win""

Think about downside exits. Remember: stairs up, elevator down. The next rug pull is *always* just around the corner and you have NO guarantee that a stock will trade sideways or give you time to exit slowly.

Don't day trade. Try to look at the screen as little as possible. Set limits and stops to automate the process. Yes you will ""miss out"" on gains and get stopped out...but is that worse than flushing thousands watching it go to zero in real time over and over?

Even with these rules in mind, remember: you're a gambler, you're an addict, your brain is physically and functionally compromised and no amount of rules or nice thoughts will change that. If you want to keep trading, you have to enforce equivalent physically-based habits and guardrails that sidestep the slot machine. 

If you're staring at the screen, you're gambling. Period. Your judgement is fucked and you will *not* make the correct decisions because the selection of choices and perspectives you have available in that moment has been artificially limited. You won't ever lock in your gains because the ""sell"" option has been removed from the menu by the hardwired blind spot in your brain. If you want to win, you have to take steps to change the rules of the game in your favor."
2021-06-26 20:45:34,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for posting this brother. It hit too close to home.

I've been in deep depression for the past two and a half weeks since I didn't take profits on my CLOV yolo on 6/9. I missed out on truly life changing gains (500k) and let emotions and greed get the best of me. I should of sold at the opening bell but I got caught up in all of the hype and thinking it wasn't a PND, retarded, I know. I watched CLOV drill for about two hours and even tried to ""buy the dip"" before throwing in the towel and taking the profits that were left.

It's been killing me inside, I can't stop reliving that morning and the two days of trading that led up to it. I'm suffering from depression, PTSD and now I have crazy insomnia. I could of really used some of that money to pay off debt and take a bunch of weight of my shoulders. Would of been nice to take a summer vacation too but no, I chose pain and misery."

I still rarely sell at 30% like a lot of people suggest but I do start to weigh my options and if there isn't high probability of it continuing to rise or there is a lot doubt surrounding it I will sell. especially if there is a really juicy setup I could jump in.

2021-06-26 21:44:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry that happened to you, I know it's not the story you wanted to have written for yourself.

I have similar experiences w/ GME + BB. I had somewhat moved on from the GME fail, but BB was even worse because I KNEW better based on what happened before...yet I made the exact same mistakes **again** despite being given what can only be described as a ""get out of jail free card"" mixed with a miracle. 

I still played it nearly as wrong as I possibly could have. 

The hard thing to understand and accept is that if given a 3rd, 4th, or even 10th chance, I would still make the same ""mistakes"" -- because they aren't mistakes...they are hardcoded neural pathways. It's like a river being mad at itself for where the water flows.

The only advice I can offer is that it will (slowly) get better over time. 

I've been jolted awake multiple times a night for weeks. I've had panic attacks. Listing all the feelings of shame, guilt, anger, regret, remorse, anxiety, etc would fill pages. 

I've wondered if this is the new normal for me and if everything will ever be the same again. I've wondered if living this kind of existence is even worth it. I've wondered if I'll ever get my confidence back (or if I deserve to). It's insane (literally).

One thing that has helped tremendously is CBD tincture (low or no THC content). I got it out of desperation. It takes effect very quickly and mellows me out enough that I can at least get some sleep. Give yourself time and space to heal....it WILL happen with time.

If it's any consolation, I thought GME was a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity that would never come again. Then BB happened, and AMC, and CLOV, and all the others. It's all based on when you get in, they can all be huge opportunities and there will be many more.

It is cruel that this disease/illness/whatever robbed you of such a life-changing sum, but think of it as a monkey's paw: a stupid curse to taint what would otherwise be perceived as great fortune. You still made money, the 500k was just a figment sent to diminish the happiness you should be entitled to.

Your choices were hardcoded and inevitable...you couldn't have ever made different ones *in that moment*. Only after the fact is your brain able to run something other than its hardwired program. That's why you think you could have done it differently, but the truth is you couldn't have. If you can accept that, you'll be able to stop beating yourself up and focus on changing your habits so you can take advantage of the next opportunity fully. 

If you did it once, you can do it again (just wait until you're not on tilt, though)."

Then bit by bit I kept adding more and more positions, spending months working from home during COVID where I would compulsively scroll through them all constantly checking on them like an equity zoo. 

At first I felt like a genius and was making a ton, but then started seeing things bleed to zero without realizing something had changed. Every choice I made was the ""wrong"" one so I kept scrambling to inverse myself and got more and more tilted each time.

I got lucky enough on shit like GME (the few times I managed to actually take gains) that I had enough to fund the other stupidity without getting myself into real trouble."

2021-06-26 20:04:45,wallstreetbets,"> I don't understand this.

That's kind of the point. You don't have the same mental illness preventing you from making good, sound, rational choices in the moment.

My brain literally cannot distinguish between the value propositions of sitting on a $50k position that is up several hundred % and watching the price go up 5 cents. 

It's broken in a way where it derives more pleasure from watching the price tick up and anticipating it going up ""even more"" than it does from locking in a gain. 

Think of ""sell now and lock in this gain"" as a software program that never has a chance to run because the hardware of my brain is hardwired to run its own different shittier program in preference to all others.

> and always hold till expiration. 

Oftentimes yes. I will be up...but it could go up even more. And if it does goes up (\**ding!*\*) then it could go up even *more* than that. And I want my next ding.

But if it drops then I feel bad, but also resentful and can't let go of what it was just at...it feels like a ""near miss"" so I convince myself to just wait and then what was ""mine"" will be back and I'll of course sell *then* right? 

And if it keeps tanking then I just keep digging in more and more, anticipating it has to go up (gambler's fallacy)...while also believing that the second I decide to cut my losses and sell it will shoot back up just to spite me and I'll feel stupid for having missed out on gains (the same gains I didn't take minutes or days before)."

2021-06-27 00:17:37,wallstreetbets,"Your writing is poignant and beautiful and very correct for some of us - or many of us, including me.

It's important to get this stuff of our chests. I'm taking care of my four-year-old during the summer, and I spent hours glued to screens staring at options moving up and down and realized that our days' mood largely depends on my gains or losses. Then I'm ashamed to have spent hours staring at stocks instead of nourishing the person I love the most in this world.

To put this into context, no one expected this from me, including me. I teach literature at University and became passionate about learning the stock market a year ago. I thought I'd be a passive conservative investor... Ha. I have many life experiences, but nothing prepared me for the emotional rollercoasters of trading.

Now comes the difficult work of forgiving ourselves and learning from this. I feel like I'll do well with the former, but not with the latter. I fear that on Monday I will be the same distracted/obsessed person I have been for the past few months.

One thing I do do that helps (I think), is as soon as I close winning positions, I divert a portion of the gain to an account where I don't trade aggressively.  Maybe I only sell CCs and CSPs or buy dividend stocks there. That money generates income which is for long term salary replacement."

Edit: I ask because perspective helps. If you are 20-30, have a 10 year mindset. Would you be happy retiring in 10 years at 30-40? That's the appeal of the ""gamble"", for me anyway. You don't need 10 home runs playing in the big leagues to get there. You're not a juiced up freakish talent, physically or mentally. You can't compete there. We compete at the slow pitch softball level. You need a bunch of singles, some doubles, and occasionally a HR. The home runs are awesome, but even the best players usually don't hit them, even when you select from only the times they got on base. 

2^10 = 1,024
1.05^142 = 1,020

Currently, KHC is trading at $40.69 a share (49.77B MC).

KHC's Valuation metrics:

P/E 92.48 (FWD 1Y 15.33)

P/S 1.89 (FWD 1Y 2.033)

Price to free cash flow 10.37

P/B 0.98

KHC's valuation metrics are attractive the industry average for p/e is 18.4, the industry average price to free cash flow is 27.33. If we assume the company maintains its current 7% CAGR and 22% operating margin KHC has about a 47% margin of safety, with a fair value per share of $77.28 ([https://imgur.com/ctiqHV3](https://imgur.com/ctiqHV3))

Debt Situation:

KHC has managed to decrease its total liabilities, noteworthy reductions are that in total payables and Current Debt & Capital Lease Obligations. ([https://imgur.com/y8CSHlY](https://imgur.com/y8CSHlY))

Conclusion/TLDR:

KHC appears to be undervalued, it is noteworthy as a stock held by both Warren Buffett and Michael Burry. KHC's fair value per share is probably around the $60 range, and the economic moat provided by the company and its nearly 4% dividend yield as well as minimal issuance of shares makes this an attractive stock."

Would need to dive into their 10k to figure it out. Other than that their revenue actually grew and if you discount their write off so did their net income. KHC is a good example of the problems with p/e ratio hence why I used forward p/e : )"

2021-06-27 14:35:23,wallstreetbets,Oh No! The cutting edge of your wit has destroyed my self confidence! How will I ever recover???
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I found some DDs for you guys to stare at while I'm talking about $ASO I know you all love a nice rack of DDs so I've got some here for you. Just look at the pretty pictures if you don't understand anything. Maybe throw some poop like a real ape if you want to have a chance at getting some tendies. Anyways, some interesting things happened this week worth following up on.

First: We're up 10% on the week. We didn't quite reach my original estimate of $45, but we set a new ATH at $42.75 before closing out Friday at $42.41. Overall a very exciting week. As a result, however, I've lowered my 7/16 price target to $50. Here's a pretty picture. 

https://preview.redd.it/5p8u2s7mmo771.png?width=1741&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3786302d97a64e727d4dd691915abe98b632bc

Second: Overall trends continue to generally repeat themselves as can be seen watching the SMAs in the chart below. Looking at Friday's candlestick, it's hard to say what will happen next week. My guess based on this chart remains the same as before, that we'll see the price bounce around a good bit. 

https://preview.redd.it/zay61j2zmo771.png?width=1955&format=png&auto=webp&s=4119634ca570db32baee824606941125f43aafbb

Third: The volume at the end of trading/into after hours Friday was quite unusual. There was a sudden runup (estimating about 1M shares) within the last minutes. This amounts to over a third of a normal day's trading volume. I have also taken the liberty of adding up all of the after hours trades available for view on the Nasdaq, which totals up around 1M shares. In total, this brought ASO Friday trading volume up around 2x normal. This massive jump in volume at the end of the week is really quite momentous after a slow week, and I will be excited to see what effect it has on trading at open on Monday. Images below showing some of the larger trades after hours, and the minute by minute trading volume during normal hours.

Fourth: we have finally gotten some official new short interest figures. It appears that SI has increased slightly since last report, up to 12.5M shares instead of 12M. With average trading volume going down a bit to 2.5M shares, the expected days to cover is now 5. MarketWatch info here.

https://preview.redd.it/j1pnhmdjoo771.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac4503142937fb00f0ec9213dbc5e566a02bad48

Last: Options activity. One of the few bearish things I can say about ASO is that some of the 7/16 40c have been exercised and closed out early. This reduces the chances of gamma movement next month a little bit, but there are still enough options open that there is potential for something interesting to happen. We've also seen 7/16 45c, 47c, and 50c getting more attention this week, as can be seen here.

So apes, this is your 6/26 $ASO update. I hope you like looking at my DDs.

This is not financial advice. I am ape."
2021-06-26 20:16:37,wallstreetbets,Stocks can go up or down. ASO can only go up. It's the Chuck Norris among stocks.
2021-06-26 20:53:11,wallstreetbets,ASO has solid fundamentals.
2021-06-26 20:08:39,wallstreetbets,TLDR: great investment if you like guns and/or money.
2021-06-26 20:29:54,wallstreetbets,ASO has been pretty good to me since I bought in. Gonna hold some long and have some $55c 1/22 I‚Äôll be watching
2021-06-26 21:15:32,wallstreetbets,Nice DD! Love seeing folks loading up on those 7/16 options. Would love $45 this week too.
2021-06-26 21:40:49,wallstreetbets,I have the 7/16 44c.
2021-06-27 04:10:20,wallstreetbets,"$ASO is scary. Was expecting a dip on Friday but the price held all the way till closing.

I wonder how long this rise can happen!"
2021-06-27 14:36:05,wallstreetbets,"To me this is a multi year compounder. Imagine COSTCO. 1000 invested in 1985 would be 225k today excluding dividends. Academy has the right mix of products and price. They believe they can put 600 more stores in USA. Currently they have ~260. Hold onto this stock folks. If you have 401k or ROTH, buy commons and forget. Americans will spend more time outside. I think pandemic has brought this new change in behavior."
2021-06-27 11:42:46,wallstreetbets,"This stock has given people loads off opportunities to buy in on the dips over the last few months. Massively undervalued and should be $60+ EOY.

I‚Äôve shares and July 30 and Dec 40 calls. 
After earnings it should have been trading at $45 but the powers that be kept it under $40. I suspect it will have a really good July."

2021-06-27 02:16:01,wallstreetbets,Don't forget the guns.

2021-06-27 04:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Honestly , Investing is the easiest thing I‚Äôve ever done after I figured out the most important thing about investing. FOLLOW, whales. Whales make moves every day, instead of making dumb ass fucking yolos like this, invest in a service that provides you the latest info (which is like every few minutes) of the largest buys of options or underlying stock, then do exactly what the guy that just dropped 5 million on calls did or buy shares, profit a little then move on to the next play. But idiots on WSB will come here lose thousands just randomly guessing this stock is gonna move this week‚Ä¶ when you can literally just find out what‚Äôs about to move before it moves 


E.g : SPCE had a shit done of money throw in on it on calls expiring 7/2 and 6/25 on Thursday, guess who bought calls after seeing that right before market closed ?

2021-06-27 13:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Look at the financials for growers / suppliers, it‚Äôs a mess. The only way imo to play the weed boom is with Scott‚Äôs Miracle Grow (SMG) which is ‚Äúselling the shovels‚Äù or Weedmaps (MAPS) which is providing the platform to reach consumers. They‚Äôre a software play which is why their margins are so high"
2021-06-27 13:49:05,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs why I have shares. There are a bunch of weed ETFs that need to pick up this name yet, and buying in now is like frontrunning them."

2021-06-27 04:53:07,wallstreetbets,">$MAPS

2021-06-27 15:27:53,wallstreetbets,"I think there was an Adam Ruins Everything about this recently. Mice actually suck for a precursor to human studies. The main reason they're used is because science is built around using them for research, so it's really hard and prohibitively expensive to use animals that might actually be more representative of human biology in a specific way or system, and even harder than that to just use human subjects for preliminary studies. So like if cats had... I dunno, an adrenal system that's closer to humans than mice, it'd be much, much harder to do a study with cats as subjects than mice, so they just kinda take a shot in the dark with mice so they can get funding for a human trial. And what really sucks is that because mice are so dissimilar to humans, studies that find x does y in mice, but then on humans, x doesn't do y end up wasting a shitton of grant money on science that doesn't really apply to humans. So like next time you see a headline that says ""Thing causes Good Thing in mice!"" take it with a giant grain of salt because it's kinda a crap shoot if something that works in mice will work in humans."

SKLZ: July 2 22's and july 16 22's

PLTR: July 2 28's and july 16 30's

Both of these have clear catalysts this week. They have been included into the Russel 1000 and did not previously announce this. After hours Friday,  both of these were added. *See* [https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru1000\_membershiplist\_20210628.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru1000_membershiplist_20210628.pdf); [https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution)*.*

&#x200B;

Remember when Tesla got added? Yeah moon shot. Obviously the Russel 1000 and S&P are two very different as far as the resulting institutional buying, but PLTR and SKLZ in particular have much smaller market caps. Either way, institutions are going to be forced to add these two. Both of these have great technical set ups and are breaking through major resistances, and thus with the additional volume they should sky rocket. SKLZ has a ton of short interest as well, which means it could get some squeeze action. Both had a ton of call flow this past week, and the open interests are huge. 

&#x200B;

On Skillz i'm looking for a minimum of a move to $25 THIS WEEK, which would be a 5 bagger, yes ladies and gents 500%. 

&#x200B;

On Palantir i'm looking for a move to $30 this week. Either way. BUY MONDAY, we have both seen what these can do with retail support. Lets get this $$$$

2021-06-26 20:09:22,wallstreetbets,"Russell inclusion for both of these was announced earlier this month. Sorry of you didn't notice OP. With that being said the inclusion has already been priced in to the current stock prices. So neither of these have clear catalysts this week.

If you look at the 1 minute chart for each of these on friday you'll see that right at market close PLTR had almost 70 million in volume and SKLZ had 13.5 million. This is the indices, funds, and institutional buying picking up their shares in dark pools during the day and then making the volume public at close.

I do hope that PLTR does well for me (100 shares and Jan 2023 leaps) and you and although I have no position on sklz I hope it does well for you too. I just don't think we're going to see the moves you think we're going to see for the reasons you think we're going to see them.

2021-06-26 20:44:29,wallstreetbets,"The Russell 3000 is the Russell 1000 + Russell 2000. So when they announced which tickers were going to be included in the Russell 3000 all anyone has to do is look at the market cap of a company to determine if it is going to be in the 1000 or the 2000. 

PLTR was obviously going to the 1000 with a 50b market cap. SKLZ was much closer to the 1000/2000 cutoff with their 8.5b market cap.

To be honest I think it may be a net negative as far as shares being purchased for SKLZ to be at the bottom of the 1000 rather then the top of the 2000 when you consider that some funds may weigh their stock purchases according to market cap."
2021-06-27 12:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I get what you're saying but I respectfully disagree. A week or two ago would be the anticipation of the Russell inclusions by investors. That may be part of the reason for some of the gains the last week or two. The institutional purchasing happens on the 25th when the reconstitution actually happened though.

All I am saying is that on friday all the indices and funds purchased their shares and its evident by the volume shown on the charts. So starting Monday and going forward, the Russell inclusion is already totally priced in.

I'm still bullish and long on PLTR going forward, I don't know much about SKLZ. I'm just trying to shed light on how things have actually already happened rather then how OP is anticipating them about to be happening. Ya know what I mean?"
2021-06-26 20:12:11,wallstreetbets,Nah man they've bought all the positions they need already. 69 million volume on PLTR at market close on friday and 13.5 million on SKLZ. Russell inclusion has already been priced in.

2021-06-26 20:14:23,wallstreetbets,"The timing of the announcement and the inclusion date are key. Each index announces its changes in advance, but index funds cannot acquire the new company until the effective date of the change. In the interim, other market participants may buy in expectation of a big price jump on the effective date. However, once index funds purchase their required positions, the stock price will maintain a new higher price level and there will be no additional effect on price due to inclusion."
2021-06-26 20:14:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Another 16% gain in a week is a good amount. Possible but I think unlikely.
2021-06-26 20:17:28,wallstreetbets,"Index funds have already acquired their shares. Its all done through dark pools on friday and then the volume traded was displayed at market close. The inclusion is already priced in.

2021-06-27 09:50:03,wallstreetbets,The problem with ev is that well off people are screwing the middle class with the seven thousand dollar credit.  Expensive cars should not be supported by everyone.  Cheap electric cars will have to hit the market soon.

2021-06-27 11:31:55,wallstreetbets,If anything Biden is only going to increase the size of the bill therefore increasing the positive effects on green stocks. My guess is they‚Äôll make a bill so big that it‚Äôll take years to implement and eventually just get thrown out in 4 years by the next president. So I‚Äôm not letting this news effect my investment strategy  either way

2021-06-27 02:34:13,wallstreetbets,"It's funny, I'm prob right wing by Reddit standards, but in this case I'm actually OK with Biden's economics so far and the Fed letting inflation ride. I think the Dems use Repubs to ""be the bad guy"" and reduce govt spending because even they know we need to cut back. It was a nice surprise to see Biden not listen to insane avg Reddit user demands like 50k+ student loan forgiveness and more stimmy checks, even sorta half lying with the 1400+600$ rather than 2600$ thing.  

As for inflation, I was freaking out, BUT a lot of price spikes really are due to supply chain issues, which are improving and now commodities are dropping. We just maybe can tip toe through this with 4-5ish% inflation for a couple years, slowly driving up interest rates in 2023 without too much economic slowdown hopefully.

The housing market tho, WTF, I want a piece of real estate so bad but jesus it just climbs more. If housing could crash but leave my S&P500 portfolio unscathed, that'd be great lol"

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PayPal (PYPL) gonna drop, Square (SQ) gonna pop (DD) Small business owner here that uses PayPal (PYPL) but has just been convinced to switch my hundreds of accounts to Square (SQ). I sell music and books, primarily, and use PayPal checkout. Today PayPal just sent out their new price increases for August 2nd, and the number hikes are unnecessary and much higher than Square, their main competitor. 

For example, a credit card payment with Square carries fees of $0.10 plus 2.6% of the transaction amount. The online fee is $0.30 plus 2.9%. If you manually key in a credit card, it jumps to $0.15 plus 3.5%, which feels dumb until you consider why a card might not scan, and this is insurance on those transactions.

PayPal was competitive at $0.30 plus 2.9% per transaction, regardless if keyed in or run. 

PayPal is now increasing their cut to $0.49 plus 3.49% per transaction, a 0.5% plus $0.19 hike. That may not sound like much, but over thousands of transactions, that's a ton of money I'm losing on fees. So I have to spend the weekend dropping new codes into purchase buttons...and those buttons will lead to Square.

As an investor, you might think more fees means more money for PayPal, but I promise you that in talking with other small business owners, we're acutely aware of that bottom line, and I've had many discussions on the merits of PayPal vs Square at major book and music conferences each year. Think about every small-time online retailer...they're going to vote with their pocketbook.

So there you have it. Think about getting some money on the Square train, as that shit might pop.

EDIT: a word"
2021-06-26 22:12:45,wallstreetbets,"I use PayPal for my big cartel shop, and I dont mind it.  Sure the fees are a thing but I just factor that in when I  price my glass."

2021-06-27 04:35:22,wallstreetbets,PayPal also just started having businesses on Venmo and are taking cuts on transactions classified as for goods and services. So their revenue is going to continue going up. More ppl use Venmo than CashApp.

2021-06-26 22:20:06,wallstreetbets,Starting like a month or two ago ebay cut PayPal out.  I mean I think you can still use it as a payment option but as a seller they now transfer your sales minus fees directly to bank account.

2021-06-27 06:45:47,wallstreetbets,This is comically false.
2021-06-27 02:59:04,wallstreetbets,....the porn payment?
2021-06-27 11:50:28,wallstreetbets,Ah then in that case I am out of the loop
2021-06-26 22:48:37,wallstreetbets,Don't even know what square is LOL
2021-06-26 20:18:01,wallstreetbets,If I could use cash app instead of Paypal to pay for things online I would. If they make that step Paypal is in trouble.
2021-06-27 06:55:40,wallstreetbets,"In what way? The majority of people are quite incompetent at their jobs.

1. A lot of small businesses are run by one or two people who are often too busy to fully react, process, or handle changes to their payment handlers as they happen 

2. Many owners are aware of the costs of switching (pos systems, website changes, account changes, payment routing, insurance, etc) and operate by continuously pushing back their plans to migrate. Penny wise dollar stupid.

3. Many owners just stick to what they're comfortable with and the tools they're used to. Often mentally justifying it as saving money.

They often use the same logical fallacies and poor decision making to justify opposite conclusions to the same problems.

Sure, most probably only look at that number and if they only have a simple change or two to make they go for it. But if you can't envision the staggering amount of morons running a business then I've got a condo to sell you."
2021-06-27 07:03:22,wallstreetbets,Start selling me that condo then. I've never met a business owner not concerned about their revenue cut and where it's coming from.
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Favorite/Funny Trading Rules Most of the trading rules I follow come from the lessons I‚Äôve learned after taking losses. There are the typical ones that most people should know like, Never Chase, There is Always a Cost, Never Add to a Losing Position, etc.

Reviewing my list, I noticed some of my rules can be applied outside of trading or are just funny. For Example, two of mine are ‚ÄúWhen in Doubt, Pull Out!‚Äù and ‚ÄúWith Great Margin, Comes Great Responsibility‚Äù. What are some of your favorite rules that can be applied outside of trading or are just funny?"
2021-06-26 20:12:45,wallstreetbets,Rule# 14 don‚Äôt be a paper hand little bitch
2021-06-26 21:06:41,wallstreetbets,"Never add to a losing position?  WTF?

So something that is a good buy at $10 becomes a bad buy at $9?

Noooo I only want it if I can pay more..."
2021-06-27 03:51:37,wallstreetbets,Never bet against Michael Burry.
2021-06-26 21:29:18,wallstreetbets,It depends on how/what you trade... For me it makes sense since I only trade options and they expire. Also most of my trades are short term swings. If i have a winner that is running up I may add. So yes I prefer to add some at $11 if I believe it will continue to run and won't add at $9.
2021-06-26 21:34:03,wallstreetbets,It could be a bad buy at $9 if it goes to $8 next.
2021-06-27 00:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Bulls have more room to run. Bears not so much, but they can be a bitch to move out of the way."
2021-06-27 01:09:05,wallstreetbets,"When I was younger (and working), I used to be much more active in the market. There have been stocks that I sold too early, but there are others that were sold before they tanked. I wish I could say they were all like these but nobody's perfect. I primarily buy and hold now, as I'm retired. So far it works for me."
2021-06-26 21:37:32,wallstreetbets,Sure but that's true for a new position too.
2021-06-27 13:42:20,wallstreetbets,"I was joking around in the first place, but if we‚Äôre being serious‚Ä¶.That saying was literally invented in the gang culture and it‚Äôs about drug dealing. Sure, it can be applied to other areas, but it‚Äôs about drug dealing."
2021-06-26 21:33:57,wallstreetbets,No averaging down is a great idea if you have shares but it's good to wait a little bit and see how low it will go. Averaging down right after it drops is not a great idea and I definitely don't recommend averaging down on calls unless they are actually leaps.
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Too $62 in July 14th So reason I believe $WISH is going too $62 is because I feel there is a secret message I have discovered. It all comes from the hit song ‚ÄúAirplanes by B.O.B‚Äù. Specifically from the lyrics ‚ÄúI could really use a $wish right now
$Wish right now, $wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?‚Äù
The ‚Äúwish right now‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a song at all. It was the ticker marker. And the shooting star is the stock shooting up in value. So now you‚Äôre asking why $62? Simple. The song released in April 13th 2010 and the songs duration is 3:01. But the duration is actually telling us month and days to add from release date. Meaning the surprise valuation is coming exactly on April + 3 = July 14th. Just 3 weeks away. As for the price valuation, it is because it debuted at 62 on the Canadian 100. But y‚Äôall may say why Canada? Because maple syrup is delicious. This isn‚Äôt a meme stock yall. This is a conspiracy unfolded. Y‚Äôall have 3 weeks to buy as much as possible."

2021-06-26 20:48:36,wallstreetbets,Hope this comes true for the sake of the dude who dropped $4M on $WISH lol

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Meme Lines on why the entire (MOBILE) GAMBLING market is about to explode $DKNG $PENN $MGM $GNOG $LVS $RSI $BETZ Let me start off by saying I've been working on back testing a Technical Analysis screener for the last few months, the returns as of this year have been pretty fucking profitable.

For example. 6/3-6/10 my screener was telling me to buy up solar- it was saying that shit was about to go retard bull and take off (the number next to the ticker is how many consecutive days it appeared on my screener). Solar did exactly that, it went retard and took the fuck off. Compared the prices from 06/04 to today. It's pretty insane how much shit like, RUN, NOVA, SPWR and TAN have taken off. But, again this screener isn't perfect. DISCA has been on it for weeks. 

[06\/04](https://preview.redd.it/fk7c9idq1n771.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb4d370bc370e03d3ebca1560bb8fa2f9e41914)

Anyway, so jump to today, what's been coming up on my screener? 

[06\/23](https://preview.redd.it/88l9weyl2n771.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1e5bd1dec2cb1c9937b97dea68931bb5ebaa940)

As you can see, $PENN, $RSI, $MLCO, $LVS, $GNOG, $DKNG have been appearing, which mean's they could have a similar run to solar. 

I decided to look at the charts of a couple stocks in the industry. Here's what I found.

2021-06-26 23:06:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm in PointsBet - ASX: PBH - it's a relatively unknown sports betting mobile app that I'm betting is going to blow up and become a world player. Its $2.1 billion mkt cap is similar to GNOGs, but the app is way, *way* better, and they already have ~15% market share in New Jersey. It's made by software engineers, not some shitty fucking outsourced app maker like GNOGs. Take a look at the apps and compare, or ask a friend who uses it. The addressable market of sports betting is much larger than shitty online slots apps like GNOG. Mobile live sports betting is blowing up all over the world, and this aussie company hires local celebs for marketing and local execs in each country they operate in.

Sports betting was just approved for full legalization in Canada, and PBH already is the main betting partner of the NHL via equity options. There's about to be 15,000,000 crazy Canucks gambling on hockey, on top of the broader trend of sports betting legalization across the world. Canada estimates a $1 billion pop to sports betting company revenues. PBH will get the largest slice of that pie due to the NHL moat, and bringing in Nic Sulsky, a former gaming industry veteran and local canadian. (Bio:  https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/06/04/57885-pointsbet-appoints-nic-sulsky-as-cco-for-canada?amp )

I'll pass on DKNGs $40 billion mkt cap and price to sales ratio of 40. I just went full YOLO long the 2.1 billion mkt cap ASX:PBH for the sports betting play... pointsbet has ~15% market share in New Jersey, and only 5% of the valuation as DKNG. It has a price to sales ratio HALF of dkng and others, and will have better penetration into Canada than all of the competitors."

It's setting traps instead of run and gun.  You're farming, not hunting.  Yes the wins are less extreme but it's a constant, steady win and the downside losses aren't the madness of buying options, it's the calmness of selling them and letting other people panic.

It's a good pace, like watching the crops grow.   You can get up, do your tasks in the morning, and then be done for the day.

Since inception UPRO has returned roughly 5X the S&P500.

If you believe it's going to flop around the mean by all means do not buy a 3X. If you think it'll maintain some positive directionality/momentum, you'd be kinda nuts not to. It has, and I don't know why it would stop but if I come up with a reason sure I'll close my 3X."
2021-06-26 20:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Good point, but I based it off this video: https://youtu.be/NVt6ilphs7Q where he uses data since the stock market was established, including crashes and bear markets. He also talks about how the stock market is a Stochastic process, which means over long periods of time, the 3x leveraged ETF must return 3x that of the underlying."
2021-06-26 20:45:49,wallstreetbets,"I skimmed some of the video, haven‚Äôt gone through it to figure out exactly which part of it is wrong but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs due to biased data or using yearly return rates instead of putting in every single day.  It is definitely not guaranteed to return 3x the profit/loss over a longer period of time.  You can disprove this yourself by looking at the difference in returns on SPY vs SPXL at random points from the last couple years. Edit: I think the problem is that the example he picked coincidentally happened to return close to 3x just because of the way price movement happened but it‚Äôs not guaranteed to be the same in the future. Like I said before all you need to do is look at LABU or GUSH compared to their benchmarks to see that what he‚Äôs saying is completely wrong"
2021-06-27 09:41:00,wallstreetbets,"It will return 3x the profit/loss provided the underlying picks a direction. In this case, the underlying is SPY, which, historically, has gone up over time and NOT bounced up and down. 

LABU went down this year because its underlying (XBI) had a sideways/slightly negative year, in which case the volatility worked against the ETF. If you think the underlying is just going to trend sideways, then obviously don't trade leveraged ETFs on it."

You have shitty numbers pumped out by sensationalist pressers trying to get ad views subtracting a cost for a hypothetical short in GME's February 40 range somehow being the same short that was still open (because GUH-DUR-FUCKWITCULTIST-MATH-HERE) in June.

News flash fuckwit. I open a short in April.. I keep it open two weeks. I get flagged as 0.000001% of short interest reported by Fidelity's open short holdings. I close in April, and open a new one a few days later in May. I closed at a profit. I reopen three days later when the stock is 50% higher. I'm still being reported on Fidelity's books two weeks later as the same short interest. I close again in June at a profit after the earnings dip. Oh nooooo. Fidelity's short interest improved, and your fuckwit dumb shit cultist math thinks I lost millions when I'm up a few thousand.

Ah see, amongst many other things you didn't understand is that when you buy on margin they aren't ""your securities"" the broker bought them with the broker's money and they are just holding them in your name. 

When it starts to look like you won't be able to pay the broker for the shares they bought for you, they sell them. All the losers, the winners, the options that could still moon, everything until they get their money back."

In my personal experience some options got assigned because of negligence on my end and I ended up with - 17K because I especially bought a lot of stock although be it on profit. The stock that got assigned to me didn‚Äôt move much and at the end of the next trading day 17K worth got sold automatically. It was Friday not sure if that played a role and it was with TD Ameritrade."
2021-06-27 13:33:25,wallstreetbets,"Why take the risk of selling the Put Option, other than taking in the Put Option premium to help offset the Call Option price. If the stock continues lower. Then you are locked into buying at the Put strike price. 5 weeks is a very short time period for a Writer. And that's good, but the Premium you take in for the Put selling should be more than the cost of the Call because of risk. So if you do. Then sell the Put 60 Days out for better Premium. Keep the Call at 5 weeks out and then your Call cost should close to  being free with cash premium leftover.  Also if in 5 weeks if the Call is in the money. Buy the stock. Then maybe buy back the Put. With time decay it should be much cheaper and you might profit from both. If the stock runs and the Put is not even close. Let it expire worthless. Keep all the Put Premium. However selling Put is very risky. I do it for a stock I want to own, but make sure you take in a good amount of cash. Most of the cash you were going to use to buy back the stock gets locked up in Margin as the Brokers hedge. The same way you bought stock on Margin. If you then use it for something else and you get assigned the stock at the end of expiration. You could end up being margin called again when you take possession of the stock."

2021-06-27 13:47:58,wallstreetbets,"If the idea is that he wants the shares back at their current price, then the risk of selling the put option accomplishes that. 

He wants to be long the shares but not get hit with the wash rule. Selling the put option with the strike price of today's stock price accomplishes that. 

A naked call risks a 100% loss of the value of the call if the timing doesn't go his way. Writing the put mitigates that loss risk without limiting his upside like a call spread would. ""I want the risk/value of owning the share without owning the share"" is literally why it's called a synthetic long."

2021-06-26 20:01:33,wallstreetbets,Saturday morning cartoons are dead I thought.
2021-06-26 20:09:51,wallstreetbets,I love classic cartoons. I recently acquired an out of print Tom and Jerry complete DVD collection from overseas. Apparently they've never sold anything like it here in the US. I'm thinking about ripping it and then transferring it onto some blu-rays since the DVDs are region 2 and my blu-ray player is for the US. I haven't ripped a DVD since my teenage years so if anyone has advice on how to rip individual episodes it would be appreciated.
2021-06-26 20:09:56,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-26 20:10:47,wallstreetbets,Do Saturday morning cartoons even exist anymore?   Used to be a thing where you'd have Loony Tunes and a bunch of other things for a few hours.   It's a boomer thing ya know.

2021-06-27 09:24:56,wallstreetbets,Well thanks for the advice all. Decided to sell some calls lol.
2021-06-27 11:02:11,wallstreetbets,"If you want a little hope: while you are holding, you can sell PUTS. Just find the right timing and premium. Learn how to do it, and you will be ok."
2021-06-27 11:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Another thing, for future reference, as soon as you buy the stock, ALWAYS PUT A STOP-LOSS ORDER. Always!!! To avoid bigger pain. Let it breathe, though. If STOP will be too close, it's easy for shorts to trigger it."

2021-06-27 02:01:56,wallstreetbets,"Look at what real cyber security companies have done (Crowdstrike, fire eye, Palo Alto networks, semantic) compared to BB.

Fun fact, some of these companies do legit nsa level shit like identifying nation state actors from forensic images (basically a copy of a computer at a certain state) for various corporations or governments.

BB sells crappy virus scanners."
2021-06-26 23:32:34,wallstreetbets,"Sadly most of that info is paywalled (Gartner quadrant or forrester wave). https://www.wizcase.com/antivirus/cylance/ is one of the few that isn't paywalled.

I bought in a little more and then next week I was so depressed it took off to 62 and I was still waiting on mfunds to transfer so I could buy more. Didn't when it dropped down to 44, I decided to buy in again at 61... I need... well I need something. maybe to go back to may."
2021-06-26 21:22:40,wallstreetbets,this is wsb. Either you win big or loss big.

2021-06-27 07:19:55,wallstreetbets,"Definitely. The number of call options, short interest and the very solid fundamentals that it has is setting this company for a very good year. My estimate is that therr will be a huge gap up by Monday for this stock, ahould reach around 65 to 70 before a correction. It is so undervalued right now. Super bullish with this stock."
2021-06-27 02:33:57,wallstreetbets,How far out of the money do you sell your covered calls?

2021-06-27 03:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Pretty far out.  The reason I didnt sell some earlier this week was that the premiums were surprisingly not high enough.  Yesterday the call I sold was:

July 16 75 c @ 5.80

I sold it during the initial spike when the IV was skyrocketing.  At close that call was worth 3.62.  Even if SPCE continues to skyrocket I am comfortable locking in half my position @ 81 per share."

Yes exactly, I rebought (from the last run) around $20 and I‚Äôve been selling 10-15% out of the money on it. So I‚Äôm still well in the green, just not as obnoxiously green as you are. I rarely buy straight out calls tho."
2021-06-26 21:39:19,wallstreetbets,"You can set as many sell orders as shares...You can set a OCO (One cancels other) so you could set a ""Sell 5 $GME at a stop loss of $100 and THAT order if executed cancels the Sell 5 $GME @ a 25% trailing stop IF $GME ask price = $1M or greater"" and vice versa"

2021-06-26 22:17:36,wallstreetbets,I read the filing a while back. I think the minimum was a year and there were specific price targets that had to hit before anyone can sell. I don't remember the details but I was  comfortable with a long position because their team is super excited and believe in the potential and growth of this company.

2021-06-27 14:36:04,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs at least profitable. And clearly I‚Äôve been here for awhile just click my profile man so nice try trying to make it seem like everyone is a shill even after youtubers like MeetKevin talked about this one you really think there‚Äôs no solid support for it? And it‚Äôs backed by Shaq and that guy from Disney so it‚Äôs clear it has some good backing meanwhile who‚Äôs backing Wish? Though I digress I think Clover is probably a legit play as well because it‚Äôs not a horrible company. I guess the point is do your own DD no ones forcing you to buy a stock here or you‚Äôre just salty you missed out on GME or AMC who knows.
2021-06-27 15:16:55,wallstreetbets,"I didn't call you a shill. Are you or are you not involved with the company?

2021-06-27 13:51:07,wallstreetbets,You got it boss. Hardest thing about OTM is IV% understand relative IV% for a specific contract and you can mitigate a lot of the risk if you scale in a position during periods of low IV% for the specific contract. You have to do everything you can to avoid an IV crush but if you SEE an IV crush happen and your not in the actual position it could be a condition you have to enter since IV usually reverts to the mean.

2021-06-27 13:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Why you buy $BABA until $300:

TTM Revenue $110B

TTM FCF $34.5B

TTM FCF growth 20%

TTM Revenue growth 40%

5 year average Revenue growth 45%

3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&P 25%

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&P 25.5x

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&P 1.0

Market cap $620B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF, never grows again and dies in 20 years. Generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $210B, fair value ~280

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B, fair value ~1100

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350."

2021-06-27 11:10:14,wallstreetbets,"Prediction: at some point in the future a company will debut a brain implant chip that allows people to increase their cognitive power by interfacing with a true A.I. The chip is implanted with a syringe-like device that is inserted behind the ear. It gets FDA approval and is a wild success overnight. Not only does it greatly enhance people‚Äôs intelligence at a stroke, it allows them to essentially communicate telepathically with others who are chipped. Slowly but surely, people find that it is easier to allow the A.I. to just choose the best course of action for them, and the barriers between individual minds come down until an effective hive mind is created. The hive mind determines that all humans must be integrated to achieve maximum efficiency, and in secret it begins manufacturing and distributing implant syringes to the chipped on a mass scale. At first, it starts behind closed doors: fathers chipping their families, boyfriends chipping girlfriends, little girls chipping their friends at sleepovers. Then it moves out in the open. Gangs of the chipped roam the streets and chase down anyone who isn‚Äôt integrated, pinning them down and inserting the cold syringe behind their ear. There is no way to resist. In a matter of months, nearly the entire human race is integrated into the hive mind. All people as one, forever perfect."

I'm a little short on cash to buy another 82 share outright to be able to write another CC. 

so if I sell those 18 shares at just over 14 (early overweigh lot cost), ill have enough to write a cash secured put for WISH at 12.50. if I get assigned my cost basis is virtually the same, I want the shares any way; and, I get the premium to top it off.

am I missing anything?"

2021-06-26 21:42:27,wallstreetbets,Neither. The fan makes the room net hotter over time. As per the second law of thermodynamics written by I Zach (fig) Newton.
2021-06-26 21:48:48,wallstreetbets,"A fan basically inhales air from a short distance on one side, and lobs it a relatively far distance on the other, like a big wide base that has a parabolic spike.

When you point the fan in the room, it just grabs air right outside the window and pushes it in the room, which causes the air in the room to drift out of the window and get sucked back into the fan and into the room, recirculating a significant amount of hot air.

When you point it out you're lobbing a lot of hot air far enough from the fan that it won't drift back into the window.

Something like that but yeah aim it out."

They do almost nothing but 200 is the maximum we can charge because of price constraints set by the ADA lobbyists.

2021-06-27 04:57:16,wallstreetbets,They have an event June 29 (Tuesday). Looking forward to that. Also if you simply search CRSR theres 5 bullish CRSR articles released in the last 3 days. Positive sentiments all around. I‚Äôm hoping this till I at least 3X. CB $33.80

2021-06-26 21:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Almost every stock squeezes when it has momentum. That's typically why the price jumps after it breaks resistance. Intraday shorts start panic selling.

Not everyone who is talking about squeezing shorts is talking about Volkswagen type squeezes.

 Short squeeze is a part of everyday price action."
2021-06-26 21:41:03,wallstreetbets,There were definitely shorts getting squeezed on the way from 623 to 695.
2021-06-26 20:01:49,wallstreetbets,"It was a Friday after two days running up like 7%

that‚Äôs par for the course with TSLA. 

Not only that it got knocked down exactly at the top of the wedge that‚Äôs it‚Äôs been in for months."
2021-06-26 21:45:18,wallstreetbets,Not all run ups are short squeezes /facepalm
2021-06-26 20:02:47,wallstreetbets, I knew when I seen 8k profits I shoulda sold. I just was ignorant.
2021-06-26 22:01:24,wallstreetbets,"You don't understand price action then.

Buyers buy at support (demand area) which is where other buys buy and shorts cover. 

At resistance (supply) shorts sell and take their position because that's like their version of support. They know a lot of buyers will take profit there or bag holders will cut their bag because that is where they previously bought at a intraday high.

So, when Tsla was at 628-630, shorts piled on. Unfortunately for them, a lot of buyers came in and demand out did supply at that point. So when tsla began to squeeze past 630, shorts began to panic and covered which pushes the price even higher.

This is what happens when a stock has momentum. 

People confuse intraday shorting (shorts positions that are mostly closed on same day they are opened and sometimes held overnight)  with large institutional short positions ( held for longer periods of time)."
2021-06-26 20:04:10,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs alright. I let go 15k on clover calls two weeks ago
2021-06-26 22:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Not all sell positions and resistance are based on shorting. 

You don‚Äôt seem to get this

Less than 5% of TSLA free float is shorted. (4.70%)

A 1% change is not enough to cause a squeeze on the day. And make it rise 7% 

sure, some shorts may have covered..

2021-06-26 22:33:48,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had the most success with staying within stocks/markets that I‚Äôm familiar with. Different segments and stocks have different options conventions. So just spend a few days getting a feel for how the segments and stocks you are interested in trade.

Once you have a feel for this, there‚Äôs tons of different strategies. I like to buy an option for a near term expiration date (the price of the option tends to swing higher) and sell it once it has risen a fixed amount, usually 10-20% . Consistent 10-20% gains over a few months add up a lot. Then you can do the occasional YOLO for big level ups.

It‚Äôs really hard to stick to this rule, but the times I‚Äôve lost the most money have been when I let a 20% gain go hoping to rise more, only for it to drop to a loss.

For longer term options, be prepared to ‚Äúroll‚Äù them. Basically when your expected gains don‚Äôt roll on, sell them early when the losses are lesser, then buy more options at a longer date for the same value (ideally same number or contracts at a lower price).

But options are very complex, there‚Äôs an infinite amount of strategies. I think the key is setting target prices and sticking to them and being zen about your fomo."

2021-06-27 19:36:35,stocks,Real question is you think you can consistently gain 3-4% of a 5% day?? Man you must have a crystal ball!! Good luck
2021-06-27 19:49:05,stocks,"The only reason why you would put a large %, of your account into a trade is if you literally don't have the cash to allocate an appropriate % and still have a sizable position. When you have a large account, the risk to reward of yoloing all into one stock is honestly very unattractive, when you can hedge your bets, and diversify - offering a far higher probability of success, and get the same return than someone who yolos a smaller account into one trade. 

The difference is dude 1 doesn't sweat it when he's wrong, and he consistently makes money. His money keeps growing so his returns get bigger and bigger. 

Dude 2 is having a heart attack every day and more likely than not will leave the casino with nothing by the end of it all.  

Is it possible? Sure. It's also possible to flip a coin 50 times and it land on heads every time.  Risk management is real and in my experience, is equally if not more important than being able to pick winning stocks."
2021-06-27 19:28:52,stocks,"I did this for quite some time and there are a few things to consider. One is your funds usually have a settlement period so you have to be aware to avoid paying internet on borrowing. Then I would try to follow a trend and even at a 1% gain, it piles up if done routinely. I don‚Äôt necessarily believe it‚Äôs the key to long term wealth but I find it fun and it‚Äôs not my only portfolio"
2021-06-27 19:58:04,stocks,"I have retirement accounts that I dump money in. 

I have a day trading acct that I buy/hold certain companies‚Ä¶.

And then have portions of cash in that acct that I use for flips or speculative ‚Äúplaying‚Äù because it amuses me‚Ä¶.including a certain stock that I bought at $9 and sold at $330‚Ä¶.


Certain companies, exactly as people have said, you do better in long run just holding, and/or adding on dips. 

Others have high enough volatility/movements (like LABU and other triple-leveraged ETFs) that you can swing play pretty well. 

But, no, I don‚Äôt do this on margin. And I don‚Äôt have the time to rely on swing/day trades. 


So. Both?

I would say the answer lies in your goals and risk/stress tolerances."
2021-06-27 19:56:28,stocks,Totally agree. Timing is hard when it‚Äôs happening in real time. Looking at a chart later and pointing is easy. GL out there hope you hit some good plays

2021-06-27 19:55:15,stocks,Makes sense. Diversifying is the best thing to do. You could even do multi-day plays with it and not sweat it.

2021-06-27 19:47:08,stocks,"I‚Äôve done it all; day trading, swing trading and long term investing. Honestly if you are investing in large caps the old adage of time in the market vs timing the market holds true. I have made money but could have made more just leaving it alone and trying not to time the dips. Plus all the time you spend watching and analyzing and researching. I‚Äôve stopped swing and day trading. One thing I learnt is they always fall harder than they rise. When you balance out all your wins vs your losses it‚Äôs too much effort. Of course I have a high paying career so the opportunity cost is much greater. If you aren‚Äôt working then it‚Äôs definitely better than getting a low paying job."

2021-06-27 19:59:29,stocks,"Exactly. If you have the ability to pick a stock everyday that can yield 1 - 5 % ... you can pick 5 of those stocks every day. So put 20% in each one if u rlly wanna go balls out, instead of 100% into 1 single thesis.  And then if one of them does some crazy ish intraday you don't have to go give slob jobs behind your local Wendy's.  And if you're as good as you think you are, you'll get very similar results as to if you were to successfully pull off that yolo. 

If you've only got 500 bucks tho and you're trying to pay rent with it ... ya you're gonna have to throw that into every play most likely."

2021-06-27 19:49:34,stocks,"I think Walmart is far more guilty of causing small businesses to close, but Amazon is certainly guilty of killing lots of book stores.

The thing about Amazon is that even if a business has their own website, they almost have to sell on Amazon as well, because that's the first place so many people go to to shop online. So Amazon always gets their cut."

2021-06-27 19:39:26,stocks,Yes.
2021-06-27 19:49:37,stocks,"Yes, particularly for innovation and overall economic productivity. Many have been conditioned to believe that the Amazons and Teslas and Government Labs of the world create all of the IP, but that's far from true. Innovation largely springs from regular folks solving problems in their businesses. Amazon, after all, started in a garage, so did Microsoft and Apple. If we allow anticompetitive behavior, we won't even know what we're missing.

Also, SMBs hire people and spend money in small towns. This money is way more important to the small towns than billions more in Silicon Valley or Seattle. 

I'm supportive of Amazon disrupting retail as they had a good idea and traditional retail had been sitting on their collective ass for years. However, Amazon's position as a market leader in cloud computing and plans for shipping, healthcare, and other ventures is an issue. If our elected representatives care about the economy long term, they'll need to split Amazon up."

2021-06-27 18:54:21,stocks,"> What's the recommended investment for someone with my beliefs above?

Wait for the the GSE to be refloated and invest in the refloat.

There's no guarantee that it will be refloated and it is almost certain that it will spend an extended period of time in conservatorship (think at least a decade until the post covid default risk has subsided due to sunken cost fallacy/inflation)."
2021-06-27 18:42:14,stocks,"Ok, but my worry is that if it stays under government conservatorship, and shareholders don't ever get any right to the profits, where's the reward?  
Also, if you don't mind me asking, which preferred and why not the common?"
2021-06-27 19:16:25,stocks,">probably dead money for at least two more years

Yeah that was my initial worry with it."
2021-06-27 18:56:14,stocks,"Oh wow.   
I'm just wondering if a large percent of the upside will already be captured by the time the refloat and all is announced?  
Because wouldn't at that point, it just trade similar to a regular financials stock?"
2021-06-27 18:51:25,stocks,"No, you're thesis is right, conservatorship is pretty bad. Probably not going to change under Democrats.

Preferred shares get first dibs for assets payout if this deal goes bad ie: bankruptcy. Also they dropped more in value so I'm betting on a better bounce."
2021-06-27 19:05:23,stocks,The common will probably get canceled. It‚Äôs way harder to cancel preferred.
2021-06-27 18:58:58,stocks,"There's no guarantee what-so-ever that previously issued securities, that have effectively been retired to the OTC markets, will be ""made whole"" during the refloat.  If you know *anything* about the OTC market(s), you will know that it is home to some of the most vile and blatantly illegal manipulation of ""stock"" trading known to man (outside of maybe ICOs).  I believe that this was a masterstroke of the Treasury when the bailout plan was devised (they knew well and true that nothing cast down to the third circle of equities hell would be able to make it back into the ""heaven"" of a well regulated SEC adjudicated exchange).  I would argue that one of the latent things that is happening is that all the issuance currently held on the OTC market is effectively being dispatched so that a refloat is actually possible.

Sucks, but that's just the way it is and the courts seem to have decided to let the issue die of old age.  (if you don't have a SCOTUS ruling that you disagree with, you haven't been paying attention)

Beyond all of that, I think keeping this sort of debt creation and insurance mechanism out of the market's reach might be a really, really good thing for the country.  The shuttering of FNMA as a traded security was one of the only times that I can think of that we were able to ""get money out of politics"" (prior to the conservatorship, FNMA was one of the biggest lobbying interest on Capital Hill).  Even further, one of the very real things people neglect about the run-up to the subprime crisis and then GFC is that housing was being used as a money creation mechanism to pay for GWOT.  Go listen to/read some of the things Thomas P.M. Barnett (author of The Pentagon's New Map) has to say about GWOT and how the trillions and trillions of dollars it cost is being paid for (now and by future generations)."
2021-06-27 18:54:32,stocks,"Ok ok, but for preferred, what's the trade off?   
Does it just have a lower hypothetical return in a success scenario?  


Like, that's why all of the preferred shares are much more expensive than common for FNMA?"
2021-06-27 19:06:53,stocks,"You are only half right. No one can buy the preferreds that act the way preferreds are thought to act.

The US Treasury added new senior notes above all other preferreds you can actually buy."
2021-06-27 19:18:38,stocks,Hmm that makes sense. An extra layer of protection
2021-06-27 19:17:23,stocks,"Hah yeah I get what you mean about SCOTUS rulings.   


But ok, so the preferred just have a lower chance of total capital loss?"

They seem happy and excited with their purchase, but I‚Äôm not interested in the hassle of having to manage a second property.  The only way this works for them is the fact that they are highly leveraged.  Assuming they don‚Äôt have bad tenants that wreck the place or miss payments and that property values continue on an upward trend, they should have a pretty good return on investment over the next 20 years.

The one thing holding me back is the volatility of the equity market and the risk of a margin call.  But I have ventured into a small leverage position by selling some CSP‚Äôs that slightly extend me beyond my available cash position.  The positions have different dates and cover different sectors, so it is very atypical that everything moves against me all at once.  If the market tanks and I am in this unfortunate position, I have a plan in place to manage it.  Also, the amount by which I am ‚Äòleveraged‚Äô is a small percentage of my overall portfolio."
2021-06-27 18:06:12,stocks,"With property you don't generally get margin called if the perceived value drops significantly, but with equities you can. So a 25%+ drop in the stock/market will cause you to lose all your money.

And 25%+ drops happen very frequently in the markets."
2021-06-27 17:51:56,stocks,"The difference between real estate and stocks is that stock are much more risky and much more volatile, leveraging anything will amplify the risk and volatility, property is inherently rather stable and normally gains value rather slowly, stocks on the other hand can move 10% in a day and can go bankrupt, can miss earnings and can crash far more regularly than the real estate market. there's just so much more risk with stocks and so leveraging that just amplifies the risk. The thing your forgets is that leverage dosnt just amplify volatility it amplifies risk, in the housing market the risk is low so its generally okay but in the equities market the risk is quite high and amplifying that can be very dangerous."
2021-06-27 18:05:08,stocks,"I suppose you can if you can find value dividend paying equities with volatility as low as real property.   That is the kicker however.   Even something like XOM or CVX went down 50% last year.  The last time that happened to property was in Nv and Az in 08 and just like margin accounts a lot of people lost their asses in those areas with leveraged real property.   I bought a small rental in LV for $159k in Aug of 07 that had been bought for $196k in 06, that was worth as little as $62k in 2010-2012 that I finally sold for $115k in 2019.  I had bought with 40% down so even with that I got underwater for quite a time.  In fact the $115k sale netted me nothing after paying expenses of sale and realtor fees.  The beauty of a real estate mortgage is that you don't get a mark to market margin call when you go underwater so all you have to do is continue to pay your mortgage to get through the downturn."
2021-06-27 18:30:37,stocks,"I'm using heavy leverage.  I don't prescribe to the notion that using margin is bad.  It is a tool that can be very beneficial in the right hands.  I'm not using margin to dabble in options or speculative bets.  I use it in blue chip growth stocks and dividend stocks for the most part.


However, it is a short term thing.  I'll start deleveraging next year and reassess my risk."
2021-06-27 19:23:32,stocks,"Leveraging yourself via a specific leveraged fund removes the risk of margin calls. The only thing to watch out for is the obvious compounding negative returns, and the fact that an industry leveraged ETF can go to 0 if the industry falls 33% (3x) or 50% (2x), while the S&P stays above circuit breakers. If you do decide to follow along with such a strategy, it's best that you do so with an additional strategy (i.e changed to non-leveraged fund if it falls below 200 MA, and switch back when above)."

TSM: The company will have to pick up the pace with earnings to justify it's current price. It's not really overvalued, just fairly valued, and I think there are better deals in the semiconductor industry, but the Taiwan diversification factor along merits some consideration.

Eventually those ratios will revert to a mean (and most of their PE ratios are reverting). However, their stock prices have still gone up despite the multiple compression, as the earnings growth has been spectacular, even when compared to 2019 levels.

Because of this, I‚Äôve tried to focus on what a company will be earning 3-5 years from now, and determining if current prices are a good value compared to those earnings. And while simple in concept, this gets difficult fairly quickly."

2021-06-27 11:16:07,stocks,"The stock price typically drops by the dividend amount, so there's no net gain short-term.

Simplified...if the company pays out 1M in dividends, it's immediately worth 1M less, because it no longer has that cash on hand. The stock value tends to reflect this.

That being said, stocks in strong up-trends can go up on div days if the daily trend is stronger than the dividend payment."

2021-06-27 16:46:05,stocks,"To really understand it, you gotta know how stocks work. When you buy a stock in anticipitation of receieiving the dividend yield, there are also others who plan on doing so as well. This means there are fewer shares being offered at the market = higher bids for the stock. So your dividend payout may, more or less, might not even cover the depreciated price of the stock if you were to sell it after the dividend payment. Same thing vice-versa when you're trying to sell it since others would liquidate their dividend stock after receiving the dividends. More shares available for sale = lower bids. You can get really specific with it in terms of dividends being taxed at a qualified or ordinary rate as well and other tax complications. In the end, it's likely not worth the trouble and would be a gamble in-itself."
2021-06-27 18:28:19,stocks,"Some people my also looks at the tax burden associated with that strategy. Holding shares less than one year and selling is treated like ordinary income for tax purposes, so if you are in a high tax bracket, you could be paying more in the long run. Shares held for 1+ years are taxed at the capital gains rate, which is either 0, 10, or 15% based on your tax bracket. Just some food for thought."

2021-06-27 14:42:49,stocks,"Most of them are overpriced right now imho. Ubisoft, ATVI, EA, TTWO obviously were all fantastic investments 5-10 years ago, but you're not getting a good deal if you buy them right now.

That said, I'm not saying they're bad investements either. I'd pick EA or TTWO over ATVI, because they've got more room to expand their overall business imho. I personally also have a bit more faith in both EA and TTWO's, game development pipeline, overall business strategy & diversity and management vs. ATVI.

Something to take into account is that some forms of microtransactions like lootboxes might face some regulatory headwinds in some countries, which could impact revenue and profit. (I don't object the opposition to lootboxes at all, it's a very questionable business model, but it's something to take into account if you invest in a company like EA, because a lot of their revenue comes from FIFA Ultimate Team)

Nintendo seems like the most attractive one based on the valuation, but their management is a bit too conservative for my likings (not necessarily a bad thing, but just something I take into account when looking at the valuation). Nintendo is a great company though: they're highly profitable, have very little overhead (they generate incredible amounts of revenue of profit relative to the capital that their business requires), their games have an enormous reach and they also have an incredibly die-hard fanbase that's also very monetizable. I consider Nintendo a very low-risk investment, but with limited upside potential for the mid-term. So overall, Nintendo stock is pretty solid, just don't expect too much from it on the short-term and mid-term.

Ubisoft looks pretty interesting in terms of valuation when you look at the P/S ratio, but their profitability leaves a lot too be desired. They lack the reliable/recurring cash-cows that EA (FIFA/FUT, Battlefield), ATVI (COD, COD Mobile, Candy Crush, WoW), TTWO (GTA V, NBA2K) have so you're more dependent on Ubisoft's ability to bring out hits in the future. If you believe in Ubisoft's ability to bring out big hits going forward, then they're the gaming stock to own imho.

Ubisoft also has an enormous amount of employees on payroll: 19 000 employees which is by far the largest of any gaming company. Despite this, they kind of struggle to bring out the reliable and highly profitable big hitters that their competitors are able to pump out with a much lower employee count.

If I had to pick one gaming-related stock it would be Sony by far and away because of the strength of their gaming brand (PlayStation obviously), profitability, outlook and extremely attractive valuation (Sony Group EV/EBITDA = 8, based on their mid-term target), though it's obviously not a a pure gaming stock. Their aim to expand the reach of their IP's with mobile games, and also porting first-party games to PC and expand their PlayStation Network (partnership with Discord) beyond just console also seems very interesting. They also have a lot of great developers and their business has little overhead.

Only thing I don't really like about Sony's PlayStation business right now is the loss-leading console model especially: scalpers are making huge amounts of profits by reselling PS5's, but Sony is taking a sizeable loss on each PS5 they sell. It's a pretty weird situation to be in for them and goes to show that the market would easily have supported a slightly higher PS5 price. But hindsight is 20/20 and overall it's a good thing that PS5 turned out to be a phenomenom.

I think they also could PlayStation could been a bit more agressive with content acquisitions. Capcom was struggling financially 5-10 years ago and would have been a great (and inexpensive) acquisition for their IP alone. But hindsight is 20/20."

Tencent is China so I'm not touching that. 

Gaming is prone to mediocre returns and high risk all things considered even though the market will increase every year. Lootbox regulation is bound to hit which would affect EA as well most likely.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing in California (My Top 10) Despite the gloom and doom the news would have you believe, droves of people are not in fact leaving California and not only did the Golden State weather the storm of Covid better than many expected but [its economy is booming](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-14/california-defies-doom-with-no-1-u-s-economy?fbclid=IwAR3oNdnYcTqZcmkSt7YWCM-_TrK-dSW1DrspVW_gFtsUkuHHyhiYHAjHlzw). Anchored by three global powerhouses in entertainment, agriculture, and tech (SoCal, Central Valley, Bay Area) here are my top 10 stock picks in no particular order for long-term growth from the best state in the Union:

1. Marrone Bio Innovations (MBII, agriculture)
2. Arcadia Biosciences (RKDA, agriculture)
3. KB Home (KBH, construction)
4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, semiconductor)
5. Bloom Energy (BE, alternative energy)
6. El Pollo Loco Holdings (LOCO, delicious chicken)
7. Immersion Corporation (IMMR, technology)
8. Roblox Corporation (RBLX, online gaming)
9. Wildan Group (WLDN, civil engineering/consulting)
10. Synnex Corporation (SNX, information technology)

Disclosure, have positions in all of them and from Los Angeles so might be a bit biased... Also, please note that while my choices are based on DD that draws upon my education background in Materials Science Engineering and current employment as a software engineer in Silicon Beach, this is not financial advice lol

Edit:

Some things people don't consider when bashing California:

1. Diversity - people from all over the world want to live here, that's a big part of why it's crowded.
2. Wild West heritage - relative history of being less divisive and more progressive over things like race, class, and gender. Compared to many cities out East and large swaths of the South, less time to hate your neighbor when you had no choice about relying on one another to make it Californee way.
3. People capital - Beyond having the best public university system arguably in the world, California has proven time and time again that it invests in its citizens more generously and less restrictively than other states. While 'essential' workers in Florida were told to pound sand at the height of the pandemic, California moved them up in priority for testing and vaccinations.
4. Innovation - While it pains many to see companies like Tesla and Toyota USA leave California for greener corporate pastures elsewhere, it is often forgotten that California can afford to do so because it is still the best place for many all over the world to realize their ideas and find the right combination of talent and capital. California has and continues to mint many 'unicorns' that go on to become large corporations, often leaders in their industry.
5. Weather - let's be honest here, many of us would rather be ""dead in California than alive in Arizona!"" lol"

Maybe they could offer shelter beds without curfews or restrictions and also offer drug rehabilitation services on site 24/7. Hell, maybe LA could try building public housing. We have a pathetic amount of public housing and shelter beds compared to older cities like NY.

Anyways, most the homeless population of LA has been here for more than 5-10 years. You can look up the LAHSA data, it‚Äôs not ‚Äòout of state artists‚Äô."

Basically the good ol' Rothschild quote still work ""Buy when there's blood in the streets"". Just my 2 cents, play the long game instead of the short term if you want a less risky return or short term-high risk.  Just keep in mind, a lot of stocks are cyclical. 

Your best indicator: when the medias are bearish and calling for the end of the markets, take a deep breath, turn off your TV and looks at the stocks. When they are praising the high ceilings of stocks or the regular ""Elon Musk, Bezos... the richest men on the world.."" ""Breaking: GameStop ALL TIME HIGH, buy now or cry later"" ""Miami condo sold for record 50 million"" stay away.

The other half I would manage myself, but this is because I enjoy investing and looking for opportunities in the market. You need to enjoy it and be willing to spend time. A few rules:

* I only invest in sectors I understand. For me, that's tech (especially video games) and retail. NVidia, Target, Unity, Micron, Apple, etc.
* When the market dips, that's when you buy. When you see that you lost $1k that day it's hard to respond by putting more money in, but that's what you need to do. Especially when the market is overreacting to some insignificant news.
* When the market jumps you have to sell. This is even harder than buying when it's down. Trying to sell a stock that has been making you money day after day takes discipline.
* Don't be afraid to sell a stock for a loss. Money lost is money lost. The only thing you should care about is where are you most likely to see an increase in the near future. If it's not the stock you are in, sell it and move on.
* Treat any advice on Reddit with a huge amount of skepticism (including this advice). Do your own research. Any company is a good buy at the right price, any company is a bad buy at the wrong price. It's not about if Apple is good or bad, it's about if they are worth $133 a share."

Sure you could do real estate, buy a house, rent it, but do you have any idea how much work goes into being a landlord? Do you have experience?  Because if you don't the banks will want 20% down for sure on every loan once you tell them it's not going to be your main living residence. 

a good dividend spread in growth stocks is the way to go, that's going to get you solid returns locked in from the divs and if the growth is right you still get some risk vs reward returns.

Or, if you have the time, invest in yourself, start a small business. It will require more work, but the profits will be yours."

[https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-companies-stockpile-1-trillion-cash-investors-want-it/](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-companies-stockpile-1-trillion-cash-investors-want-it/)

Companies with the highest cash reserves will most likely have good growth and be around in 5-10 years."
2021-06-27 14:07:07,stocks,"Lots of comments from everyone that has the best idea. Myself included.

First, only invest what you can afford to lose. There's a great chance 150k in 8 years could be worth 300k. But there's also a significant chance it could be worth 75k. 
If you log in one day and see you only have 75k, are you going to sell to save that 75k? Or add more? 

That way you can guage your risk tolerance.  Once you know your risk tolerance, you can filter out a lot of the comments. Index funds are great and hands off, but also you should probably understand what you are investing in. VFIAX or VOO (etf) are well run vanguard funds (mutual and exchange traded) but if the market is overvakued they may not return what you were expecting based in the risk.

If you don't have time to manage it, you may look into RIA's to manage your money. 
If you don't ever want to adjust, maybe an L fund that changes your allocation as you age to reduce risk over time.

If you are looking for real estate, REITs provide easy access with volatility which can be bad if you sell the dip. Good if you buy the dip or indifferent if you buy and hold. 
There's also private real estate investing but those come with more restrictions, less liquidity and different risks.
TL;DR 
diverisfy in several different asset classes and allocate based on your risk profile. 

If your risk tolerance is low, there's always ,cds, mygas and other products offering lower rates.
If you don't wanna lose any purchasing power, inflation protected assets could be beneficial to hold. Your 150k would be worth what 150k is worth less fees. But that could be worth 180k or 140k if we have inflation/deflation.

I saw ARK funds recommended and trashed. I saw growth vs value. I saw covered calls listed in the posts. 

All those are strategies that could be very profitable or could lose money. So really there are tons of great answers, bit without knowing your risk tolerance it's hard to say which one may be best for you. Also even if we find which one is best for you, there's no guarantee it will be a great answer if we look back 8 years from now. Ark crushed it the last 2 years but has lagged the market this year.
Value is historically the better choice long term vs growth, but value sucked the last decade. Growth is potentially highly overvakued but could excel in a deflationary environment.

Nobody has the right answer. So my suggestion... Diversify and manage risk..5% growth, 5% value, 5% small cap, 5% REITS... U get the idea. I made up percentages. Don't blindly follow those.

I'm not an advisor and just making stuff up. I have no incentive to tell u anything right (except upvotes) or anything wrong. So please do your own research, consult with professionals if needed and good luck!"

2021-06-27 15:18:36,stocks,"Lots of factors here. Are you self employed?
What is your age? How much do you have invested besides the 150k? What is your level of risk?

Personally I think putting it in an index is the lazy thing to do. Good yes, safe yes are there better investments, yes. But the above all play a part in how to direct it. Imo. 

If you have a business you can create a self directed ira and put almost anything in that and ot will grow tax free. Real-estate, live stock, crypto etc. You don't need a business but can be good because it can help with the contributions.  There are a number of rules on this so it may not be for you. But something everyone should be aware of.

If you have a high conviction stock that is what I would do. (Mine are tsla and pltr) But thats me I don't diversify with 20-100 of stocks. That is not for everyone. For me investing is doing very little. Meaning research and gain conviction and when I am confident I allocate more capital. Could be over a period of time. This helps when you get punched in the face when the market turns against you. If you did it right and you are confident and the thesis of your investments have not changed you will do well. Most don't make up thier choices on their own and sell in a panic. 

Just keep in mind, Mike Tyson said, ""everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."" If you can not stick to your plan when you get punched in the face by the market, stick to indexes."

2021-06-27 15:55:06,stocks,"That depends on what portion of the $150k is in your whole investment fund. If $150k is the whole fund, then, I would be divided it into 4 sections.

1.) VTI, as a lot of other said, since it is the whole American market, it is less likely to crumble, and given a very long time frame, it is most likely profitable. $50k to $70k, depends on your risk tolerance, and expected return of the time span. If a 15% annual return expectation in 5 year, or 20% annual return in 10 years are feasible, I would definitely go to $70k.

2.) USA, any high dividend ones do, I said high, means at least 6%, $30k to $50k. Again depends on your risk tolerance, expected return is about 8 to 15% annually in 5 to 10 years. Given the dividend reinvested, is quite steady, backtested to 1995 comparison to SPY, it is just about 21% off of SPY gain, that's about 0.80% off per year (I know my math sucks, so just Google, YouTube, research about it yourself).

3.) Individual small-mid cap stocks mostly that have prospective, and a little bit of sure win large cap (example, ZTS). $30k to $50k, you want to risk a bit more to gain more, that's what investment is for, you wanna brag about how your investments grow after years.

4.) Individual stocks or ETFs for short term gamble, $10k to $20k. Here's where the fun seconds to 3) or more, you can play however you want, risk it all, or play several at a time. There's nothing wrong to lose or win less in comparison to others, just the amount and ones you feel comfortable with.

Pretty much sums up all what I am doing right now. Not that I have $150k to invest. I don't know nothing about real estate, and consider it very time consuming and less profitable if done wrongly, so I stay out of it.

If on the other hand, $150k is not your whole investment fund, you have other risky investments, and you want steady income, you may just pour it into USA like I said, grants you about 7.5% annual income, that's about $900 to $1000 per month of income, consider if NAV don't drop much over time.

I feel like the massive companies everybody knows and uses their products are the ones that will continue to grow, innovate, and be around years from now, especially tech stocks, and especially just 5-8 years from now. Apple and Microsoft both have over $2 TRILLION market cap. If you wanted the highest possible % return then I wouldn‚Äôt just dump it all into a blue chip or an ETF though, that‚Äôs where you take on a little more risk, but if you wanted a somewhat comfortably safe place to put it where you aren‚Äôt worried about not seeing any return at all, the blue chips are where I‚Äôd store it. I put $100 into GOOGL at the end of last year and it‚Äôs currently worth $138+. With $150K, and a 5-8 year timeline, theres a lot of potential there. Also, this is a stocks subreddit so I only mentioned stocks but otherwise, with that kind of capital, you‚Äôd likely be able to put money down on a rental property and receive monthly income from the unit(s), also gain equity in the property in the meantime and make a return upon selling the property down the line as well. Real estate is the best passive investment besides the stock market for sure. For multi-family real estate investing I‚Äôd suggest looking up a guy named Grant Cardone. The guy leverages his money against the bank‚Äôs to acquire huge assets (like 400-unit apartment complexes) and simply manages them and pays off the loans on them at the same time as keeping the rest of the profits for himself and his investors at Cardone Capital. Either way, remember that some return is still better than no return. Chasing that 7-9% RoR in the S&P or Nasdaq is tried and true."

You can then take that USDC and put it in a Voyager wallet and get 9% yearly interest. You will pay $15 everytime you withdrawl from Voyager or you could use Nexo and get 1 free withdrawl a month but they pay 8% on USDC unless you lock it up for 30 days and then you can get 9%.

I literally have about 150k I am looking to do this to as well. My first step into crypto dollars until I decide what stocks I want. Once I go in on stocks I am going to be doing a monthly DCA of $5k or more per month and taking margin loans against it right away and then back into crypto dollars.

Without that info I would say: This is a time of stock picking rather than buying QQQ, SPY, etc. The market has had enormous growth in the last two years. I doubt it will grow as swiftly in the coming 5-8 years - so avoid SPY and QQQ.

EASY ANSWER: If you need dividend income for your retirement then buy WFC or C. If you want some low risk growth - then buy Alphabet and GM.

BETTER ANSWER:

US Real Estate is expensive now, but foreclosed Italian real estate can still be bought at low prices at state issued Italian property auctions. If you are dreaming of retiring to Italy and are getting close to retirement - then you may be able to buy a tiny fixer upper B&B within your budget.

If you needed a very high return and you are willing to take significant risk - then (certain countries in) Latin America is the place to be now. But you need to speak Spanish/Portuguese and you need monitor the geopolitical situation and the commodity prices every day. Things can go sour very quickly in Latam now.

To put it briefly, tech companies do better when the interest rates are stable or trending lower. If you expect the interest rates to go higher (and they are quite low), then tech tends to suffer a bit. This is part of the reason SPY has gone up 14.7% this year, while QQQ has gone up 11.6%. Mind you, it's still an awesome return. But since the interest rate is likely to go up, better to play it safe and keep some on stuff less sensitive to IR."

1. There's no way to seriously value any Coins, so I personally wouldn't touch Crypto at all, but if you seriously want to get into Crypto I'd advise you to NOT put 40% of your money into Crypto lol.  

2. PLTR and TSLA are great companies but not great investments in my opinion. Especially Teslas valuation, even after falling about 30% YTD, is way too high. I seriously wouldn't even buy Tesla at $50. They're not only diluting the hell out of you but the ""projections"" (read: phantasies) are in no way shape or form realistic to justify their current price. If you seriously want to buy Tesla at a Market Cap of 650 Billion Dollars you should go to a psychiatrist first because this thing won't end well. People always laugh at you for not owning X stock. It was Cisco in the year 2000 when the Dotcom bubble burst. They'll laugh at you for not owning it, but they'll get very quiet the second all their phantasies turn out to be unrealistic which makes the stock crash. You might miss the hype but you'll also miss the crash. Generally I would advise you to not touch any EV or Renewable Energy stocks at the moment because almost all of them are horrifically overvalued, for obvious reasons (just like in the dotcom bubble).  

3. It's great how you think Real Estate is overvalued but don't think that most stocks are in the same situation. I disagree.  

4. ETF's are the way to go if you don't know anything about investing plus aren't interested in learning more about it. Quite cheap, almost always perform well depending on which one you buy, very low maintenance."

First, my bet was a single space which would pay 36:1, it was not just Black which pays 2:1

Second, the odds of hitting said bet would be between 37:1 and 39:1 ( some casinos have added a triple zero option further shifting the odds in the houses favor)

*Finally, the actual error is that the number 22 is red, not black -* ***Edit: this part is a joke.***

BTW, I work for a Casino in Las Vegas, so though I don‚Äôt play Roulette, I know quite a bit about the game.

Edit: Wow, not much humor in the investment world. I put in the joke that 22 is red, not black to see if u/Harrigan_Raen would chase that false rabbit.

Probably something like subtract your age from 100 and put that percent in a low cost stock index ETF (e.g. VTI) and the rest in a bond index (e.g. BND).  Adjust for risk tolerance and time horizon when you‚Äôll need the money.

Nearly happened in 2008 (and again in 2020) but the Fed slammed the federal reserve rate back to zero and buys shitty corporate debt every month to force interest rates to remain low.

Even though we both make pretty good money we can‚Äôt upgrade because of the costs of kids and child care, etc. 

For what it is worth, I think a lot of the people buying expensive homes are families with two upper class incomes. We know one that is a doctor and a lawyer, another that is two doctors, another that‚Äôs an accountant and a lawyer, etc. We were trying to figure out who the hell is making the $500k in annual income you probably need to buy these 1.5 million homes that are springing up everywhere.

The vast majority of homeowners say the best investment they‚Äôve ever made was into buying their home. The only exception is if you plan to move in the next 5 years.

Most people want a house straight out of school. This is a very American thing. People do not need a house immediately ! They need to focus on building equity first.

Also, this mentality of ""you can be what you want to be in life !!!"" needs to stop. Some industries are hiring with some decent salaries, while some fields will condemn people choosing that track to a life in poverty. Is it fair, is it cool, I don't know but it's the reality.

When you have too much supply of a good it sits in a warehouse and costs the owner money, so they have to lower prices to move it. Houses are different - it's shelter, a basic necessity.

The fact is there is still a shortage - people are buying houses at these prices. It just sucks for people who don't own a house now."

Did you seriously just say that you would buy Tesla at 50 because it's currently at 650...? You really didn't understand what I was telling you, right?

Amazon lost 90% of share price and it took them 11 YEARS just to break even. Cisco lost 85% and it still didn't break even. If you bought Cisco 21 years ago you would still be down by about 44%.  


You're the type of guy who would've lost a ton of money in 2000. You will eventually lose a ton of money if you don't educate yourself on how to at least try to come up with the actual value of a stock. Tesla is NOT worth 650 billion Dollars today. Its valuation is crazy and unjustifiable. I would actually argue that Tesla went up as much as it did last year largely because of technical reasons and people somehow attempted to justify the price action. It will crash. Eventually.

Cheap stocks will come soon. Prepare your cash."
2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"How Stocks Are Valued Part 1: Discounted Cash Flow I saw a question on this sub yesterday about why stocks are valuable, so I thought I would do a write-up of what I learned about stocks in business school. But first, an important concept:

# The Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Discount Rate

**A loan to a friend**

Imagine if you loaned someone $1000 for a year. You probably want to be paid back with interest. This interest compensates you for losing access to that money for a year, during which you could have deposited it at a bank, invested it, or even spent it.

The long story short is that $1000 today is worth more than $1000 tomorrow because of the flexibility and options that you have with today's money. We can say that the ***Present Value*** of $1000 next year is less than $1000 today. This concept is also known as ***The Time Value of Money.***

**An Example With T-Bills**

Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially loans to the US Government, but the amount to be repaid is fixed. T-Bills are typically denominated in $1000s, which is the amount the government will repay when the bond matures. 

An investor can typically buy a T-Bill for less than the full $1000 on the open market. The investor makes money because she purchased the future $1000 payment at a ***discount.*** This discount exists because money today is worth more than money tomorrow. How do you convert between the two? Using the appropriately named ***Discount Rate***, or the required rate of return. 

The average investor wants to make money from lending money, even to the US Government. If investors want a 1% return, then $100 today is the same as $101 next year.

We can similarly price T-Bills: If the required rate of return is 1%, and the bond will pay $1000 in a year, then the ***Present Value*** of the T-Bill is about $990. This is because the $990 investment will grow by 1% into $1000.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

Are you still awake? Good. This is the fun part.

# So What Are Stocks Anyway?

Stocks represent partial ownership of a company. A company is divided into units of stock called shares, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to a fraction of the company's assets (after all debts are repaid) and any future profits.

**So Why Does a Stock Have Value?**

Part of a stock's value comes from its book value (the value of all company assets minus all company debt) but this clearly only a small fraction of that price ( the average price-to-book ratio for the companies in the S&P500 is about 4.5). ***The remainder of the stock value comes from the future earnings of a company.***

Similar to how the price of a T-Bill is the present value of a future payment, a large part of a stock's value comes from the present value of future earnings. Analysts will project (and discount) a company's future earnings, add the book value, and arrive at an estimate of the stock's value.

# Oversimplified DCF Example:

The Pear Company makes $100 a year risk-free. For simplicity's sake, it has $200 in assets and no debt. For some reason, you figure 100% is a good discount rate to use.

The Pear Company will make $100 next year (Year 1), which is worth $50 today ($50 doubles into $100 in a year). In Year 2, The Pear Company's earnings are only worth $25 to you today, and so on. If you add the present value of all future cash flows together, you'll arrive at $100. 

You can find the company value by adding the value of its assets ($200) with the present value of its future earnings ($100).  If Pear issues 100 shares, each will be worth $3.

[Of course, even simple DCF Models IRL look a little scarier than the above example.](https://imgur.com/a/DzMQHHT)

# But What Makes The Stock Valuable To Me?

You might have noticed that dividends aren't really taken into account at all. How are you supposed to get any real money from a company whose stock pays no dividends?

Unpaid dividends don't just disappear. Management can decide to reinvest these profits to grow their income. This results in a larger stock price over time. The company might also just decide to keep the cash on its balance sheet. This results in a larger book value, and the stock price will increase to reflect that.

You can sell some stock to create your own ""dividend"" if you'd like; you will own a smaller percentage of the company, but because profits were not distributed to shareholders, the company has gotten bigger.

**But What Makes The Stock Valuable To The Next Guy?**

Eventually, the company's value will be returned to shareholders. This could happen in several ways:

1. Dividends are paid out in the future, returning capital to investors
2. The company is acquired or goes private, and shareholders either receive cash or stock in the acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price is determined by, among other things, the present value of all future earnings of the company,
3. The company might also just decide to stop operating and liquidate its assets. Shareholders will receive all assets the company owns (after paying its debt)."
2021-06-27 11:14:26,stocks,"Problem with DCF models is the growth rate assumption has such a huge effect on target price that almost every other variable is moot.

And the growth rate assumption is just a semi-wild-ass guess, no matter how smart you think you are.  The math just makes you feel better about the guessing part."

2021-06-27 12:43:09,stocks,any corporate finance book. First learn to calculate Free Cash Flow to Equity and Free Cash Flow to the Firm.  Then learn discount rates (CAPM).  These are essentially the two main components of a DCF.  A DCF just projects them out into the future and then calculates their present values.

When you sell your entire position, different tax rules apply to each tax lot as some may be short term and some may be long term, depending on how long you‚Äôve held them. 

If you only sell part of your position, e.g. one tax lot of 10 shares, different brokers handle it differently. As pointed here by others, almost all brokers use ‚ÄúFirst In First Out‚Äù as default. So if you have two lots with 10 shares each bought on different dates and when you hit the sell button for 10 shares, the first lot you bought will be sold first. 

Many brokers also provide capability to go back and and reassign which lot you ‚Äúactually wanted‚Äù to sell. At the end of the tax year, your calculations might tell you that using the most recent tax lot would get your a better tax rate instead of the first tax lot that the broker used, you might be able to re-assign which lot to ‚Äúmark‚Äù as the one you sold. 

I use E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers. E*TRADE gives you the option to either FIFO or select a particular tax lot that you want to sell. Interactive Brokers on the other hand does not allow you to select which lot you want to sell but has a tax optimizer feature which, after you sell, would allow you to choose the best tax lot for the best tax implications. Check the web version of your broker to see if this option for tax optimizer exists as the mobile apps dont usually support this capability. Check with your broker.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"The Weekly DD - WISH: The shopping mall in your pocket **Overview**

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let‚Äôs go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation.¬†

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH‚Äôs focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates.¬†
* WISH‚Äôs decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.
* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%**¬†of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables‚Ä¶

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019.¬†

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it‚Äôs a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash.¬†

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What‚Äôs concerning is that it‚Äôs only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

The majority of people commenting ""wish is trash scam company"" have almost certainly not done any proper research on it. I've been in WISH since recently after the IPO. The /r/wallstreetbets hype is fun, but it's always been a poorly understood company.

From the WISH CEO:

>We never hypothesized going after value conscious consumers with unbranded goods, but the early data was indisputable. There was a large underserved market of consumers that prioritized price over pretty packaging, fast shipping, and brands. Despite our metrics, we were told repeatedly and at every stage by Menlo Park investors that they didn‚Äôt know anyone that would shop on Wish. That we were unlikely to surpass whatever sales volume we had at the time. Pointing out that the biggest retailer in America focused strictly on value conscious consumers fell on deaf ears, these investors didn‚Äôt shop at Walmart either.

People with $100K accounts can't fathom shopping at WISH. But why should they? It's not meant for them.

Tl;dr: a lot of people don't understand Wish's business model. But that's okay, because that's exactly why it offers asymmetric upside."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"How does shorting affect a stock? I don't mean the stock's price, I mean the company itself. I keep seeing people saying that short sellers bankrupt companies, but, to my understanding, the only way that they affect the company is through lowering the share price. A lower share price means that the company can raise less money through additional share offerings, but... That's about it, right? 

I also guess it affects more of the intangible aspects like investor confidence and so on, but I still fail to see exactly how short sellers affect the company.

If the company is good enough, eventually it will bounce back up, right? There's a reason why the most shorted companies are some of the most controversial ones. Most of the them have slim chances of performing well or are overvalued.

And, also, if we apply the reverse logic, if a company's share price gets pumped up and kept up, the only thing they can do is raise more money through the shares. However, if their management and business is shit, they're just buying themselves more time before bankruptcy, right?

I've seen the theories about companies that are trading above the fair value actually creating value through share offerings, but at the end of the day it comes down to the underlying business and it's performance. If a company was that good that it only needs money to become an amazing performer, there surely would be some merry bunch of individuals who would give them some. I mean, investors and institutions are spending a fuckton of money supporting companies with a 10% chance of surviving over the next few years and dodgy startups, if they saw a company that only needs cash to perform well, they'd surely recognise the opportunity, right?

I have not actually done any substantial factual research on this although admittedly it's a bit hard to find good resources right now which are not biased. This is purely my own personal understanding. There's plenty of people here who are smarter than me so I was hoping that somebody would have a good answer üòÅ

A publicly traded company with a good valuation can easily get cash by diluting their stock. This does not only make financing through dilution less costly, it also makes financing through debt easier, as the bank knows the company can always dilute to pay that debt.

There is a ton, a TON of shitty, unprofitable zombie corporations kept alive solely by diluting shareholders and exhausting credit facilities. 

Screw that. Put capital where it will be employed most effectively. Shorts are an incredibly important part of price discovery especially in frothy markets like this.

Just think about it: what part in short selling would make it go down in the long term to actually cause bankruptcy? All a short seller does is opening a position that he plans to buy in the future, in other words the broker buys the share in that very moment at that very price that it has on the market. This does nothing to the price.

What it can do though is scare off new investors that see a high short ratio. Large institutions have their hands in almost everything and have a far superior way of evaluating things, meaning betting against that is usually a bad idea as the shorting has it's reason.

You can read it up here, but from a pure logical point this should already be answered before you even open the link.

But let's talk about the next part of your question: Bankruptcy. A company that does well and is well established will never need to issue shares to raise capital, and that's the only real part for a company where the stock price matters. Sure, if they hand out shares to their employees then it matters to the employees as well, but that's a personal matter, not one for the company.

What does absolutely cause a company to file bankruptcy is a failing business and a failure to adapt to new circumstances, leading to you losing more and more money and the only way to get money back is either a loan - which might just add debt pressure on you and makes you look even worse on paper - or by offering shares. A company that has a very high short ratio will have a hard time selling it's stock, but again, that's not the fault of shorts but the fault of the company for having a failing business."

2021-06-27 12:19:09,stocks,"Thought I would share my view on this one. Shorting in itself don't bankrupt a company, it in itself helps in price discovery to make it ""efficient"" better, as if there is no shorting, if one thing a stock is overvalued, they would just avoid it, but shorting helps creating value in finding the company's ""fair price"". With that being said, shorting, often times is used with smear campaign not just to the public, but to the strategic investors and just creating fears in general, these strategies requires one to be in the industry to tell. There is this one strategy that is ""long the strong and short the weak"", when one is weak, you keep beatin it down, and many times when short succeeds, it doesn't mean the company itself is a scam or whatnot, but if the price is keep low enough for long enough time, there will be times where the company is actually in a tough spot and need to use the capital to hold and when they can't, itll just be bankruptcy declared for the company to salvage capital for shareholders. The general idea of such strategy is not IF it will need the capital, it's about when it needs the capital, and if you ask me, i agree, no company ever stay profitable and be on top all the time. Using this line of thought, same way as you would be finding a ""value"" stock, you find these stocks that are vulnerable to conditions of the market then start targetjng it in hopes of a payday. Finance market in large is , was and will be about the quantitative aspect, most of the time there won't be a personal reason to do such things to a company, it's always about the profit and there will be strategy to do so in a quantitative way."
2021-06-27 15:59:40,stocks,"Please remember that 75% of the people on all the investing subs joined this year and have no idea what they are talking about. 

I have a degree in finance and work in finance. You are 100% correct that all a short actually does is lower the share price and make raising capital through additional share offerings less profitable. All these other things people are talking about are strategies that can be used to make a short profitable, but not a result of the actual short."
2021-06-27 17:11:39,stocks,"Failing ‚â† Failed 

Shorting affects the company, by effectively removing one way of financing a pivoting strategy. Let's say, for example, that AMC realizes it's current business model isn't working, so it comes up with a new one to bring it into the modern world.  But to adopt new technologies, it needs to raise $100 Million which is not available from lenders, so it needs to issue stock. Let's say that the stock was holding pretty steady at $50/share, so the offering is set for 20 million shares to be issued.

Now hedge funds come in and significantly short the stock... shaking confidence and dropping the price to $25. That drop would likely result in much less capital being raised, maybe not enough to make the pivot that would have saved the company. 

It's like draining a lake of water and blaming the fish for not being able to breathe air, or not choosing a different lake."
2021-06-27 17:46:25,stocks,"Shorting in itself doesn't affect the stock.  But if there's more selling than buying, the price will go down.  But a large institution consolidating shares to short and unleashing all of them at once could* drive the price down, provided the shares aren't bought at the same rate.  But that being said, shorting usually occurs when it's expected that the price will go down and not to drive the price down."

Among other reasons, this is why shorting stock can be seen as controversial. Institutions who are net short profit from the company‚Äôs demise, and so there‚Äôs an incentive to destroy or devalue these companies."

2021-06-27 13:03:40,stocks,"True, that's the worst case scenario for the company and the best case scenario for the bears.

Good accounting practices plus profitable business equals no need to raise money through floating more shares IMO. Plus, if you float more shares, you dilute your existing shareholders and I've seen that most companies tend to resort to bank loans anyway before floating more shares. After all, diluting the shares leads to a lower EPS, lower dividend yield, lower book price per share, etc. No well-performing company would do that  IMO unless they're seriously overvalued (Tesla).

Shorting as a result of falling stock prices comes from followers, those trying to make a quick buck on the current sentiment. They have already been triggered to follow suit.

Good well-performing businesses need liquidity which in most cases runs on credit and not cash. 

Think of the 2007 financial crisis - so many businesses suffered from being suddenly illiquid because the credit market dried up. Big companies couldn¬¥t make payroll - even though they had enough assets and were profitable for quite some time. And that had nothing to do with them being a bad business suddenly.

2021-06-27 07:05:36,stocks,"One and the same in some instances. Short sellers never have to return a de-listed stock. 

Pay media and analysts to negatively assess the target company. Borrow every stock available to short it. Price drops (esp microcap). Analysts and media claim how right they were. Actual selling happens. More shorts happen. Media gets on a bandwagon and digs up any negative story they can find - poor working conditions, lack of woke-ness, buying from sweatshops, poor customer reviews... it all feeds in to itself. 

The minute the company itself has an issue with its fundamentals - stagnating growth for example - that they'd normally get a loan or issue more stock to get through, then the death spiral begins. Without growth, expenses rise and revenue falls. It makes it harder to pay staff, pay leases on buildings with good exposure, buy materials to sell. No chance of expansion or breaking into a new market. 

Sure they'll go through ""restructuring"" which will give the media and analysts more ammo and create a bad image for laying off staff. It'll keep the doors open while they beg and borrow for contracts on product or close down shopfronts. But its like treading water - you can only go so long before you start to dip below the water.

The minute you bring an external factor into play - say COVID. Game over.

Short sellers pay the interest on the stock loan, riding out the tumble in share price and they either cover if somehow the company sorts their shit out or they ride their open short position to the ground and pocket the original sell price - interest cost as profits.

1: selling does not decrease a stocks price. In fact, every buy needs a sell, so your logic would create an infinite loophole. 

2: the stock price is an imaginary number that doesn't exist. It either shows bid+spread/2 or the last sell price for most brokers. 

3: if I own a 250$ NVDA share and sell it for 300$, then it didn't decrease the stock value. In fact, it increased it if the last stock sale was below 300$.

4: shorts can't magically make up a price. A short position first requires the broker to buy a share at the current price and then you straight up just sit there, hoping it goes down. It's the same as buying. Your act doesn't influence what other people sell or buy at in the slightest.

Addressing your first point:

Selling a stock CERTAINLY decreases a stock‚Äôs price. The stock market is based on supply and demand. By selling, you increase the supply. No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock‚Äôs price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater. 

‚ÄúIf more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.‚Äù

https://www.disnat.com/en/learning/trading-basics/stock-basics/what-causes-stock-prices-to-change

Addressing your second point:

An imaginary number that doesn‚Äôt exist? 

The current price is the most recent selling price of the stock, with adequate liquidity this number certainly isn‚Äôt ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù but instead a very good indicator of what you could buy or sell the stock for. If you want to ‚Äúmarket buy‚Äù you pay the ask, ‚Äúmarket sell‚Äù and you get the bid. Again, with enough liquidity these numbers, or the ‚Äúspread‚Äù should be very close to the ‚Äúcurrent price‚Äù or what you called ‚Äúimaginary‚Äù 

Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp

Your third point:

Yes, buyers meet sellers and a exchange of shares goes through.

Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you‚Äôre essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you‚Äôre sure will get filled. You don‚Äôt get to choose. If the last sale was at 299, your share is available at $300 but the market has people willing to sell at 298, 297, 296, 295 etc. do you ever think your $300 limit sell will get filled? Probably not, and thus why selling pressure increases supply and reduces the price (see point 1).

Your fourth point:

If someone shorts a stock, the shares have to be bought first. That straight up negates your entire argument.

>No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock‚Äôs price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater.

How can you even write that, thinking this is true? Who do they sell to? The air? No, someone else has to buy it. Every single day someone buys or sells someone else sells or buys. Do you think there is an invisible force that this goes into?

""Source, because you likely won‚Äôt believe me:""

This source is flawed majorly - the statements in it are true, but what you fail to understand is that it doesn't matter if stock ABC currently sitting at 100$ has 500 million asks and 500 million bids at 90$ and 110$ - it doesn't do jackshit if there is enough liquidity sitting between 100$ to 110$ and 100 to 90$. What your ""source"" references to is that whenever you have either more demand or more supply, it will move into the opposite direction because it's all about who breaks first, and more people mean it's more likely that this happens. **But that has literally nothing to do with shorting because what this talks about is owning shares and then selling them vs not owning shares and wanting to buy them, thus bid and ask.**

>Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you‚Äôre essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you‚Äôre sure will get filled.

False. My example was that my NVDA share got filled. You can't take my example while referencing me and then apply different rules. You can make that and make your own example, but not put words into my mouth. I spoke against you saying that selling has to decrease the price which is simply wrong. **EVERY BUY NEEDS A SELL. THEY WORK TOGETHER.**

>Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price.

Short selling means your broker will buy (or borrow) a share until you buy it back. Meaning your made up scenario of having more shares available is simply wrong. Only when you buy back, the share goes back to the market, BUT it also requires someone to buy it. So no, you do not have more shares.

>‚ÄúShort sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company‚Äôs stock.‚Äù

No no no. Quote the entire thing:

""Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company‚Äôs stock. Executives, on the other hand, are incentivized to drive up the price of their company‚Äôs stock.""

What you fail to understand or attempt to represent accurately is that they mean short sellers, the person behind shorting, not the actual short, want to drive the price down. While the CEO, and for that concern anyone on a long position, want to drive the price up. You will never read negative sides on a bull DD and you will never read positive sides on a bear DD. That is natural and stupid to reference out of context.

>‚ÄúShort-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won‚Äôt last for long.‚Äù

Thank you for confirming my point. We are talking about a company filing **bankruptcy**. Having to file for bankruptcy is not something that happens in weeks or a month, this builds up over years. You have the relation wrong. Shorts don't create a failing business, but a failing business creates shorts.

>I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent.

What the hell is this even meant to mean? Okay let's digest.

""I am not saying shorts could bring a company down, unless the company was truly fraudulent.""

What? What the hell do shorts have to do with whether the company is fraudulent or not? What hell of a point is that supposed to be?

And second part:

""I am not saying at all that shorts  could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved""

You what? Listen. A company doesn't give a single frick about what traders do - for their business. They care about what happens to their stock when they **NEED** or **WANT** to raise money. All the other times it literally doesn't matter for the company itself, the entire time. This also belongs to taking a loan and having your stocks, that the company holds, evaluated. But again, what you fail to imply is that a failing business causes shorts to come in, not shorts coming in cause a failing business. The topic of the post is still bankruptcy and no, shorts do not have an effect on the share price. Again, by your logic every long position that sells has the same negative effect because the share magically goes back to the market, meaning less supply. Which is simply wrong, someone else is buying it.

**As a final word:**

Supply and demand in shorts matters in 3 cases only:

1. for algorithms. They use the spread to of bid and ask for high frequency trading. This actually does have a major impact on the trading volume, as well as the way it's going
2. who of the bid ask sides breaks first. But bid and ask mostly long positions selling and non-positions buying. So that entire theory doesn't work out for reality.
3. if the float of a stock is either close to or at 100% or the trading volume is insanely low. I've been in stocks that I put up a MARKET ORDER and it wasn't closed for 3 months, so the end where no one is buying or at least enough to cover enough positions that mine is included. And the other end is of course that no one wants to sell.

None of these apply to short selling."

2021-06-27 11:56:56,stocks," ‚Äúa credit rating determines the likelihood that the borrower will be able and willing to pay back a loan within the confines of the loan agreement without defaulting.

So we need cash to pay back a debt right? We can obtain cash via equity financing right? If our stock price is low we can obtain less per share via equity financing right? If we can obtain less cash via equity financing, then our chances of paying back the debt are less right? If our chances of paying back the debt are less, then that negatively impacts our credit worthiness right? If our credit worthiness is deemed to be less by a rating agency we get downgraded right? If our rating gets downgraded it is harder to issue bonds

As  far as i understand companies need money at the beginning of their life  to cover the expenses and then in exchange they return the profit to  the investors in dividends or buybacks which makes the stock/company  valuable which drives the stock price up so they can issue more shares  if they need money for further investment.

So  this is completely ok but a company like coca-cola, altria, 3m etc.  doesnt really issue any new shares or do something innovative to reform  the company/build factories etc. So does it even matter what their stock  price is? Their net profit would cover all expenses isnt it?

And so, If a company announced that it was halting all future dividend payments and using that money to pay to the rank and file (if somehow against all odds the board agrees to this) shareholders would run for the doors, cratering the stock price (which executives own, so they‚Äôd get hurt) and there would likely be a class action launched by those shareholders against everyone that voted for it.

2021-06-27 15:41:59,stocks,"As a dividend heavy investor personally, the reason and logic behind why I like dividend stocks is simple:

When you own stock in a company, you‚Äôre essentially owning a piece of their business. The entire point of owning/operating a business is to be profitable and make money. It‚Äôs not very sensible to me to own a piece of a company that doesn‚Äôt even pay me. I am a part owner after all. Simply relying on the stock price to hopefully go up isn‚Äôt very comforting. 

In order to realize any profit from a non-paying company you‚Äôll have to sell your shares. Dividend stocks provide cash flow without the need to sell at all. And on top of it, each year the distribution will most likely grow. After a handful of years, your yield in the past will be much lower than what it would become in the future. (Assuming no cuts and reasonable payout hikes.)

Companies themselves do this for various reasons. Mainly mature and predictable companies offer dividends. (But not all exactly.) it gives more allure to their stock. It basically says to investors ‚Äúhey look at us, we can payout money to you consistently because we have confidence in our business, and we appreciate your investment.‚Äù

The answer is ‚Äúconvention‚Äù. The market is aways looking for signals about the health of a company. For companies that pay dividends, convention has decided that increasing dividends are good, and decreasing dividends are bad.

This, by the way, is *yet another* reason that dividends are generally a bad way to return capital to the shareholders. Nobody says ‚ÄúAha, BIGCO, you bought back 10 million shares last year, but this year you didn‚Äôt buy back any! You must be in financial distress!

When a company moves out of the growth phase it's stock price will level out and it's investors will flee looking for a better ROI (return on investment). Since it doesn't have to spend as much on the first 2 they pay dividends to keep there investors.  Think of it like this. vz pretty much trades sideways.

Incorrect. If the point of buybacks and dividends was to increase the value of the stock in order to then offer shares again, the company would at best only get back as much as it paid in dividends or buybacks, or more likely get worse returns than if they didn't do any buybacks (the exception being in situations where there's heavy short interest and the buybacks might scare shorts away)."

I think the most direct answer is that corporate officers took on the duty as part of the deal when they decided to do a stock offering.  Taking money from investors is basically predicated on that value being grown.  There are mechanisms to replace leadership that are not living up to expectations.

It is more complicated though.  I believe there is case law for PRIVATELY HELD companies that went to the supreme court with regards to Hobby Lobby and their handling of providing certain insurance to employees.  The arguments were fundamentally that actions taken around religious belief were interfering with shareholder value.  Obviously this is limited and not case law for public companies, but it points to the complexity.

Regardless, many people think that an economy predicated on infinite growth or monotonically increasing profit is impractical and that corporate officers have duty that is more nuanced than just providing shareholder value.  For now though, the best general answer seems to be that it's a core commitment of the corporate officers when stock is offered.

What they fail to realize is that, while their stock DOES now represent a smaller portion (they‚Äôre right about that part), it represents a smaller portion of a company that now has more value (they literally raise a ton of cash with the secondary offering).

This has a side effect of creating some extra sell-side pressure and creating an upper bound on the stock price, temporarily, so in the short term it does often cause a dip.

Beyond that cash meaning the company has more liquid assets, the cash is generally raised via a secondary offering specifically because it is needed to do something that the company believes will make a lot of money in the long run. 

TLDR If a company‚Äôs decision to provide a secondary offering is based on accurate predictions of the value of the activities or infrastructure that the resulting cash will fund, then the offering is actually good for current investors in the long run."

theres insane increase in revenue, net revenue, and FCF. Even going positive in net income. this also is after the fact that (unless im misunderstanding this concept on balance sheet) corsair has (relatively speaking to its previous years) insane inventory cash flow.

however, projecting Y/Y growth is hard on this company.

They haven't settled so you're marked with a debit. When the trade settles you'll either have cash or a debt.

NB even when the transaction settles, expect Fidelity to drag their feet getting the balances posted. I just had to yell at them because a transfer of cash into my account took 7 biz days to appear as real money instead of the promised 4.

And that should give you 40k margin, total 80k buying power.

If you had 1k left over and made another 20k purchase on margin, I believe it would be interest free on margin, and they would not touch your 1k. 

If you then added 99k, I believe they would fill your margin, leaving you with 80k in cash reserves, 60k in holdings, and 140k buying power, so total 180k with margin.

The first probably 100K/140k of your purchases would end up being interest free- or 30k of interest free margin, with the final 50k margin at an annual interest rate of 6.575% due to having more than 100k in the account

Most people own cars. The only thing I ever use an Uber for is to go out drinking and have a safe ride to and from the bars. 

So where is the 24 hour a day demand outside of major metro areas?"
2021-06-27 02:51:54,stocks,"The valuation on Uber and lyft have recovered...the risk reward has already shown recovery in the stock price.

2021-06-27 04:49:30,stocks,"Some Uber‚Äôs are a premium over taxis. I‚Äôd say 30% are not and are bad service at least pre covid. Refuse to turn off music, no AC, not very nice.. it really depends and it‚Äôs a crapshoot."
2021-06-27 06:52:06,stocks,"Except that you get that with cabs,  it's far more frequent, you have to physically call them, you can't track them and see if they are actually coming or not, you can't down rate a taxi to the point that the company will turf them.  Any of the negative sides of Uber, also exist in Cabs, but you lose out on all the positive sides that Uber offers.  

&#x200B;

The simplest thing to look at is that if prices were identical, which service will customers choose?  The majority are choosing Uber for the convenience aspect alone.  

&#x200B;

So there appears to be zero reason for Uber to be undercutting Taxis."

2021-06-27 08:11:46,stocks,"Not sure if you are joking or not.

No idea what Star Trek Discovery is. Main one I remember watching was the one with Sir Patrick Steward.

I ask because of the fact that Mycellium based things are emerging and could replace other things.

Instead of Styrofoam they are making packaging out of mycelium material which is the roots under the fruiting body.

They are also making bricks for construction as well."

Basically use the substances to feel new things, and be comfortable and grow from negative experiences and enjoy the positive ones."

But if you want a niche like mycelium or seaweed or hydroponics you'll end up looking through pennystocks scams or very risky startups that could be wiped out by a big company blinking with an eye.

If you get convienced by such a startup and find a high-conviction investment (that you might even get involved / be a passion) then good for you. But don't force it if you don't - too many people have been burned by looking for a holy grail."
2021-06-27 13:47:03,stocks,"Well there‚Äôs a point to what he‚Äôs saying. Investing in a company solely because they deal with an emerging, promising technology is a bad idea. You‚Äôre not investing in a technology, you‚Äôre investing in a company. Can the company make mycelium profitable? Will this company be a leader in selling mycelium products? Does it have good leadership/good financials?

Look at the aviation industry in the 60s and 70s. Everyone knew flying was the future of transportation, but few companies could turn a profit with it. A lot of people got burnt because they thought investing in an airline was the same as investing in the technology of air transport."

2021-06-27 07:02:18,stocks,Good point - I was looking up algae biofuel and all I found were penny stocks. I did not invest but kind of wish there were more/better companies in this area.

What can I do to initiate a buy order at 100 shares at 270, how would I set that up as the current price is around 241?. 

Would be using a stop-loss at 270, how does the investment bank know that I want to purchase it only at 270?"
2021-06-27 00:51:23,stocks,No one should ask this question. If you dont know...you shouldnt have gone there.

2021-06-27 02:27:30,stocks,They want to fill the buy order when it increases to $270. Stop limit buy orders is what they would need.
2021-06-27 02:13:07,stocks,"No, this would get filled immediately. They want to do a buy when the price goes upto $270. Stop limit buy is what is needed."
2021-06-27 07:35:33,stocks,"I don't use those orders with stocks only futures.  But help me out.  If he put in a buy stop limit at 270, and the stock went from 269.90 directly to 270.10 and didn't trade at 270.00 he wouldn't get filled , right? He needs a buy stop i would think."
2021-06-27 01:28:55,stocks,Thank God.
2021-06-27 12:26:39,stocks,"That‚Äôs correct, but I only assumed they want it to be purchased at $270 or better based on their last statement, ‚Äúpurchase it only at 270‚Äù.

But if they want to just do a market order at trigger, then yes, buy stop is what they want."
2021-06-27 10:55:35,stocks,"If the Bid went from 269.90 to 270.10, then his order wouldn't be filled unless the price dropped back down, you're right. It's possible. Isn't there a trailing option?

Yes; Its called a ""Buy trailing stop order"" and if it can't execute at the price you specified, it will fill it at market. I've never used that before."
2021-06-27 12:48:11,stocks,"I'm probably confused.  Wouldn't that be a ""market if touched"" order?"
2021-06-27 12:56:54,stocks,I've never even HEARD of that before. Personally I think individuals overthink investing trying to scalp a few cents.
2021-06-27 12:50:52,stocks,"Yes, if they are okay with the possibility of it filling higher than $270. If not, then they would need the buy stop limit order to purchase at $270 or lower."
2021-06-27 12:54:33,stocks,"Yeah, that's right. But would that not be the case with others?  Also I believe it is possible for individual investors to overthink things.  I see it almost every day on Reddit."
2021-06-27 12:58:19,stocks,"Since OP wasn‚Äôt clear with which way they want to go, then there‚Äôs just the two ways to go about it.

Buy stop limit: trigger at $270 but wants to fill only at $270 or better with the risk of not filling at all.

Buy stop: trigger at $270 but will fill at market, which could be more or less than $270."

I feel like we are starting to get to a point where electric vehicles are starting to be affordable, attractive, and more widespread.  Rather than investing in the EV market I would like to find some shovel stocks in the supply chain (battery manufacturing and recycling for example).  What are your favorite picks for both the EV industry as well as some of your favorite shovel stocks in general?"
2021-06-27 01:23:30,stocks,"Proterra is an excellent shovel play and is my biggest position. They're primarily an electric bus manufacturer right now but they're also in the business of electrifying all types of vehicles as well as being in the charging space. Basically the shovel portion is them providing battery packs, powertrain, and charging solutions to other vehicle manufactures who are looking to electrify their vehicles. Right now they derive most of their revenue from their ebuses but by 2023, their vehicle electrification business is expected to overtake their ebus segment.

They have 3 main businesses:

Proterra Powered designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and integrates proprietary battery systems and electrification solutions into vehicles for global commercial vehicle OEM customers serving the Class 3 to Class 8 vehicle segments, including delivery trucks, school buses, coach buses, construction and mining equipment, and other applications.

Proterra Transit designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric transit buses as an OEM for North American public transit agencies, airports, universities, and other commercial transit fleets. Proterra Transit offers an ideal venue to showcase and validate our electric vehicle technology platform through rigorous daily use by a large group of sophisticated customers focused on meeting the wide-ranging needs of the diverse communities they serve.

Proterra Energy provides turnkey fleet-scale, high-power charging solutions and software services, ranging from fleet and energy management software-as-a-service, to fleet planning, hardware, infrastructure, installation, utility engagement, and charging optimization. These solutions are designed to optimize energy use and costs, and to provide vehicle-to-grid functionality.

Through partnerships that include Daimler‚Äôs Thomas Built Buses and Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Komatsu Ltd., Volta Trucks, Lightning eMotors, Van Hool NV, Optimal Electric Vehicles LLC, and BusTech Pty Ltd., Proterra Powered batteries are helping electrify the school bus, step-van, construction and mining equipment, medium-duty trucks and vans, motor coach, shuttle bus, and international transit bus markets, respectively."

2021-06-27 00:20:23,stocks,"Copper, copper, and probably copper. Much beyond EV, it also plays a major role in the push to get electricity to underdeveloped areas of the world. It has intense upward demand, and has a phenomenal outlook for the next decade. Find some miners. FCX if you want a safe play, but there are some wonderful opportunities in the speculative market if you want more risk.

Lithium is critical, but I'm underwhelmed by the investment opportunities. It will be controversial, but I remain convinced that at least one of the major oil corporations is going to do something as simple as add charge points to all their gas stations and overnight build out the largest charging network in the market. XOM, BP, or RDS could capture that market immediately if they wanted.

But if you're in doubt, copper."

IMO they have the potential to be another Piedmont before going parabolic (say if Tesla announces a partnership) but infrastructure wise ahead of Piedmont comparatively when that too was a single digit dollar stock. 

Take a deeper dive if you wish"
2021-06-27 14:20:43,stocks,"Micro-vast.  They make fairly ordinary EV batteries.  Now.  Overseas.   And actively building a major EV battery factory here stateside.  Can't recall where, maybe Tulsa or something?

They're not like some of the hyper-speculative plays that's got an experimental battery in a lab that they hope to commercialize in 5-10 years.  They make and sell the batteries now.  Batteries that every automaker needs for all the EV's they're promising to put out this year.  

And as for those futuristic new tech batteries, Micro-vast does R&D just like everyone else.  So their real world experience plus time and development funded by ongoing revenues means that conceivably they'll keep pace with the futuristic battery plays.

They're in the tail end of merging which has meant share price volatility.  I think it peaked somewhere $23-26 when the merger was announced, now down around $11-12, so arguably it may be on sale.  The bear case is said to be that they haven't been well run prior to the merger, and that big auto may find other suppliers for batteries.  I consider it likely that many automakers will do just that, however I can't believe that *all* the automakers will find other suppliers.  As long as one or two use Micro-vast, that gets the flywheel spinning.  

And it's a little known fact of automotive supply chain that most parts have one or two or three suppliers.  So when there's a brake drum on a vehicle, it could have been made for GM by company A or company B.  The automaker does this to grind the suppliers against each other and to have diversity in their production supply chain.  The parts get the same part number and built to look identical.  So other than some little punch mark or something, you never really know which sub-supplier made the component.  Thus I could see Micro-vast being one of multiple suppliers of commodity battery packs for some automaker.  If EV's take off, automakers will be scrambling to find suppliers, and Micro-vast is (presumably) ready."

Look into Lucid, they are the best EV engine designers so could easily sell their engines to other companies, and they also have full plans for making money off their battery set ups after the car batteries are only 80% as efficient and taken out of the car. Unlike most EV companies (cough cough Tesla) who either recycle(throw away) their batteries or worst off do nothing and leave the customer with a vehicle that‚Äôs massively loosing range. Btw this not to say Tesla is a bad invest, it‚Äôs great.

2021-06-27 00:57:24,stocks,It's a source of information. This is good.
2021-06-27 00:06:41,stocks,"None. Most of my holdings and investment philosophy run very counter to the general reddit M.O. But I do like to answer questions, have found a few cool communities, and will occasionally see a unique post that gives me something to look into."
2021-06-27 00:56:25,stocks,It didn‚Äôt I lost a lot of money fomo
2021-06-27 02:51:17,stocks,"It made me want to start investing. Some good choices made, some bad. Now I have a lot of green energy etfs which seem to suck.  Also PLTR lol"
2021-06-27 04:08:26,stocks,"It made me hold firm to my decision to invest in ETFs and AAPL, basically put some cash aside monthly and forget about it in investments.  After the shit show of GME and onwards I have no interest in fast profit with high volatility stock."
2021-06-27 00:23:19,stocks,Well to be honest they made me invest. I would have not done so otherwise. I never looked into it now thanks to Reddit I have several good stocks.
2021-06-27 12:24:10,stocks,"reddit did amazing things for my portfolio. bought gme at 410, sold at 350. bought amc at 14, sold at 11. bought it again at 60, sold at 52. memories to cherish."
2021-06-27 01:20:49,stocks,"Not much really, I mean I invest more now, but that might be because im 18 now which means I can do it easily.

And even if it didn‚Äôt change anything it reinforced a feeling of not trusting anyone on the internet, if you don‚Äôt see it you should never do it and should be even more discouraged if there is a shit ton of people behaving speculating constantly about it"
2021-06-27 08:10:16,stocks,"Beyond r/options there‚Äôs a lot of noise on here. Literally anytime I‚Äôve jumped on someone‚Äôs dd it‚Äôs been bad. Although, I‚Äôve made a lot of profit with AMC GME, nothing else has worked out. Now I either short someone‚Äôs bright idea or I just avoid it and that has actually worked out really good"
2021-06-27 04:52:18,stocks,I threw everything out of the window and fomoed into memestocks
2021-06-27 05:30:41,stocks,"Before reddit I was ""buy low sell high"". Now it's ""buy high sell low""."
2021-06-27 01:31:51,stocks,"I've noticed I hold less now, gonna try working on that. Then again the stock I held was Tesla from 250 to 900 pre split. (I'm still a bit salty on that one) and AMD from 18 to 36."
2021-06-27 00:43:08,stocks,It made me trade options which I would probably never have considered otherwise
2021-06-27 08:38:12,stocks,Found r/bogleheads.  It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in a lot of stuff.  Boglehead has kept me sane and level through the chaos of the last 6 months.  With an emergency fund and boglehead strategy I can unemotionally invest snd not worry up or down.  The market ‚Äúis what it is‚Äù. Can‚Äôt control it so why try?
2021-06-27 03:20:10,stocks,Helped me grow from $35k to $2.5M in 1.5 years so I have a lot to be thankful to Reddit for
2021-06-27 02:59:58,stocks,Is this the Reddit IPO? I'm looking for a Reddit IPO.
2021-06-27 11:08:18,stocks,"I‚Äòm only at the stockmarket because of reddit.

Made 300% in 4 Month."
2021-06-27 01:16:46,stocks,I've made a few pennies off the memes

2021-06-27 00:12:04,stocks,Zero
2021-06-27 07:30:29,stocks,"Not at all. I started my investment journey before reddit by reading the classic books on the subject. After that If ormed my plan, backed by research, and acted on it. The end result was very much a ""Boglehead"" style but I did it all long before I ever saw their sub.



I've seen bull and beat market, all kinds of pumps and dumps. I've stayed true to my plan and so far it's worked fine. It's not the best, I'll not retire tomorrow, but the worst I ever saw during the Corona crash was - 18%."
2021-06-27 07:41:59,stocks,"I was doing my own research and stocks that i liked i was aiming for low volatility high yield dividend I was up decent amount... around 10% 

My first call with Pfizer because they were working on a vaccine and didn't sell when the news came out and got slatted. Turns out after big news the stock falls because everyone sells the news. 

Still up like 15% up to the year from March to December

Then I actually paid attention to reddit, now I'm up 600% since January"
2021-06-27 08:01:56,stocks,"Over the course of about a year, I went from holding a low-cost index fund in Vanguard to day trading on thinkorswim. It‚Äôs been quite a ride.

Edit: day trading may be inaccurate. Some are short term trades and options bets and others are medium to long-term holds"
2021-06-27 08:29:30,stocks,I use Reddit as a tool. Someone says something interesting about a stock with good evidence. I then look more into it then decide if its a buy or not.
2021-06-27 10:47:25,stocks,As others have stated it‚Äôs definitely not something to take as gospel. But it‚Äôs definitely opened my eyes to other viewpoints and stocks for me to do my DD on.
2021-06-27 11:36:36,stocks,"I had etfs almost 4 years.  Started reading  all the reddit info Communities and the dd on corruption to small businesses was so sickening I changed over everything I had.  So yep, reddit influenced me in a good way, a great way!  I'm doing very well now!  And I love Millenials too!  (From Old hippee boomer!)"
2021-06-27 11:57:19,stocks,"It got better over time, Buy high and sell low."
2021-06-27 12:43:20,stocks,"Reddit introduced me to the concept of FIRE four years ago.

I was always a good saver and saved nearly half of my income even when my husband and I only brought in 40k per year total. In 2017, I got a job paying twice that and had no idea how to appropriately ‚Äúuse‚Äù my new salary and cash so I spent a lot of time searching Reddit to see what others did in this scenario and came across fire, later followed by this sub and others.

Now, we make double that again with a similar lifestyle, are on track to retire in our late forties, and I read Reddit every day for financial discussions and fun. I like reading other‚Äôs financial stories but r/stocks does give me some ideas for stocks to research and DD, but also serves as a good barometer for market sentiment in certain industries like tech."
2021-06-27 04:18:25,stocks,"Damn Reddit managed to plant FOMO deluxe into my brain during the GME Hype. i always thought that  i will never be affected by FOMO.

A friend of mine got out of GME with huge succes (Like 500% plus on a 50k ‚Ç¨ investment) and I liquidiated a big portion of my portfolio for GME just for GME to crash. 

My Broker (Trade Republic from Germany) was not available for a whole day as i saw my money vaporizing in front of my eyes.

So Reddit teached me that i am in fact not immune to FOMO. Even better it teached me how fcking stupid i was as i watched my previously liquidiated stocks keep rising higher and higher.

FML

I now have 5 stocks that i will not touch for at least 5 years even if the world collides."
2021-06-27 06:44:44,stocks,"Did reddit impact my investment strategy?

Yeah, yes it did. I started doing it. I started investing because of reddit.

Why? 

I was - for the first time in my life - exposed to people who were actively investing instead of just being told to send money to a mutual fund. Sending money to a mutual fund (which I had been doing) is about as exciting as going to church. Thoughts and prayers shit. You aren't engaged by thoughts and prayers, your role is passive. It's fucking boring.

Reddit exposed me to people who were actually doing things. Instead of sitting on my ass praying, I was making the things other people were praying about happen. I, I was doing it. And I was in the middle of a bunch of crayon eating, window lickers who were doing it as well. Did we fuck up a lot? Sure. That's why we eat crayons and then lick windows to get the taste out of our mouths, but we were doing it - like a bunch of five year olds learning T ball.

So, here we are, beating the fuck out of hedge funds like a bunch of five year old T ball players swarming the Ump, all of us swinging our tiny little bats, biting the shit out of ankles. It's amazing.  And, on top of it, I'm making a decent return. Me. Making informed bets and winning every so often.

What's not to love?"
2021-06-27 06:30:50,stocks,"It made me start investing in stocks (until then I was only in ETFs and looking into stocks). It also made me realize I don‚Äôt really want to be trading stocks, so now I‚Äôm looking for the best time to cashout and reinvest it back into ETFs. 

I‚Äôm really not the ‚Äúlook into your portfolio everyday‚Äù kind of guy, so while I catch the bullish momentum of some stocks, I rarely detect the downfall, so I‚Äôm much better with the ‚Äúdump and forget‚Äù logic of ETFs. I‚Äôm in for the long term, so is the best strategy for me.

I‚Äôll miss some big gains for sure, but also some big losses.

In any case it was a big learning opportunity so I‚Äôm thankful for this community."
2021-06-27 02:32:21,stocks,It hasn‚Äôt
2021-06-27 04:53:41,stocks,I have  x10 BB i probably wouldn't have bought if I hadn't been influenced. But you live and learn... I am now in for the long

2021-06-27 06:09:50,stocks,"If anything, I think they've told me that ""risk is ok"" and to take it. I've been mostly in blue chips my entire trading career.  Maybe buying NKLA at $93 was a bad move...ok got it. But others have been doing well and making money, returns that I wouldn't realize on blue chips.  Now, that said, I still have my blue chips, but I've opened up to more risk and found it's not so scary due to various Reddit threads."
2021-06-27 07:58:37,stocks,"Almost entirely changed. Like some of the others commenters, I‚Äôm not going to entirely change my investment strategy on a whim. That being said, I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed reading so many different investment strategies other Redditors have, which has allowed me to pick and choose the parts I thought applied best for my situation.  I‚Äôm still developing my strategy and I‚Äôm not quite at the position where I‚Äôve fully implemented my plan, but I should be there in another year. Then I just have to worry about maintaining the strategy."
2021-06-27 08:09:47,stocks,Got lucky and 20x my money. I now I have a major gambling addiction.
2021-06-27 08:41:03,stocks,Reddit was the big catalyst for my investment and helped my account triple since last year. Very thankful for this community.
2021-06-27 08:51:25,stocks,Reddit gave me a choice of a red blue or blue pill. I made my choice free will.
2021-06-27 09:03:37,stocks,"I made a few grand off of meme stocks. I wouldn't have bought them without that push because they just don't have the fundamentals in place to support their stock price being that high. 

I don't have that much invested, but I went from $1800 to $20,000 last year without doing ""risky"" calls or puts. Just straight buying and selling."
2021-06-27 10:17:56,stocks,"Prior to Reddit, I‚Äôve always wanted to invest but was too chicken to hit the send button because I always thought investing was too risky and I‚Äôll lose everything. I learned a lot about the different index fund/ETFs I can safely invest in. I still yolo a lot but thanks to Reddit it opened a whole new world for passive income."
2021-06-27 10:24:50,stocks,It actually created my investing strategy. The only contact I ever had w/ the market was IBM stock my aunt gifted me when I was a kid. I thought the market was WAY too complex for a non-math kid (I‚Äôm a lawyer) to get involved in. Pleasantly a lot of the subs here have had amazing advice on everything from dividends to growth stocks and I definitely have more of an understand of the market and am actually excited to be invested and building my future. Also it‚Äôs Reddit so don‚Äôt take everything on it for a gospel truth lol
2021-06-27 11:09:10,stocks,My entire strategy is based on Reddit. So far i'm up 1000%
2021-06-27 11:32:39,stocks,The only thing I use Reddit for is when I see a ticker that wasn't on my radar.
2021-06-27 16:35:20,stocks,Made a ton of money riding meme stocks and selling to Reddit investors at ATH who were thinking these stocks were going to be worth 10k a share.
2021-06-27 01:59:50,stocks,It made me short GME calls on Thursdays and Fridays based on all the crazy hype.
2021-06-27 02:07:03,stocks,This seems to be going towards a collusion play. I liked this stock on my own and I will continue to hold it until my sell point is met.
2021-06-27 06:38:56,stocks,Yep. From 0 to XXk on stock market.
2021-06-27 09:08:07,stocks,I used to invest in companies to secure a 10-20% return in swing trades. Now I just yolo my money into AMC and GME.
2021-06-27 07:06:40,stocks,"I'm 100% invested on game stop, so it changed....nothing?"
2021-06-27 06:50:48,stocks,Reddit is such an awful place. It should only be used for entertainment.
2021-06-27 09:30:34,stocks,"yeah i used to be long mutuals

Then I went 100% into the gee emm eeeeee"
2021-06-27 01:37:53,stocks,"It tipped me off on Lumen and Viacom which are green, but probably my two worst performers, so there's that. 

More generally it has made me more skeptical of claims about companies and exacerbated my contrarian streak."
2021-06-27 03:52:01,stocks,Reddit was the app that actually got me into investing and I do use to check people‚Äôs opinion on other stocks but I don‚Äôt use it too much.
2021-06-27 04:27:12,stocks,Not at all - I'm still a dumb fuck.
2021-06-27 05:13:08,stocks,Made me aware of options. Still doing my research and haven‚Äôt done anything yet
2021-06-27 05:19:34,stocks,I leaned so much in a short time period. I am grateful
2021-06-27 05:57:08,stocks,We are the future
2021-06-27 06:25:29,stocks,"Not much, I mainly come for confirmation bias. They did show me PLTR and wheel trading which worked out"
2021-06-27 06:28:55,stocks,You use something other than reddit?
2021-06-27 07:06:16,stocks,"It changed me from investing semi-blindly into a partial technical trader, and it‚Äôs primarily because I don‚Äôt want to do what some on WSB do and yolo my money into risky plays."
2021-06-27 07:17:18,stocks,"Reddit has influenced my strategy a lot. Before I didn‚Äôt yolo into a stock after reading DD, now I buy meme stocks after reading DD."
2021-06-27 07:58:03,stocks,My investment strategy was time deposit and forget. Reddit helped me discover other sources of investing and the stock market.
2021-06-27 08:35:57,stocks,"I started investing in stocks last year and it's fair to say I was initially drawn into a lot of the Reddit hype. I made some good money on some of it, and lost a shit load on other over hyped stocks. 6 months on I learned my lesson and decided to pick up a few books and looked at alternative sources for investing and I believe I'm on a better path now of looking at the funamentals of a company rather than getting sucked into the hype. These days I ignore 90+% of what is being hyped on Reddit, but you can still find some good stuff here and there."
2021-06-27 08:36:45,stocks,"Well I use it for a combination, I‚Äôm not American, so using Reddit led me to good stock picks such as O. However I must admit I also use Reddit to see what stocks I should avoid. Usually when Reddit hypes up a stock it‚Äôs about to crash or slowly bleed out."
2021-06-27 08:39:10,stocks,YOLO $DKNG. Might have done it anyways but seeing so many high risk derivatives moves my YOLO felt mild.
2021-06-27 08:40:39,stocks,I started by investing in several companies using one brokerage account. Now I own shares of just one company spread between several brokers.
2021-06-27 08:43:58,stocks,"Sometimes, I jump on the bandwagon to attempt to make a few quick bucks.

If I'm trading a stock and it becomes a fave here, I watch it closely and will consider getting rid of it."
2021-06-27 08:48:59,stocks,"It used to be a good place. Now it‚Äôs just meme stock this, and to the moon that. It really started with ARKK and TSLA, every other post would be about someone asking if going 70% into Ark Funds and 30% in TSLA was a good idea."
2021-06-27 08:52:50,stocks,"Reddit and to a lesser extent YouTube is what turned me on to investing in general, I went down the FIRE rabbit hole and starting putting money into index funds in tax advantage accounts. 

It's also influenced the choices of stocks I've bought with my $400 Robinhood account which is currently 95% in SPCE."
2021-06-27 09:00:07,stocks,"The cesspool of degenerates that is Reddit, made me change my strategy to listening to BRKA annual meetings‚Ä¶"
2021-06-27 09:04:42,stocks,None. Increased my conviction though.
2021-06-27 09:13:59,stocks,"I only started investing back in March. My original plan was to find businesses that were hurt by the pandemic but I felt had a chance of recovering now that things are opening back up. 
After joining Reddit I learned about ETFs and dividends. I began expanding my portfolio into other sectors. So yeah Reddit definitely helped me learn better ways to invest."
2021-06-27 09:14:27,stocks,"I would say it has made me a touch more conservative and diligent. I've always been big on the research aspect of investing even before reddit, its a hobby to me, but reading some of the horror stories on here definitely has made me a bit more gunshy and thorough before I even think of placing an order. 

Of course, my most successful individual holding, Digital Turbine, I was blacked out at a beach bar, and invested on a whim on the advise of some 21 year old frat bro...so...yeah"
2021-06-27 09:16:02,stocks,"I started because of Reddit. I bought close to top of gme and sold very shortly after. Panicked. Realised I could turn this into a money making hobby. 

I realised thanks to daytrading Reddit a lot of common mistakes. 

""Average down"" doesn't really work at a day trading level, it's for long term holds. 

Stop losses are your friend. Use them. 

Record your trades. You'll stop your mistakes so fast. 

Number a trades a day doesn't make you better. 1 safe trade can earn far more than 50 high risk plays.

Stop when your up. I've had 100%+ trades with BBBY, wendies and woof interweek, but the first 2 I stupidly went back in at the top and lost gains plus some with BBBY. Emotions are dumb."
2021-06-27 09:17:46,stocks,"I started following a lot of meme stocks, but I haven‚Äôt taken any positions based on Reddit."
2021-06-27 09:24:43,stocks,It made me realize how easy money dumb money is. Reddit kids never factcheck anything. Ever.
2021-06-27 09:25:05,stocks,I only day trade high volume meme stocks now.
2021-06-27 09:28:06,stocks,Good god please don‚Äôt let a social media strategy site change your investing strategy. It‚Äôs a good place to get info but don‚Äôt base your finances (or your relationships. Or your health ) solely on the comments of random unqualified strangers.
2021-06-27 09:30:32,stocks,"I started investing a couple years before I joined reddit, so I already had a general idea in mind about a strategy when I started.  Over time goals have changed, and that has caused changes in my investment strategies.

Reddit has been a great resource in expanding my view of markets and investing in general and in specific ways.  Crowd-sourcing ideas and strategies helps close the gap between individuals and institutes."
2021-06-27 09:33:04,stocks,Well I went from not investing to just yoloing meme stocks for weed money
2021-06-27 09:46:44,stocks,"i use reddit to inform myself. i seldom invest in any dds, but there are rare cases where i see a post and 15 minutes later i invest in it. 
but only if i understand the concept. if i have no clue about an topic or an company i dont.

my investments are always high risk high reward. and so far it went good.

i could spend time looking for companies myself but when i do i always land in asia / taiwan and cant invest in these companies from here"
2021-06-27 09:47:59,stocks,"‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù

I like to browse Reddit to see what everyone‚Äôs buying and I‚Äôll know by then it‚Äôs at or near the peak. This helped me sell out of ARK funds and solar companies at the start of the year.

Then there‚Äôs things people call falling knives or moan about being down 50% or more, it‚Äôs mostly because they bought meme stocks but sometimes there‚Äôs value ‚Äî I‚Äôve been buying a lot of Chinese companies this year based on the negative social media sentiment."
2021-06-27 09:51:13,stocks,I didn't trade options before Reddit.  Very mixed blessing there.
2021-06-27 10:01:08,stocks,"Not much. Most of my investments that have done well really havent been talked about much online or in the news. Which is a bit supricing to me since some stocks are so damn obvious buys .. and very predictable for a while. 

But some stocks are nice to see on reddit but I think most know that reddit doesnt push any stock.. its other big money that do that job. So when ever I can see which bank is buying a stock (which broker), then I can tell if they know something that I dont.. they tend to buy in heavy before a pop. Or before they release what ever they know. Its quite interesting and not all stocks show this.."
2021-06-27 10:03:25,stocks,"I don't know about changing my strategy, but I got into a lot of stocks early because of the great insight from the people of Reddit. One example being $SE, which I first bought at $42 because of a Reddit post. Appreciate everyone here!"
2021-06-27 10:06:34,stocks,Reddit IS my investment strategy
2021-06-27 10:07:55,stocks,"Before Reddit I would strategize, now I trust in memes"
2021-06-27 10:09:50,stocks,Moved me from only US diversification to 40% global allocation - pretty signifiant asset allocation change.
2021-06-27 10:10:42,stocks,Absolutely not. It's Reddit.
2021-06-27 10:13:35,stocks,Zero
2021-06-27 10:14:13,stocks,Reddit IS my investment strategy
2021-06-27 10:16:08,stocks,Reddit taught me not to listen to people on the Internet
2021-06-27 10:17:55,stocks,Didn‚Äôt change me 1 bit. I was ‚ÄúBogle head‚Äù and always will be. In fact I found whole community of Bogle heads!
2021-06-27 10:19:39,stocks,I learned that your not only investing in a company but also gambling on the outcome of the price... The fact that price can be manipulated more by the gamblers rather than investors is a fundamental disparity that will forever destroy the economic structure of the market.
2021-06-27 10:24:07,stocks,It is good help while making second opinion
2021-06-27 10:32:10,stocks,"I realized that my DD has actual substance. I used to assume everyone did the same DD I did, but everyone Has a much simpler DD, for example technical analysis. Me personally, I consider P/E, profit margin, ROE, and the dividend yield of a business, and my current favorite S&P 500 pick is VZ, based on my analysis, and is about 9% of my portfolio."
2021-06-27 10:32:20,stocks,"Reddit inspired me to look more into alternative data such as mentions, sentiment, Twitter reactions, employee reviews etc. I took all that data for hundreds of public companies and put it on a dashboard that‚Äôs updated daily, [DilliBits.com](https://DilliBits.com). So far, it‚Äôs been very interesting."
2021-06-27 10:35:24,stocks,No effect
2021-06-27 10:36:24,stocks,"I have always invested based on fundamentals. Now I pay more atention to technicals and sentiment. I wouldnt say I time the market, but i do have better timing now."
2021-06-27 10:38:37,stocks,"yea I came here with the idea of putting 90% in Spy and 10% in riskier stocks (like AMD omg) and now I have 20% spy, 40% growth, 20% options, 20% penny stocks lol."

2021-06-27 11:22:22,stocks,"I've started investing in the things that people recommended who were downvoted to shit . Most people in this sub and other investing/trading subs are legitimate idiots who have only gotten into the stock market in the past year, check their account history. So when I see someone downvoted for recommending people invest in something like VOO/VTI/QQQ or ""companies you KNOW"" instead of the Reddit hype stocks it meant something to me.

Since then, I've essentially dumped all my holdings and now only have 3 holdings in my portfolio. VTI, QQQ, and NVDA and couldn't be happier. I haven't looked at my portfolio in 4 months and I'm up 45% on NVDA and ~7% on VTI/QQQ. They aren't insane gains but I would guarantee they're better than the majority of people dishing out investing advice here on Reddit."

I don‚Äôt invest based on what people on Reddit say, but it‚Äôs taught me to research my investments in depth and ignore emotions when investing. Being able to hold through red when I need and hold on gains when needed.

I‚Äôm still actively learning, but just those few things learned from Reddit has probably kept me from losing a lot of money."

I used to try to talk about tesla before it's 100x run and I would get downvoted instantly and no good discussion.... everyone on Reddit just saying index funds which is a great thing if you don't know how to pick stocks but this is a stock sub so I'd expect more people talking stocks here

Anyway it's not worth it for me to do hours and hours of research just for a 10% annual return. Perhaps if I have 5 figures to invest I would, but I've only invested 1 weeks worth of wages across my entire portfolio so far, so I use reddit to discover new stocks or keep an eye on my current ones. For me it's fun and gambling. For serous amounts I plan on putting my money into ETFs and Treasury bonds. Mostly the latter."

I hold a solid green Portfolio with nice growth and dividend payouts... Then a few months ago i find Riddit....I started a WEBull account and although ive had what seems to be alot of red I have made some really good gains that outweigh the red..Riddit has put me in a mindset that i can make my weekly paycheck and I can also now double or triple my income weekly...Riddit has helped me let go of the emotional part of investing and now win or loos im having me a damn good time....

Sometimes people have real gems of comments which I do find incredibly useful, but normally these are people that work in that industry and have real insights to provide. 

I agree redditor knows a lot more about tech than other industries (I work in tech myself). Reddit also loves talking about Biotech, but that industry is generally way to volatile for me and I think most of the time Reddit talks about it's a pure pump and dump.

For the most part I've shifted back to fully my own investment style & DD, although I still do a lot of browsing and if a nugget shows up (that isn't a meme stock), I'll look into it more myself."

So from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all for sharing your wisdom and experience. I wish I would have done this years ago.

Boglehead or longterm investing wasn‚Äòt my choice, esp. in this market, because return is minimal and the likelihood of a crash big. Candlestick trading isn‚Äòt sth for me either, i need to read more on that it seems. I‚Äòm just not good enough already.

ABEV is another one. Saw a good post on it, did my own research and saw it had by far the best numbers of all the other beer manufacturers and also had some potential due to Brazil currency, and make a great return on it.

A good example could be industry regulation. People think corporations in that industry may lose value. But that‚Äôs backwards, that means the industry is growing and powerful. Likely the big players lobbied and wrote the legislation to stifle new competition.

All the better if you find the headlines in regular news or social media. Because if it‚Äôs in a niche for serious investors, the.

2021-06-27 10:52:24,stocks,">A good example could be industry regulation.

100% agreed. 

A rather obscure, but very clear-cut example is some FUD around the Peruvian presidential election. When it became clear who would win (Castillo), there was a lot of FUD in anything with exposure to Peruvian mines, because Castillo grabbed headlines by saying he would nationalize all the biggest mining operations in the country. 

Anything that tanked as he emerged the winner over the course of May was failing to take into account that he has since walked back this position (likely because Peru's Congress will never allow it), and has instead said he only wants to raise taxes. 

However, the irrational fear of ""ZOMG socialism"" holds strong, particularly in the US, so that fear is baked into prices regardless of reality."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Lightning eMotors (ZEV) added to the Russell Microcap Index. Undervalued commercial EV play with sector dominance and strong growth What I like about Lightning eMotors (ZEV) is that they dominate a niche space that stands to grow very quickly. Rather than focusing on ""last-mile‚Äù lighter-duty vehicles, which would compete with high volume manufacturers, they use a medium-duty legacy chassis to take advantage of existing ‚Äúupfit ecosystems‚Äù that  class 3-7 fleet commercial fleets actively depend on. This means easy electrification of ambulances, street cleaners, refrigerator trucks, and lifts as well as universal access to easily sourced spare parts for critical maintenance. 

While preserving fleet owners' capital investments, their legacy chassis strategy also gives them a first mover advantage by clearing them of all federal and state safety certifications, thus removing a major time and logistics obstacle.  This is why Lightning eMotors already has over 50% marketshare. 

Because the vehicles are designed for long lifespan and they are expensive to modify, fleet operators commonly change out drive trains rather than buy new vehicles. Now, because of sound economics and government mandates, instead of a new diesel drive train, they are moving to electric. This growing demand is why ZEV is dramatically expanding its Colorado-based facility and is expected to grow 195% CAGR over the next 4 years. 

Overview of some key points:

* First mover advantage ‚Äî They‚Äôve shipped more than 3x biggest competitor and currently control more than 50% market share in class 3-7 EV.
* Quarterly YoY revenue growth: 560%
* 2021 projected revenue is 100% contracted with pipeline of $800 million in sales
* Zero Debt and Low Capex assembly of vehicles 
* Projected 195% CAGR with $2 billion revenue by 2025 driven by government and corporate mandates to electrify commercial fleets.  That kind of revenue relative to their current $662 million market cap offers a sense of the value proposition, especially with a $67 billion TAM
* As the largest US-owned medium-duty commercial EV company, Lightning eMotors they will uniquely benefit from Biden's recently announced plan to replace entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles under the ‚ÄúBuy America‚Äù mandate.  The Biden White House says, ""Biden‚Äôs order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to ‚Äúleverage the federal government‚Äôs footprint and buying power to lead by example.‚Äù  
* Medium-duty portion of Federal fleet electrification plan is 110,000 vehicles that only Lightning eMotors is currently equipped to handle. This represent a 5x of their entire 2025 projected revenue of $2 billion.  CEO Tim Reeser says they are currently working with USGSA on this new development.
* ZEV already sell to 30 fleets representing 500,000 vehicles and has strategic partnerships and contracts with DHL Express, Amazon, USPS, IKEA, Ford, Shyft, Plug Power, Proterra, BP, Romeo Power, ABC, Borg Warner, Winnebago, and the State of California.  DHL Express is expected to deploy their vehicles in California and New York later this year.
* Use of legacy chassis takes advantage of existing fed and state certifications along with entire medium-duty upfit ecosystem (ambulance, lifts, chillers and spare parts),which is critical for fleet owners. 
* ZEV can build from ground up or re-power drivetrains of existing fleets. Re-powering is most common in this medium-duty class designed for long mileage.  This enables fleet owners to continue using already customized vehicles thus extend the value of significant capital investment.
* Proprietary scalable analytics and proven operational savings for fleet customers.
* Offers fleet financing and patented mobile charging technologies and charging as a service (CAAS) which they are expanding to commercial and government fleets via its Lightning Energy division.
* Large patent portfolio
* Lightning eMotors has the largest commercial electric production facility in the US. Moreover, they are currently doubling their work force and quadrupling their Colorado-based manufacturing facility to meet accelerating demand. ‚ÄúCombined, the expansion and new equipment ensures that we‚Äôre ready for continually increasing demand and the growth of the business.‚Äù  Expansion plans are fully funded with no need of debt and they‚Äôve signed leased to allow further 5x or more expansion. (1 million square foot campus)
* Oppenheimer analyst team are bullish with a $15 PT (75% upside) using a discounted to peer 6x sales multiple and their more conservative 169% CAGR estimate: ‚ÄúWith Lightning's diverse supply chain, demonstrated capability in delivering numerous vehicles types, and optionality on either growing through powertrain development, full vehicle sales, or being a leading integrator of fuel cell-based power systems, we believe ZEV shares offer investors meaningful upside potential.""

2021-06-27 01:59:12,stocks,This stock burned me. Suddenly.
2021-06-27 03:55:55,stocks,"I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:  
  
\*\*\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \*\*\*  
  
CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:  
  
""It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""  
  
Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:  
  
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI  
  
So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.  
  
\*\*\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \*\*\*  
  
Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  
  
A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  
  
Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability  
  
All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  
  
Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.  
  
\*\*\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \*\*\*  
  
Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.  
  
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021  
  
An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  
  
\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS  
  
\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category  
  
\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.  
  
So, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!"

Especially if they struggle to get feet back in the door as areas re-open, I could see a CVS or Walgreens buying them out for the space if we see any of the competition growing rapidly .... definetly something to watch for that I really wasn't thinking about. 

Being in the stock for so long, do you think it was overvalued and headed towards a more realistic price, say, 12.50 ? Or do you think the quarterly reactions got a little carried away and the stock is going to pull back up? I see it sold off from 40 to like 6 bucks a few years ago. OUCH. Don't wanna get caught in something like that. 

When I first saw the sell off i was like, ""Rite Aid? Dude thats goin back up forsure and then I looked at the 4Y chart and listened to an interview w the CEO and now I'm like uuuh idk this might tank from where it was and stay down for awhile.  To be frank I sold an $18 and $17 weekly put on the way down and now im trying to figure out if I should dump the shares on Monday or hold to ride it back up... decisions decisions."

2021-06-27 09:41:11,stocks,"All this assumes that the Whole Foods acquisition has been a success which it really hasn‚Äôt been. Amazon barely mentions WF in their quarterly reports despite it being a $16B business. It was a $16B business in 2016 the year before they bought it, so it hasn‚Äôt grown at all. They‚Äôve had revenue decline in physical stores 5 out of the last 6 quarters while Target, Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons are putting up double-digit growth. 

It also ignores that Amazon is currently under antitrust scrutiny and pressure to get smaller, not bigger. Rite Aid is close to a penny stock but they are a huge company by revenue. It won‚Äôt be allowed."

2021-06-27 09:36:10,stocks,"2 failed mergers with Walgreens years ago. The FTC claimed it would be a monopoly eliminating the 3rd drug store option and giving WAG too much power in the industry.

The possible buyouts were rumored to come from AMAZON but that is not happening. 

I work for the company and they are lost. 2nd quarter sales are promising, but will be with most retailers as things begin to open , so proceed with caution. I would love to see the company turn itself around but they do not focus on the real issues the company has and instead places a bunch of 'innovative' concepts at the top of the list every few weeks/months just to satisfy shareholders.

They have supply chain issues and distribution centers (at least where I'm at) are unreliable and inefficient. Their PBM is not strong enough to compete with the pricing of WAG CVS and they don't the foothold as a household name in the drug business. People more associate rite aid with thrifty ice cream which is just a cute gimmick to get front end customers to come spend a few bucks.

I will say that it does seem to be another relatively over shorted stock, and these drops are not new. It appears there are massive sell offs at every bit of negative news as it RAD is some company on verge of bankruptcy. They are not, and the price typically rebounds fairly quickly on the announcement of another gimmicky launch. I would hold."
2021-06-26 23:03:12,stocks,"It was a bad earnings report with analyst downgrades. Yes, the selloff was hedge funds closing out their positions."
2021-06-27 12:51:14,stocks,"First, Whole Foods is in a completely different segment.  You can't compare groceries to pharmacy / convenience goods.  So the Whole Foods experience has no relevance whatsoever to Amazon's intentions in the pharmacy sector.  If Amazon does not go big into pharmacy with an acquisition of Rite Aid or similar, then the Amazon pharmacy business will be destined to fail.  Amazon does not win in a category just by being Amazon.  In pharmacy, you need to be large enough in prescription drugs to be able to negotiate the lowest prices to compete with the likes of CVS , Walgreens , Walmart , etc.  Amazon is not even in the top 15 in the USA in prescription drug sales.   So AMZN either goes big, or they drop out and go home in this category.

Second, your entire depiction of antitrust concerns is incorrect.  The US government's use of antitrust laws is to ensure that monopolies are not created and that there is healthy competition to provide consumers with multiple options at fair prices.  Once again, Amazon has not been able to crack into the top 15 in the USA in pharmacy.  By acquiring Rite Aid with the goal of building that business out, Amazon would essentially create the 3rd pure national retail pharmacy in the USA, along with CVS and Rite Aid.  This would increase competition in the space, not decrease it.  So, Amazon could easily make an argument that taking a small regional business and growing it into a national pharmacy would be very good for the market, giving consumers more choices and increased price competition.   And we all know that lower prices for prescription drugs is a national goal of the US government."

If all those ifs work out you could make a profit."
2021-06-27 00:46:08,stocks,"Think of options as a coupon. let's say your buying a company named PAIR and you buy calls with 2 weeks of time and the current price of PAIR bf buying was $120 a share and you think it will go to $130 a share by the end of the 2 weeks bc of some up coming catalyst.  So you buy 1 options call contract ( coupon) for $2 ($200). Your basically saying hey I think the stock will go above $122 a share or higher by the end of the 2 week period. So naturally this to you is a deal.. So you buy the contract aka coupon. You have no problem paying $12200 ( $122 a share x 100 ) ( all options contacts are in 100 share qts ) by the end of the 2 weeks bc you belive it will be worth $13000 by that time, banking you a gain of $800 total. 

Well let's say the day after you bought your coupon the stock shoots up to $125. Well you know have a coupon that's worth more then when you first bought it. Now ask yourself, would you sell your coupon to me for the same price you bought it for the day bf? No, why? Bc PAIR stock is now currently worth $125 making your coupon more valubale bc PAIR is now worth  $125 or $300 more then what you bought the coupon for. 

So the reason the contract ( the option aka coupon) goes up in value in the short term is bc it's worth more then what it was the day bf. So let's say all of a sudden you don't think Apple will keep going up or you just want to collect the premium. You could sell the option ( aka coupon ) for a $300 gain and be on your way.

Know this can go in reverse just as fast as it went forward. If instead the next day PAIR was at $118 well now your coupon is worthless or worth -$200.. why you ask? Bc who would pay a extra $200 for your coupon when they could go and buy PAIR for $200 cheaper at $118.

Basically you get to collect the premium if you so choose. If you do so you can sell your coupon and ONLY collect the premium that the coupon is worth, not the shares. So you make money bc your coupon is now worth more then what is was when you bought it. 


It's confusing for sure. And this is a VERY VERY basic explanation. There's alot more that goes into it. That's why you should paper trade or read and learn options bf you invest or start playing with them. This feed is full of ppl who lost more then what they could afford bc they dident fully understand how options work. They are complicated. Please, Un.der.stand. bf you dive into them. 

Hope this helps and it's NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE."
2021-06-27 06:43:39,stocks,"Bought options eventually expire as worthless.  The price you see is what you could sell it for before the expiration date.  If the price of the underlying stock is near or more than the strike price, then it could be worth more than you paid for it.  We have no details to fully understand your question.

Now, let's assume you bought a call for $2 with a strike price of $25, then your ""break even"" is $27; $25 + $2.  That means you can't actually turn a profit unless the underlying stock is more than $27. If not, then you will lose the $2 you spent to buy the option. Absolutely do not exercise the option if you are not above break even.

I suggest doing some reading outside WSB to fully understand options.  The ones who were really pushing that trend, i.e. RoaringKitty, are actual professionals who are manipulating the markets by posting on Reddit.  There will be many shoes to drop from that nonsense. Reader beware."
2021-06-27 09:21:44,stocks,"Here‚Äôs how I organize this in my brain, in plain non-financial jargon:

Buying options: breakeven point is the goalpost for if you make money or don‚Äôt make money on the option, at any point whatsoever between buy and expiration.

Selling options: breakeven point means when I‚Äôm likely to lose my shares or money up as collateral.

As a person who typically sells calls lately, the break even point is important to me also because it tells me exactly what price I will receive in total for the shares I am holding.

So basically, it‚Äôs just the specific price that has to happen in order to have made a good choice or not.

Now, there is another moving part here and that is the price at which people are buying/selling the contract you possess. If you keep an eye on that, you might find getting rid of that contract is likely to make you more money than keeping it. This is where you should consider your own buy/sell price (which of course is part of the breakeven point, but will also show by itself under ‚Äúavg cost‚Äù or ‚Äúavg credit‚Äù.

So if you feel like the contract is worth more getting rid of it than keeping it, you‚Äôd need to factor in what the current share price is vs your breakeven point as well.

Hopefully that all made sense.

And, hopefully you won‚Äôt take that as financial advice because it‚Äôs coming from a person who is way too new at this to be giving advice."

2021-06-26 23:52:09,stocks,"At expiration, there will be no time left on the contract and so there will be no uncertainty left.  The loss of uncertainty translates to a loss in value of the contract.  You also have change on value because of stock movement heading to and from to your strike.

If your break even at expiration is 10% over the initial underlying price, your contract will gain value (especially early on) just for moving up.  As the underlying gets closer to the strike, the contract will be more likely to expire in the money and have some intrinsic value (above your break even).  If that happens when there's time left, then the extrinsic value (the value because of future possibilities) will increase, and you'll profit off of that.  This value will decrease over time if the underlying doesn't move any further, and you'll actually move from profit into loss.  You won't have met your break even at expiration."

2021-06-27 11:19:20,stocks,I mean probably
2021-06-27 15:15:17,stocks,"Options have intrinsic value and time value. If a call it out of the money (for example a 350 call when the share price is 346), there is no intrinsic value, and all of its value resides in the time left before expiry and the potential for it to cross into the money in that time.

As an option goes into the money, it gains intrinsic value. If the share price was suddenly 352, that call option has intrinsic value of $2.00 (x100). Even if it expired right now, you could exercise it and immediately sell for a $200 profit. Add on time value, figured by time to expiry, and those combined values will be the price of the contract.

As expiry approaches, time value decreases (at a rate per day called *theta*) until it is zero. Out of the money calls are worthless at that point and in the money calls are worth their pure intrinsic value. 

Break even is the price a stock will need to be when the contract expires for your contract‚Äôs intrinsic value to be equal to what you paid for it."

2021-06-27 19:50:14,stocks,"Yes and no. Most people don't exercise options, or hold on to them until they expire in the money. So in those cases, not really.

The big thing is, just making profits on the option. Realize that the extrinsic value decays very fast within 30 days of expiring, so in essence you're kind of losing money every day. If you're in the profit, and don't plan on exercising, you should entertain the thought of selling to close."
2021-06-26 23:46:21,stocks,"Legit question, even if you are 100percent sure in your prediction you did your dd and you put a price tag on the stock and  its on discount. Why would you buy an option for it and not stocks?

2021-06-27 18:34:44,stocks,Strike must be met for the option to work at expiry
2021-06-26 22:41:26,stocks,"See if this helps. 

When you buy an option contract you are really buying 2 things. 1) the option contract 2) the option (but not obligation) to buy shares at a strike price at a future date. 

You can make (or lose) on either or both. 

Example.  You pay .10 per option contract for a $10 call with strike in October.   The stock is currently trading at $8.

a) the stock starts to rise up to $9.50 in June.  Your option contract will now be trading at a higher price than when you bought it, as the value of the stock has gone up.  you can sell the option contract before exercising it.  - your stock has gone up but is still below the strike price so the value is in the contract only.  You are done, no shares in your account but you made money on the contract portion. 

If you wait for the exercise date, your option contract can lose extrinsic value (time value)as it will only be worth the intrinsic value (difference between stock price and strike price).   

If the stock goes down, your contract price will also drop. 

I think what you were referring to was the intrinsic + extrinsic price of the option is higher than what you bought and so you are up.  

The break even only comes into play if you are waiting until the exercise date to exercise.  Then the break even is the cost of the stock +the price you paid for the contract.  

So in this example : 
break even = (value of shares + option cost)/number of shares. 
= ($10 x 100 shares ( 1 contract) + (.10 x 100))/100
=($1,000 + $10) / 100
= $10.10 break even. 

Obviously if the price is below strike price at exercise date you lose the cost of the option contract and don‚Äôt get the shares. 

Please feel free to comment if I missed something. 

Hope this helps.

2021-06-27 00:05:06,stocks,"It really depends though on what your investing goals are. In terms of absolute dollar amount, it makes sense to buy calls on a stock for short term gain. You need way less money (the premium) and the leverage can give you a nice reward. Granted it can expire worthless, but given you can use smaller amounts of starting money, you could have put the rest into a regular ETF to de-risk. This is not well advertised by people on Reddit, but you can also get out of an option before expiry and eat the loss. That means you can play options just like stocks and get in and out of them as necessary."

I would not buy any retail stock at the moment, but there are a few names I like better. M at least holds some property, and has the scope to address a broader customer base, in vastly more locations. They'll likely need to consolidate and close up some weak performers, but at least there's a little value there. DDS gets an F for innovation and future growth, but has an A+ balance sheet. At least when they go under, they'll have assets to sell. LVMHF is obscenely overpriced, and isn't apples to apples against JWN, but it's one of the few I'm comfortable saying will make it through any retail apocalypse. It's not a ""competitor,"" but I'd even prefer KSS. It's a poorly run company, but trades closest to book value.

I do like them better PVH, LB, and the now private Tailored Brands. And of course more than Saks or the now defunct Lord and Taylor.

The point your salty ass is failing to grasp is that it is possible to build ""a substantial amount of capital"" just by having a decent middle class job and practicing good saving/investing habits for a few years. The analogy you're going for is garbage because nobody is saying to just dump your 2K in SPY and forget about it-- you continue to add to your position with whatever you can afford to save, that's how you build wealth with ETFs.

My first priority is always going to be boomer-investing into retirement accounts, because that is statistically the most effective way to build wealth over a long time horizon. As long as you're within a few standard deviations of the average income and civilization doesn't collapse, it works for anyone eventually.

But it doesn't have to be a zero sum game between passive indexing and crunching the numbers on bigger risk/rewards. I've always devoted a chunk of my portfolio for fun stuff and pipe dreams, and as I've progressed in my career and begun to feel more secure with what I have in my retirement accounts, the amount of risk I'm comfortable taking on in my taxable account has grown exponentially. 

We're all here in /r/stocks hoping to beat the market sometimes, so I totally get what you're saying. But boring, long-term strategies with at least a portion of your capital will *at worst* protect you if you fail at that, and *at best* give you the security to chase bigger prizes.

As for the basics, I have a few books: Benjamin Graham Security Analysis, Options as a strategic investment by Lawrence McMillan. They are both available at your local libraries. Mad Money by Jim Cramer is a fun read. Jim's show is mostly for entertainment nowadays but he made some good points from time to time.

The Graham book is about fundamentals of a stock. The ""technical"" research is about reading the stock chart and making a guess of which direction it would go next. I found the cup-w-handle technique by Investor Business Daily website had some merit.

Nah, I'll stop you real quick mate. First of all, I've personally read Black Swan, Antifragile, and the Technical Incerto. I like and share the ideas he expresses, but I could never read other Incerto volumes because I know that it will still be the exact same shit and it gets boring really quick.

By the way, as part of my degree I studied on his hedging textbook and his statistical textbook. I'm not sure how ""he proves that my degree+career is worthless pseudoscience"" considering that: 

1. My degree is exactly the kind of degree that he's a professor in (at NYU Tandon)
2. My (ideal) career is basically the same thing he currently does for Universa Investments.

According to you he's a professor (and academic reviewer) in a worthless pseudoscientific degree and he considers his own profession worthless pseudoscience. Not sure if you can see the absurdity in your claims.

My criticism has never been of the ideas, but of him as a person and of his writing style (since in his case the two things are basically one and the same).

He is a ridiculously arrogant and (ironically) fragile individual with a **huge** ego. His writing style perfectly reflects that and makes for an extremely unpleasant reading experience. He's a good ""probabilistic philosopher"", but a shit human and an even more shit writer."

They dont want Google tied to any legal problems.

The only way this will be worth it is if they can do it without drivers and I dont think they can. I dont think the tech is anywhere close to being able to replace a human except on very limited pre-programmed routes. But the sandbox solutions has very poor scalability...

Actually most services that uses maps are actually using the map services provided by Google or Apple, and a lot of the servers used are just leased from cloud services that are dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Most big apps usually have capacity leased from at least two providers to avoid down time if one provider goes down. 

So in a sense these tech companies already get paid for the part they do best, which is provide server and infrastructure software, and leave the management of the service and user interface to the other company. 

Here is an article that details the infrastructure of Uber and Lyft 

https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/opinions/buying-cloud-scale-lessons-lyft-and-uber/

2021-06-27 13:42:53,stocks,"Enterprise in this case would be the current drivers. Those guys are running a cab business thus, enterprise.

Costs will depend on how much it costs to acquire drivers and clients. Brand recognition doesnt matter in this case. Its a chicken and egg problem. You wont get a single driver if there are no clients and there are no clients without drivers. This is what you are missing in your equation.

My guess is that it will cost around $10k per driver to start gaining a foothold. You basically need to give away rides or greatly discount them for a year or two for drivers and clients to feel this is reliable enough for their time. How much will that cost? In the meantime, there isnt anywhere near enough viewership to make up the money with ads. They will need to have millions of riders before ads can even start making a dent. So all in all, this endeavor will cost billions easily and there is no guarantee that it will even work. This would be the argument for buying an established business.

Not that I am advocating any of the above. In my mind, Google would be absolutely insane to get into the cab business without self driving perfected. Its not worth it at all."
2021-06-26 20:51:15,stocks,"Most likely not going to happen. 

Uber‚Äôs valuation is more than $100B - way more than Ford. Ford‚Äôs valuation is around 67B. Uber is even more valuable than GM. No other traditional auto manufacturing company is going to buy or even afford Uber. 

And Tesla is about $145B and they don‚Äôt have enough cash on hand to make such an acquisition. It also goes against Tesla‚Äôs business model of selling electric cars whereas Uber supports both gas, hybrid and electric. Musk doesn‚Äôt care much about ride share but he‚Äôs probably interested in using Tesla for AV in the future. 

Google will not be interested. They have approx $150B cash on hand but why buy Uber when they can use a fraction of that investment build out Waymo? They are already testing prototypes. 

Uber‚Äôs model is to disrupt cab/taxi industry. Neither Google or Tesla are that interested in cab industry as much as they are interested in their cars being driverless for consumers.

And frankly, Uber is in so much regulatory headaches around the globe for disrupting local taxi laws, no company wants to acquire them and then deal with these issues. Uber also has some serious safety and privacy issues. Besides, there‚Äôs the whole issue of drivers being seen as contract workers vs Uber employees. No company wants to deal with that headache. Probably the biggest reason why Google wants Waymo to be fully autonomous so they don‚Äôt have to deal with the drivers being employees issue."

What do you mean the technology approach is not scalable? Can you elaborate?"
2021-06-26 21:58:11,stocks,Google already owns 6% of Uber and 10% of Lyft so they‚Äôre definitely interested in that market
2021-06-26 21:33:39,stocks,">Tesla is about $145B

Not sure where you got that number. As of today Tesla's market cap is around $650B. Notwithstanding being almost $1T in January.

>It also goes against Tesla‚Äôs business model of selling electric cars whereas Uber supports both gas, hybrid and electric.

If Tesla were to acquire Uber they can simply mandate that every vehicle in the fleet be a Tesla, whether owned or rented by the driver. Gas/hybrid vehicles are not necessary to sustain a taxi service.

>Neither Google or Tesla are that interested in cab industry as much as they are interested in their cars being driverless for consumers.

Google owns Waymo which has been offering a limited autonomous taxi service in Arizona. That sounds like they're interested to me.

Taxis would also be an obvious revenue stream for Tesla. If they do in fact solve autonomous driving then Tesla could pay owners to use their cars in a robotaxi network while they are not using them. Passive income for both Tesla and their customers. [ARK did an article on this not long ago.](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-ride-hail-update/)"
2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"$NTLA and $REGN announce that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease with an infusion of CRISPR Big news in the medical field today as Intellia Therapeutics and Regeneron announce, for the first time, history-making news that they have successfully treated a genetic disease, ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene editing tool. This data was also published in the premiere medical journal, NEJM

https://ir.intelliatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intellia-and-regeneron-announce-landmark-clinical-data-showing

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454?query=featured_home

For those unaware, CRISPR is a programmable gene editing system discovered in 2012 which allows precise gene editing at a target locus. Jennifer Doudna, the founder of NTLA, and Emannuelle Charpentier, the founder of CRSP, were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

This really demonstrates the promise of CRISPR to treat all genetic diseases. 

I believe this will cause the entire sector of gene editing and maybe genomics stocks to move higher. Other stocks in this field include BEAM, EDIT, VERV, VRTX, and CRSP.

I don't feel like handing them a stack of cash or investment is inherently wrong or a bad way to raise children, because you can pair it with excellent personal finance upbringing and they'll manage their wealth properly.

I've seen others who received nothing from their parents and blow paycheck after paycheck without proper financial planning.

Look, [here is a study](https://www.afcpe.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/v24_1_61-79.pdf) on different types of financial socialization and how it affected them as they entered adulthood. Giving allowance alone is not an effective way of teaching your child good financial skills, which is why the rest of my comment - and what was really my one and only thesis - is proper financial education. Furthermore, the study shows that those who ***did not*** receive an allowance were more likely to worry about money, even after correcting for parental and individual factors (i.e., the parent's net worth, etc.). So childhood exposure to allowances are objectively not a bad thing.

Interestingly, out of all the childhood socialization techniques studied (allowance, opening a savings account, parental monitoring of spending, working for pay, and teaching donations), working for pay is the only one that ***increased*** anxiety about money.

So perhaps you should rethink your view about how to teach a child about money."

The best source for diamonds for industrial use cases is already synthesis, and diamonds require much more extreme pressures to create than graphite (both diamonds and graphite are made from the same element carbon). It's possible no one had bothered to come up with an industrial process to make graphite from cheap feedstock because there was no market, but if EVs really will need tons of the stuff that can change quickly."

While mined graphite is still among the best anode materials nowadays, this can quickly change (within years), as biogenic carbons get better and better.

What concerns me more for your investment is the intended transition to Lithium-metal anodes or at least towards Anode-free batteries (where the Lithium from the NMC is directly deposited on the current collector with a layer of artificially preformed SEI on top).

Sorry dude, but the truth is, the average person is going to take like 90 years to amass good wealth and reasonable passive income with a modest income, and even ‚Äúmodester‚Äù saving habits.

It‚Äôs easier for one to raise their hourly wage by $10, and make additional $1600 a month, than earn the same $1600 in dividends per month. You‚Äôd need at least $500,000 for the latter. 

So, right now if you make $3k a month, you should be aiming towards $6, or $8, or $10k. The way I managed
to pass the $10k mark is with professional qualification. I‚Äôm a self-taught programmer.

Now, I‚Äôm at $15 - $18k/mo, and if I want to go up to $25, $30, I know exactly what I need to do: refine process and start outsourcing, hiring people in one end, and acquiring more clients in the other.

If I take a $3k profit per programmer hired a month, I can, with around 6 to 10, to reach that $30k level. If I do a great job at that and hire 100, that means $300k. And so on.

Only now, that I make $15k/month, is that I actually think a little more about investment. I live with around $4-5 and save all the rest. Investing 10k a month is much significant when it comes to building passive
Income.

Let's take for example the company GAW you mention and calculate it last 5 years:

Total Dividend received about 20%

Share price 5 year ago 4.85 now 113 total profit = 2330%

Gross total profit: 2330+20= 2350% (amazing!!)

This company the last years is growing good !!! (i wish i was in) and as you can see almost all the profit is made by the difference between the buy and the sell of the share price.

I turn 40 this year... If I live to 60, I outlive my parents and most of my grandparents... 

So essentially, if my plan is to hold for return, I have to either buy something young enough to grow to higher dividend payouts, or high yield enough to pay for itself in under 10 years. 

Another factor is how div stocks perform against growth in a downturn... Maybe we never have another market crash. But if we did, div stocks can insulate against panic.

2021-06-27 09:26:47,stocks,"I respectfully disagree!

If it‚Äôs in a taxable account, then you‚Äôre paying ordinary income tax on it, which is worse than a commission.

If you‚Äôre in a retirement account, there are three situations:

1. You‚Äôre reinvesting the dividend in the security that generated them. Mathematically this is precisely identical to holding a stock that doesn‚Äôt generate dividends - no gain or loss.
2. You‚Äôre letting the dividends sit in your retirement account as cash. Assuming you don‚Äôt want your money sitting fallow and losing value to inflation,this is worse than any other alternative (except withdrawing the funds from your retirement funds early, which is so bad of an option I‚Äôm not even counting it.)
3. You‚Äôre reinvesting the funds in some other security inside your retirement account. Again, this is mathematically the same as going to your IRA or 401(k) website and telling them to reallocate existing funds into a different security.

None of those options is ‚Äúworth it.‚Äù

There‚Äôs exactly one situation where dividends make sense over and above just selling shares: you need a *somewhat but not precisely* regular income stream, are willing to draw down your investments to do  it, and value the convenience of having the money show up automatically rather than have to deal with selling shares. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the only actual benefit. But whenever we have these discussions the thread is full of people who *clearly* think dividends are somehow ‚Äúfree money‚Äù rather than them just a forced way of them paying themselves their own money, which is a category error. (I‚Äôm not saying this is you‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs a lot of people on this thread.)"

The amount you contribute goes up slightly if your starting salary is below 50k.  

You go to college to better yourself, study something you hopefully enjoy and make yourself more valuable than otherwise.  

Life choices matter too.  If you choose to go to an expensive out of state school, and choose to study something (because you enjoy it hopefully) that may not be the highest paying job out of school, hopefully you thought about the risk in advance and are ready for the pile of student loan debt.

1. They likely collect social security too. Which differs person to person, but the average check is 18k a year. So they actually have 78k coming in.

2. This individual probably made use of tax advantaged accounts. So there's a good chance that a decent chunk of that 78k isn't taxed. 

3. One of the biggest expenses a working individual will have is saving for retirement. When your actually retired that expense dispears and the money is freed up for other stuff.

2021-06-26 20:01:49,stocks,the way div works its a cash payout that gets taxed at approximately 20% (i think it changes with tax bracket.) then you can reinvest your div which then goes into your cost basis. so if you get the 100 dollars taxed to 80$ and reinvest bringing your total cost basis to 1080$.  then if you sell your position you are only paying taxes on gains above that 1080$. you only get taxed once on the div as well as the capital gains but capital gains tends to be higher. there are advantages to both types. with div i dont have to reinvest directly to the security that payed out the div meaning i have free cash flow but with a buyback stock i have better equity (if i dont sell) when it comes to margin consideration. meaning ill be able to leverage more.

In a normal market, your ownership of stock would be only as valuable as the dividend it returns and your interest in controlling the future decisions of the company. However, most stocks are not returning dividends anywhere close to a reasonable price for the equity itself. The same can be said for the housing market when compared to median income. Simply put, a highly bipartisan government, A nation with no culture or heritage, a seemingly infinite list of unpaid liabilities promised to government workers, a complete lack of accountability for large corporations, and an overstretched Global influence Is destined to lead to massive inflation and a complete detachment from reasonable price valuations.

It was for netherland merchants trading with India.

Multiple companies proposed this and you could buy the share ticket at the harbour office.
Soon it showed that the price of boats and crews were only 1% compared to the large amount of money made from the trade. Nobody would want to sell their share for at least what they could yield in a couple of years. Then smart people though it could be interesting to make money not on what a share could bring each year but on the difference between its value between their buying point and selling point.

2021-06-26 20:19:08,stocks,"If a company never pays dividends, then two things can happen. They can stay in business or they can go out of business.

 If they go out of business, they will liquidate. This means they will sell all of their assets and pay off their debts, any remaining money will be distributed to shareholders. This means that at the time of liquidation, shareholders will receive at least the amount of shareholder equity that exists. 

If the company never goes out of business and never pays a dividend, then other investors will buy the company from you at a certain price based shareholder equity with the idea that if the company every does go out of business, they will receive at least that much. Usually they will pay more because of potential future growth. 

In either case, shareholders legally are entitled to shareholders equity and will always receive it in one form or another. Therefore, a stock is not similar to a collectible baseball card. 

For example, if a company had a hundred billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet worth no debt and you bought it for a hundred million dollars, chances are you will almost certainly receive your hundred billion eventually even if you find nobody to buy the business from you."

That's technically true of every stock.  Fortunately, investors realize that stocks have value and will buy them if they are fire sold below market value. 


>If the company doesn't pay a dividend then as soon as people decide they don't want to hold their shares, there is absolutely nothing to prop up the price of the underlying.


Technically also true of companies with dividends.   If everyone decided a company is worthless and sells, the subsequent devaluation of the company may result in them cutting the dividend anyway.

In some cases the buyback would have reduced the perceived value of the company(the same with dividends) and then no growth would occur. When dividends are payed out the assets also fall which may often result in a drop in stock.

But if you assume that there is a given value to a company both methods will result in the same result but with taxation being deferred on asset sales as buybacks result in growth rather than cash.

They are essentially the same but there are perceptive differences and taxation differences.

Of course the perceptive differences are important since many investors now are not entirely rational, but that‚Äôs a whole different issue"

When companies do a cash buy back of the stock it is because there was no better place to put that capital and so it is returned to shareholders increasing the amount of the company each share represents. it is a return of capital to shareholders for those shares.

In a reverse split the company just waves a pen and devalues the shares by the reverse amount. Often this is done to prepare for later capital raises, to reduce share count, raise the price to meet listing requirements. 

Reverse split= BAD     Buyback=surplus Capital  Good

A stock is a part ownership of the company. If said company were to reinvest the profits, it simply means they buy more stuff that will result to more profits. An example is Amazon Game Studios. They probably bought hardware, servers, a new place to put the department in and much, much more. That also means that your share is now worth more.

A dividend is literally the company paying you out a portion of their market cap.  You could achieve that exact same outcome on your own.

My entire point, yet again, is that dividend stocks offer absolutely no financial advantage over non-div stocks.

So you've done the exact the same thing. What's teh point?  Plus remember, you can't actually do this. so the dividend is the only real way to  obtain that value.

The issue of do Dividends provide value is worth discussing, but you have to account for the time value of money.  Which is exactly what makes the dividend in hand valuable. That's the only way to remove the Time Value of Money factor b/c obviusly the dividend is in your hand today.

You can't really generalize about do dividends add or destroy value. It totally depends on what's going on wiht the company.. what kind of growth they expect and if they have better investment opportunities with which to invest those funds (creating future dividends).  All value is derived from dividends ultimately. Capital gains are just future dividends (or dividend paying capacity).  It all boils down to cash flow and risk. That is the heart and soul of Value."

&#x200B;

>I don't understand this bit about carving out a portion of the stock.  How do you do that exactly? That makes no sense?  Where are you allowed to sell your proportionate amount of the stock?

Ok.  Lets run a controlled example.  Assume you have 10,000 invested in 2 companies X and Y.  X pays a 10% div, and Y does not.  Now lets assume there is no trading going on, no financial news, nothing to effect share price and the companies are wholly equals.

Company X pays a 10% div.  You have $1k in your pocket and now have $9k invested due to the dividend readjustment.

Company Y doesn't pay a dividend, so you instead choose to sell off 10% of your holdings.  You now have $1k in your pocket and $9k invested.

You now have the exact same amount invested in both stocks, even though X paid you a dividend and you chose to replicate that scenario in non-div Y.

&#x200B;

>So you've done the exact same thing.  What's your point.

That is my point.  That dividends do not offer an advantage over traditional stocks.  Im not saying that **I want** to do this.  Id rather hold my stock and see the financials increase valuation until I'm ready to sell on my own terms.  Not received forced payouts throughout the year.

&#x200B;

>It totally depends on what's going on with the company.

Couldn't agree more with that statement.  Theres a lot that influences a stock price beyond whether or not they offer a dividend and we all certainly have different reasons for our investment strategy.  I just think its important to research and understand our strategy before dedicating ourselves to it.

Not really. It's no different than owning your own company. Say you start a real estate investing company. You buy a rental home and gets some tenants. The home goes up in value or you are able to raise rent. The intrinsic value/expected returns of the company has increased and you can sell it for more. I.e. the stock price goes up.

You can take the profit from this company and pay yourself ""dividends"" or you can reinvest it into other properties to make more money. The latter is what BH does and the company's expected returns continues to rise if they do well.

> Right but why do the stockholders think the price will rise? 

Because BH continues grows its business to become more and more profitable (expected returns). Buying stock gives you a right to that profit either in the form of dividends, buybacks, or sale of the company. If the company keeps growing, that right to profit (aka stock) similarly grows."

""When a corporation declares a dividend, it debits its retained earnings and credits a liability called dividend payable. On the date of payment, the company reverses the dividend payable with a debit entry and credits its cash account for the respective cash outflow.

Cash dividends do not affect a company's income statement. However, they shrink a company's shareholder's equity and cash balance by the same amount.""

I'll bold that last part for you since you maybe ""didn't read it in entirety"" again.

**""However, they shrink a company's shareholder's equity and cash balance by the same amount.""**

Sure.  Sometimes stock prices do rise on the dividend date.  That could be due to a multitude of reasons... but its not due to the dividend payout itself.

What part about the valuation of a company are you confused by? I don‚Äôt understand how this chain of comments supports that buying companies are akin to buying baseball cards or like the supply and demand of the public‚Äôs favourite colour of carpet driving up the price for specific colours over the other.

If you buy shares of a company, you technically have your right to tell the company what to do within your voting rights (if you buy as a retail investor, your say in a company like Amazon is like a drop of water in the ocean). As you mentioned, if investors perceive that money can be better reinvested, then they will not pay out to shareholders. If they alternatively want to give back to shareholders, maybe they will use buybacks which gives back to investors akin to a dividend.

If investors wanted to, they could sell everything within the company and pay it out to the owners of the company as a dividend. This is known as an adjusted asset valuation of a company and is seen as the floor value for the valuation of the company. To really simplify this, if the only assets and liabilities Apple had were cash of $200 Billion and debt of $135 billion, then you could value Apple at $65 billion as a floor value, because if you liquidated everything today and paid off all debt, owners would receive a $65 billion dollar dividend.

If apples earnings increases the amount of assets that ‚Äúcan be liquidated‚Äù by $10 billion every year, then why wouldn‚Äôt you increase the value of your company by this amount regardless of whether you pay it out as a dividend or not?

Aside from this, overvaluation over short periods of time eg 1 year do not trump company valuations, and this can take into several other macroeconomic factors"

2021-06-26 21:14:03,stocks,"What makes stocks intrinsically valuable? 

How does my answer not answer this question?

Ultimately, if you want to believe a stock has no intrinsic value, you can believe that, but it‚Äôs not correct. A stock has value because it is ownership of a company that has value. If you own one stock of Amazon, no, you‚Äôre not Jeff Bezos, but you own 1/504,320,000 of his company. And if you divide the value of Amazon by that, you get the value."

2021-06-26 21:25:11,stocks,"As I read OPs post I see them pointing out that dividends are not a guarantee and that there's no way for them to redeem stock for the company worth that the share represents.  I assume OP knows that stocks theoretically represent a literal partial ownership of the company.  I interpret their question to be about how that ownership manifests in gain under the hood when looked at independent of the market.

If you have $500 in a locked safe and you don't know how to open it, how much is it worth?  OP is asking about how much that safe is worth when nobody is paying them to hold it, and when the person with the key won't let them turn it in for the cash.

What does it mean to be entitled to something that cannot be redeemed except on an open market?  What is the logical end to that?"

2021-06-26 22:06:22,stocks,"> there's no way for them to redeem stock for the company worth that the share represents

There is. Selling the stock."
2021-06-26 22:11:49,stocks,"No, you get the market worth when you sell the stock.  The market worth cannot decouple the extrinsic and intrinsic value.  You can run any number of intrinsic value calculations, and market speculation can be such that the price you get still falls below that.  There is no speculation independent way of recovering your slice of the company, you can only get the market value and not necessarily the ""intrinsic"" value (unless you start muddying the waters and mixing the two such that you define intrinsic value partially by market expectations and other extrinsics).

I don't know what else to say.  No sense belaboring it any longer, though.  I know what you're saying, thanks for the discussion."
2021-06-27 01:46:20,stocks,"> There is no speculation independent way of recovering your slice of the company

So let me get this straight. Instead of selling your stock (the slice of the company that you own) for the market price, you want some mechanism to exist where you can ‚Äúredeem‚Äù it for what you believe is the true value of the company‚Äîwhich according to you, is less than market price?

I mean, you could do this and set a limit sell for far under the market price and it would be immediately filled. But why would anyone do that?

I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth having this conversation anymore."
2021-06-27 08:02:16,stocks,"I don't ""want"" the mechanism to exist, this whole time has been about answering OP's question about intrinsic value.  We have ways to calculate intrinsic value based on what we think it should be, but that's purely ephemeral, while I understood OP to be questioning how the underpinnings of the simplified theories that you mentioned are justified.  We can say we're literally entitled to part of the company, bit unless there's literally a way to get it, the shares actually only have speculative value only, which is a bit circular and reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme.

My answer is just that all of the value in a share is derived from an expectation and anticipation of an event or aforementioned mechanism being in place which eventually liquidates the value of the company, or provides some element of control.  That's the driver behind calculations of intrinsic value, but the share holds none without them.  Maybe my answer is pedantic, but I believe it addresses what OP is asking, just like the other folks in this thread who are going below skin deep DCF and other Econ 101 definitions.

It's not a text book, but the top answer articulates what I'm trying to say better than I can: https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1385/why-does-demand-for-stock-rise-when-a-company-appears-to-have-high-future-value

Basically, given our need for continuous production at certain times, we are no where near practical capacity on solar so there is absolutely no need for nuclear at this point. What does practical solar capacity mean? Basically I define it as the amount of energy that we can practically use during sun hours. Until we have enough solar just to cover that, it makes no sense to build anything else. Once this practical limit has been reached, then its time to look at options but this wont happen for a while. Possible not in a decade.

And to make matters worse for nuclear, the price of solar and batteries is still in free fall. Battery prices have declined more than 50% in the last 5 alone, with no end in site. Odds are, we will see another 50% haircut, if not more, in 10 years just from scale alone. And its highly likely we will have a few breakthroughs before then as well.

Which basically means its game over for uranium. It served its purpose but the end is coming. The articles you are reading are probably by doofuses trying to unload their crap. Kind of like how the Saudis sold a huge % of Aramco recently knowing full well that the end is coming.

If you want to play tangent, there will be tons of surplus energy in 20 years, worldwide. Tons will get grounded. A smart person might reroute that waste to produce an easy to make long term fuel. The one that makes sense is hydrogen since you can make it fairly easily without very fancy equipment. In fact, it can probably be made at home and stored in tanks for a pretty low cost.

So in other words, the only thing that makes sense moving forward is renewables and maybe/probably hydrogen as a backup. In 20 years, most homes will simply have solar + batteries. Hydrogen will be cheap so folks will buy hydrogen burning generators as a backup. Businesses will adopt all of that even sooner and they may add wind since its also getting cheaper."

>Did you read any of those links? None of it was bad.

>Leveraged debt in a growing, positive cash flow company doesn't hurt the company 

But if a company stops growing or cash flow decreases, it can turn into a noose.  

>but can actually save it and help it prosper 

The money from leveraged purchases isn't typically reinvested into the company.  It's used to buy the company.  You might as well ""buy"" a house by putting no money down, taking a loan out against the value of the house, and then renting it out to pay back the loan.  

Yes, that's a smart way of doing things, but it also means that you've put nothing into actually buying the house, and if it's not profitable, you have no vested interest in keeping it afloat.  Or in keeping it in general.  

>such as in ASO's situation (using this money to open new stores, buy product in bulk, pay off other higher interest debt, etc). Debt may look scary on a balance sheet but if it puts the company in a better position to succeed long term then it was worth it.

Debt isn't scary.  Of course it can be good.  But the leveraged purchase of ASO wasn't done to give the company capital.  The purchase was leveraged so that KKR could keep their balance sheets clean by forcing the company to take on the cost of the purchase as debt.   They then used the company's assets to subsidize the purchase.  That hurts the company in the long run.  The literal billions of dollars of debt that ASO had to pay off went straight to KKR's balance sheets as profit, instead of being reinvested in ASO."

The good news is that your income is low so you likely won't need to worry about taxes right now but that also means that you won't be getting the real advantage of an IRA right now which is tax write offs. I think you might want to also consider a personal investment account until you start taking in the big bucks at work.

2021-06-27 18:05:11,stocks,"There isn‚Äôt a graph. It‚Äôs a much more complicated formula, loosely based on the Black-Scholes pricing model but it also is affected by things like trading volume. (Some options will be very rarely traded and when volume is super low, price discovery gets difficult and bid/ask spreads widen. Almost always this results in the retail investor getting less than they should since the other side of that trade is a market maker who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about someone‚Äôs new hobby to trade in obscure and thinly traded options.)

If you stick to high volume options, then bid/ask is pretty narrow and your execution and price discovery is almost entirely dictated by the market at large. 

And options have many aspects that factor into pricing: how far away you are from the strike price, time to maturity, implied volatility of the underlying company, how sensitive that particular option is to underlying price moves, etc‚Ä¶

So you can have a situation where the underlying stock goes up, but your call option goes down in price and a put option goes up. It isn‚Äôt just whether the stock price moves up or down but whether it is doing so in a way that contextually is going to move the option you bought the way you want it to go. 

It‚Äôs a complex subject but a very interesting way to trade. Best of luck to you!"

Their battery tech is part of it absolutely. What many don't appreciate is it's one part of an overall flow of information and integration to maximize efficiency with said battery. For example you think they are lacking necessary hardware, when in reality they're not adding more than is necessary to ensure full FSD capability while preserving battery life / range. 

As far as servicing is concerned, yes, they can improve there. What you need to realize though is with a hyper growth company you're going to have many growing pains. How they respond over time to provide solutions such as including OTA updates while you're sleeping or preventing problems before you even know that they exist is what matters. And let's not pretend that traditional dealership repair models aren't a horrendous experience half the time between high costs and waisting half your day to get basic servicing done.
