Sentiment in the industry surrounding VG is they are a joke. They have no serious vehicle for their market. Nor any type of superior engineering advantage. SpaceX, Blue Origin, Relativity and Rocket Lab will dominate the marketspace in the short-mid term years. 

I wouldn’t touch VG with a 10 foot pole. Only reason they are trending is because they are the only vehicle producing company available on open market. I’d wait till Astra or Rocket Lab IPO later this year and dump money there. They are actually real space companies"

2021-06-27 19:24:25,wallstreetbets,what about the low low insider holding %??
2021-06-27 19:34:23,wallstreetbets,"NNDM 🤦

-Removed from the Tel Aviv exchange for diluting price to low.

-Moves to the Nasdaq where in 5 years diluted the share price from almost $100 to under $1.

-Diluted shares 4 times in one month in 2020.

-Over $1b from diluting within a 3 month span.

-Extremely low shares held by insiders because .... They are going to dilute this down to a penny stock again.

(Leaving out Ex CoCeo stepped down because money laundering & fraud accusations, shady acquisition with relatives garbage company and all the paid YouTube channels for pumping this garbage)."
2021-06-27 19:01:43,wallstreetbets,The ceo is a dilution machine though. If he starts seeing green he paperhands some shares for sure. Wont be participating in this one
2021-06-27 18:34:43,wallstreetbets,"I bought 4500 shares at 3.50, then sold them at 3.00 lol damn paper hands"
2021-06-27 17:52:18,wallstreetbets,It actually aired on Bloomberg on Saturday. We'll see what we get out of it this week.
2021-06-27 18:12:23,wallstreetbets,"Many growth/speculative stocks fell at least 50% from February highs. Nano Dimension suffered a over 60% drop. There wasn’t any company news that would of caused such a sell of. To me, I just think the stock had such a rapid spike in the beginning of the year and people were selling off at any price that let them secure a gain."
2021-06-27 19:02:16,wallstreetbets,"It was a combination of the bond yield, and the fact that they simply have been working harder on raising money to fund the transition in their business model as opposed to focusing on what they had been doing previously. 

NNDM is going to be a success, but I’m not so sure WSB is ready for it. After a couple more acquisitions, and the new machine hits the market, (by years end, hopefully) we’ll see good movement from the stock. I wouldn’t expect ti to rise much above $10/$11, but in 5 years time? If you get I now, you will easily double your money on fundamentals alone, and probably more now that the markets operate on speculation and hype from retail/social media."
2021-06-27 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is low. Two things I can say about that:

The CEO personally invested in the company when he joined.

[https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3140006&headline=NNDM-Nano-Dimension-president-CEO-Yoav-Stern-invests-in-company](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3140006&headline=NNDM-Nano-Dimension-president-CEO-Yoav-Stern-invests-in-company)

&#x200B;

Also, many insiders/executives from the acquired companies have warrants/options to buy the stock at a specific price later on."
2021-06-27 19:42:19,wallstreetbets,"Care to show where you saw they got ""removed"" from the Tel Aviv exchange? To my knowledge, they voluntarily left and went to where the majority of their market share is, which is America. (NASDAQ)

You have four of your five points regarding dilution. Dilution isn't the end of the world for a company. 

Fundaments are good, good growth & value play. Dilution is over, money is in the company's bank. Sounds alright to me"
2021-06-27 19:17:44,wallstreetbets,He did mention in a recent interview no more offerings are needed because they have sufficient cash to do what they envision.
2021-06-27 19:25:26,wallstreetbets,"insider holdings is already low enough, idk if him selling would effect much"
2021-06-27 17:54:20,wallstreetbets,"Oh. My bad. Thanks for the correction. 

I’ve been all about the 3D printing stock opportunities. So this seems like a good play.

But I literally know nothing. I just like the stock."

2021-06-27 19:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Here’s a bonus:

Because of 90% institutional ownership, the 8% short interest is rather significant (8% is already high for an individual stock; even tobacco and oil are under 1%, and people are gunning for them politically).

Float net of institutional ownership: 58M shares;

Short interest as of 6/15: 45M shares;

One big buy could mean every available share has short-interest, and could trigger a mini squeeze.  My assumption is at this price funds won’t unload, which is why I used the 58M number to start."

Comparing it to netflix is like saying lions and housecats are both cats.  Technically true but...  I am a former holder and made a very small amount before getting out, just worried about the pace they are improving paramount compared to hbo max and others."
2021-06-27 19:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Viac RSI is at 55 and MACD is flat on the daily. True, it could breakout, but there are better plays. To me, the money flow index at 55 is a 50/50 (more like 55/45 bearish), so I’d rather watch it, than be bullish."
2021-06-27 18:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Viacom’s run up earlier this year was entirely due to Archegos capital lighting billions of dollars on fire to control the stock/option and artificially raise the price.

Even $61 is a forward PE of 15 vs EPS of $4, which I think is quite conservative.

They could very well do $5-$6 and carry a PE of 15-20 in their industry.

Keep in mind that big banks who did secondary offering priced it at $85…"

2021-06-27 18:08:59,wallstreetbets,"They actually have updated Paramount+ a lot.  If you havent used it in a while I suggest you give it another go.  It performs just as good as Netflix’s app if not better and they added Watchlist functionality, there is no difference in the apps functionality these days.  1000s of movies added… the content library is huge.

Edit:  Just pulled up Netflix and Paramount+ and I cannot find a discernible difference in functionality except you get live television with Paramount+ and you dont with Netflix.  Its better than HBO Max, Hulu, Apple TV, Amazon Video and equal to Netflix with just as much content.  I own them all."
2021-06-27 19:49:15,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a good comparison and that popular comparison is why the stock has been  overlooked. 

P+ is streaming but it’s it’s own niche in streaming - not all streaming competes with Netflix and they aren’t trying to replace Netflix. Streaming is not going to be a 1 service game anymore that’s going to change and it already has started. 

They aren’t trying to take share of NFLX or Prime—- they’re after the final slice of the chord cutters from the cable tv market.  It’s much more of a cable tv replacement.  Afterall they still produce tons of content for Prime exclusive  (which viac owns, but Amazon pays for production and short term exclusivity) . Viac still needs Netflix afterall as a distribution partner and vice versa. 

What does Netflix not have that you’d still need cable tv for? 

Other than a shit ton of content News+live sports and a lot of tv-style programming would be up there as well as older kids/teen content. 

That is exactly where P+ is strongest, they have the nfl, ncaa, champions league, cbs news, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central , bet, cmt, smithshsonian etc etc. plus other big name content like movies and shows to come."
2021-06-27 19:17:51,wallstreetbets,"They did a stock offering right before the Archegos bomb went off.

2021-06-27 18:48:52,wallstreetbets,maybe its just me but there are probably 5 decent movies on there and zero tv shows. I got a free trial to watch the new movie infinite (total garbage) and to rewatch the indiana jones trilogy. Haven't seen anything else worth while.
2021-06-27 19:57:28,wallstreetbets,"Their debt to equity declined from 390% in 2019 to 88% right now. This is very bullish for me. The debt is not big problem for them anymore like it was 5 years ago.

Also their current ratio now is 1.78 which means they are fine with regard to their short term liabilities."
2021-06-27 19:03:37,wallstreetbets,"It all depends on your taste, I enjoyed Infinite even though it had its obvious flaws because the graphics were cool and I like Mark Wahlberg.  Watch The Stand, it was an awesome remake.  There is a lot I watch but we probably dont have the same tastes, for me Netflix has nothing I really want to watch"
2021-06-27 19:14:36,wallstreetbets,"Agree about people’s tastes.

Netflix has “Cobra Kai.”

P+ has Star Trek, iCarly, SpongeBob reboots."
2021-06-27 19:12:44,wallstreetbets,"Infinite felt like a fast and furious movie with ridiculous action and very little story. The stand looks pretty good I'll check it out. Yeah netflix has a decent show/movie once a quarter, I mostly use hbogo."

2021-06-27 18:03:40,wallstreetbets,"In the Netherlands the car sales of Telsa dropped. One reason is that there other car companys making electric cars. 
Beside that there seems to be problems with the cars: autopilot starts breaking when it should't, Cost 8500€ to fix it. Ledlights break after 2 years €1000,- each. These are 2 of the 17 complaints. They say the damage is near 30k a car. 
They are planning a lawsuit against Telsa for millions and if it spread true Europa multiple billions.

Of course they disclose it after the transaction."
2021-06-27 17:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Transitively, are you also skeptical of the auto manufacturers who are reliant on purchasing those credits from Tesla as to not get penalized from the government? Ford, Toyota, GM, etc?"
2021-06-27 17:42:33,wallstreetbets,"Probably not, the ‘recall’ was actually just a software update. Chinese Tesla owners don’t have to bring their car in for it either. It’s equivalent to an update to your phone’s OS"
2021-06-27 19:10:59,wallstreetbets,This happens with all car manufacturers. They do everything they can to keep it silent or avoid any major recalls
2021-06-27 18:39:44,wallstreetbets,"That would be braindead investors getting out, it's an over the air software update and not a recall"
2021-06-27 17:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Those other companies won’t need those credits for long. Once the major players come out with EV’s, there is no more need. And Stellantis already announced they won’t need EV credits anymore.

So yes, to the extent EV credits were some long term competitive advantage, there would be an issue. 

But they will be a non-factor in under three years. And TSLA will then not only lose it’s EVEN credits, but it will be faced head-on with actual competition. TSLA caught the major automakers asleep at the switch and showed the world how beautiful and powerful and advanced an EV could be. (Compare to the fucking Chevy Volt). 

Watch [this promo ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rzGlVG75kUM) for the Hummer and tell me TSLA doesn’t have legit competition once cars like the Hummer and Mustang and F150 are all electric.

TSLA has done a lot of things well, but EV credits are a blip and will end very soon."

2021-06-27 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,They're handing out free software upgrades to almost 300k vehicles; that's bullish!
2021-06-27 17:45:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is what I heard too
2021-06-27 18:04:15,wallstreetbets,"Some great points, and I totally agree. I just have to think Tesla’s software and battery tech is years ahead of said competition, but we’ll see when everything is out on the road and reviewed. I preordered a Cybertruck but I’d take a Rivian or F150 Lightning if I could get it sooner for sure!"
2021-06-27 17:54:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, honestly I have no idea why all the headlines say ‘recall’. If you look in the articles, they mention it’s just a downloadable software update that prevents the car from activating cruise control when turning the steering wheel."
2021-06-27 18:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think these electric pick up trucks will have sales that blow past anyone’s expectations for the first five years or so. How that affects the automaker stock prices, I have no idea (although I am long a few dozen Ford deep-in-the-money call LEAPs.) 

- for rural farmers: you can power your house of the F150 for days in power outages. No more gas generator. 

- for contractors: many already operate cordless jobsites with all battery tools. These trucks will let you charge the batteries on these tools all day without needing thousands of dollars of generators on site. And if you run actual tools, you can run them off of your truck battery all day too (many job sites don’t have power during various phases of construction and trades like roofing often don’t ever enter the home and need external power)

- with home solar - you now can drive that truck for FREE (no more $100 fill ups at the gas station)

- operating and maintenance costs will be far lower than gas trucks

- federal tax credits of up to $12,500 will make $70-$80k F150’s affordable for a large portion of America. 

I’m really excited for these trucks to arrive. I drive a Ram 1500 for work and can’t wait to get solar/go electric."
2021-06-27 18:26:53,wallstreetbets,It is weird.. some miss-translation from the Chinese source maybe but nobody bothered to fix it? Anyways I wonder sometimes if there are trading bots keyed to specific news headlines like this and they’ll sell on Monday even if it’s wrong and just a normal ota update. I guess we’ll see Monday if coders forgot to tell the bots to ignore the “recall” lol

2021-06-27 17:33:53,wallstreetbets,"CLNE option traders, one more thing. 

For 9-17 35$ calls, if it does dip, just be ready for the .10 average ask, cause I’ll be loading up HELLA at that point. The lowest the ask went was .15 on Friday and I bought that a lot. If it goes to .10, I could average down so much more. (These calls were 3.00 not even 2 weeks ago! 👀)

I 100% believe in the CLNE squeeze. It’s not even a hype stock, it has sustainable business model and flow, amazon partnership, leader in RNG fuels and Amazon sees that, so they literally ordered 700 CARGO TRUCKS that run on CLNEs fuel, which is great supply and demand which will drive the stock up... I could keep going.

Not to mention, we are at the end of a massive bullish cup and handle. 🔥👌

2021-06-27 16:18:02,wallstreetbets,"CRSR is currently trading with a P/E in lockstep with Logitech, but with greater growth potential from being much smaller. With a Forward P/E of around 18.5, you can easily argue CRSR's current valuation should be $39.69 ( +14.6% ). Throw in some multiple expansion for it's growth potential and tailwinds from the growth of E-Sports and the professional streaming boom, and I think it's an easy buy with a PT of around $47 over the next 12 months.

2021-06-27 16:31:54,wallstreetbets,Buy- I have CLNE as a moderate buy because the current stats are great but they fall into a grey area for me where I could go buy or hold. The momentum indicators say go but I’m not finding much beyond that other than the newsfeed. So if CLNE falls far enough I’ll be there to help catch it but if it’s just minor movement than I’ll probably take a pass for the day unless I’m got a few extra bucks on me to blow.

2021-06-27 16:55:24,wallstreetbets,"Last 10 years of money printing didn't cause inflation because:
1) Fed's QE trapped money in the financial system and it was not handed out to people
2) China cheap manufacturers were a global disinflationary force
3) Technological advancement

What's changed in 2020-present:
1) China is slowly starting to not be so cheap. Replacing countries such Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines are yet to take on the full manufacturing load of China
2) On top of Fed's QE, through fiscal spend, money is being handed out to people

Arguments against persistent inflation into the future:
1) People are more focused on paying off debts rather than going out and spending the money
2) Yield curve doesn't incentivize banks to create more loans (but it's better than how it was a year ago)
3) Supply side will eventually pick up to rising demand/prices, and will bring cost down

Arguments for persistent inflation:
1) Continuing fiscal spend into the future
2) Supply side might not be able to pick with demand in time

Rising shipping cost might not go down. Oil prices not go down because of less Capex spend in the area as part of the greening initiative. Dollar devaluation might continue if Fed doesn't choose to tighten and continues to monetize debt.

Edit: sticking wage inflation might have a ripple effect"

Those things not only clean your clothes better, but make them smell awesome too. Even my trashcan is better.

2021-06-27 18:48:09,wallstreetbets,I sold puts because I figured I'd either end up with free money or a good price on the stock

2021-06-27 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,I’m a pattern trader. It’s overbought on my charts. There’s room for profit early like Monday/Tuesday(1hr chart)  but I’d look to rebuy on Wednesday/Thursday
2021-06-27 16:35:14,wallstreetbets,Past the deadline for the dividend. Whatever shares you buy will still split. If you buy a share of NVIDIA today you aren’t going to lose 1/4 of the money you invested. No one would buy it for a month if that were the case.
2021-06-27 19:16:52,wallstreetbets,Probably because I’m in CLF genius

2021-06-27 19:08:51,wallstreetbets,"I've been spending about 40% of my account trading AMD the past 3-4 months and I'm up significantly on it. Selling CSP at resistance cashing out at 30-50% profit and holding leaps I bought back in early May. I'm up 67% on the leaps. June 17, 2022 75 calls. Every time it has a +2-3% day I sell covered calls on my leaps and cash them out at 30-50%."
2021-06-27 17:13:44,wallstreetbets,Shares
2021-06-27 17:44:25,wallstreetbets,But what if we don’t have a red day
2021-06-27 17:38:30,wallstreetbets,Wow that made sense.  Are you in the right place???
2021-06-27 17:02:42,wallstreetbets,And labor costs at ports.  These jobs are serious jobs that can’t be filled overnight
2021-06-27 17:03:53,wallstreetbets,I'm listening 🤔
2021-06-27 16:46:47,wallstreetbets,How much is the dividend?
2021-06-27 16:48:01,wallstreetbets,No but because I’m primarily a PC gamer now and get all my shit on steam. If I was an Xbox or PS4 gamer I’d take advantage of physical trade ins

2021-06-27 16:48:13,wallstreetbets,"I've said it almost every time that CLF has popped up on WSB. I think CLF is a no-brainer buy at this price. Even if infrastructure talks end up not coming to fruition, I think a PT for CLF is at least $30 in the next year. I have multiple leaps."
2021-06-27 16:09:51,wallstreetbets,"We need more LG memes. Plz memelords, make it happen."

2021-06-27 17:44:06,wallstreetbets,"Release Earnings is coming and we could see something bigger coming... Analyst are targeting $40 price on CLF and if it does at the end of July, we could see something similar to GME/AMC"
2021-06-27 19:25:18,wallstreetbets,CLF is STRONG. There has been more volume on up days than down days indicating CLF is under accumulation which is a very bullish condition. The stock is trading above a rising 50 and 200 day moving average showing an uptrend indicating the trend is BULLISH!!!

2021-06-27 18:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Mini gme. Not because of shorts. But because it is one of the few companies in this market that is undervalued, and because it is gone through major changes the market has not digested yet.

3k shares and may add monday if it doesnt run too much before open

Edit: for clarification, I was comparing to gme 2020. Also, not expecting a squeeze at all on clf. Just strong natural movement."

2021-06-27 14:30:08,wallstreetbets,The place I work for is called Tecomet and we make parts for that planes engines (GE 9x). These engines are supposed to save the airlines $1 million in fuel per year/per plane. I personally machined hundreds of these parts over the past few years for their test engines. I watched the test flight they had online in January of last year. I was working 10-12 hours a day to keep up until they put a halt on production because of covid and the FAA concerns. But they really plan on ramping up big time. Hopefully soon
2021-06-27 14:15:05,wallstreetbets,This is good....up 10 pct on Monday
2021-06-27 14:18:09,wallstreetbets,Extremely bullish.

For real:

* There is a *massive* currency and trade/sanction war risk. Just look how easy it was for the US to shoot Huawei at point-blank range.
* China is not a democracy, it isn't a country where you as a foreigner can expect deals to stay (the ""legal system"" will always favor the Chinese part), it isn't a country where a Chinese can expect deals to be honored (just ask Jack Ma - become a threat to the Party and you'll get disappeared)"

2021-06-27 19:46:09,wallstreetbets,Do bots ever give out good advice or is it always a scam?
2021-06-27 14:43:27,wallstreetbets,">Posted 

You are correct. AAPL sells iPhones at $1000. NIO will sell ET7 at $80,000. Then ADD NIO Life, NIO House, NIO Pollution Credits, NIO Points, NIO Battery Upgrade Plus AAPL never got the U.S Govt Support to establish Globally that NIO is getting. NIO is attacking EVs, AVs, EV Batteries, AV Long Haul Trucks, Robo Taxis, Used Car Market -- That is more than 10% of China Economy"
2021-06-27 14:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Very true, just a lot of people compare it to Tesla, which is fair, but they’re building the company like Apple not Tesla."
2021-06-27 14:53:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes 100% it can, as long as the word gets out there which it already has. A lot of major players are in or getting in. So should we apes"
2021-06-27 15:25:30,wallstreetbets,This guy is no joke. IMO tomorrow will be double the buying volume or more https://twitter.com/realwillmeade/status/1409136215270563845?s=21
2021-06-27 15:21:56,wallstreetbets,Wkhs to jump this week. Just keep buying and holding. 🏇 🚀
2021-06-27 16:34:23,wallstreetbets,"My number one reason for avoiding investing in anything Chinese is their government.

* Edited for context because people thought I hated Chinese food."
2021-06-27 18:10:12,wallstreetbets,"Every company wants to make money. I think that's enough said. Let's avoid politics, because every country wants to avoid any company controlling 1 sector."
2021-06-27 18:15:37,wallstreetbets,"china is run like a feudal system. the emperor gives select individuals their blessing to become rich and powerful as they dont fuck up and bring shame to china. as long as the person who runs nio isnt an idiot and makes a car that blows up or speak out against the government, he will be fine. jack ma really should have just kept his mouth shut, he actually thought he became successful on his own and not because he had the blessing from the state"
2021-06-27 16:11:00,wallstreetbets,Yup. I still LOL when I think about their Lufkin Coffee.
2021-06-27 14:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, I’m as bullish as it gets. You’re right though, the referrals that NIO gets is insane. Its the most hyped up car brand in China, everyone wants them. Nevermind the advertising from NIO day. Didnt have time for a true dd full post"
2021-06-27 17:44:44,wallstreetbets,America 350 millions. China 1000 millions.
2021-06-27 14:27:59,wallstreetbets,"Then invest into an American one, WKHS all the way!"
2021-06-27 14:28:18,wallstreetbets,I’m sure they would threaten a delisting of tickers like Trump did with a few Chinese companies a while back. I don’t see a war happening any time soon but if it did I doubt it would really affect the stocks. After all its not like investing in Chinese stocks provides them war money.
2021-06-27 14:20:15,wallstreetbets,Avoid stereotyping when investing.
2021-06-27 17:04:24,wallstreetbets,"Did you really say companies in the west lack truth? I normally don't reply to much but are you implying companies are the harbingers of truth from every place except <fill-in any country>? In all of written history, you will see whenever money is involved, companies (and those who run them) throughout the entire world will lack truth, whether that ""lack of truth"" is to be:

1. approved for larger loans
2. taxed at a lower rate
3. an attractive entry point to additional investors"
2021-06-27 16:01:51,wallstreetbets,Yes but NIO isnt a meme stock its a great company

2021-06-27 14:20:53,wallstreetbets,NIO is taking many pages out of Tesla's book! Which is a great thing. I support them and hope they destroy legacy auto too! Tesla is and will always be king though.
2021-06-27 17:02:17,wallstreetbets,Did he just wrote WKHS could double its initial price of $31 and double it ???
2021-06-27 18:16:46,wallstreetbets,you dont eat chinese food in america because of their government?
2021-06-27 16:39:25,wallstreetbets,Wasn't one of their trademark images on their bags an ape?
2021-06-27 18:36:42,wallstreetbets,Look at cars per household and how many people can afford to buy the car. The population is not an accurate measure. Rather have 10 clients that can afford to buy than 1000 that can only admire in a distance.
2021-06-27 17:56:56,wallstreetbets,1400millions.  You are understating by 40%
2021-06-27 14:49:42,wallstreetbets,You must be high if you think I am going to invest into anything other than GME
2021-06-27 15:58:35,wallstreetbets,Yep plus NVDA and possibly SLGG.
2021-06-27 15:14:38,wallstreetbets,">NIO is taking many pages out of Tesla's book!

for example? They both do EVs and they both invest heavily in ""autonomous driving"", and that is very much it"
2021-06-27 14:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is the king of America, NIO will be the king of China"
2021-06-27 17:07:30,wallstreetbets,Volume
2021-06-27 18:24:40,wallstreetbets,I didn't realize this was a chinese food subreddit
2021-06-27 16:44:18,wallstreetbets,"😂 See, that's just cultural appropriation!"
2021-06-27 15:44:35,wallstreetbets,For one thing Nio is planning on using many Giga presses. Not as big as Tesla's but still. Who do you think gave them that idea?
2021-06-27 14:38:40,wallstreetbets,NIO could easily be kings of a lot more countries than just China. I think NIO and TSLA will fight for Europe. Should be good for prices
2021-06-27 14:46:50,wallstreetbets,King of China Yes. King of Europe in Premium Segment Probably. King in 78 OBOR Rest of the World Countries Probably.
2021-06-27 15:10:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah there is no way america would just let NIO into the market freely.   Maybe trump would’ve lol
2021-06-27 17:23:07,wallstreetbets,I mean the tweet.
2021-06-27 19:38:37,wallstreetbets,So you want to tell me Tesla was the first one to use die casting in building cars?
2021-06-27 15:17:43,wallstreetbets,Yes will be interesting not to mention the completion from the traditional manufactures as they change over to electric.
2021-06-27 16:33:20,wallstreetbets,">Maybe trump would’ve lol

The guy who got constantly in trouble for talking about the ""china virus"" was going to roll over on china, compared to what we have now? Just put that kool-aid down."
2021-06-27 17:29:56,wallstreetbets,If it starts to squeeze it can.
2021-06-27 19:45:01,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-27 16:07:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the legacy boys are starting to jump on board, will be interesting to see how well that goes.  I'm especially interested to see how the F-150 Lightning does.  Not sure how much sway they will have in the Chinese market, but America and Europe....."
2021-06-27 16:36:29,wallstreetbets,"Trumps policies were much more relaxed with China, look at his polices not the jibberish coming out of his mouth.  Trump would’ve also entertained back channel deals as well.

The current administration takes a much more protective stance when it comes to developing certain industries within America, hence they would not want a competitor such as NIO to enter the market unless some sort of partnership could be made or agreed upon."
2021-06-27 19:46:28,wallstreetbets,"well Tesla was not. Giga press is just die casting a large part, rather then smaller parts. Other companies have been playing with die casting for a long time."
2021-06-27 17:01:55,wallstreetbets,"We are literally living on two seperate planets.

I lived on one where Trump constantly pushed and supported us business (spending his entire time as president elect drumming up foreign investment in the US), started a trade war with china, pumped military spending while the navy upped it's ""freedom of navigation"" operations through waters china claims,  tried to increase local medicine production during operation warp speed, and explicitly blamed china for covid via leak from the wuhan lab (which is suddenly no longer a conspiracy) 

Most of the ""covid relief"" passed under the current occupation has been to foreign nations.  The best he has done is try to claim credit for the few trump policies he didn't undo. 

So really, where have you been the last 4 years, because it certainly wasn't the US"

2021-06-27 17:40:32,wallstreetbets,"In 2022-2023 when Inovio gets the vaccine out, covid is just a bad memory. Partnerships does not help of vaccine is not tested and approved. No country will wait another year to get a vaccine if there is already options available. Africa? Well, the cold chain is a problem but nothing that can't be solved. 

Seriously... I bought my shares in March 2020, saw this going to $33. It took months before I understood that CEO is fraudulent liar. I took big losses and I still hate to look my account."

2021-06-27 19:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Only recommendation, since you obviously don’t like the company and  ceo, sell your shares and put it on one of your winners on your portfolio. 

Why are you in a play you don’t like. It doesn’t make sense.

2021-06-27 17:23:41,wallstreetbets,It really is.
2021-06-27 16:26:30,wallstreetbets,They have their own subreddits. Sorry. AMC and GME don’t own this one. Unless…

2021-06-27 14:00:45,wallstreetbets,Can confirm it is fidelity
2021-06-27 14:05:16,wallstreetbets,Does Fidelity offer a ‘play money’ platform because I have been seeing some ridiculously large accounts posted in here.   A lot of people with some serious cash post in here.
2021-06-27 17:43:21,wallstreetbets,Didnt know that. I’m not balsy enough to trade on margin
2021-06-27 15:46:03,wallstreetbets,"DFV likes the stock… seriously though, it’s rated as overvalued, but even the “experts” recommend buying GME right now. If you look at the trend, we’re still seeing GME rise. Obviously there was a huge sell off around 300-320ish, but people are buying the dip. My target price is around 400, a number we all know is not at all out of reach for this stock."
2021-06-27 16:00:35,wallstreetbets,That’s all just speculation though. Are we just expecting it to go up based in volume?

2021-06-27 16:32:36,wallstreetbets,The recent investors presentation has invalidated the bear thesis; addition to the Russell index; shorts doubling down to save their position. This is going to get very interesting.
2021-06-27 14:51:22,wallstreetbets,If uber ever goes driverless or if autonomous cabs become a thing these would kill.
2021-06-27 17:56:28,wallstreetbets,I’ll accept this P&D as I’ve got options on both 👍🏻👍🏻
2021-06-27 16:52:22,wallstreetbets,"To recap, GOEV go brrrrr 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-27 16:45:09,wallstreetbets,Canoo is legit af
2021-06-27 16:39:23,wallstreetbets,I'm going to double double down in GOEV again this time in stocks.
2021-06-27 13:52:25,wallstreetbets,Good analysis. GOEV definitely looks like it's being manipulated.
2021-06-27 15:06:33,wallstreetbets,Love Canoo. If anyone’s interested here check out the website and watch some of the latest videos of their upcoming vehicles. They are amazingly well thought out. Honestly think this is going to print.
2021-06-27 13:23:18,wallstreetbets,"This is a great in depth analysis, thank you man."
2021-06-27 14:04:59,wallstreetbets,Canoo will moon this week. The price has been heavily manipulated to be under 10. I feel a short squeeze coming.
2021-06-27 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,I see myself whipping a Canoo; they’re different.
2021-06-27 16:24:08,wallstreetbets,"20+ class action suits + SEC ‘fact finding’ investigation which hangs over $GOEV is to some extent a cause of substantially different market valuation. When, if, sky clears up for Canoo, the SP will pop"
2021-06-27 19:14:10,wallstreetbets,I'd take the F150 Lightning over the Canoo pickup any day.. I don't think they will be able compete with legacy EV pickups or newcomers.
2021-06-27 13:12:22,wallstreetbets,"This is FSR’s second kick at the can. They’ve done it before and I think that warrants a premium compared to GOEV. 

I was holding both but exited GOEV last week."
2021-06-27 13:32:32,wallstreetbets,FSR FTW $25 calls Jan 2022
2021-06-27 15:35:04,wallstreetbets,Not that aero dynamic is it  looks like it plows through the air
2021-06-27 14:06:40,wallstreetbets,who the fuck thinks these cars are cool looking because they ugly AF
2021-06-27 13:25:41,wallstreetbets,"Only one of GOEV’s cars will look as advertised.  The other production vehicles (delivery van, truck) that the company is taking deposits on, will look nothing like the concepts they debuted because of cost, safety and crash…"
2021-06-27 19:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Definitely. On Friday with over double the average volume the trading range stayed so tight....no other explanation but manipulation.

**Day's Range	9.61 - 9.99**  
**52 Week Range	6.51 - 24.90**  
**Volume	13,345,921**  
**Avg. Volume	5,719,530**"
2021-06-27 17:17:39,wallstreetbets,I don’t think you understand how a class action works. 20+ ambulance chasing firms with no lead plaintiff is what it is.
2021-06-27 13:16:29,wallstreetbets,They have not done it before. They went bankrupt before.
2021-06-27 16:12:26,wallstreetbets,They have done it before by making an exhaust that points forward.
2021-06-27 14:25:15,wallstreetbets,"They're definitely different. New things often look ugly at first, but they're growing on me."
2021-06-27 13:28:05,wallstreetbets,For clarity what I meant is that they’ve navigated bringing an EV from concept to market. Yes they went bankrupt but there were other factors that led to that.
2021-06-27 15:52:18,wallstreetbets,Hasn't their CEO bankrupted several businesses and had to pay massive fines for ripping off other designs for vehicles? I mean look st the Ocean its basically a RangeRover but not...
2021-06-27 16:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes he was sued by his former employer because his designs looked similar to HIS designs that were done for Aston Martin. The previous failure was also due to battery suppliers going bankrupt. 

Again, I’m not shitting on a bull case for GOEV, just pointing out why I think FSR is trading at a premium."
2021-06-27 17:01:33,wallstreetbets,"They are at the same point basically in their timeline and have ~30% more cash, I'd expect a 30% premium at the most. So IMO either FSR is overpriced by about 50% or GOEV is underpriced by about 100%."

2021-06-27 13:43:57,wallstreetbets,"It is indeed unfortunate. The problem with tracking WISH in the current version of the tracker is that it would mark posts saying 'I wish I was rich' as a post mentioning WISH. That is a problem with the problem so far and in future versions I am trying to fix it. Hope you understand the problem, but thank you very much for your comment!"
2021-06-27 15:48:54,wallstreetbets,Because it’s getting spammed by bots constantly. It’s the most obvious and fake pump I’ve seen on this sub.
2021-06-27 15:13:23,wallstreetbets,Wkhs clov and bb are my plays for the week
2021-06-27 16:08:06,wallstreetbets,Buy 1 more GME share
2021-06-27 13:49:40,wallstreetbets,"I do understand the problem. But it still deserves to not be ignored from the list. I would include it where it belongs and just mention that 10-15% of WISH mentions are potentially from use of the word, and not of the stock. Then the people reading your post can make their own decisions based on its position on your charts.

IMO, most people saying WISH mean the stock and people who hate the ticker go out of their way never to say the word WISH. The fact it's not on the list at all kinda makes me feel like the list is not based on reality, I think it should be revised cause it feels disingenuous to the amount of love WISH gets on this subreddit.

Also, 90% of the time people say I wish I was rich, they are intentionally mentioning the ticker."
2021-06-27 15:51:55,wallstreetbets,"Just because you believe everyone is a bot other than yourself, doesn't make it true. The amount of times I've been called a bot for liking something others don't is incredible. You guys are out of your minds and are full of hatred. Imagine being triggered by a ticker name, you guys are definitely special folk!"
2021-06-27 15:53:44,wallstreetbets,"I’ve clicked on a fair number of the WISH posters, and their accounts have never posted anything else before. All they have done in their history is mention this stock. That seems pretty fake to me. No doubt there are genuine people interested, especially now after the bots did their work, but it has been fishy as hell."
2021-06-27 16:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Fair, but it's all ass backwards. The people bashing bots are bashing plenty of real people and calling them names and fakes. When you all keep crying wolf no one can be bothered to believe you anymore. Everyone is tired of hearing you cry fake at every living person and pump and dump at every corner. Also WISH ain't that bad. If you can't see the upside you're just blindly following other bashers. It's like you've unknowingly become a bash bot yourself."

2021-06-27 14:33:47,wallstreetbets,🌝 is the limit. 💲6️⃣9️⃣ inevitable
2021-06-27 15:01:19,wallstreetbets,If you own over 100 shares sell covered weekly calls that are OTM and take profits every week
2021-06-27 17:34:14,wallstreetbets,I got 12 too!!
2021-06-27 13:32:14,wallstreetbets,I have 16 of those contracts too.
2021-06-27 19:43:44,wallstreetbets,Its only going red on Fridays because idiots keep trying to scalp on 5DTEs. If they bought out a bit in August and October they'd be building positions as this climbs and it would smooth the Fridays out quite a lot.
2021-06-27 16:42:23,wallstreetbets,Yikes... I think if $wish breaks and holds 15 it’s game over... 15 >>> 18 >> 20 >> 34 >> 6️⃣9️⃣
2021-06-27 16:39:06,wallstreetbets,Good shit! I started buying at $11 and got confident last week with the volume. $wish 69
2021-06-27 18:44:51,wallstreetbets,Both... lots of misinformation about SI but the ppl I trust say it’s a lot higher than ppl think. Beaten up off ipo debut.. deep value. CEO wouldn’t sell to Amazon/baba/etc at 10b so $30+ seems a lock.. with volume and hype $69 short term >$300 long imo for $wish
2021-06-27 19:46:39,wallstreetbets,Its longer term than a one off pump and dump. There's an options chain built out aggressively to 40 / share all the way out to December.
2021-06-27 19:52:01,wallstreetbets,Let’s go 🦍!!! $wish 69🚀
2021-06-27 14:53:00,wallstreetbets,Plan is to lever up over $15 and get to 6969 shares
2021-06-27 16:27:42,wallstreetbets,$wish 69
2021-06-27 15:38:23,wallstreetbets,My $wish is the dip is down to $15 from almost 16 then moon

You’re a cultist aren’t you?"

2021-06-27 18:41:50,wallstreetbets,Makes me wet. $wish
2021-06-27 19:18:45,wallstreetbets,how did you figure it was supposed to hit last Friday?
2021-06-27 19:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Stop selling CCs. You're selling to retail most likely and stopping them from buying from a hedge fund that will buy additional shares to leverage the gamma pumps.

&#x200B;

Edit: I'll be happy when your CC shares are exercised and the stock moves past your strikes to fuck you. If you want to make money selling options against a rising stock, do CSPs. The delta hedging helps the bulls and the CSPs give you an entry or a premium."
2021-06-27 16:40:33,wallstreetbets,You apes are savages! I hope it goes to $69 and you buy your pants. $wish 🚀
2021-06-27 13:59:13,wallstreetbets,Lol I sold off half the other day at a 75% gain. Now I can sleep easy for these lol
2021-06-27 19:44:10,wallstreetbets,"17 is the real fight. That's where a bunch of short positions were opened. JP Morgan, Citadel etc."
2021-06-27 16:43:17,wallstreetbets,"The Volume has been very good. I think that last dip was an all time low, even down here it's severely undervalued as a company. It's not unusual for 🌈🐻 to pile on after an IPO but people can see its turned the corner and will have to reevaluate."
2021-06-27 18:47:02,wallstreetbets,Cool. I'll gobble up 50 or so shares and forget about it til it hits $300. Thanks for the clear response!
2021-06-27 14:54:03,wallstreetbets,well that's one option too
2021-06-27 13:45:39,wallstreetbets,Have fun being locked out of your account and losing all your money lol
2021-06-27 18:27:37,wallstreetbets,"Meh.

No cult, but i came at you wrong.

Good luck and;
A) You win: Congrats and fuck you.
B) You lose: You'll get em next time, bud. But please share loss porn."
2021-06-27 17:04:15,wallstreetbets,Exactly.. all hyped ipos were beaten up.. $wish took the biggest beating.. way undervalued now.
2021-06-27 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,Full transparency guaranteed. Hope you’re positions print.

I have not gotten in on any IPO's yet but browsing the upcoming IPO calendar on NASDAQ looks like good ole KRISPY KREME is on the list for the first of July!

I am blinded by my love and nostalgic memories of Krispy Kreme growing up in NC so I was wondering if any of you have experience with IPO's on opening day? 
 
Seems like well known, and tech companies usually do well but they can also take a dive from the paper hands making a quick buck. 

Bullish or Bearish on this one?
or any other upcoming IPO suggestions?
This is not a DD or financial advice

2021-06-27 16:36:57,wallstreetbets,I did a lot of work for KK in early 2000’s. Then it was found out that they were lying about their financials to investors and everything went to shit.

2021-06-27 17:52:09,wallstreetbets,They are still big in Japan. They are 100 times better than dunken which is doing well.
2021-06-27 14:20:26,wallstreetbets,"IPO for a barely decent donut? Nah. I'd avoid it. They are financially irresponsible. And had solvency issues once before leading to mass closure after trying to do the same thing they are now. 

They saw the AMC money train leave the station and thought they can capitalize on retail money too to save them selves. 

Fuck 'em. Bearish. Buy puts for the week or two after IPO when interest in the stock hits an all time low and make money on the inevitable downward spiral."

I'm probably gonna stay away from that one.  Unless I find more free gambling money for a 1-2 day ride.  Thing is gonna blow up on meme-ability, and fall back to middle earth once people start looking at financials.  I'd consider it after that pounding...but I've just watched them expand and contract too many times.  Seeing the daily line at their drive-thru seems like a no-brainer, but then you have to ask why they have to constantly be reshuffling with so many customers.  Too many questions."

Navy/Marine Corps COVID-19 Study Findings Published in New England Journal of Medicine
12 November 2020
From Naval Medical Research Center Public Affairs. Please read what DARPA wants.

Implementing public health best practices on their own among young adults may not be enough to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and additional actions, such as widespread and repeated testing, are recommended to reduce risk of viral spread, according to research published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Implementing best practice public health measures on their own among young adults may not be enough to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and additional actions, such as widespread and repeated testing, are recommended to reduce the risk of viral spread, according to research published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Researchers from Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), in collaboration with scientists from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, conducted a study to understand the dynamics of viral transmission and host response to COVID-19 in young adults in order to inform public health measures in response to COVID-19 in a group setting.

The study, COVID-19 Health Action Response for Marines (CHARM), took place at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, South Carolina, and included nearly 2,000 participants, composed mostly of 18- to 20-year-old healthy Marine recruits predominantly from the Eastern United States. Upon arrival for recruit training, they spent two weeks in a strict, supervised group quarantine that required wearing masks and emphasized hand washing and social distancing as they began their initial military instruction, primarily outdoors.

To determine asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and transmission among study participants during the quarantine period, researchers collected study questionnaires and specimens weekly and conducted both polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology tests. PCR tests are the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19.

""The study hopes to improve medical readiness for the Marines and the DoD as well as inform force health protection measures,” said Cmdr. Andrew Letizia lead researcher for the study and deputy director of NMRCs infectious diseases directorate. “The investigators and I believe these findings will help the DoD, other public health entities, and society as a whole mitigate the spread of the pandemic not only among this particular population, but to those they might unknowingly infect as well.""

The authors also found that nearly 6% of study participants arrived to recruit training with antibodies for SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previous exposure to the virus. Additionally, at the start of the supervised quarantine, 1% of participants tested positive, 95% of whom were asymptomatic. All reported self-quarantine at home for two weeks before reporting, denied any direct exposure to sick contacts and did not have any risk factors for exposure to COVID-19. Therefore, questions assessing current symptoms or risk factors would not have identified 95% of these individuals who were infected.

According to the authors, these results suggest the need to augment public health measures with widespread initial and repeated surveillance testing to prevent COVID-19 transmission in group settings.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests.  

Hope all of you had a pretty good week in the market. After moving sideways for the last 2 months, the S&P 500 hit a new high last week (+2.7%) ([Fun fact:](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/market-news-insights/stock-market-news/stock-market-weekly-update) This is the 33rd time this year S&P 500 is hitting a new high - a spectacular 26% of all trading days in 2021).

In spite of the pullback experienced in mid-June following the concerns of a Fed Policy shift, both the Nasdaq Composite (+2.4%) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (+3.4%) also ended the week with strong gains. Even though the overall market was green, some of the most popular stocks did end up taking a beating as shown below.

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/rmu6l4gc8t771.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=56048e38714148ca8c96346b391591a2148fe49f)

WISH finally overtook AMC to become the most discussed stock! This was mainly driven by the 20% increase in stock price over the last week. Investors were also extremely bullish about the stock as reflected by the sentiment. Tesla has made a comeback to the top 10 list with an 8% jump in stock price.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/mmsh20yd8t771.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7c66752fc656d0e3483fccf3cb338eea43259f1)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Globalstar($GSAT):** GSAT, an American satellite communications company gained a massive 46% this week following a [Buy rating with a 150% upside](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/globalstar-rated-buy-b-riley-likes-potential-for-return-on-assets) from investment bank B.Riley. The stock jumped \~18% on Monday following the report and has continued its upward trend. According to Riley,

>Globalstar and its sponsors, after years of development, support, and patience, are at long last starting to realize a return on satellite system and spectrum assets, making 2021 an excellent time, in our opinion, to buy GSAT

**Paysafe($PSFE):** Paysafe jumped 9% as the company is set to join the Russell 3000 index. Most of the retail crowd is trying to front-run the purchases by hedge fund managers (Fund managers that track the Russell index will need to purchase the shares after its added to the index).

**Trade Desk($TTD):** TTD was generating discussions as Google announced that they would delay the removal of third-party cookies that help advertisers track users until 2023. The news also sends the stock price soaring as the stock finished the week with a 25% gain. 

**Purple Innovation($PRPL):** The current volatility of the market is perfectly reflected in this stock as an 8% run-up in a billion-dollar company has generated zero news! The retail crowd was hyping up the stock as the company has announced an off-cycle investor event which will take place on 6/29 and also because the company was one of the first meme stocks that were picked up by Reddit almost a year back.

*As always, please note that I am not a financial advisor.* Hope you enjoyed this week’s issue!"

2021-06-27 15:15:56,wallstreetbets,"It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here is the average across all the comments. 

[here](http://imgur.com/gallery/vyg92Nz) is a sample of the sentiment analysis I posted when Boeing's engine failed on UAL flight. 

Is it 100% accurate? No! The program misses out of nuanced sarcasm. But when you are analysing 100's of comments the issue is not very prominent enough significantly change the results!"

During the pandemic they were lumped into the furniture and improving your home, “the home you are stuck in stock movement.” PRPL crushed some earnings in May last year , I remember seeing some crazy gains, I know some people made a killing in here and it had a pretty good following.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A Beginner and Intermediate Guide To Options: Everything You Need To Know To Stop Losing Money Like A Complete Tard   

**Introduction**

For those of you that are living underneath a rock, options represent the contractual right to purchase or sell blocks of 100 shares in the underlying security. Because each option represents 100 shares, they often provide volatile leveraged like returns and are often used by either professional investors as part of a sophisticated investment strategy or by retail ~~gamblers~~ investors as a way to potentially gain massive amounts of money while putting up a relatively small amount.

In this post, I will walk you through the pricing fundamentals, the Greeks, and common option strategies. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will stop losing all your money like a bunch of half-wits. Well, you probably still lose money, but at least you can act like a smartass about it.

**Pricing Fundamentals**

This section is going to be focused on the fundamentals and theoretical aspects behind what gives an option value. Aka, that boomer shit.

There are two types of options: American and European. American options give the holder the right to exercise the option at any given time prior to the expiration date (cause freedom, that’s why). These options are the ones you typically buy from your broker. European options on the other hand are fucking gay because they only let you exercise at the expiry date and since none of you cucks ever bought an option from a Europoor before, I will focus solely on American options for this DD post.

**Value Breakdown**

Every option, regardless if it’s a chad call or a gay put has two pricing components that justify it’s current market value: the intrinsic value and the speculative value. Let me explain via this equation:

*Value = Intrinsic + Speculative Value*

Intrinsic value is how ITM an option is, and the speculative value is the chances of it becoming even more ITM by the time to expiry. For example, assume a call option has a strike of $10 and the current price of the stock is $12. That would mean the intrinsic value is $2. However, the option expires in let’s say 3 months, and is being traded at $3. That would mean the additional 1-dollar difference above the $2 is the speculative value of the option. That $1 represents investors speculating the option will become even more ITM within that three months time frame.

Taking that logic further we can derive the fundamental value for a call and put option as:

Call = stock price – strike + speculative

Put = strike – stock price + speculative

**Leverage**

Now that you know that a single option grants you exposure to multiple shares and the returns are therefore leveraged, you might be thinking to yourself oh gosh, I hope there is a way for me to calculate exactly how leveraged this option will be. Don’t worry, there is. You can calculate exactly how leveraged an option is via this equation:

(Option Delta x Share Price) / Option price

**Volatility**

This is the big one. If the market is a casino, then this is the bookie playing around with the odds on the board. So if you want to leave the casino with money and not another man’s dick in your hand, you need to know volatility cold. For options trading, there are two kinds of volatility: realized and unrealized.

*Realized*

All you need to know is that realized volatility is the historic price movement of the stock. It is measured as the standard deviation (or deviation from average price) from the average price of a stock in a given time frame.

*Unrealized Or Implied Volatility*

This is the most important of the two. To put it in simplest terms, IV is the expected magnitude of a stock’s future price changes expressed as an annual percentage.

This expected yearly price change can be expressed as the following:

*1-Year Expected Range = stock price +/- (stock price x IV)*

What is important with this formula is that it shows the riskier stocks usually have the higher IVs which will result in a larger annual expected range. Taking this a step further we can also visualize the expected stock price changes via standard deviations.

Assuming most of you passed high school, a fair amount of you must be somewhat familiar with the normal distribution graph. We can demonstrate this with a graph of a normal distribution that shows a 1 standard deviation of the price movement of a stock that is trading at $100 with an IV of 25%. This means that with a standard deviation of 1 there is a 68% the stock will trade within the range of $75 - $125.

&#x200B;

We can also take it a step further and do a 2-standard deviation which will give us a representation of a stock’s fluctuation with a 95% confidence interval. In the chart below, still assuming a stock price of $100 and an IV of 25%, the range has doubled to $50 - $150. Remember, in statistics, we can go all the way to 3-standard deviations which is a confidence interval of 99.7% and that will mean a range of $25 - $175.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6mg3o4xf4t771.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b1d816612808faea9f3033a18edbf5c0e372209

Now that your high school nostalgia is out of the way, there is one more useful tidbit of knowledge I will show you.

We can also calculate the stock’s expected move over any period via this equation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6pf729pg4t771.png?width=325&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f73cbe0ad10dfbfc42b4dedca03f75b8d4d93c1

\*\**19.1 is the square root of 365 or the days in a year. For Simplicity’s sake, I simplified the denominator.*

This way whenever you buy an option that doesn’t expire in one year exactly, you can still map out the expected price range as stated by option traders. That way, you know what you are getting into and be all surprised when a dick is shoved up your ass (unless you’re in to that, then call me).

**Greeks**

What you all need to know is that within the premiums of every option that you buy there are certain assumptions that are priced in, much like there are certain assumptions that are priced into a stock price. These assumptions are often represented by certain Greek letters and by understanding what they are and how they influence the option’s value, you can better understand what you are betting on and whether or not the risks are tilted in your favor.

In this part, I am going to talk about the four Greeks every last one of you degenerates must know by heart: Vega, Delta, Gamma, and Theta. And no, they aren’t the name of the fraternity your girlfriend goes to so that she can blow half the chads on campus. These guys are the ones that will determine whether you make actual life-changing money or move back to your mother’s basement while your new stepdad subtly judges you.

**Vega (V):** This represents the change in option price per change in the option’s implied volatility. Vega is highest when the stock price is at the strike price and when the option is farther out from the expiration date.

Ex: Let’s assume the premium of an option is 7.5, IV is at 20% and vega at 0.12. If the IV moves up from 20 to 21.5, that is a 1.5 increase. The option price will increase by 1.5 x 0.12 = 0.18. 0.18 + 7.5 = 7.68

**Delta (Δ):** Delta is a change in the option’s price due to a change in underlying stock price. Assuming we have a delta of 0.5, that means per every dollar the stock price goes up by, the option premium will go up by 50% of that change. Delta is often highest the farther ITM the option is and will often be the most volatile the closer the strike price is to the stock price. Call options have a delta of 0-1 while Puts have a negative delta of 0 – (-1). The absolute delta of an option also tells you the probability that the option will finish in the money.

**Gamma (T):** Gamma is the rate of change in an option’s delta per 1-point move in the underlying’s share price. It is essentially the first derivative of delta and is used to gauge the price movement of an option relative to how far OTM or ITM it is. Taking this further, gamma is also the second derivative of an option’s price with respect to the underlying share’s price. This is because the delta is the first derivative of share price and since gamma is the first derivative of the delta, it is, therefore, the second derivative of the share price.

Whenever you long an option, you have positive gamma exposure and when you short, you have negative gamma exposure.

It is also important to note that gamma approaches 0 the farther an option becomes OTM or ITM. Gamma is also at its highest when the strike is ATM.

**Theta (O):** This Greek is probably the easiest to understand. Theta is the time decay of an option as it approaches its expiration date. This means that theta measures the constant and steady decrease in an intrinsic value for an option on a daily basis.

**Delta Curve:**

For those of you that don’t know, the delta of an option is not stagnant, and its rate of change in accordance with share price changes is represented by the option’s gamma. You can actually map out the expected change in an option’s delta in accordance with the underlying share price via the delta curve.

Let me show you the delta curve for a call option:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dxzwnvwh4t771.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dd06ce979c5d1be575cab96f5f73342519a129c

Note that the delta becomes more volatile as the option becomes ATM as the stock price rises before slowing that rate of change as the delta approaches 1 the deeper the option goes ITM. The delta will approach 1 because the absolute value of a delta represents the market’s expectation that the option will expire ITM so it makes sense that the more ITM an option becomes, the higher that percentage will be as it approaches 100%.

When you look at the delta curve for a put option, you will find a lot of similarities with the call option delta:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b3i8zgli4t771.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab2abacf875b84c0df9120c3950a16068839691e

Just like with call options, the delta becomes more volatile as the option becomes ATM; however, remember that put options have a negative delta and because it becomes more ITM the lower the stock price is, a rising stock price will result in a delta approaching 0.

**Equations**

\*\*\* *I got these equations from my CFA textbooks so the nomenclature for these option strategies might be different than what you are seeing on your brokerage page. Either way, you can just look at the descriptions I have made and figure out which strategies I am talking about.*

To wrap this up I am going to go through some popular options strategies that are often mentioned in investing subreddits. These descriptions will include what the option strategies entail, what will be their value at expiration, how much profit you can make, your maximum possible gain, how much money you can lose, and what price you need to be at in order to break even.

First here is a list of the variables I will be using and what they represent.

S0 : stock price at open

ST : stock price at close

X : strike price

Co : call premium

Po : put premium

XH : higher strike

CL / PL: premium on call/put with a lower strike

CH / PH: premium on call/put with a higher strike

***Covered Call***

This is longing for a stock and selling an OTM call option on it. People often do this in order to increase the “yield” on investment, meaning they get to haul in some additional cash flow on their stock holdings. Benefits to this strategy include the cash flow you receive from selling calls and its ability to reduce the overall volatility in your portfolio. The downside is that because you sold calls, you limit your upside potential because if the stock price goes over the strike price, it would be assumed that the option you sold will be exercised; therefore, there is a ceiling on how much money you can earn.

Expiration value: ST – Max\[(ST – X), 0\]

Profit at expiration ST – Max\[(ST – X), 0\] – So + Co

Max Gain (X – So) + Co

Max Loss So – Co

Breakeven Price: So – Co

***Protective Put***

This is longing a stock and a put option on the stock that is usually OTM. The idea here is that the put option serve as a kind of insurance on your stock holdings. By purchasing puts, you limit yourself on how much money you can possibly lose which will serve you well whenever the market decides to hit the shitter and enters a correction. Another benefit to this strategy is that unlike covered calls, you still have unlimited upside potential on your stock holdings. The downside is the money you have to spend in order to insure your positions.

Expiration value ST + Max\[( X – ST), 0\]

Profit at expiration ST + Max\[( X – ST), 0\] – So – Po

Max Gain ST – So – Po

Max Loss: So – X + Po

B.E price So + Po

***Bull Call Spread***

This is a directional play with options. Meaning in this case you are betting that the stock will go up. Bull Calls is longing for a call option with a lower strike and at the same time selling a call option on the same stock with the same expiry date at a higher strike. Here you are trying to profit off the deltas in which the positive delta for the option with the lower strike will be greater than the delta for the option with the higher strike and as the stock price goes up, you can profit from the delta difference. A benefit to this strategy is that because you are selling an option as well as buying one, you can limit your cash outflow. A downside is that you also limit the amount of money you can gain with this strategy. You can also do this strategy with put options in which you sell puts with the higher strike and buy puts with the lower strikes. For simplicity’s sake, I will just list the equations for the strategy with call options.

Profit at expiration Max( 0, ST – XL ) – Max(0, ST – XH) – CL + CH

Max Profit XH – XL – CL + CH

Max Loss CL – CH

BE XL + CL – CH

***Bear Put Spread***

Similar direction play just like Bull Calls but in this case you are betting the stock is going down. Here you are longing put options with the higher strike and selling puts with a lower strike. The expiration date must be the same for both options. The rationale of profiting off the Greeks and the pros and cons remain similar to Bull Calls.

Profit at expiration Max(0, XH – ST) – Max(0, XL – ST) – PH + PL

Max Profit XH – XL – PH + PL

Max loss PH – PL

Breakeven XH + PL – PH

***Collar***

This strategy is used when you think a stock is going to trade in a certain range. Here you are longing the stock, longing an ITM protective put, and selling an OTM call. The idea is that the put will provide downside protection while the call provides a ceiling on how much money you can earn. The main benefit is that it allows you to buy protection while limiting your cash outflow since you sold a call. The downside is that upside is limited just like a covered call strategy.

Profit at expiration (ST – So) + (XL – ST) – (ST – XH) – (Po – Co)

Max profit XH – So – (Po – Co)

Max loss So – XL + (Po – Co)

Breakeven So + (Po / Co)

***Straddle***

This is a directional play except over here you have no idea what the direction is. This strategy is ideal when betting on the general volatility of the stock without any idea on where the direction of the stock will go. Here you are longing both a call and a put on the same stock at the same expiration and at the same strike. The idea is that as the stock goes up or down, the delta of one option will slowly go to 1 while the other goes to 0 and you can profit off the gamma. The benefit to this is that you don’t need to bet as much in a certain direction, the downside however is that you are longing volatility and if the volatility does not reach high enough to what is priced into the premium, then you will lose money on both the call and the put as they both expire to 0.

Profit Max(0, ST – X)

Max profit = Co + Po

Max loss Co + Po

Breakeven X – (Co + Po) and X + (Co + Po)"

2021-06-27 10:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I'm new to all of this and 1000% appreciate the above writeup.  I'm just starting to try to figure out options and calls.

I understand selling covered calls which are relatively safer.

But there is something I can't wrap my head around in terms of buying calls.  I get that it's used to leverage far more shares than you could otherwise afford since 1 call = 100 shares.

Ok, so say you buy 50 calls (5000 shares) of a stock trading at 100 with a strike of 105 because you expect it to pop.  The premium is whatever, a dollar.  It doesn't matter, using it for math simplicity.

Buying 5000 shares would cost you $50,000

Buying 50 calls would cost you 50\*100\*1 = 5000$.  You have $10000 liquid.

Less money = leveraging more shares.  I get this completely.  Sure, you could lose the premium if it doesn't pop but this is a casino.

Ok, stock pops to 115, again just illustration.

You want to exercise the calls.  But this could cost  
5000 shares \* 105 = 525,000 which clearly you don't have.

But you could then sell for

5000 \* 115 = 575,000 for a net 45,000 profit (50,000 - 5000 premium).

Ok, here's my question: How does this work?

Do I have to actually pay up the money for the 5000 shares I can't actually afford, or do I just put in the sell order immediately and pick up the 45,000?  Or do I put in a proactive sell option at 115?

Basically I'm trying to figure out how these folks YOLO some insane number of call options, that presumably they don't have the liquid cash to pay for the stock if they are assigned/exercise but still make the profit.

I've read tons of stuff online about this and it's the one question I cannot find an answer to.

If there's an easy resource to point my dumb ass to, I'm all ears."

2021-06-27 09:29:05,wallstreetbets,I saw some words. Now I can tell people I'm making an educated decision when I yolo into OTM options on Mister Car Wash
2021-06-27 10:27:26,wallstreetbets,"Good info , I'll have to read it like 50 milliontrillion times before I retain and understand."
2021-06-27 10:31:36,wallstreetbets,"Let me add this in case it’s not written here, 85% of people who BUY an option, call or put lose money, been that way for 30+ years, but the flip side of course is 85% of people who SELL an option make money (think market makers) so to be successful with options is to SELL calls (covered) or my favorite is to SELL puts (naked).  To be successful doing this 
First, find a stock you want to own so if you get put the shares you’re ok owning it.
Second, look for a chart where the shares are going from lower left to upper right.
Now here’s where you can make 20%-40% on your cash.
Example is a stock trading for $22, the $20 put 30-60 days out is selling for .80 ($80/contract) the requirement is a convoluted formula but I’ve always calculated as 20% of assigned amount.  Thus for my example your option requirement is ~$400 ($2000 x 20% = $400) the premium you receive is $80 thus it’s a 20% RETURN ON CAPITAL.  The actual formula is like 20% of put value ($2000) plus the amount out of the money ($100-$200) minus the premium ($80) 
$400 + $100 - $80 = $420 approx. so u see how just using the 20% as I do is very close.  Too many say I’m getting $80 and “risking” $2000 = 4% net but u see how that’s not correct.  I did this exclusively for 4-5 years in early 2000’s and did extremely well and I still have a separate acct just for this.  Also, if the shares do drop you can accept the shares at $20 and sell calls vs shares or roll puts out farther in time if you expect shares to go back up."

2021-06-27 14:00:39,wallstreetbets,"A good thing to remember is that risk is not actually measured by standard deviation. 

Stddev is the ""second moment of the distribution"" which means that it will adequately describe the risk of normally distributed returns.

The issue is that returns are nowhere near normally distributed. Each moment of the distribution is important in assessing risk. I've personally only worked with data up to the 4th moment which means using the mean, stddev, skewness, and kurtosis data. 

Historical returns show left skewness and positive kurtosis (fat tails especially on the left, and a thinner body).

No institutions use only stddev unless they're passively investing, and even then they've likely got a staff going much deeper."

2021-06-27 11:35:10,wallstreetbets,"I just read the Options Playbook or something I bought on Amazon the other day. This post is equally if not better informative, saved. 


IMO the most important thing is options value, and if you trade based on that reference you’ll do way fucking better than random betting. 

Don’t buy options that have crazy moves priced in, lose less money.  Don’t buy big options plays until you understand what the fuck your doing, and you need to get crushed a few times to really learn. 

If a $15 stock has a $17 call for $1 next week, you’re betting the stock moves up at least 20% or you lose your money come Friday. 

And every day you don’t have big moves that possibility is smaller hence your FD drops faster. 
No Greek is needed to understand that, 

Just set a target price and only buy things with enough time for intrinsic value to reach that target."

2021-06-27 13:11:22,wallstreetbets,"It’s a pretty good guide, but it’ll be irrelevant for most people here. While implied volatility gives you a measure of what you’re paying for the option premium, it’s tough to actually use in practice because most people are not going to be dynamically delta hedging. I’m a pro volatility trader, so IVs vs HVs are pretty relevant for me as my systems do gamma hedge and scalp deltas. 

Most people on WSB is using options for leverage, myself included (personal account). I think a better way to look at it is risk reward of the option or spread that you’re putting on. I do think there needs to be a PSA about how people are using options. I would never Yolo five figures into weekly expiring calls. If people are trading in longer duration options, whose expirations are more than a few months away, then implied volatility is a lot more relevant. However, I wouldn’t recommend people to trade GME or TSLA Jan23 options as a non-professional. There’s too many factors at play beside where stock is trading. For example, even if you buy calls and stock goes up, you could lose money on the volatility coming in."

2021-06-27 16:51:23,wallstreetbets,"OMG I'm gonna have to read this several times and continue doing my homework. BUT ...can you please tell me WHY it is possible to make money on a call option when the share price isn't at the strike price? for instance, I paid 38 for a call on a stock at 9am one morning, at 11am I sold it for 273 (it was $AMC). I bought it a day before expiring...so the IV was super high. I still have no idea how I made that profit.  Also, right now i have a $RUN 120 strike for 8-20. it's no where NEAR 120.00 (it's 54.19 per share) a share and I am 3.00 profit? I have googled and youtube trying to specifically understand why/how you can be in profit when the share isn't close to the strike. Is it because of the greeks?(which I still have a ton of learning and studying to do regarding that) or is it more the standard deviation that allows the profit before a share reaches the strike? I know this is a long question, but I've been trying my best with my 50 year old new-to-stock brain to learn this. A lot of things regarding TA have stuck with me but the options....well...it's all GREEK to me. (see what I did there...lol)"

2021-06-27 17:59:53,wallstreetbets,"This is a really great primer for anyone interested in options. Natenberg's 2nd Edition is the standard for anyone seriously interested, while keeping much of the reading light on the mathematics.

I'd only add that Delta can be modeled by the sigmoid function whose range is bounded between 0 and 1. The Gamma function is just the first derivative of Delta. The rate of change of an exponential function is itself exponential, which explains why options can be so lucrative. 

For round 2, you could even go into CRR trees for options modeling. The binomial model is straightforward. There are limitations to that, and Black-Scholes in general (the classical model does not account for early exercise in American options) and both assume constant volatility and interest rates. There have been extensions for dividends in the original, and variations for futures and Forex options (the Black Model, and Garman-Kohlhagen), but for basic Black-Scholes, CRR trees break this down nice visually.

At the esteemed St V-M (same hs as lebron and was a sr when he was a 6’4 150lb freshman that still avg 17ppg and led us to 1st state championship) anyway I think RKT is severely undervalued and eventually will explode (again) I want to long it. Never bought an option contract of any sort before. Ideally I would like to buy one a year from expiry that I could exercise anytime between now and then (Bc I’m a free American, not a euro, although euro roulette is better than American Bc there’s only 0 and NOT 0 and 00) considering your post I think I want a straight long with no hedges Bc hey, RKT is at ipo prices while net profiting billions. My brain can’t process how the Greek stuff/equations play into my strategy. How about a hypothetical example RKT is $20.14 right now.

2021-06-27 11:19:08,wallstreetbets,So buy gay puts instead?
2021-06-27 13:45:43,wallstreetbets,Step 1. Listen to people say “(insert stock here) to the moon!”. Step 2: sell overpriced calls to retards in said stock. Step 3: watch idiots blow their money and come away with free money. Step 4: make money like a chad
2021-06-27 12:13:32,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying if people sell their shares, the people who do options lose money? Asking for a retard."
2021-06-27 16:33:29,wallstreetbets,Plan simplified.
2021-06-27 10:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Careful, you might start making money with that attitude."
2021-06-27 16:26:04,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-27 11:33:51,wallstreetbets,"You would usually just sell the options before expiration and pocket the $45k.  Alternatively, you can let them expire and if you don’t have the cash to buy the stock your broker will simply exercise them for you and immediately sell the shares on your behalf.  Either way you keep the profit.  Generally tho, I sell before expiry and make my money via the increase in the contract’s value."
2021-06-27 11:34:22,wallstreetbets,"All I've done is lose money on options, but I think in theory, the vast majority of people buying options absolutely never intend to exercise the calls. In fact, they might not even care if the stock actually reaches the strike price. All they care about is that the value of the option contract goes up.

So in your example, the options contracts were 1 dollar. If the stock starts moving up and the value of each contract goes to 2 dollars, then you just doubled your money, so you sell the contracts because as you say, you don't have the money to buy all the shares if you wanted to exercise.

Most of the insane gains on options contracts are people buying options when the volatility is low, so the price of the option is cheaper, then when volatility increases (because the stock is making an ""unexpected"" significant move) the contract value goes way up.

At least, that's my understanding, but don't listen to me."
2021-06-27 11:47:32,wallstreetbets,You can sell the calls at any time but you can’t exercise for the shares if you don’t have the cash to pay for it
2021-06-27 11:51:26,wallstreetbets,"I could be wrong (most likely am) but I believe you don't have to actually call the shares when the underlying pops. When it pops, the call options you hold pop in value too. So you can still profit the same by selling the call option itself rather than exercising it and then selling the shares."
2021-06-27 13:13:31,wallstreetbets,"You have to be very careful with this. If those options are ITM and it expires, you don’t have the money to exercise those options to take delivery of the shares. It won’t be exercised in your account on expiration and you’ll lose it. Make sure you sell the options prior to expiration if you don’t have the liquidity to cover the stock"
2021-06-27 12:24:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks for asking this question. It is the same thing I had been trying to get clarity on as well.
2021-06-27 11:44:13,wallstreetbets,"You sell the option, this might help you.
https://www.moolanomy.com/4687/how-to-read-option-ticker-symbols-jschroeder12/"
2021-06-27 12:57:34,wallstreetbets,tendies?
2021-06-27 17:08:58,wallstreetbets,"Are you talking about exercising your option? Ill use call as example because what you want to do is sell the call to close it out. So if the call you bought pops you go in and sell it (the opposite of what you did to get the option) to close it out cause your not gonna exercise it and you dont want to risk losing the value of it and have it expire worthless if price starts to dip and the other question about not having the money, you won't get assigned unless you have the buying power for it. 

So the best thing to do is not let it get to expiry just sell it back before then and thats your profit. This is my understanding Keep learning man im right there with you too."
2021-06-27 13:17:44,wallstreetbets,"You can do both. If you have enough money you can simply exercise and buy a bunch of stock, after which you can either hold it or sell it back at the market. If you dont have the money, or just want to hold on to any extrinsic value, you can just sell the contracts to someone else. Unless theres relatively little liquidity, making it hard to sell the calls, I'd recommend just selling them rather than exercising, even if you have the money."
2021-06-27 09:17:18,wallstreetbets,TLDR: Buy options when their price is low. Sell them when their price is high. Make lots of 🍌
2021-06-27 09:25:00,wallstreetbets,Cleveland Cliffs version.  Buy Jan 2022 calls get rich.

All in!"
2021-06-27 10:08:12,wallstreetbets,Lol im gonna wait for the YouTube version
2021-06-27 16:48:29,wallstreetbets,"TL;DR:  If you make the wrong assumption that all price movements in stocks are random and stochastic, you can then use math to characterize those movements in aggregate.  Most people can't understand the math, let alone why the underlying assumptions permitting its use are violated; and people love things they don't understand, like mysteries and horror stories; so there is always someone talking about it."
2021-06-27 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Here's a secret, If you buy the ones way out of the money they're cheaper. Thank me later!"
2021-06-27 10:41:10,wallstreetbets,now thats how to clean out an account.

2021-06-27 12:27:38,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree with you. I tested also buying option, and the result is losing money. I make money only with selling option"
2021-06-27 14:23:09,wallstreetbets,Dangerous and shitty advice from a literal amateur. This ignores tail risk and doesn’t profit on a risk-adjusted basis. Selling naked puts is a good way to expose yourself to infinite downside risk with limited upside gain. “Picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.”
2021-06-27 11:12:18,wallstreetbets,"I agree that the odds are in your favor when selling. If a stock goes sideways or in your direction, you win. It can even go down a bit and you still win. For the other beginners reading this… Selling, however, has unlimited risk unless you sell spreads. Sell a bull put spread and your risk is defined.

Buys singles. Sell spreads."
2021-06-27 12:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Lol and you do all that just to get beaten by buy and hold because you got exercised at bad times. It works until it doesn't work.

That's not to say that selling options isn't a good strategy if you know what you're doing, which few people do (I don't). r/thetagang is full of people gambling on meme stocks instead of actually maximizing their return selling theta."
2021-06-27 12:56:46,wallstreetbets,r/thetagang is for you
2021-06-27 12:47:44,wallstreetbets,Theta Gang approved strategy.
2021-06-27 13:12:39,wallstreetbets,So both buy and sell options to lose 170% money. Got it.
2021-06-27 16:36:19,wallstreetbets,"Selling naked anything is fucking retarded.  Emphasis on NAKED.  There's a reason they call it naked.  It means you have no protection from the elements (i.e. market movement).  If you expose yourself to INFINITE LOSSES in either direction, you WILL get fucked.  Buying, on the other hand, you can only lose the money you spent on the option premium.  The fact that this absolute dogshit advice has over 100 upvotes should be enough for smart people to realize that most WSBers have no idea what the fuck they're doing."

2021-06-27 10:16:55,wallstreetbets,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ironcondor.asp

Its essentially buying a call, selling a call, buying a put, and selling a put. All of these must have same expiration price. The idea here is that you are betting the stock remains within the range specified by your strike prices. You are betting against volatility. 

I do not use iron condors. If I want to bet on a stagnant stock price, I just do a collar."
2021-06-27 11:36:15,wallstreetbets,"It's like a regular condor, but tougher."
2021-06-27 12:44:54,wallstreetbets,"It's similar to a wooden condor but with more iron. Also, it's a strategy of using two option spreads to profit off the underlying stock price moving sideways instead of increasing or decreasing. Its made up of 2 calls and 2 puts. A good brokerage will let you set it up as a single trade though to reduce commission cost."
2021-06-27 10:12:51,wallstreetbets,Im saying buy american or GTFO commie
2021-06-27 11:04:05,wallstreetbets,"A strike is the price on the contract. If you buy an $AAPL call with a $100 strike and it expires in the money, you gain 100 shares of Apple for a deal. Everyone else needs to pay $133 for the stock currently.  But most options traders don’t make money this way. We buy and sell these contracts before they expire, making money (or losing) from the price changes in the contract itself."
2021-06-27 11:05:22,wallstreetbets,The strike price is the target price.  It is the price at which the option is considered ITM (in the money.)
2021-06-27 11:20:49,wallstreetbets,And how do you create a call? Can you not do it on all brokerages?
2021-06-27 11:29:45,wallstreetbets,"When you buy and sell a call, that’s it. Nothing happens besides you make or lose money. When you sell it to someone else, that other person is now on the contract."
2021-06-27 11:42:53,wallstreetbets,"When you’re buying options you don’t need anything but the buying power to purchase it in the first place. When buy an option contract and then sell that same option contract, you are done. You have exited the position and locked in your profit or loss."
2021-06-27 19:20:47,wallstreetbets,Get your money back and donate it to my OnlyFans pls
2021-06-27 13:42:35,wallstreetbets,Oh god give it to me
2021-06-27 18:54:13,wallstreetbets,thats the optimal outcome. do not exercise.
2021-06-27 10:08:30,wallstreetbets,"When you sell to close an option, if the buyer was not short that option they are now long the option. If the buyer was short that option (had written at that strike and expiration) then they close their position by buying the long side. This matters very little to you if you were selling to close; you lock in your profit or loss regardless."
2021-06-27 13:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thanks. I put down the important parts in this post. There's also other stuff I wan to add to it as well such as Black and Scholes, the math behind a gamma squeeze, answering certain questions such as buying OTM or ITM calls, volatility curves, etc but for the interest of time I decided to leave those out."
2021-06-27 10:54:48,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean to type theta decay? Theta will disappear over time and exponentially faster as the contract approaches expiration. Delta doesn’t decay, but it can get smaller as the contract goes further out of the money. This is actually a good thing when the option is going the wrong direction."
2021-06-27 11:45:25,wallstreetbets,"This is an advanced technique that requires specialized hardware, like a short ladder."
2021-06-27 11:13:21,wallstreetbets,"I think its because option value is still being effected by weekends even if the stocks aren't traded. Remember, with options you are betting that a stock is going to move a certain way within a timeframe and that timeframe is still being effected by weekend days."
2021-06-27 11:52:07,wallstreetbets,"You can buy a call at any strike price they’re being sold at. Someone smarter than me would have to explain how an ITM call would behave, but my understanding is it would generally go up & down in value with the stock price but have less volatility."
2021-06-27 11:29:48,wallstreetbets,Im doing level 3 but you learn the majority by level 2

2021-06-27 14:02:06,wallstreetbets,"People sell the price goes down. People holding short term OTM options (all they can likely afford) promptly get fucked, and not in a good way. Aka the people that bought my BB $30 weekly covered calls last month for 2.5 in premium. Price had shot up to $20 all of a sudden so people were going batshit. Closed those positions back out for effectively free the next day."
2021-06-27 13:21:40,wallstreetbets,So this is where you use sell to close after the stock has exceeded strike?
2021-06-27 17:15:06,wallstreetbets,so is this why I made profit from a call option even though the share price was no where near the strike price I bought it at (because the contract price went up)? I bought AMC a couple of weeks ago a day before expire. paid 38 at 9am and sold it at 11am for 273. I'm still perplexed as to why I made a profit.  I'm certainly trying my best to understand options..but it's still all greek to me. I'll get there eventually though.
2021-06-27 13:14:49,wallstreetbets,"You really have to be careful with this. It depends on who your brokerage firm is. My friend was using Merrill Edge and his AMZN calls expired ITM, but this was his personal account and he didn’t have the cash to cover the stock, so he got fucked"
2021-06-27 12:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I have never exercised my calls. I've made a bit on calls, and lost a bit but certainly up overall. I have an oil play I may exercise my calls in for the cash distribution when the time comes but otherwise I virtually would never exercise."
2021-06-27 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,"Ive exercised 10 options total, but they were deep itm on stocks I wanted, and low IV, making them not as profitable as holding the stock.  I now horde that stock until the IV goes up again and then will sell covered calls for maximum profit.  There are other reasons to exercise too, like to cover an assigned put, or if the option is at the money and you are able to minimize loss."
2021-06-27 13:23:12,wallstreetbets,"So as above, this is where you use the Sell to Close on the option?

You buy to open at whatever premium/strike price, once it's popped (hopefully) you sell to close to pocket the profits?  


thank you"
2021-06-27 16:49:43,wallstreetbets,"Most brokers will sell itm options for you if you don't exercise by 1 hour before close.  Robinhood, webull, etrade, public, etc etc etc all do this by default, but it's a setting you can turn off if you like being risky."
2021-06-27 19:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I finally understand where I was confused conceptually about this.  Basically the idea is to buy the call, hope it moves in the direction you want it to and sell to close before expiration.  At least unless your goal is assignment to pick up the stock.

Thanks everyone for the clear explanations.  For a bunch of crayon eaters, there's a lot of smart folks here."
2021-06-27 14:33:08,wallstreetbets,"Got it.   I am thinking (like all greedy apes) about using it to simply get short-term profits rather than increase a portfolio.

I mean logically, if the stocks are at 100, I have the cash already, it makes more sense to just buy at 100 rather than take options at 105.  I think."

2021-06-27 13:51:27,wallstreetbets,When the stock gets exercised I put in a buy order for the strike price and wait for it to tumble. I sell options at 7-10% above current with a ~6 week exercise date and get ~2.5-3.5% return with just the option value. If the stock gets exercised that means I made 10+% in 6 weeks. And we know how these volatile stocks are…volatile. So they just come tumbling back down for me to gobble them up again. Yummy

2021-06-27 13:17:25,wallstreetbets,"I know this is a joke, but naked long options aren't a thing."
2021-06-27 14:18:17,wallstreetbets,"Yup that’s exactly it, you sell the contract after exceeding the strike price and before the expiration date if you don’t have the cash/don’t want the assigned shares"
2021-06-27 14:58:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes; you can also sell to close even if the stock has NOT exceeded the strike price, because even as the stock approaches the strike your options will increase in extrinsic value."
2021-06-27 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,Quick sidenote - you can sell to close anytime. Option doesn’t have to be ITM to close it out if for some reason you were happy with gains to that point or wanted to mitigate losses etc
2021-06-27 17:37:28,wallstreetbets,Yes. As the stock price approaches the strike price the value of your option will increase and you can sell for a profit even though it is not ‘in the money’.  It’s kind of the point of scalping options.
2021-06-27 15:02:16,wallstreetbets,Never heard of that happening and have been trading for quite some time.  It’s possible he inadvertently told Merrill he intended to exercise therefore they did not do so on his behalf.  Such an issue should be easily avoidable.

2021-06-27 14:37:55,wallstreetbets,"With regards to your second example, yes. The way people use options to take possession of stock is to, for example, buy a 95 call when the stock is trading at 100. In this way, you gain the exposure of 100 shares without spending the full amount. If the stock drops below 95, you lose pretty much everything you spent on the option, but cant lose more, and if the stock goes up you can always exercise and buy the shares later at the price of 95. You can do this same thing with OTM options, but if you actually want to own the shares down the line that's not as effective of a way to do it."
2021-06-27 18:38:05,wallstreetbets,"All the worst advice I've gotten in the markets have been from old, retail traders that were incredibly sure of themselves."
2021-06-27 18:51:06,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations.  You made $1mm selling Puts. They must've been the most expensive and riskiest Puts in the world.

You're full of shit buddy; If a Put pays a lot of money, then it is because the seller is being accomodated for their risk (it's very likely to pay out). If it pays very little it's because it's not likely to pay out.

Your ""strategy"" empirically falls apart if you were to keep doing it over 20 years, especially if you aren't scaling it with tons of collateral.

&#x200B;

EDIT: No unlimited risk? You literally collect a premium and your risk is to have to pay out the difference when the Put is ITM - e.g. when the market shits itself, the Put will become very valuable and you can be on the hook for the differential + continuation value, which at most can be the entire Strike per share that the contract underlies if the stock went to zero (which is probably won't, but that's technically the maximum it can go down to). That's the ""risk"" you claim doesn't exist."
2021-06-27 11:37:00,wallstreetbets,Yep. Naked exactly. Thanks for adding that.  It’s good for the new kids to read this.
2021-06-27 14:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Yea it is limited risk to sell puts or CCs, but still far far higher possible loss than buying them. I imagine that is what they meant although they didn’t use the right words but who knows. 

Just as an illustration for whoever may need it:

If you sell a weekly put at a 10$ strike for .1, you still have a possible loss of $990 theoretically while the buyer has a possible loss of 10$. 99 times the risk kind of feels unlimited in comparison though it is certainly defined. Again it is only theoretical generally unlikely that you lose your entire collateral on a weekly.

The selling and buying of CCs has a similar risk comparison."
2021-06-27 16:34:26,wallstreetbets,">I put in a buy order for the strike price and wait for it to tumble.

Lol yup, then it rockets and you're left with nothing but cash and your dick in hand. Then a week later you forgot to turn off your limit order and you catch a sharp as fuck knife and spend the rest of your days selling increasingly less otm trying to futilely to get your ""adjusted cost basis"" down...and then suddenly it moons and you're exercised for a loss, or you roll and do it all over worse.

Again, selling options on meme stocks works until it doesn't. It can be fun seeing such fat premiums and ""either I sell for a profit, or keep the premium for free"" seems to be mostly easy money, but you eventually get fucked.

(This totally didn't happen to me)"
2021-06-27 11:37:33,wallstreetbets,You basically decide the range you think the price will stay within. Then you sell a call around the top of the range and buy a call at a higher strike to cap your losses if the price 🚀 & blows through. You also sell a put around the bottom of the range and buy a put at a lower strike to cap your losses if the price plummets & blows through your short strike. All these options have the same expiration date.
2021-06-27 12:31:26,wallstreetbets,"It would be hard to make money only holding for a day or two unless you’re very close to expiration, and that makes it much more risky. Normally you’d sell a fairly wide iron condor and hold it for a couple weeks while the extrinsic value decays.

If you want to make neutral trades on a shorter timeframe, strangles are the same as iron condors but without protection (i.e. buying the further OTM options). With an iron condor, you have a maximum possible loss. With strangles you have unlimited potential loss but you make more money and you make it faster. They’re a great way to make a bunch of money a bunch of times and then lose all of that money at once."

I'd bet a majority here don't understand how puts and calls work on both sides of the transaction. Very basic stuff isn't widely understood. Plus charm doesn't really matter unless you're a dealer delta hedging, something else 95% of retail has never heard of. You'll know because they'll claim ITM call options are going to force dealers to panic and buy loads of shares at expiration when in reality they're constantly balancing their deltas.

Anyway good info nonetheless. Probably more appropriate for the r/options sub. I've seen a couple market makers post there in the past."

If you sell a put on a $10 stock with 45-60 days to expiration you’d be foolish to take less than .80-$1 but that’ll depend on the share price vs the exercise price.  If the shares are near $18 and it’s a $10 strike price the premium will be near a dime but that would not be a trade worth doing"
2021-06-27 16:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Lol I don’t do it on meme stocks really. I do it on stocks I’m planning on holding that have volatility above average. It’s gotten me consistent returns. And I’m fine with it dipping below the buy order after I buy because, well, I was planning on the stock being a buy and hold anyway. I just let other people pay me a premium for my stock that I’m planning on buying and holding regardless. Then I put the premiums into index funds and let that build until I either double up on current stocks or find a new one I like and do the same thing. You have to be pretty active when your calls are expiring (or if the call loses all value quickly I buy it back for pennies and sell another) but other than that it’s just me collecting premiums on stock I’m planning on owning long term anyway. It’s hard to pass up immediate 3% returns every 6 weeks."

Wanna sort me out?"
2021-06-27 14:11:19,wallstreetbets,"Good points. I use charm even when I'm long though. At least very close to expiration (like 1dte), a heavily loaded options chain's net charm gives a bit of an indication of how the stock will move the next day. But you're right, it's much more helpful when selling."

2021-06-27 17:10:04,wallstreetbets,"You are not on the hook, you bought the contract to open a position then sold to close. The original option writer would have sold to open a position, they can buy to close at anytime, then the liability would shift to whoever sold them the contract back.

Key things to understand are you can 'sell to open', 'buy to close', 'buy to open' and 'sell to close'.

If you write an option you are selling to open

If you wrote an option and you want to get out of the position you will buy to close

If you buy an option you are buying to open

If you want to sell an option that you bought you will be selling to close.

You have no liability on a closed position"
2021-06-27 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,"No. Not exactly. 

The breakeven price is what the underlying stock would need to be priced at *at expiration* for someone exercising/assigning  the contract to make a profit on those actual shares (x100). 

The amount you can sell the options contract itself for can be profitable at any time if the sales price of the contract > purchase price of the contract. 

The two are related (obviously) but not dependent upon one another. Two different supply/demand bid/ask markets (one for the shares and one for the options)."

ITM options at expiry are getting closed out, period.  There’s no reason to create debt like what you’re describing.  Your buddy is either A) a moron or B) misunderstood something.  No broker is going to create an FTD on a retail contract when it’s ITM and the FTD is avoidable."

2021-06-27 10:37:03,wallstreetbets,"Dont take my word for it but if I remember correctly, European options still adhere to the same information I have stated in my post. I think the main difference is the pricing models used to value the fundamental values for European and American options. 

European options are valued based on present value  of positive cash outflow( for calls ) and present value of cash inflow ( for puts ). 

American options are priced by the market makers using the Black and Scholes model. It is a statistical pricing model that covers a broad range of assumptions you can look up on your own free time."

2021-06-27 14:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Well maybe I'm a worse trader for overlooking it, but I've never used 2nd order derivatives to trade and done ok.

One thing I'm studying now is how dealer gamma can pin spy or indicate where the price will land, when it's overbought and sold, etc. I've seen some traders who use this to trade spy and when to short volatility. They use it to predict those intraday V shaped rallies we've had.

Spotgamma.com I think focuses on this. But I have a lot more learn before I start trading it. It is interesting to look at the put walls in SPY and SPX every week, which are largely just massive hedges dealers sell. Theory is their delta hedging of these walls is what sets a floor in the market and moves the index."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly DD - WISH: The shopping mall in your pocket (Full DD because nobody asked) **Overview**

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let’s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation. 

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH’s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates. 
* WISH’s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

https://preview.redd.it/lazx0wzots771.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9d9b596338c225c0fb8d9dbae4579b9f84faf2e

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.

&#x200B;

* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%** of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables…

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019. 

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

https://preview.redd.it/erjzrtqqts771.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c34dd891a3104e2fc3228d1ea78efcbb142e1f5

&#x200B;

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it’s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash. 

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What’s concerning is that it’s only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

Positions: Long shares of stock."

2021-06-27 09:29:32,wallstreetbets,Isn’t WISH just a re skinned Ali express.  I don’t see what makes them any more unique than them.
2021-06-27 16:09:41,wallstreetbets,Wish is good for Chinese knockoffs and scams. Not much more.
2021-06-27 18:50:13,wallstreetbets,Their products are absolute garbage. Don't try and play off their unbranded products as a good thing. It just means they are willing to hose their customer's with inferior products at inflated prices.
2021-06-27 10:16:13,wallstreetbets,I think it's crazy people do these mental gymnastics to find value in a company like WISH when if you ever used it you know its an awful company. Their business model is based entirely on the occasional person's occasional curiosity that I guarantee only about a third of its customers feel satisfied at all with the transaction. Analytics don't change that. Find a company thats over shorted that sells more than a disappointing gimmick. I would not want to be left holding the bag for a company like wish but I promise there are good companies unfairly manipulated by shorts out there available to help squeeze. I'm not going to list any here because it would seem like I was just trying to pump them up but I assure you WISH isn't one. The hedges want you to make WISH and GME the battleground.

2021-06-27 11:37:53,wallstreetbets,WISH is the all in one scam package in your pocket. It doesn't create any value other than to ship shit from china to the rest of the world. Stuff is cheaply and badly manufactured just to get quick bucks. As long as any scammer on this planet can sell it's trash without real consequences through this casino like app I will stay miles away from this company.

2021-06-27 10:11:46,wallstreetbets,"Different days; the 40 calls at 60 dollar strike price I bought on Friday: cost 27k. Biggest investment I’ve ever made. My mind can barely comprehend spending a cars worth of money given the chance that it can all go down the drain. I took a ton of profits though, so no matter what happens, I’ll be happy."
2021-06-27 12:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Yep I'm not going all in anymore haha. I'll at least have 20k that I'll take out and I'll put a lot more in less risky investments. However, I am still bullish and plan to make a lot more on SPCE!"
2021-06-27 13:28:30,wallstreetbets,The uncle we wish we didn't have
2021-06-27 10:06:18,wallstreetbets,"I just bought these at different times. I bought the 65 dollar call 7/16 back in March when the stock price was high,  then the 55 dollar one after it dropped some more, then the 46 dollar after it dropped even more. Different expiration days hedge risk: if the stock price doesn’t reach a point by one day then at least you’ll have the calls expiring later on. I don’t buy ITM calls, so as I buy more the price changes so I’ll buy higher strike prices. Don’t know if there is a known strategy; that’s just how I did it."
2021-06-27 12:05:29,wallstreetbets,Buy more at a lower cost
2021-06-27 12:33:27,wallstreetbets,"I see it haha Just putting that out their , seem way too many posts of “ Gains “ but the next day people update and their “ gains “ are gone lol"
2021-06-27 15:25:37,wallstreetbets,Lol man 😂
2021-06-27 14:05:44,wallstreetbets,I agree… this isn’t a p&D … this is actual hype to go to space
2021-06-27 09:18:33,wallstreetbets,Next one is when superAPE  Branson supposedly takes flight to space on the 4th ?
2021-06-27 11:03:19,wallstreetbets,SuperAPE Branson is his name. I just hope he doesn't get stuck in the galaxy otherwise then I have to think of PUT strategy

2021-06-27 13:20:07,wallstreetbets,You think you’re trying to sound cool gatekeeping a Reddit sub but you sound like a major tool.
2021-06-27 11:23:04,wallstreetbets,I mean we were hoping for a gamma squeeze so I don't think that's inaccurate... I mean I am an idiot because I am down $10000 for the last two weeks but I don't think I'm an idiot for calling a gamma squeeze a squeeze
2021-06-27 12:09:06,wallstreetbets,"20k is right around the amount I'd take out if it were me also lol. I like the way you think, guy. Congratulations on the home run and don't forget us when you buy your lambo!"
2021-06-27 12:20:15,wallstreetbets,"that's what they all say until there's a couple of losses and they bet on the next ""sure thing"""
2021-06-27 13:22:04,wallstreetbets,Am a victim of this. Never know when to sell
2021-06-27 09:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Don’t know if he will fly the 4th.. source just said that they were looking into it. He could, but I think there is a good chance he goes up the weekend of the 18th which is his birthday and still before the Bezos flight. We will see though; a lot of uncertainty, but I’m still bullishly optimistic"
2021-06-27 11:06:48,wallstreetbets,Yeah no gtfo my man there was hardly DD in the golden age of WSB options and only gain and loss porn. Get with the culture or fuck off

Congrats btw"
2021-06-27 16:51:45,wallstreetbets,How this test flight makes difference than before test?
2021-06-27 11:39:09,wallstreetbets,Its a new place now. New apes in charge. Times change. Accept it and enjoy the rides
2021-06-27 18:57:21,wallstreetbets,Why is a random reddit schlub speaking with some type of authority? 🤣
2021-06-27 14:25:00,wallstreetbets,Now you just sound like a crotchety old man.
2021-06-27 16:09:02,wallstreetbets,"Sheep are cool now big bro?

But you said just for fucking before…"
2021-06-27 16:46:02,wallstreetbets,"Why are you acting like I have not already said I was an idiot? I did not get played i made a bad call. When I said ""we"" I was referencing the group including myself and others who discussed the possibility of a gamma squeeze due to the high OI on 6/18."
2021-06-27 09:52:21,wallstreetbets,"I kept buying the dip until I had put 2k into it. I was pretty embarrassed because my account was down 90 percent at one point, but I ended up getting calls with strike prices in the 20s that expired at the end of May for very cheap in the middle of May. After the flight, the calls went ITM and I sold those and bought more OTM calls at later dates. I was anticipating an announcement last week so I YOLOed a few thousand dollars for 70 contracts that had strike prices in the mid 40s. My current positions are on the last picture :)"
2021-06-27 16:50:26,wallstreetbets,there was never a gamma squeeze
2021-06-27 10:04:07,wallstreetbets,"Was it you or someone else that was posting about SPCE like a month ago and it was getting deleted?

Damn I missed out lol"
2021-06-27 17:10:31,wallstreetbets,Drama squeezes are cool.
2021-06-27 10:08:22,wallstreetbets,"Probably not me; I mostly lurked in the past. Don’t feel bad for missing out—there are plenty of opportunities out there, I just got pretty lucky."
2021-06-27 14:46:07,wallstreetbets,That happened a lot more than people realize. After the successful test flight a lot of people posted about SPCE but most posts got deleted. I’m surprised the mods here are letting SPCE posts be now. Very nice!

2021-06-27 12:35:26,wallstreetbets,I think SPCE is perfect pump and dump. I think it will lose all gains in next week or two.
2021-06-27 13:13:55,wallstreetbets,Yes. I'd like to give a shout out to the ape that told me about spce when it was 16$. I tried to go back through my comments and find him so I could suck his di k but no luck
2021-06-27 08:08:20,wallstreetbets,I guess it wasn’t the time for our bird to fly yet
2021-06-27 12:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Whenever I mentioned it in the daily thread it usually got a couple upvotes.

Too bad I sold covered calls at $40 so I missed the entire 40% gain on Friday."

2021-06-27 11:42:06,wallstreetbets,Sony Vegas. Learned it as I was making the video
2021-06-27 14:54:38,wallstreetbets,"A pump and dump is something that rises without a reason: no good news (occasionally fake hype), no catalysts, it just has huge gains temporarily then quickly goes back to the norm. Now while SPCE very well may go back down a bit, it rose due to successful space flight, and now FAA approval. Meaning it is not a pump and dump as there were very logical reasons for its climb."
2021-06-27 12:57:51,wallstreetbets,That means you don't know about the events ahead lol
2021-06-27 19:23:37,wallstreetbets,Your moms a pump and dump
2021-06-27 13:59:37,wallstreetbets,All I ask in return is 20k in shares and your welcome

2021-06-27 12:51:49,wallstreetbets,That sucks. I sold CCs at $125 7/16 and I'm a lil scurred tbh

2021-06-27 07:19:48,wallstreetbets,Why will it push 200? If you’re so sure why not pick those otm
2021-06-27 10:16:45,wallstreetbets,I have been buying CROX leaps and encouraging others to do so only to be mocked and admonished. Glad to see a fellow CROX boi. If u listen to any of their earnings calls they are constantly talking about breaking into new markets and expanding in others. Pretty low float ticker as well. I have been speculating 130 after this earnings and 150 eoy but I like ur pt’s better.
2021-06-27 08:45:22,wallstreetbets,I love the play but I just sold my calls after the blowout Nike earnings. It’s still on my watch list!
2021-06-27 07:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Because you still have to account for external events in your risk-reward analysis and deep ITM calls provide the most value with the least amount of risk in this scenario. If the market took a shit in the next 6 months and the S&P fell 20%. I’m fairly confident that $CROX wouldn’t gain 66%. However, if the market is flat or positive their isn’t a single security that j would rather own. $NKE killed earnings on Friday and was up 15%. $CROX is going to kill it at the end of July and will be above $150 come mid-August. And then it’ll slowly but surely cross $200 and I wouldn’t be surprised if it reached towards my upper target for this year of $250. 

Look I have greater than $500K in calls. I also have a couple hundred $K in the stock itself in my Roth and other taxable account. You do whatever you want, it’s just easy money."

# NOKIA once had a market cap greater than Apple's

# NOK is a 150 year old company that has reinvented itself more times than Vegas

# The future is industry 4.0 and NOK has specifically targeted this in a multifaceted approach

Probably the most significant acquisition was Bell Labs with Alcatel-Lucent which means NOK's R&D is unparalleled. That acquisition was for around half of the current market cap, just to put it into perspective.

NOK has a similar cash flow and revenue to main 5/6g rival ERIC but a much lower market cap. This would be an initial target.

**Summary of scope of NOK Industry 4.0:**

* **Arguably most valuable 5g patents globally**
* **Has a western duopoly on 5g deployment with ERIC**
* **EU lead for 6g**
* **NOK blockchain data marketplace**
* **NOK M2M IoT Wing**

For quick context, Warren Buffet stated in several interviews and reports suggesting that the near crash is going to be caused by a few factors. The largest main factor in this imminent bubble is due to the debt of Margin Lending mainly due the pandemic causing the debt to increase 49% in the year of 2020. One other sub factor is due to the low interest loans that are being tossed out to every fool who can press a few buttons on a cell phone.

Should this be of concern? If so…

2021-06-27 05:49:40,wallstreetbets,"Margin debt is roughly double the level of the Great Recession and dot com bubble. (850B over 400/450B respectively I believe).

 The stock market size is roughly triple, 50T as opposed to 15/18T (2000/2007)

So while margin debt is high if you look at the dollar amount…, it is much much lower with respect to the market size of both the last ‘bubbles’. 

There is a book called animals spirits that talks about bubbles in general, but the main reason I bring it up is because it talks about why people make market predictions. Being right once is worth exponentially more than being wrong frequently. So people will always blurt out predictions on the stock market and if they don’t come through nobody pays any attention, but if you get it right once everybody thinks you’re a genius. (A great example of this is Dr Burry going way way short bonds during the last fed meeting and getting it completely wrong, did you hear about that? Probably not) So as markets approach the peak of a cycle everybody starts screaming crash and citing all sorts of reasons that are unprecedented. Doesn’t mean they are wrong, they could be right, but they are definitely not right just because things today are different than they were in the past. Best to keep things into perspective."

Another thing to keep in mind is that the most correct market predictions are backed by in depth market research which being the extreme minority makes this whole thing seems like a fake out. But… I’m thinking we are just a little early and from all the charts I’ve looked at it seems like the pandemic and the money printer saved us some time. Meaning that we were already set a course for another crash due the pattern in high level of margin debt. Although, the dollar amount is lower, the inflation rate has also sky rocketed creating a cycle of inflated debt. Like I said we might just be a little early."

2021-06-27 06:22:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes maybe to all those things, but correlation does not infer causation, and while I was with you on inflation problems my opinion has changed to match that of the fed (being it is transitory and the supporting evidence for that is the decrease in commodities across the board).

The theory is that purchasers for companies purchased much more than they need trying to overcome supply chain restrictions and now that everybody is stocked up on durable and non-durable goods from being stuck at home the money will be focused more towards the service sector which makes perfect sense. The decrease in commodity prices seems to support the fact that purchasers are canceling raw material orders which would mean the next few periods of inflation will be much lower and support the transitory theory. Of course time will tell but the commodity prices don’t lie and they seem to be saying exactly what the Fed has this entire time. I didn’t formulate these opinions by myself, I obviously watched a bunch of smart people talk about their predictions of the near future and these are the ones that I happen to agree with.

There is no doubt going to be a large shock when the Fed announces it is not buying bonds at its current rate anymore, but the sector rotation last week back into tech shows that most smart money is seeing the same.

In any case, there are a lot of other variables out there that I think are a bigger concern over margin debt. Specifically the amount of bonds being purchased by the Fed every month… And purchasers and commodities coming to some sort of equilibrium so we can get a true idea of what the actual supply chain restrictions are after a fully opened economy worldwide.

Margin debt being high before a crash and lower afterwards I really do not think is an indicator. I think it is a result."

2021-06-27 05:23:04,wallstreetbets,"No, it was not sarcasm. I was speaking on the statement that the op had that the pandemic caused the debt to increase by 49% in 2020.

2021-06-27 12:46:19,wallstreetbets,I wasn't talking about either of those specifically. I was referring to the trend where Americans started paying down credit card debt and increasing savings during the pandemic. That trend has reversed.

2021-06-27 05:49:04,wallstreetbets,Because I’m high and I feel like shooting the shit with other retards on the potential to make millions with a correctly timed long term atm put/call on the entire market
2021-06-27 13:36:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes,  the steel hold out could be the infrastructure spending everyone seems to think will pass. If that’s the case the affect on inflation would not be as big. 

Take stimulus for example, you give $1 in stimulus, The person you give it to saves a portion and spends the rest let’s say they spend $.80. Whoever they spend that $.80 with saves a portion and spends the rest let’s say they sped $.60 this repeats down the line until one dollar stimulus has basically a two or three dollar affect on the overall economy. This is the basis for new monetary theory with stimulus.

Now take purchasers for a business. Everyone sold out of inventory they could not get their stock or supply or whatever it was to do business. Demand went through the roof. Purchasers make purchases plus a certain amount in anticipation of meeting future demand extrapolating future demand based on current demand… Which was unnaturally high. This happens the same way as a stimulus dollar, the store orders more from supplier, the supplier orders more plus future anticipated increase from their supplier, on down the line until the demand is multiplied the same.

So now you have all this demand for raw materials, price goes up, inflation. The feds theory (and also some fund people like Cathy wood) is this demand is not real. Once consumer spending goes back into services/experiences this material demand will fall off and normalize. So will prices. And thus the transitory inflation. It makes sense to me and the commodity prices sort of confirm it."

2021-06-27 08:28:27,wallstreetbets,Don’t make any stock decisions while high…sound advice from the cat man 🤫
2021-06-27 05:36:42,wallstreetbets,Haha it reads like it is but I swear it’s not. I’m obviously aware of the debt and loans and credit cards a ton of people had to take and open and use to survive and had to default on them. And millions of retail investors have or will have to pull out all their money in the stock market. And the stimulus pump is gone so naturally the market should take a hit. But there’s also a huge influx of money into the economy that I thought would equal everything out or atleast make up for some of it.
2021-06-27 14:07:18,wallstreetbets,Ohh ok…where do you go to look at the numbers of these trends on the debt americans have and the rate in which they are or not paying off debt?

2021-06-27 16:26:00,wallstreetbets,"Dear gardening diary,

Today I mowed the yard finally, and picked a bunch of harlequin beetles, squashbugs and Japanese beetles off of plants in the yard.  I got the squashbug eggs too - ripped them straight out of  the pumpkin leaves.  A couple had hatched already but I think I got them all too.  I had wanted to spray BT on everything and the mosquito/tick repellent all over they yard but I'm too exhausted to even move any more.  Maybe tomorrow.  I got some thicc hypodermic needles last year to inject BT into the squash stems so I think I'll spray and inject for the squash vine borers and all the caterpillars eating my mustard plants.  Full on attack from nature this year.

Also I harvested a ton of Sage because it turned into a huge bush and was shading out the bush beans, asparagus, carrots, eggplants, pole beans and thyme (I've got a couple patches of it planted).  Lawdy... oh and I lost the nut off of one of the bolts holding  the lawnmower handle  together so I've ordered one of those big magnet wand things roofers use to find loose nails to hopefully find it, and it'll help me get the last of the staples and nails the shed roofers left in the yard because they didn't pick that stuff up ugh.  I mowed the front yard with 2 wire ties and a rubberband holding  the handle together lmao.  If I can't find it in the yard, I'll go to the hardware store and buy another one.  I gotta cut down all the little tree seedlings trying to sprout everywhere too still."

2021-06-27 11:20:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s because this a generational opportunity. When SAFE hits soon and institutions pile in this’ll be an easy 50%+ and when uplist follows it’ll be an easy 2x-3x. The path forward for MSOs is coming into focus. 
Tilray right now is a bit of a mess. I made a shitload of dough on APHA and flipped it into MSOs. Tilray may eventually be a powerhouse if they can dominate Europe but it’s too early to tell how likely that is. Curaleaf, I believe, will offer them some competition."

2021-06-27 11:13:30,wallstreetbets,That’s hilarious and completely ignorant. Tilray burns cash. Green thumb and Trulieve ALREADY have a positive bottom line and are growing rapidly. New York will be huge for Green Thumb. Green thumb will be close to $1B run rate on revenue 2Q

2021-06-27 12:17:57,wallstreetbets,"I pretty much completely agree with this. I don’t think tilray is a garbage company like sundial, it is well run and they know what they’re doing generally speaking now that Aphria and Irwin have taken over (because after all let’s not forget they only kept tilray’s name because of the meme/brand recognition bullshit, Aphria was the better run company) but either way it’s not a garbage company it’s just not as good of an investment as the multi state operators and I believe that is blatantly obvious at this point. $MSOS🇺🇸🚀"

2021-06-27 11:23:47,wallstreetbets,It’s a lot more risky to bank on Tilray dominating Europe. I hold Tilray as well but I’m much more excited about MSOs in the next few years. Tilray is not going to take over Europe without competition. And if they don’t become a major player in Europe the company won’t be worth shit. Canadian market is peanuts.
2021-06-27 09:03:10,wallstreetbets,"Ur smoked lmao. CanLP will be lucky to even be allowed entry into the USA weed market eventually. Hence the huge arbitrage between canopy and acreage right now. That’s why you also own GTI and Curaleaf. You should sell ur CanLP positions into cresco and Trulieve. There are too many mitigating factors against the CANLPs, the federal government is even considering not letting big business and foreigners in. CBD and anything else related to weed that’s not really weed isn’t gonna matter at all soon. Sweet water gives tilray nothing. There are already companies in the states making weed drinks and shit. I also once held the Canadians, but there’s no point when curaleaf just acquired for the European market, Columbia care has had a an overseas for years… I could go on and on, but that’s ok. I digress, good luck. I hope we all make money."

2021-06-27 11:33:29,wallstreetbets,I agree. I hold GTI and TLRY. But TLRY excites me more as a meme stock as opposed to MSOs being solid companies rapidly growing.
2021-06-27 09:49:53,wallstreetbets,"The second I saw Canadian LPS won't be allowed entry into the U.S I stopped reading. This is a bad take. While both will succeed, Tilray is way to big and popular of a brand to not be a clear winner overtime"
2021-06-27 10:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, don't call peope smoked when you have no clue what you're talking about lol.

CGC/TLRY/CRON will all be in the states. I'm sure you've heard of Constellation brands? Or Altria Group? Sweetwater isn't huge but it's part of TLRYs plan. They know what they are doing. 

Also, CL is cresco labs lol I don't hold CURA. Just Green Thumb and Cresco for MSOs. It would be silly to keep all eggs in one basket so ofc I'll play both sides. I wouldn't be surprised to see some of the MSOs get acquired or merged eventually.

I do agree with the last part of your post, I hope we all make money. And I think we will."

2021-06-27 10:08:16,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t say that they definitely won’t be allowed…. it’s on the table though and you have to take that into consideration man there’s a lot of talk about social equity blah blah blah they’re even considering not letting big corporations like big tobacco and alcohol get involved. it could get fuckin messy and if it does the Canadian LPs are fucked. Just saying…
Also USA players have first mover HUGE advantage. If tilray does not do something similar to what canopy and cron have done they will be in a very bad spot shortly… maybe too late"
2021-06-27 10:17:38,wallstreetbets,"You cannot guarantee Canadian companies will be permitted to sell weed in the USA. I know everything about what you’re talking about just because constellation Brands has a 40% stake in canopy, they kicked out Bruce Linton and installed their CFO as the new CEO doesn’t guarantee they’ll be allowed in. Bruce Linton paid a $300 million option to Kevin Murphy @ acreage (also no longer w their company) for potentially nothing… that’s the problem type of stuff. I could seriously go on and on… I took my $15k dividend I received from acreage for that, sold my shares and bought the other companies that didn’t tie themselves up and become stagnant like curaleaf and Trulieve.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why $GPRO never goes pro GoPro has been well established for 15+ years and seem to be everywhere. People use the cameras for all sorts of adventures and ego-feeding selfie and point of view videos. They have been in and out of the drone market. Yet the stock never seems to be able to hit $15.

Why such slow growth and stagnation when they keep releasing new products and seem so pervasive in the market? Undervalued with the potential to go big? Or just not much there? It always seems like something that could and should take off, but never does."

2021-06-27 04:40:07,wallstreetbets,Isn’t it established that Gopro going public was just to reward the initial backers. They don’t own anything. Just licensing sensors and software and given a 6-12 months leadtime.
2021-06-27 04:24:00,wallstreetbets,Their products are too reliable for great profitability. I still have a Hero 3 that does everything I need it to
2021-06-27 06:44:22,wallstreetbets,"Go pro needs to branch out and become more than a camera company. Such a huge opportunity to become the new “+” version of every popular consumer product. They have the branding and the exposure, they could easily partner with Nike and have “Pro Nike Travis Scott Jordan 4s”. Boom, $18,000 pair of SNKRS. Then partner and make a “Pro” version of every product out there, like Red did for project Red."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lets talk about BABA. Again. Reposting this cause my last one got deleted for some reason:

Alright listen up you retarded apes. After this weeks move its time we revisit BABA.

First my personal thoughts on why the move: everybody and their mother knows BABA is fundamentally undervalued but have been staying on the sidelines like scared little bitches because of some vague China fears. Same thoughts are running on the institutional side and majority of hedge funds being the sheep they are, they’re all afraid to act first and pull the trigger. With the public news of ARKK and a couple other funds buying up BABA and other Chinese stocks this has finally signaled to the other hedgies that its okay to invest in China and now theyre all trying to pile back in at the same time. Institutional FOMOs gonna drives this beast back up.

So imo the recent moves been sentiment driven but we havent even triggered any of the fundamental catalysts yet thatll further pump this bitch to the moon. Heres some to name a few, all likely due later this year or early next:

1. ANT IPO. Lot of ancillary news coming out around this such as Ant being approved to operate a consumer finance company by regulators, working together with state owned companies to create a credit scoring company. This shows Ant and the regulators are willing and able to work together. And making headwinds fast.
2. Listing of 9988 on the HKSE Stock Connect Southbound program. This means Chinese investors would finally be allowed to trade the stock and you bet these rich fuckers wont have the same hesitations American apes will about YOLO’ing into their home grown crown jewel company. This gets revisited if HKSE gets 55% share of outstanding shares traded vs the ADR. MSCI the giant index fund has already migrated their shares over from BABA to 9988 and other funds might follow suit to protect their shares in light of fears over US delisting Chinese stocks.
3. Earnings release - important number to look out for imo is BABA’s operating profits on their cloud computing arm Alicloud. They’ve invested a ton of money into cloud computing and gotten huge market share. So far they’ve always reported an operating loss on this but the numbers are improving every quarter and theyre on the cusp of finally being in the green now. This year might be when they finally turn a profit. For those who know, this was when AMZN skyrocketed and the same will happen to BABA when they finally get there. Cloud computing is a huge cash cow with big profits low costs that’ll be a huge boon on their operating margins which has been one of the only fundamental weak points of the company so far.
4. 13F filings for Q2. We all know the stock popped when Charlie Munger disclosed a position. We may see another if we see him adding to the position or if any of his other retard boomer investing buddies like Buffett getting in on it too.

For those who are worried they missed the move its not too late. My guess is there’ll probably be a pullback next week so you apes will still have a window to get in cheap. Plus this is not the type of typical retard wsb stonk that pumps one week and craters the next. This is THE stock with solid fundamentals that sets you up for early retirement. Together with the bonus of a short/mid term upward correction back to fair value. This is the next AMZN, the next AAPL staring at you right in the face. I know I’ll be adding to my position and my tits are already thoroughly jacked on this one to begin with.

Lastly, just look at BABAs net profit last year: $21bn. What was AMZNs net profit that year? $21bn. Except AMZNs market cap is $1.7 trillion and BABAs is $620bn. In other words AMZN is valued 2.8x higher than BABA for generating the exact same profits. Plenty of money to still be made here.

Tl;dr buy some BABA if you want to make money you fking retards."

An SA article recently highlighted the below four points (really 3) as concerns for BABA.

> 1.) The dip in Alibaba’s share price does not present a buying opportunity yet and investors should Hold on Alibaba.   

> 2.) Alibaba’s latest earnings report lowered profit guidance for next year due to reinvestment of a substantial amount of profits back into the core business as a result of heightened competition  

> 3.) Alibaba is required to adjust Ant Financial's business model, curb its monopolistic practices, and invest in technological advancements as a result of regulatory pressure.  

> 4.) Alibaba Cloud has grown slower this quarter due to fallout of a top-class customer, loss of government contracts, and a strong rival, Huawei Cloud.  

 seek ingalpha.com/article/4434615-beware-of-the-risks-in-buying-alibaba

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PRM - residential construction due diligence 

PHM is poised for success with the current housing shortage.  They have the reserve capital and access to cheap capital from their LOC that will allow them to accommodate the inevitable demand for more housing units.  

What differentiates residential construction from riets is that Riets seek to capitalized rising housing prices and charge higher rents to maximize profits.  Residential construction is creating value and in PHMs case, doing it in an affordable way while using durable materials and strategic locations.  

The housing shortage is a part of a bigger problem - too much demand.  A shortage leads to rising prices, and in the current economy, this will work both ways for PHM.  

They will sell homes for higher, their assets will appreciate, and they will benefit from building more homes for at least 3 years (inflation and interest rates will start getting sweaty in 2024).  For a short period of time, debt and capital obligations will rise but then revenue, net income, and balance sheet size will all increase.  This probably won’t increase margins because they already have competitive margins and CAPEX will be higher anyways.  

There are a number of alternatives to PHM, notably MDC which is extremely similar but about 1/4 the size of PHM.  Both will do before inflation becomes visible with rising rates, and there will be significant growth, probably 25% YOY.  

I have about 5k cash in my investments account and $500 in PHM.  I have 3600 in a margin account.  If you guys convince me, I’ll move my cash into my margin account and buy some long term calls."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"You've heard of $GSAT, meet $IRDM **tl;dr:** I was preparing a DD for Globalstar when I came across one of their competitors, Iridium. I will be opening a position with Iridium this upcoming week.

Iridium Communications (NASDAQ:IRDM)

Sector: Communication Services

Industry: Telecom Services

Market cap: [5.5B](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IRDM?p=IRDM)

Iridium provides mobile voice and data communications services to businesses, the United States and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations, and consumers globally via satellite. They also provide prepaid mobile voice satellite communications, push-to-talk, broadband data, and Internet of Things services. The Iridium network operates in the [L-band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_band) and has [66 low Earth orbiting satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/iridium-billing-platform/) and provides coverage to the entire globe, including the poles.

*What is low Earth orbit?*

[ Fun fact: Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station use low Earth orbit](https://preview.redd.it/579e1kqrgo771.png?width=376&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f1452ca0139dd7dfdd00197d7c2338a1bd7c40f)

Satellites at an altitude of less than 1000 km, but could be as low as 160 km above Earth. Travel time around the earth is approximately 90 minutes. The close proximity to earth is commonly used for satellite imaging. Although single satellites are less useful for telecommunication in this orbit, Iridium increases coverage by using multiple satellites (constellation) creating a 'net' around Earth. Globalstar is another satellite service provider with a constellation in this orbit.

*What is Internet of Things (IoT)?*

According to Wikipedia, Internet of Things is a network of physical objects (things) that connect and transmit data to other physical objects via the internet. Sensors, software, and other technologies are embedded within said physical objects to achieve this connection. For example, a lightbulb that can be switched on using a smartphone as the IoT device.

**BULL ARGUMENT**

Iridium has the largest constellation and orbits closer to Earth than any other networks. This allows for shorter network registration times and low communications latency. Globalstar only has [48 satellites](https://sbs-satbill.com/globalstar-billing-platform/) and *does not* cover the poles. Iridium just secured a [$30M R&D contract](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iridium-awarded-30-million-research--development-contract-by-the-united-states-army-301318757.html) with the United States Army to develop a payload to provide more effective sensor-to-soldier data transmission when in the field.

[Rendering of the Iridium payload \(light blue\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfw5vg2s3q771.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=106ebf731779c02302041064dea70760c21ac87c)

Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium, commented on the contract, ""This is one of the largest engineering contracts in Iridium's history... It also represents another phase in the evolution of our growing relationship with the Department of Defense."" U.S. Department of Defense has partnered with Iridium for more than 20 years and is the largest customer. In September 2019, Iridium secured a [7-year, $738.5M](https://spacenews.com/iridium-lands-seven-year-738-5-million-defense-department-contract/) contract with the Department of Defense for unlimited use of the Iridium satellite constellation.

Iridium completed a [$3B multi-year constellation upgrade](https://investor.iridium.com/2019-02-06-Iridium-Declares-Victory-3-Billion-Satellite-Constellation-Upgrade-Complete) in 2019, replacing all satellites and upgrading the supporting ground infrastructure. To complete the upgrade, eight Falcon 9 rockets were used to launch 75 satellites into low Earth orbit ([66 operational, 9 in-orbit spares](https://www.roadpost.com/iridium-satellite-network)). Final payments to SpaceX for those launches were made during the second quarter of 2019.

**FINANCIALS**

[Total commercial services revenue decreased $0.6M \(1&#37;\) as a result of decreases in hosted payload and voice data revenue](https://preview.redd.it/rm6sdp9jeq771.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcd7fb3e3b2c64186b9a05cbecc14dd4744e58bf)

For the three months ended March 31, 2021:

* Hosted payload and other service revenue decreased $1.5M (9%) due to data billing settlement that results in recognition of $1.3M
* Voice and data revenue decreased $0.8M (2%) due to a decrease in usage and access fees from COVID-19
* Subscriber equipment revenue increased $1.7M (8%) due to an increase in the volume of Internet of Things

[ Total commercial revenue increased 3&#37; due to increased hosted payload and other data services revenue and increased commercial broadband revenue. ](https://preview.redd.it/84uqb0t9gq771.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=04e5b0ae51f22923d069b738c55d929749dec6dd)

For the year ended December 31,2020:

* Hosted payload and other data service revenue increased $10.6 (21%), primarily due to increased [Aireon](https://aireon.com/resources/overview-materials/iridium-constellation/) data service fees related to contractural step-up and increased Aireon power fees
* Commercial broadband revenue increased $5.5M (18%) from sales of Iridium Certus broadband services which was commercially introduced January 2019
* Government service revenue increased $3.8M as a result of the higher pricing in the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services Contract
* Engineering and support service revenue increased by $3.8M (12%) as a result of an increase in the volume of contracted work for the U.S. government and volume of work for commercial customers

**BEAR ARGUMENT**

Iridium relies on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of the subscriber equipment, and purchases parts that are periodically subject to shortages. There is a large reliance on a few significant customers, particularly U.S. government agencies meaning a loss of that business will significantly impact revenue. Moreover, Iridium relies on a single primary commercial gateway and primary satellite network operations center.

Last, but not least, Iridium is in debt. Specifically, $1.39B as of March 2021. Iridium also has liabilities of $88.3M falling due within a year and liabilities of $1.81B due beyond that which outweigh the cash and short-term receivables by $1.62B.

[Debt in March 2021 is about the same as it was in March 2020](https://preview.redd.it/ydpi2b0j1q771.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=3eadbeb02390e2f73675bd5b946b15b37c7f8668)

**CONCLUSION**

I'm bullish on Iridium and I only see good things coming from them in the future (short, medium, *and* long term). Although in debt, I think Iridium can handle the current debt levels. They continue to be the front runner for government contracts and are the only provider that covers the entire globe. From December 2019 to December 2020, Iridium saw an increase of 176K subscribers (14%) and I believe this will continue to grow. Voice and data, and Internet of Things revenues have historically generated higher margins than subscriber equipment revenue, and this trend will likely continue. The diverse customer base including end-users in land-mobile, Internet of Things, maritime, aviation, and government will continue to grow overtime.

*Why Iridium over Globalstar?*

To summarize the couple points made above:

* Iridium has 66 operational satellites to Golbalstar's 48
* Iridium has full coverage of the Earth, while Globalstar only has coverage [between the latitudes 70 north and -70 south](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1023/A:1019164909332)

[70 and -70 covers most, but not the poles](https://preview.redd.it/qy88nocvps771.png?width=489&format=png&auto=webp&s=07dbff1d86f846e7f8cd268ce85cc16e8575d2cc)

[Iridium covers 100&#37; of the Earth](https://preview.redd.it/yl8w3lr8qs771.png?width=457&format=png&auto=webp&s=1afc1834f0e8bda5397169d3f2e969283fcc0b62)

In addition to having more satellites and more coverage of the Earth, [Iridium was certified](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/worlds-first-truly-global-real-time-maritime-emergency-service-launched-by-iridium-301193130.html) to use in the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System in December 2020. This ended a monopoly that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system started in 1999.

Iridium is already a top key-player for global maritime satellite communications. The respective market was valued at $2.39B in 2021 and is [expected to reach $3.96B in the next 5 years](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-maritime-satellite-communication-market-2021-is-expected-to-register-a-cagr-of-69-with-top-countries-data-industry-size-share-business-growth-revenue-trends-market-demand-penetration-and-forecast-2021-06-15). That is a CAGR of 6.9%. If you'll notice in the Marketwatch link, Globalstar was not listed as a key-player.

I'm not the only one who likes Iridium - Cathie does too. As of June 25, 2021, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has [8,491,509 shares at a value of $350M](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKK_HOLDINGS.pdf). **But wait, there's more.** ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ) has [3,125,565 shares at a value of $129M](https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_AUTONOMOUS_TECHNOLOGY_&_ROBOTICS_ETF_ARKQ_HOLDINGS.pdf). Moreover, Cathie's last purchase was [1,478 shares](https://blog.mywallst.com/what-did-ark-invest-buy-this-week-06-18/) as of June 18, 2021. If Cathie is in, I'm in.

2021-06-27 11:19:20,wallstreetbets,"I've been in GSAT for longer than most, I keep adding pieces here and there. I've read alot of DD, and witnessed ups and downs, I believe this will boom. Once people buy and hold it will reach it's potential. Hard pass on IRDM for now, but I'll keep an eye out thanks."
2021-06-27 05:09:11,wallstreetbets,Could you add a section why this is a better investment than $GSAT? Thank you for the research
2021-06-27 02:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Used them all the time in the military. When people talk about having a ""sat phone"", they are talking about Iridium."
2021-06-27 05:26:59,wallstreetbets,"GSAT volume: 132 million
IRDM volume: 2 million

I think Im gonna keep playing GSAT for the time being but good luck to ya"
2021-06-27 10:14:41,wallstreetbets,I like seeing their flares.
2021-06-27 09:52:42,wallstreetbets,"Typical pump post. GSAT is a much better play, and the investors know it. Look at the open call interest and also the volume. It’s really not even close. If you’re going to make a post about a particular stock, don’t degrade another one in an attempt to make others buy the one you like. Clearly GSAT is the 3rd best 5G company behind QUALCOMM and NOKIA, which they are both partnered with by the way. Have a good day."
2021-06-27 02:04:08,wallstreetbets,I like this for a long position
2021-06-27 09:54:40,wallstreetbets,"Agreed that would be great 👍 

Gsat has been overall solid IMO"
2021-06-27 08:06:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the suggestion. I have added the section as an edit
2021-06-27 10:21:30,wallstreetbets,We literally use Iridium like the word Kleenex...as the default term for a sat phone.

2021-06-27 06:27:51,wallstreetbets,Same here. GSAT all the way.
2021-06-27 12:00:21,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to pump anything. There is no *we* here. 

I'm personally looking at this as a long-term play. Mainly due to the government contracts and the long standing relationship with the government."
2021-06-27 12:14:12,wallstreetbets,Seems like you know a lot about 5G. How do you feel about Ericsson? I got a couple of leaps that I’m up on. Wonder if I should reallocate? Thanks.
2021-06-27 15:04:10,wallstreetbets,I sold 12 call spreads last week. But once this thing gets over $2 and stays there Im out lol
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is TD broken or do I actually owe $1,000,000? So I got an email that said something something something all the $75P $AMC contact's you sold have been assigned. And my day trade buying power is suddenly showing up as -$1,000,000 with a cash balance of $0. Also I can't view any of my positions/balances BUT the TD website is currently ""under maintenance"" at the moment. My question is, are the rest of you retards unable to see your account balance and positions or do I need to go grab some rope?

https://imgur.com/gallery/wlVPcyH

(Insight: it was a $75/$80 put debtit spread... I think. So the $80 should have been exercised as well.. probably)

EDIT & CONCLUSION: Okay so after watching Mia Khalifa for 2 hours, I took some of your advice and logged out of the App then logged back in and all the positions/balances were back to normal. So turns out that hack does actually work. 

For those of you who are disappointed, I still have 2 naked short straddles on $AMC so there very well could  be loss porn in the future. (Proof) http://imgur.com/gallery/2PQ2TsL"
2021-06-27 02:12:50,wallstreetbets,dude...you an inverse millionaire..

2021-06-27 03:10:02,wallstreetbets,"If your debit spread was set up right then it looks like TD has exercised the long positions and the short positions aren't being reflected against your balance yet. Pretty sure this is similar to what happened with the kid that did $ROPE. 

TD certainly does auto exercise positions ITM. So call or wait till Monday. Your gain* should be the spread difference minus* the debit paid. The math for your balance doesn't make sense if you had only 100 contacts. 

Don't do anything stupid dude."
2021-06-27 02:08:15,wallstreetbets,"hey, i got a weird margin call message after i had sold positions and never used margin. it vanished. don't freak out, wait to talk to someone, and at the end of the day your life is valuable. we care about you, you dumb fuck. stay alive."
2021-06-27 01:52:39,wallstreetbets,Wait for Monday to roll around. Your long leg should be have been exercised by your broker. Might take until Monday for the balance to change to respect that. Shouldn’t be an issue.
2021-06-27 01:41:54,wallstreetbets,"First calm down, you’re fine. Don’t do anything crazy like hurt yourself like that one kid. An actual broker will review the trade and exercise for your or it will do it automatically. 

Word of advice, just buy to close the position and pay the small little amount to prevent this kind of thing in the future.

Edit: if you’re still a little worried, just go ahead and google “does Td ameritrade automatically exercise options.” A lot of results including td’s own website to confirm they do."
2021-06-27 01:43:05,wallstreetbets,Just wait until they’re done with the maintenance or check it from your phone. But if you received an email…
2021-06-27 01:48:58,wallstreetbets,Just commenting so I know how this turns out.
2021-06-27 02:23:08,wallstreetbets,Don’t grab rope you figure something out. Honestly call someone or go to a hospital if that’s a serious question.

2021-06-27 03:03:01,wallstreetbets,"So you sold a SINGLE PUT 75 contract to open? I don't see how it would be worth even 1/50th of 1 million considering current price of AMC.

P.S I'd recommend against selling naked contracts. Cover it with shares to sleep a lot better at night, or just buy to close instead and pay fee to get out.

Edit: I realized it was a bear put spread 75/80. Op is probably fine."
2021-06-27 05:20:17,wallstreetbets,Just ask for a refund. If that doesn’t work simply delete the app. Problem solved

I don’t think this trade should have been a concern, since both legs stayed in the money all week, so both should have been exercised. Probably a brokerage error. Give it till Monday eod to clear, then call support."

2021-06-27 09:05:24,wallstreetbets,Day trading bp is usually how ever much money you traded for that day minus what was cash. If I bought 100 shares of a stock that was one dollar  and sold them the same day then did it again for no gain or loss I would have used $200 since money doesn’t instantly clear. Now you don’t have to pay margin on day trade bp you just use margin on whatever your bp is

Not really man...

Even if you do owe a million, you don't have to pay a cent back. It may fuck your credit for about 10 years, but it's better than the rope."

2021-06-27 02:16:04,wallstreetbets,"Did you sell them in a margin account or cash account?

2021-06-27 07:08:00,wallstreetbets,"If the contracts are purchased individually, yes.

If the spread is bought as a single unit, and some brokerages allow you to add legs and stock together as a single transaction, then the total debit (pluses and minuses) is the only collateral requirements."

2021-06-27 10:03:47,wallstreetbets,You can sell puts on margin half the time fore better % returns. But. Dang lol

2021-06-27 02:37:50,wallstreetbets,"No, it was a debtit spread"
2021-06-27 02:56:48,wallstreetbets,Ok then TD will have it sorted out by Monday sometimes as early as Sunday. Option expiration Friday usually takes the weekend to clear. As long as both the long and short puts expire in the money they will automatically be assigned/exercised. You should actually be profitable in the trade the width of the spread-debit paid.
2021-06-27 10:05:50,wallstreetbets,How much $ was actually at risk?
2021-06-27 02:00:45,wallstreetbets,Leveraged CC's? I doesn't he get cash for the stock after the trade settles? 🤔 ya uh and uh...uh.. uhmm

all the broker has todo is to file charges against you. and they have ground.   


also non extradiction doenst exist. just countrys dont extradite for everything.   
the way they get people regardless is via fake charges. so you go to brazil, safe against your charge, but police suddenly finds a kilo coke.  
youll arrested and extradited just before they drop the charges for the coke"

2021-06-27 05:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if you are making fun of me, but I worded that a little wonky.  I should have said I was attempting to make a few market orders, along with checking things, and the TD plat got a bit glitch and went into mostly full lockdown for scheduled work.


How dare you accuse me of puts!  I stayed up to make my market buys, not even limit, because I want to own more of the stock!"
2021-06-27 06:36:45,wallstreetbets,"These are just new travel goals of mine, so I can't speak from experience, just DD.  That said I've got advice on places like Bolivia, Poland, all of the Amazon, etc.


That said, the more the merrier on our next Ape excasepade!"
2021-06-27 11:34:55,wallstreetbets,"Good you actually want them to sue! You are virtually guaranteed to get a reasonable payment plan from any court ruling. Also if your lawyers are any good then they can claim entrapment via irresponsible trading ie they should never have allowed you to get into that position in the first place. Works particularly well if you are a student/younger Adult with limited income.lots of people are under the impression that companies have Zero responsibility to the clients but they are wrong, that's why nearly all companies try and settle out of court applying maximum pressure so that you settle on a deal before you ever seek legal help. Always remember that no matter how good and friendly you think you're broker/financial institution is they don't give a shit about you, they want as much of you're cash as they can get✌"
2021-06-27 01:53:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm aware, super tragic. I think I had it all set up right so I'm not going to worry too much about it unless it's still showing up as negative on Monday morning."

2021-06-27 07:44:46,wallstreetbets,Ok this is technically accurate but fucks sake….🤦🏼‍♂️
2021-06-27 04:32:13,wallstreetbets,"I think the broker exercised the sells and didn’t exercise the buys.   
  
FYI: Most brokers won’t let you naked sell puts. You’ll need the collateral in the account before the trade goes through."
2021-06-27 04:19:56,wallstreetbets,"You might wanna count in that the owned shares are worth something, so it’s basically 75-54=21 he looses per share."

2021-06-27 07:39:01,wallstreetbets,"It’s selling options that requires a lot of equity , not trading futures or buying options"
2021-06-27 10:09:33,wallstreetbets,Ummm.. well for the spread itself about $18K I believe but I also have naked calls I sold on them so technically I have unlimited risk at all times to the upside.

2021-06-27 08:42:43,wallstreetbets,This isn't true. China wouldn't extradite it has no treaty.
2021-06-27 10:50:13,wallstreetbets,Unless it's the IRS. McAfee was literally being extradited for owing tax money until he got Epsteined.
2021-06-27 06:07:04,wallstreetbets,"It was a joke bud...

And yes, in some places owing money can land you in jail. Ex, if the hospital sues you for unpaid debt and you don't/can't appear /aren't aware of your summons, you go to jail. Being in contempt of court can get a bench warrant out on your ass (because of medical debt).

2021-06-27 04:36:55,wallstreetbets,"So much incorrect in such a short poorly worded comment. Yes non extradition does exist, any country without an extradition treaty such as Ecuador, or Russia. As for fraud, no your broker doesn’t have a case of fraud unless you misrepresented something. Since you didn’t it isn’t fraud. They also can’t press charges, they make
A Complaint which then has to be investigated and then someone has to decide to charge you. Otherwise they can only sue you saying you owe the money."
2021-06-27 11:41:03,wallstreetbets,I assume you're also in Kyiv. I'd be down for a kind hearted 'ape up' at the zoo
2021-06-27 04:03:29,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I'm partial to Kyiv, it's harder to travel internationally from Lviv. TEFL would be for your benefit mostly, it's not required to teach here like it is in Asia. I'm not a teacher though so take that as you will xd.

Software gore over the weekend while the spreads work themselves out within the brokerage's systems.

In the meantime, great loss porn pictures to send to the ex-wife's lawyers so they stop trying to take your money."
2021-06-27 03:11:16,wallstreetbets,It’s just negative cuz you’re missing your shares
2021-06-27 11:12:21,wallstreetbets,It’s free loss porn tho. 😂
2021-06-27 06:22:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah
2021-06-27 04:48:10,wallstreetbets,Why would that happen? Share price was below lower strike price so OP’s broker should have exercised and assigned surely? Do you think there is a possibility of early assignment on the short put? Whatever has actually happened I can’t think of a scenario where OP is actually down $1m based on info provided.
2021-06-27 06:38:28,wallstreetbets,"And they wouldn't let you leverage -$1m unless your account was huge, also."
2021-06-27 06:39:23,wallstreetbets,That's still gonna be a huge hit
2021-06-27 04:19:18,wallstreetbets,OP in final part of their post said it was a “$75/$80 put debit spread” so they bought the right to sell at $80 and became obligated to buy at $75. I missed that earlier.
2021-06-27 08:29:22,wallstreetbets,Software gore.  I'll bet my left nut monday morning the whole spread exercises and it's way less than a million.
2021-06-27 07:41:03,wallstreetbets,"I'm aware, but i meant that tastyworks allows me to sell options with a very small account. I was selling /mes puts with less than 5k in my account when I started."

2021-06-27 13:34:50,wallstreetbets,How tho?
2021-06-27 14:05:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes tax is different , but he was being charged with a crime , ie “tax evasion “ . going bust and not having money to pay your debt in normally not a crime"
2021-06-27 11:04:23,wallstreetbets,Butterfly effect jail. Nice.
2021-06-27 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,"again youre wrong, sorry. extraditions are always on a type of crime basis not in general. there only a handful countries that would not have for most (but not all)( crimes. 

even russia extradites you for certain crimes, just not as many or on request.  
on the other hand even countries with extradition treatys wont if the expected punishment in requesting country would be seen as to serviere in the extraditing country.

for example, US cannot request an extradition from europe for a crime what has the possibility of a death penalty. no european court would agree to that. thats why those requests usually are for lower charges.

&#x200B;

as for the fraud, nope. in such a case where you make a contract you could never fulfill but is to your advantage couve commited fraud. if you cant fulfill the contract because something unforseeable happend then its not fraud jsut sueable. 

yes, most failed contracts are borderline to fraud, even many people dont realize that.  


however regardless how weak or good the case, if youre gone and cant defend yourself in the investigation phase it almsot certainly comes to further legal proceedings which then justify an extradition for your trial. 

&#x200B;

yea press charges/ making a complain maybe language barrier. different legal terms on different continents. but basics still apply"
2021-06-27 05:28:35,wallstreetbets,"I spend 2 weeks in Zhytomyr around 2005, with a weekend in Kyiv. Very friendly ppl and so cheap. Couldn't belief a night in one of the expensive hotels overlooking freedom square was E75"

*All I want is more of those shares you have, I have better thing to hold than paper, plus maybe if I get rid off all this paper, all of it, they will stop calling me paperhands*"
2021-06-27 04:54:14,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. The info doesn’t add up.   
  
The only thing I can assume is that a person who was sold these put contracts assigned them early. And he was the unlucky person who was randomly appointed to sell them to the buyer.  
  
It’s just means he has to exercise his buy put contracts to be back to net zero (or whatever small positive/negative he will be)"
2021-06-27 08:07:27,wallstreetbets,"If you hold to expiry the balances don't always reflect correctly over the weekend. 

The real danger in a spread is holding to expiry and then having the price move through your strike in AH. In that case most brokers **don't** automatically exercise the long leg and you can end up fucked. This is why RH will sell your spread if the strike is anywhere near the price about 2 hours before close. It's not foolproof though. A big AH move can still screw you. 

Tldr: you should **never** let a slread expire unless you really know what you are doing."
2021-06-27 08:36:34,wallstreetbets,If true Perhaps he can sue them for emotional damage

2021-06-27 14:04:11,wallstreetbets,Ok this is getting out of hand. At this rate I’m a trillionaire. And the US is in 100 gigatillion dollars of debt.
2021-06-27 11:15:39,wallstreetbets,"You are so confidently wrong. I find it fascinating. 

You are weighing in on the US legal system and don’t live here? Come on man, just say “I think but don’t know” and you would be fine.

As for fraud: your definition is way off. There has to be intent and there has to be a ( federal US anyway)

a purposeful misrepresentation of an important (""material"") fact;
with knowledge that it is false;
to a victim who justifiably relies on the misrepresentation; and
who suffers actual loss as a result.

So most failed contracts are not fraud. 

As for extradition: in almost all cases there has to be a crime which is covered by the treaty without a treaty there usually has to be a crime in both countries and then that country has to care enough to arrest you and extradite you. Most of the time you would be made to leave the country but for owing money to a brokerage firm I 100% guarantee you wouldn’t be extradited, and likely wouldn’t be charged in the US either. If you sued civilly in the US, you have to be served - good luck with that for a million bucks.

So once again- you are wrong. Demonstrably and stupendously so."

Say, maybe $80 each?"
2021-06-27 13:13:37,wallstreetbets,"lol you even agree to my statement yet say its wrong.

if you make a contract that might have to covered with a million but. you never had the assets to cover that you have intent. thats why, most failed contracts are BORDERLINE to fraud
 i never said they are fraud.
but very close and it would higly depends on certain details of they qualify.


if the contract fails because ur not avle to cover ur now obligated to proof that you acted in good faith and thought you would be able too.

now qould they activly search you in most countries for that, like kicking in doors? no. however you gonna be on interpols list and be arrested at any border or even hotels that require registration.

yes this happens, more than you think not only for tax evasion as recent events have shown.

now if  broker company would file a criminal complaibt or stick with a civil sue is a different topic but they could.

and yes its already fraud if you order something you cant pay for and think oh i believe my amc gonna tripple then i can pay for it. thats not good faith. however if you could pay for it with ur portfolio but there is a gigantic sudden unexpected loss then it is.
one is fraud the other bad luck for everyone involved"

-HA, Soldat!  I fought for Serbia!  Do construction!!

Yup, glad I didn't have to fight you, I was in the same group as you, fighting (okay this sounds bad, even here but it was the truth) Muslims as well.(I was more about giving out shool supplies to kids, than hate, but infantry can only do so much)  I wasn't into it, but you don't get to pick you fights in the US infantry.

Spending the evening watching the sunset with another soldier on top of a building, where comparing scars and maybe asking him if he liked Dragonball Z; we could barely understand each other, but it was priceless!

2021-06-27 10:01:48,wallstreetbets,True maybe it was the maintenance they were doing. I also checked my account during maintenance and it wouldn’t show me any positions I had or buying power

2021-06-27 18:47:14,wallstreetbets,The naked calls are apart of short straddles that expires on 07/16. It's in combination with a $50C 07/16-08/20 calendar spread that I have. When you factor in the premium I already collected on the call calendar in combination with the short straddle I have a breakeven of $35 & $83. Whether everyone wants to admit it or not the nature of volatilty is to chill the fuck out which is what $AMC has been doing for the past 2 weeks. The 75/80 put debit spread was actually apart of a weird iron condor that paid off big for me on $AMC because of the less dramatic moves it's been having lately. I'm at my computer 24/7 during trading hours and know how to delta hedge fairly quickly if AMC gets out of control so I'm really not concerned about the naked calls. Even if it went up to $100 (unhedged) that would only be a $4K loss for me the way I when the trades set up.

That being said...I'm not going to scroll through this entire thread to see if anyone else has pointed this out, but are you aware your shares in that screenshot are flagged as margin?

2021-06-27 09:46:50,wallstreetbets,"The consensus seems to be that if they're in a *margin account*, even if bought with cash, they can and likely will be loaned out.

If so inclined, contact your brokerage to see if that's the case.

Because the whole point is that they need them and you don't want them to have them, at least at this price point."

Yeah those get removed.

If you have any links to posts that you feel were unfairly removed, feel free to post them. I'll take a look and either let you know why they were removed or if it was a mistake, I'll give you the option of approving it or letting you repost it and I'll manually approve it so it stays up.

If there aren't any actual links in response though, that says an *awful lot*."

AMC lol don't ge me even started. Their CEO has become greedy and wants to dilute another 25M shares for 2022 by begging the shareholders to vote yes, after he raised already enough cash from previous ATM offering's. That money is going straight into his pockets or did you hear how he wants to turn AMC around?"

2021-06-27 17:05:55,wallstreetbets,"so far Amc leadership has sold shares like 3x this year. They did once after promising they wouldnt. They sold directly to a fund (Mudrick) who then sold when it rose a few bucks and then they publically called it overpriced. 

GME did 2 capital raises. One to ensure they had capital and now another that one assumes is tied to an expansion. Cohen has assembled a tier 1 team of executives with amazon type backgrounds.


In addition, you ever see the Msm push you to buy a specific ticker before? they were literally tryna ram AMC down ppls throats for weeks. GME is the way.

edit GME is cash rich, AmC could still go broke. Gme transitioning to tech company and expanding market footprint hugely already. Difference in total outstanding share counts and floats. Gme is a relatively small share count (supposedly, ... its quite possible the total outstanding now represents a signicant number of naked shorts/synthetics/failures to deliver, etc. Still AMC total outstanding is 10x or more officially."

""It may seem counterintuitive, but the Russell 1000 “promotion” may actually be bad for GameStop’s stock, as Barron’s explained earlier this month. Funds that track the small-cap Russell 2000 will have to sell GameStop shares on June 28, and funds that track the Russell 1000 will have to buy them. Three times as much money is invested in funds that track the Russell 1000, but GameStop’s overall weight in that index will be much lower than it has been in the Russell 2000. In the Russell 2000, GameStop made up about half a percentage point of the index, while it will be less than 0.1% of the Russell 1000. GameStop will look tiny next to behemoths like Apple (AAPL). """

Let me tell you. People aren't posting *quality* GME DD here and then they get shitty when their poor quality post gets deleted. They're posting it in the superst0nk subreddit instead, because the mods are fucking morons most of the time. That's fine. Nobody is expected to be infallible. We all make mistakes. But they seriously let a LOT of shit slide and it'll be up for *hours* before *maybe* someone posts a valid counter DD... and then they don't even remove it. They just flair it with ""inconclusive"" or ""debunked"". But by that time, some muppets have already taken it as fact and run around half the Internet screaming about it.

In wsb, it gets nuked by the mods because it's just blatantly incorrect most the time.

2021-06-27 14:00:02,wallstreetbets,"First time here? What was the original meme? What was the first meme you recall? Sure Citadel is likely to blanket positions, but citadel also has influence over everything including CNBC(look at their bright logo on the tv). It’s been a consistent pattern of all the tickers with professional looking Dd.       

DFV was one of the first to post technical analysis. I believe he is a financial advisor with licenses to practice. If a consistent amount of posts following the first price correction correlate with more technical analysis, it shows that the bots know what people are more likely to listen to(pattern of behavior). They can then use that pattern of behavior to fool the reader. I believe some conglomerate said they had everything and social media under control on TV in February, implying that social media could never influence the markets again.      

RKT was the ultimate pump and dump that only a market maker could do. Fill puts to drive price. Fill otm calls where gamma means nothing. Fill stock and post on social media in order to cause panic buying and essentially causing a short squeeze through volatility, and profiting from volatility on the puts on the way down if they sold it. Overall play would’ve been easily worth x10-20 in a few days of trading.   

AMC was their pump and dump. They filled calls and stock. They owned a significant percentage of amc stock on the way up. I don’t know what their ownership percentage is right now, but if it’s being pumped on CNBC likely more than 1%.         

The only way they can dump or make money is by creating demand. They create demand when there are no sellers and suddenly you have a trifecta of margin calls, volatility and fomoers. You can’t sell when there is no demand or else you lose a lot of money.      

Honestly, I don’t care about hedge funds or market makers if they ran a legitimate business that was 100% legal. The fact that every clearing corp has passed multiple rules in the past 6 months would show that there is some kind of manipulation going on at the higher level."

....DFV was *not* one of the first to post TA here, what the fuck. How new *are* you?


You make a shit of assertions here but still haven't backed any of them up with anything beyond ""believe me because I'm telling you"".

Where's your *evidence* that any of that was orchestrated? As opposed to being just like any one of the other meme stocks that have come through WSB over the years.

Your claims about volatility is a sign of artificial market behavior by hedge funds isn't exactly sane either. You could use this same logic to claim that the Illuminati is behind everything, and you would have presented just as much evidence for each: nothing verifiable."
2021-06-27 19:08:30,wallstreetbets,"Claims to have been here for 5 years and account shows 1 year.       

They posted their play on social media and on the media after. They created demand, and then I believe they suppressed the demand with their options+ selling of stock and caused it to drop fast.       

Do you know what a bid/ask is? Do you understand how much market makers talk to one another? Check out confessions of a market maker on YouTube. It will blow your mind. Anton Kreil also breaks down the fundamentals of a market maker pretty well. Anton Kreil is at least a proven trader with a track record of working for big banks.           

You’re telling me filling in a 20m position as a market maker and then posting through the media and social media isn’t suspect? Someone even posted their position on here.               

Give it a couple years and wait until they show all the insider trading in the future."
2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What are the best ways of playing present and future water crises? The world is increasingly running out of fresh water. Many different countries around the world are dealing with fresh water shortages and are being forced to spend billions of dollars to solve this problem. For example China has spent $79 B on a water pipeline to pipe water from its northern regions to Beijing. Saudi Arabia and various Saudi Arabian companies have bought farmland in the US as it is cheaper to import water intensive crops than to waste their own water on farming in Saudi Arabia. Israel has spent billions on construction of water desalination plants and as of 2016 met over 55% of their water needs from these desalination plants. And of course there is also the hedge funds buying up water rights and land with large amounts of groundwater to sell back to municipalities in times of crisis.

[Risk of Fresh Water Shortages](https://preview.redd.it/xlkuw3k48q771.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=61158037408f52baed9bb6c9da9414b0caf24315)

So my question is what stocks or ways of playing these shortages do you think is the best? 

(Such as desalination stocks, buying land, etfs... )"

Some of the most contentious issues in the world right now are water related.   Central Valley California (San Fransisco river smelt that won out against those Mcfarland almond orchards that had to be ripped out),  Chinese dams on the Yangtze (denying water to down stream countries) and the Ethiopian dam on the Nile doing the same(Sudan and Egypt raising protests through the UN), the Dead Sea is a quarter of its original size due to the River Jordan is just a trickle because it's siphoned off for farming (a person can literally wade across it).  Access to water is creating incredible tensions all accross the entire Sahal region.  BBC was running a story last week about the issues around Lake Kivu drying out (between Rwanda and DRC) and peoples *already* moving due to water scarcity...

Any farmer (in my old stomping grounds) can tell you pricing is escalating due to scarcity of fresh water access with those quarter-sedtions that have water sources going for a premium - and that's in a non-water scarce region.

The current evidence about fresh water points to both costs and access being outside the reach of vast populations of people - the UN couldn't even dig simple wells in Bangladesh without severe cultural repercussions.

* Moderna is more than a vaccine play. They have projects ranging from HIV/AIDS to cancer treatments, and with the massive influx of vaccine fueled cash coming in, these projects will have an even higher chance of moving forward.
* It has not garnered much social attention (yet), getting in now before the retail social-media crowds do is always advantageous. 
* MRNA tech is still very very new, and the doors it could open in the future are endless. Moderna now being a household name means more trust will be given to them in comparison to other new MRNA tech companies. 
* Their freaking ticker is $MRNA. 

I've already made thousands on this, and will continue to hold for at least two years. This could easily jump to $400 by year end if current trend maintains itself. I really believe this company is the ""Tesla"" of biotech, and will in a few years hit the four digit mark if they manage themselves as they have been."

2021-06-27 00:55:23,wallstreetbets,Market cap is pretty huge already. Some definite upside with possible targeted personalized cancer treatment but that's a few years away. Vaccine is great but really not a lot of money in vaccines and with others getting approved it will only lessen going forward.

2021-06-27 04:06:27,wallstreetbets,"I was more thinking of getting out of it and buying puts on it. I think its at the end of its bull run. Yes the vaccines are used all over the world. But as soon as there's less need for it or no need, for example they are sending less to states in the US now because less and less are getting vaccinated. Not to mention the recent bad news of side effects their vaccines are causing. I think its coming up to time they go down for abit 🌈 🐻"

That said, although we will definitely need boosters given the rapidly mutating +ssRNA virus that is the Rona, this price point is significantly overvalued and likely 5 years ahead earnings. Thats important because even with Governments going out of their way to buy the product, there is likely not company infrastructure in place to maintain this price...yet. How they structure post high demand will determine a lot.

2021-06-27 12:32:05,wallstreetbets,Sundial volume spike went from 1 billion to 3billion daily in the course of one week for those who have been watching long enough and consistently. So that 1.9b shares you are worried about literally got flipped almost 2x in a single day so yeah its definitely possible and with the pivot into cannabis banking and no debts with tons of cash on hand nobody is talking about how sundial could do a share buy back rewarding share holders who held during their fight for nasdaq compliance (which they did secure) as far as movement this entire last quarter sundial has been outpacing the cannabis market including tilray.

2021-06-27 09:44:18,wallstreetbets,"It for sure aint SNDL,  The sole reason people invest in it is because it is ""cheap"" and think ""well if its a dollar now and goes to 10 i can make ten times my money"", even though Tilray is a much better value than other cannabis stocks currently with an 8 bil market cap and the potential to become a 50-100 billion player which would be the same reward. People just dumb man"
2021-06-27 10:02:02,wallstreetbets,The MSOs worth buying will be too expensive for tilray! Why u think CGC and cron are doing what they’re doing? Have you looked at the market caps of the major MSOs vs. Tilray? Have you compared earnings numbers? Have you seen the brand loyalty to select (curaleafs brand acquisition) compared to tilrays? Dude you’re on the losing end of this argument lol
2021-06-27 13:15:54,wallstreetbets,Lol nice fud do you just do whatever investorplace.com says 🙄 everyone of your posts are as deep as a puddle you lack so much understanding of the industry its embarrassing sundial has hundreds of locations that level of quality control will always come down to that location and usually the lack of oversight of just one or a few individuals and is easily corrected who ever received contaminated product always has the right to return and exchange and on the grow end they can fire employees who continue to affect product quality. Was that supposed to make me sell and run away because honestly this conversation makes me want to buy more sundial. 🙃 nice try bud
2021-06-27 13:18:37,wallstreetbets,Not to mention the float is enormous.
2021-06-27 11:49:49,wallstreetbets,Alright when curaleaf loses market share to Tilray then what? CURALEAF DID NOT EXPAND GLOBALLY. YOU DONT LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE.
2021-06-27 13:18:58,wallstreetbets,Go douche. They literally put garbage in their weed. Fuckin loser
2021-06-27 13:20:09,wallstreetbets,Thats what happens when you dilute shareholders for 5 years. I'm in Tilray because of Irwin Simon. Not once did he dilute and I firmly believe he will create shareholder value. Also Tilray is actually cheaper than SNDL  even tho SNDL is only 1 dollar. People just look at the price of ana asset at 1 dollar and assume it can hit 10 lmao
2021-06-27 13:20:51,wallstreetbets,Float is like 2 bil shares meanwhile tilray is 440 and can easily hit a 40 bil market cap  which is almost 100 a share.

2021-06-27 12:02:40,wallstreetbets,They just expanded to Europe. Tilray has had a major subsidiary CC pharma which is in Germany for over 2 years  as well as several other expansions around the world
2021-06-27 14:52:19,wallstreetbets,"If you were educated which you are not, you would know that Tilray is essentially just Aphria with a better name brand and the same management u jackass"
2021-06-27 14:51:42,wallstreetbets,This isn't even the same business... Shows me you have done 0 DD.
2021-06-27 12:05:32,wallstreetbets,I love that you try to make a point and I refute it and then you just completely ignore the fact that I just walked over your stupid points and then u mention something else that I refute lmao dude gtfoh
2021-06-27 12:09:31,wallstreetbets,"Doesnt matter when they did it. Emmac is an established company. If you acquire an established company you aren't starting over again.

Just like how you say TLRY will buy an MSO when able. Quit with your double standard."
2021-06-27 12:04:08,wallstreetbets,Columbia care has had an overseas contract for years now too? Do you even know that company? The point is who cares about Europe right now?? The prize is the USA🇺🇸🚀🇺🇸🚀🇺🇸$MSOS
2021-06-27 12:08:34,wallstreetbets,Well you're refuting points are invalidated by everything I say and then you bring up another point that although may be true still does not validate or give me any explanation as to how MSOs will outcompete Tilray and other global brands like CGC
2021-06-27 12:11:37,wallstreetbets,Ok but that doesn't change the fact that they just expanded their brands to Europe and are still at a disadvantage to companies that have been doing this for years... It really isn't complicated to see how Tilray will be the biggest company. By the time MSOs uplist cannabis will mire likely than not be federally legal and they will be way behind
2021-06-27 12:06:57,wallstreetbets,Europe has a larger population (2x the size) believe it or not. Also M.S O can only lose market share to Canadian LPS who have nothing to lose since they are not in the market yet. People fail to realize that market share will be lost to the major businesses once federally legal
2021-06-27 12:10:22,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at last quarters numbers yet? Apparently not lmao 👋
2021-06-27 12:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Emmac is an established company with its own brands.

MSOs are in the US. It is TLRY who is falling behind until they are able to buy MSOs for a premium."
2021-06-27 12:09:16,wallstreetbets,This is part of your problem your fundamental thesis for your investments is incorrect…  it’s not going to be federally legal it’s going to be decriminalized. the President of the United States is not on board with legalization…. It’s not going to happen bro. They can’t even get banking legislation passed lmao good luck
2021-06-27 12:14:46,wallstreetbets,I looked at every quarter for the past 4 years
2021-06-27 12:15:06,wallstreetbets,Canada wasn't even open lmao
2021-06-27 12:24:59,wallstreetbets,Lmao!
2021-06-27 12:25:41,wallstreetbets,Or they just come in and swing their big dick all over the U.S market and take market share from M.S.Os whilst maintaining all of their Canadian leverage
2021-06-27 12:14:07,wallstreetbets,If you think they will just decriminalize and Biden won't sign whatever Schumer puts on his desk than you're delusional.

But let’s face the truth, their revenues fell 95% since they stopped phones production. Compared to the past, they don’t have anything to offer without which people wouldn’t survive on a daily basis. Saying that they are long-term play and have future is the same as saying that sp500 and gold index are long-term and has future. Except, last two probably has brighter."

2021-06-27 16:58:28,wallstreetbets,Getting shares isn’t considered a yolo. This is actually safe with stocks
2021-06-26 21:08:02,wallstreetbets,I $WISH you weren't still rolling in the hood
2021-06-27 00:38:05,wallstreetbets,"When you're a millionaire, please send me $1 OP"
2021-06-26 22:33:55,wallstreetbets,Wish seems like it’s the next BB or NOK
2021-06-27 00:28:09,wallstreetbets,Dude this is a bot too wtf? Wish gonna rocket monday
2021-06-26 21:10:50,wallstreetbets,"finally, back to the sub’s roots"
2021-06-27 00:15:42,wallstreetbets,What was one of the main reasons you decided to make your move? I wish you (and my July calls) well!
2021-06-27 01:17:12,wallstreetbets,This made me throw up in my mouth a little bit
2021-06-27 09:50:28,wallstreetbets,WISH easily to the moon. It's not just a squeeze play. This is a fundamentally sound company. F the shorts. (Long 80k on WISH)
2021-06-27 14:18:00,wallstreetbets,shares are fine
2021-06-27 07:11:15,wallstreetbets,300K and its only half your port? Put the other half in 27$ calls
2021-06-27 09:39:19,wallstreetbets,Not the way ☹️ .....is what someone told me without financial advice......
2021-06-27 09:50:02,wallstreetbets,God speed
2021-06-27 16:08:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding it down, she's about to go off"

Let’s go!!!!"
2021-06-27 19:23:15,wallstreetbets,"You must really think wish is going to rise soon if you are willing to invest this much.

Got any insider info?"
2021-06-27 19:47:55,wallstreetbets, 🚀
2021-06-26 21:45:47,wallstreetbets,You can legitimately make $50k selling calls a month out from now
2021-06-26 21:38:33,wallstreetbets,At $3.19 avg I think you'll be ok. Good luck.
2021-06-27 04:52:06,wallstreetbets,Did you have that money or is it leverage? What you look for in your DD
2021-06-26 21:16:48,wallstreetbets,Actually that's not even a yolo. 13.19 is a good price point.
2021-06-26 23:25:16,wallstreetbets,Shares aren’t a yolo change my mind
2021-06-27 02:56:32,wallstreetbets,I swear Yolos were supposed to be options not shares.
2021-06-27 02:43:04,wallstreetbets,Everyone knows this is shill tactics to sway from GME. The only play.
2021-06-26 21:26:38,wallstreetbets,Ew
2021-06-27 18:40:09,wallstreetbets,Wish? Is that the online retailer that sells low quality merchandise?
2021-06-27 19:01:46,wallstreetbets,Should have bought gme tbh. Good luck
2021-06-27 19:16:47,wallstreetbets,That's one expensive yolo.... Jesus
2021-06-26 21:10:55,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-06-27 09:01:37,wallstreetbets,"Your a special kind of stupid when your on Robin Hood, WSB and anything other than AMC  ALL AT THE SAME TIME thats called a trifecta of confusion and you will fail X3 🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡🤡"
2021-06-27 00:20:38,wallstreetbets,"Hilarious. Your other posts are shilling your fucking tutoring business and all of a sudden you’ve got 300k for a yolo?

Speaking from experience, tutors do not have 300 thousand dollars.

You’re at 200 likes so far. I think that earned you 50$ right? Does it feel nice to take 50$ from Shitadel?"
2021-06-27 00:35:00,wallstreetbets,Autist ape cuck
2021-06-27 10:13:08,wallstreetbets,PSA FOR THE NOOBIES YOUR FUCKING SHARE PURCHASES AERENT FUCKING YOLOS
2021-06-26 20:59:47,wallstreetbets,Good luck. No way it’s going up this week though.
2021-06-27 02:31:14,wallstreetbets,"Ahh yes, the FDs"
2021-06-27 16:32:26,wallstreetbets,Why is this only 54% of the portfolio
2021-06-27 17:06:14,wallstreetbets,I think the only thing holding it back is that they actually are a good company and not some bankrupt bullshit lol.
2021-06-27 17:45:08,wallstreetbets,They are on a weekly option is there only monthly as I see
2021-06-27 17:49:15,wallstreetbets,Good luck I’m in for a dime

2021-06-26 22:54:13,wallstreetbets,"Wish is a p&d, nothing more"
2021-06-27 18:41:50,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I see this & wonder how much easier it would be just donating that money to me. I can make better use of it 🤡
2021-06-27 00:36:02,wallstreetbets,Well gl. The institutional ownership on this screams pump and dump. I would stay far far away from wish. Plus I saw a bot pushing this. Maybe a day trade
2021-06-26 23:20:35,wallstreetbets,I just dont understand people like this. Like where the fuck were you when this stock was stagnant at around 7\~9? Why not buy then but now at 13? lmao. I guess you must hate money.
2021-06-27 13:02:36,wallstreetbets,Why do people like this stock? Just downloaded the app. They just sell cheap garbage from china. I can’t imagine ever wanting to use this app for anything. What a piece of shit e commerce site. I’ll pass.
2021-06-27 04:20:00,wallstreetbets,just another BS :) is that on RH ? distractions 😄
2021-06-27 12:08:06,wallstreetbets,Has anyone here actually ordered from wish? I would short it
2021-06-27 09:24:39,wallstreetbets,Get Rekt
2021-06-27 09:58:24,wallstreetbets,This is the same clown that a week ago had a million dollar port in robinhood which now looks to have lost about 40%
2021-06-27 17:19:17,wallstreetbets,$300k on RH. Ha
2021-06-27 17:33:07,wallstreetbets,300k? What the hell? Are you an HF? Are you insane? How bout you give me the money. You would get better returns. (Not financial advice)
2021-06-27 17:49:56,wallstreetbets,Wow.  Good luck but should have played AMC
2021-06-27 09:17:55,wallstreetbets,Lol how do you have so much money if you're so irresponsible with it
2021-06-27 09:43:01,wallstreetbets,This sub is getting dumber and dumber by the dat
2021-06-27 12:50:04,wallstreetbets,Got to be total BS. The market cap is only 1.6 million.  How much did you move the price buying this?  People just post a portfolio and we’re supposed to believe you own 20% of the entire supply? There’s been no spike in volume on the charts. There was $7 traded yesterday.  Lol. C’mon..
2021-06-27 16:23:32,wallstreetbets,sorry to tell you but you will lose it all 100%. it is a scam. i been there I lost my money too.

2021-06-27 19:33:54,wallstreetbets,Is there some DD on this or just a hope and a wish?
2021-06-27 19:27:10,wallstreetbets,Really? How are you so sure? I want in! 😅 What’s the motive you think it is a good investment?

2021-06-27 19:29:13,wallstreetbets,Why is everyone investing in $WISH? Any info you can spare for the poor? 😅
2021-06-27 01:32:31,wallstreetbets,Full retard would have been 300K on weeklies.
2021-06-27 19:31:25,wallstreetbets,Before or after capital gains tax?
2021-06-27 10:59:39,wallstreetbets,You have to imagine having a half million on any platform. Hilarious how the poors look down on people on Robinhood who have more money than they will ever have in a lifetime. Acting like your better and being better are 2 different things losers.
2021-06-27 09:49:50,wallstreetbets,What would $27 leaps cost?
2021-06-27 09:51:24,wallstreetbets,Why not ITM $10 leaps(
2021-06-26 21:09:31,wallstreetbets,Autistic would be 300k on weekly options...
2021-06-27 07:50:24,wallstreetbets,how do you define autistic in this context
2021-06-27 00:28:28,wallstreetbets,Is it autistic if its a bot??

2021-06-26 21:23:17,wallstreetbets,Nah this position is in shares. OTM contracts with a short expiry would be classic WSB.
2021-06-26 21:55:18,wallstreetbets,Shares aren't back to the roots you retard.
2021-06-26 23:04:22,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t that bite him in the ass if it moons ?

2021-06-27 06:57:51,wallstreetbets,"Most of us didn't hear about WISH until recently. I got in at $11. If I got in around $9 I would have bought more. I put in around 150k but should have put in more.

3bn revenue selling garbage products? Once they add useful products and more vendors (they've started adding European merchants) revenues will continue to grow. Premium retailers are a dime a dozen because the margins are high enough to survive as a business. If Wish builds a platform that can survive off is garbage products then they'll have tons of data to feed their algo which they can leverage like Google maps."
2021-06-26 23:28:37,wallstreetbets,He’s already up 18k. This guys poised to be make a million $. Not a bad trade IMO
2021-06-27 13:23:37,wallstreetbets,I can’t imagine ever using Wish. They sell cheap China garbage. I wouldn’t touch this shit.
2021-06-27 19:19:24,wallstreetbets,This makes zero sense. It’s always smartest to do it yourself with a website full of total morons cheering you on.
2021-06-27 18:52:39,wallstreetbets,What fun would THAT be?
2021-06-27 19:26:41,wallstreetbets,Exactly right
2021-06-27 10:45:19,wallstreetbets,I wish you people weren't so fuckin retarded bud. Who puts 300k in robinhood? Fake and gay
2021-06-27 19:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Nope, just a wish…."
2021-06-27 19:49:12,wallstreetbets,I read some DD on it a week or 2 ago idk how to find it now
2021-06-27 19:46:04,wallstreetbets,Same tho lol
2021-06-27 10:14:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah and that's what we need here tired of the shares bullshit fuck his shares and fuck his week ass return %
2021-06-27 11:04:04,wallstreetbets,My comment was referring to robinhood locking people’s accounts and their joke of a customer support. People who have their money on real brokerages are definitely 100% better than those that have it on robinhood
2021-06-27 10:00:32,wallstreetbets,$27 is less likely to happen but way higher % gains if this moves up 🚀
2021-06-26 21:57:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, really wish 13 avg will be absolutely fine. Zero worries. Just don't panic sell if it doves one day. It's not a joke meme."

2021-06-26 23:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Morgan Stanley bought in early at the average price is $18. 
And...the majority of analysts have targets above that."
2021-06-26 23:36:30,wallstreetbets,Have you actually gone on the app? Bought something off of it? I have. Its just a glorified Aliexpress for white people who don't know Aliexpress exists. Actually I'd even argue the stuff they sell are even of worse quality than the crap from Aliexpress.
2021-06-27 19:42:17,wallstreetbets,It’s the thrill of the kill that really matters.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME building up for another squeeze? 🚀 I know i've been off of reddit for awhile but don't be worried... I am back.

Yea I know you don't care who I am so let me just cut to the chase, I think we're going to see another massive GME run again very soon. Now I don't have any crazy DDs or upcoming secret catalysts to share but the way I trade stocks in general is mostly through Technical Analysis.

*To keep this simple, if you're not familiar with Supply and Demand zones just think of them as ""support"" (Demand) and ""Resistance"" (Supply) for now...*

On the chart pictured below, it seems like GME tested weekly demand, went up a bit, then retested it again and as you see, buyers came in and bought it up once it touched demand again! I like how it respected the trend-line as well... I personally use demand zones to add on shares/contracts to my positions (which is what I did here)

[GME 1D SUPPLY AND 1W DEMAND](https://preview.redd.it/s70d479sfp771.png?width=1608&format=png&auto=webp&s=40508e58a9f96133e0b0d9a52ec93f68bdd261b4)

**If that didn't satisfy you enough...have no fear because I have more TA to show...**

Chart below is showing an apparent falling wedge on the daily and 4hr, not only did GME respect the wedge pattern, we also held the 38.2 fib support from the retracement back in march!:

[GME Wedge and Fib-set](https://preview.redd.it/nq6uua1xdp771.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e109053530c5ce7a83df9d9b0e2ef83b687cc9)

And my last example is more of just a slight theory but tell me if yall can also see this massive cup and handle showing on the daily/weekly or am I tripping?

[GME C&H?](https://preview.redd.it/51w2urn4fp771.png?width=1609&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95da5e2848b87bf5dfe0528d97fdc55b3997f1f)

&#x200B;

**TDLR: I think this is the GME bottom for awhile unless something crazy happens, if your gonna buy into GME, I recommend buying around here by demand and not being caught chasing when it squeezes again:/ 🚀**

*My positions: 8/20 250c + shares since last year*

&#x200B;

Good luck, Happy trading!"

-Amazon is flailing on consoles, delivery, and electronics and is basically a Chinese bazaar with fake reviews eroding trust in their base. (Chewy took their market for pet food and now GameStop will take their market for games, PCs accessories and electronics)
-SI is still over 40% conservatively.
-GameStop is somehow still cool after the millions of free mentions and articles that continue day after day - everyone hates hedge funds and the criminals who halted trading in Jan.
-cloud gaming is doa and physical games aren’t going anywhere
-there is no cross platform game store as of yet. Yet.

I've been following Elliott Wave graphs and it looks like the stock is all set up for a huge move up.  It appears ready to easily go to the $500 range and possibly up to around $860 for this upcoming wave.  It could then drop back into the $300 range where it would find consolidation again before pushing up again past $1000 into the $1,200 area or higher.  Looks damn good!  I've been buying and holding since January. I haven't sold and I don't have any plans on selling until MOASS.  That's just my game.

2021-06-27 00:41:37,wallstreetbets,Bought more on Friday just to sure I was able to.  Then I did it again to double check.
2021-06-27 14:12:49,wallstreetbets,It's been building the last 6 months. The fact that we have been getting these crazy volatile run ups every months or so is evidence that there is something going on here. Market makers are putting new laws into effect to protect themselves as best they can to minimize damage that is about to go down
2021-06-27 14:26:02,wallstreetbets,THIS WEEK PAYCHECK ALL IN GME
2021-06-27 15:06:07,wallstreetbets,Fine I’ll buy more! You had me at GME

2021-06-27 04:17:58,wallstreetbets,These charts mean nothing. This is terrible advice. This sub has turned into a shitty second rate cult. Lemme know when you dumb apes finally drink the kool-aid and check out. The rest of us want our fucking sub back.
2021-06-26 20:54:12,wallstreetbets,This and AMC both have a nasty setup on the chart. Ticking time bombs 💣
2021-06-27 03:44:44,wallstreetbets,Just BUY and HOLD. Don't be a fucking pussy. Price doesn't get better than this.
2021-06-27 04:25:22,wallstreetbets,"I'd say yes... the short data indicates significant short shares on loan of approximately 10 million. The last trading day saw a net short interest gain of 2.46% which roughly correlates to 248.5k short positions opened Friday. That's good since we need more shorts for the short and gamma squeeze. 

We can win this by continuing to buy and hold. GME is relatively inexpensive from it's pre-market ATH ~500. 

Plus we can remain retarded for much longer than the HFs can remain solvent, lol.

And we aren't even talking a illegal short positions yet, since there are obviously no official count of those and we can only estimate those positions.

Buy, buy, buy. They can't keep doing this forever."

2021-06-27 02:50:05,wallstreetbets,Le tittays are jäcked
2021-06-27 03:14:27,wallstreetbets,C&H… yes.  However I see an inverse head and shoulder in the making if we blow past 350 before ~July 23.
2021-06-27 03:14:58,wallstreetbets,Last fridays’ buy limit orders at 200 confirms it.

2021-06-27 06:01:16,wallstreetbets,"Goddamnit you better be right, because I've been loading up my Fidelity account to buy something and I went to a bar for the first time tonight in forever and I claimed GME made me rich so that's why I was buying everybody drinks. Kinda gotta replenish those funds."
2021-06-27 06:29:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m hoping to add long calls to my portfolio this week. Waiting on a transfer. No worries though, I believe it will run sideways on low volume for a while. At least until after all the new clearing house, market rules and regulations are firmly in place.  But this ticker is a fucking rocket waiting for lift off 🚀"
2021-06-27 06:37:26,wallstreetbets,Yes

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕"
2021-06-27 08:54:46,wallstreetbets,Love the TA and hope the trend of GME allowed on WSB continues. Averaging up more tomorrow.
2021-06-27 08:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Been talking about the cup and handle as well a lot recently. On trading view many people have spotted that as well, it being one of the most noticeable and common patters around. 

As far as the demand and supply zones, I'm curious, how do they work?

Overall, I think we are nearing the end of the handle, but could also have another week of sideways trading. and then, the price target in the first rip would likely be around 750-800, with the long term trajectory to around 3500 in an Elliot impulse 53535  wave"
2021-06-27 08:57:50,wallstreetbets,Good analysis ape.  I will sleep better tonight.
2021-06-27 09:12:00,wallstreetbets,Hmm might he time to start tickling GMEs balls again.

2021-06-27 07:32:28,wallstreetbets,"shut the fuck up holy fuck, the only reason this abosolute dogshit technical anaylsis is upvotes is because it is pro gme and it is sad to see. This is what happens when you take a subreddit from 1.5million to 10 million i guess"
2021-06-27 00:25:47,wallstreetbets,I mean.. it only dropped because of the earnings call. It can only go up again.
2021-06-27 05:11:20,wallstreetbets,I thought GME was banned on WSB. This is great to see. The TA does look like something is brewing.
2021-06-27 07:02:03,wallstreetbets,"GME: ""That's my secret, Cap.  I'm always building up for another squeeze."""
2021-06-27 11:58:18,wallstreetbets,"Actually the wedge you drew has a bearish bias because it is coming from downside. It is a descending wedge not a falling wedge. That is no longer a cup and handle we would have had to form a bull flag or wedge or triangle at the very top. 

Your demand/supply zones are also drawn arbitrarily in a way that fits your bias. 

Also, your trendline is connected to the most recent candle, which makes it invalid in TA - it’s pure recency bias.

This analysis is actually bearish."

Leaving aside the typical fundamental vs. technical vs. hybrid styles discussions, this is simply an oddball stock. Because of the short interest, the games, the general attention this thing gets... there's nothing normal about it.

The bizarre winds will blow here as they will. Personally, I probably won't add more. But I'm not selling anything until/unless it does some insanely, out of this world, beyond the moon and out past the edge of the solar system move. I don't own this for $$$, I own it as a political and social statement.

Whatever... whatever it takes, whatever the catalyst... I hope that something triggers another - even bigger - giant move and does damage where we all want it to. This game hasn't stopped yet, so we'll ideally see something happen soon enough. The big question I wonder about is, ""How DOES this actually end?"""

On paper they still look solid but you can see other online markets becoming more popular. I think in five to ten years amazon will be a shell of what it was 5 years ago. Bezos knows this. He said this in an interview that he believes all businesses at one point are doomed just no one knows when but now with Amazon, the writing is on the wall and he saw it and left. It just takes time for other people to realize. Gamestop is in the unique position that it just became hugely popular and people looking for alternatives to Amazon."

2021-06-27 00:58:34,wallstreetbets,Where are you seeing short interest at 40? Everything I can find has it hovering at 20% or 11.9 mil shares short with a 57.8 mil float. The thing is the daily volume is higher than the short interest at 12.6 mil so it’s only at 1 day to cover.

2021-06-27 07:50:25,wallstreetbets,"Check your broker's policy on fractional shares, when it comes to fractionals you don't actually 'own' the share in question, not that it's a problem, but if you're close to owning a whole share it's good to grab that little extra bit. Makes transferring brokers easier and if there is a problem later down the line (such as you forget you actually own them, which more than a few retards on here do) it can be easier to reunite you with your shares later in life. GME could genuinely be a ultra long term play, personally, I would like to have a piece of that pie when I'm 80, rocking back and fourth in my chair uncontrollably, dribbling away in the corner of a euthanasia clinic, but you know, each investor has their own unique strategy."

After that, there's an argument about AA(AMC CEO) diluting x5 the outstanding shares and still being in debt and wanting further dilution while getting paid fat bonuses.
 https://www.businessinsider.com/amc-ceo-adam-aron-pay-bonus-compensation-pandemic-cinema-movie-2021-3?op=1

And on the other hand you have Ryan Cohen refusing pay and paying new hires from Amazon/Chewy/etc in stock while having 0 debt.

Now tell me, which one wants to see this explode and which one will use any opportunity to dilute further even if it means saving shorts?

Edit: if =/= of"

2021-06-27 02:37:36,wallstreetbets,"“another” yes, because when shares went up over 10,000 percent in Jan that totally wasn’t a squeeze"
2021-06-27 09:28:12,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you got actual proof for that? Like, anything that's not bullshit conjecture? 


You know where that BS line started? I do, because I was there. That literally started from, ""The price is dropping and there aren't many shorts left to borrow today on Fintel - *it must be naked shorting!*"" Never mind that...you know, *people sell*, and Fintel is not the only source for short shares. But the cult went, ""Yeah, that makes sense!"" and wrote a whole DD on how naked shorting happened once elsewhere, so it MUST be why the price drops now, here! 



And then it was the also excuse when there were TONS of shares to borrow for pennies, and yet the price still dropped. The price dropped? Gasp, they must be shorting, right? But with what?! It must be ....NAKED SHORTS!! WHY ELSE WOULD THE PRICE DROP??


None of that is proof, and I'll tell you why the price dropped: people sold. You can go right to a Bloomberg terminal and see that individual and institutional holdings both went down after January. Occam's razor - does the price drop the same way *every other share on the market does*, or - here's the cult line - is there a huge, vast conspiracy involving literally everyone on the markets and in government to keep one stock down?  Which sounds more plausible? 


Actual evidence doesn't lie. But your cult sure does. This post is a blatant attempt to pump the stock for another dump. And if this moron has had shares since last year and DIDN'T sell during the real squeeze in Jan, or the two Gamma squeezes since then, that's his own dumb fault. He's obviously an idiot, and you shouldn't listen to any ""technical analysis"" he offers. I can do that too with any chart before it crashes - draw lines and be like, ""See, it's gonna go up, because lines say so!"" Except, what if it drops, and now the line trends downward? It's like tea leaves, these charts are BS."
2021-06-27 03:53:05,wallstreetbets,short it then

AMC is not a short squeeze play or fundamental play.

GME is both a short squeeze and fundamental play. 

Your only hope for AMC is another gamma squeeze and that’s it.

The two are no where near the same."
2021-06-27 09:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Your right, a squeeze is by definition when shorts been squeezed out by margin calls, that yet happened, the trend to 400+ from 40 was artificially made by hf to put a high price to make people sell, their issue started when nobody sold, and now their stuck, but they most likley gonna swing it a month to two before the big breakout.
Im not here for a squeeze, just a fair value for a good company, im positive were not so far from see it over 1000$ and beyond."

They will become part of the ""infinity pool"". The more I continue to buy, the higher the peaks. There will be many to come. I'm buying more every day because I'd like to do big things for a lot of people."

2021-06-27 02:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I do feel like the short squeeze had just begun before the rug got pulled out at $450 on that dreaded Thursday. The restrictions got piled on so fast by RH and so many other brokerages all at once. I think only Fidelity and schwab were pretty safe. Td ameritrade only placed restrictions on options trade. 

Anyways, 450 just scratched the surface.  Gamma squeeze brought it up to like 150 and overselling on wsb, institutions, other hedge funds was responsible for much of the rest. Plug got pulled as soon as the short squeeze began. I think an actual short squeeze if allowed to play through a bit could have easily popped past a couple grand.

That is also why I'm playing it very closely this time around. Not going to be greedy or allow my emotions to decide anything. I don't trust these brokerages or sec or wsb or anyone this time around. Pulling out as soon as I feel it's timr."
2021-06-27 10:03:55,wallstreetbets,"It was blatantly a short squeeze. People are delusional if they think a gamma squeeze out of nowhere caused the stock to go up 1000% two different times. For it to he a short squeeze it would mean the hedgefunds would have had to cover a lot of their short positions, which blows apart their narrative that they never covered."

2021-06-27 09:28:04,wallstreetbets,It’s shorted worse than ever.
2021-06-27 11:06:07,wallstreetbets,"False. Retail only increased positions drastically. Short interest is self reported and so totally useless, misleading at best. There is overwhelming evidence that short interest increased from the 140% in January. It is impossible for that 140% short interest to have been covered.

GME is the real short squeeze play right now. Or in the words of the DTCC a ""single security exhibiting idiosyncratic risk"".

Forget all these other stocks who are being pumped as a squeeze, it's all bullshit."
2021-06-27 10:13:09,wallstreetbets,Short interest reporting data isn't accurate.

2021-06-27 12:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Literally no one is in this stock with a ""pump it so I can break even"" mentality. I have never seen a group of investors be so secure and confident with their investment as GME holders are. Even at 200 USD there are not that many bagholders. Most shares bought can be sold for a profit at this point, and a lot of people bought more and averaged down since January.

Read what GME holders are actually talking about and you would know your point is nonsense. It's undeniable that GME holders feel the stock has massive upside potential, on a squeeze but also definitely on fundamentals."

In fairness, I think at this point I would’ve been better off holding AMC without selling the covered calls against it. However, if AMC stays in the general range it’s trading at and if IV stays high (which I expect IV will), this strategy will literally be a money printer.

Most of my portfolio is covered calls actually. Make fun of me all you want, but many of my positions are essentially “free” just because the premium I’ve received the past few months have paid for them."

2021-06-27 13:00:15,wallstreetbets,"The daily chart (YTD 1d specifically) is what we’re talking about. The daily peaks we’ve seen since the original actual squeeze in January have been lower. But specifically, I meant lower lows and lower highs over the last 12 days. Everyone just wants their confirmation bias, so go find it in the other comments saying nothing but a bull thesis. But there’s another side to the TA that looks like we have more downside ahead of us (followed by another peak at some point… I just don’t think it’s imminent). I’d bet sometime next month or two we’ll see another 250+ peak again.

Keep finding different timeframes and indicators that tell you it’s going to $69,420 tomorrow though lol."

I’m a simple person, I just want enough for me and my family to never be worried again, then use the rest for others. I don’t believe in the whole hoarding wealth concept. After a certain point it’s just too much."

I’m not in this for a short squeeze although if it happens, I’ll gladly take it. I would like to comment though I still believe there are FTD’s being pushed out just not so technical again to try and understand what that short interest is and how many FTDs are out there. V"

2021-06-27 02:55:15,wallstreetbets,"What does that have to do with anything? Puts don’t require you to purchase the shares to cover the contract, the most you can lose from an OTM put is the premium you paid for the option.

 The whole point of a squeeze is once the price starts rising you’re forced to buy the shares to cover your short at the higher price to keep your losses from rising even more which triggers the price to rise even higher and so on. 

Puts have literally nothing to do with it."
2021-06-27 01:54:05,wallstreetbets,OTM puts barely have any delta left.
2021-06-27 02:52:06,wallstreetbets,"OTM puts in no way requires you to buy the shares to cover them though.. The whole idea of the squeeze is that they’re shorts that which require them buy the shares they had borrowed at a higher price to keep their losses from mounting should the share price rise further.
 Put options don’t have anything to do with a squeeze?"

Few weeks ago GME was trading at almost $350. Few weeks later, at $200, means those new short positions taken are absolutely printing right now. 

Granted the short interest has been declining substantially so it's not the most popular move, but those with the balls to do it are being rewarded handsomely."
2021-06-27 02:44:10,wallstreetbets,"You said it never squeezed. The share price alone went up over 10,000 percent. If that happened right now it would be at 20,000 a share. If you missed the squeeze in January, you missed out on the best opportunity GME had to offer. Sorry dude. Maybe if you’re lucky it will hit 1000 per share some day but I seriously doubt it"

2021-06-27 01:30:25,wallstreetbets,"The idea is that they opened long positions on all non-GME stocks in those ETFs in conjunction with shorting the ETF to suppress GME specifically. So if they sell off those long positions along with closing the shorts on the overall ETF it should mostly be a wash for those other non-GME stickers, at least in theory from my understanding. 

This was not financial advice."
2021-06-27 01:26:23,wallstreetbets,Big brain comment here.
2021-06-27 02:02:33,wallstreetbets,They may still use it to short the other “meme stocks” like AMC that didn’t make it to the Russel 1000.
2021-06-27 03:52:46,wallstreetbets,You will never see a rise in short intrest again since short intrest is self-reported. And smart money want to fool dumb money. They will hide their shorts with option play.
2021-06-27 14:53:02,wallstreetbets,"My understanding is the MMs are able to disassemble the ETFs into their component stocks and then go long on all of the stocks other than GME so they are net neutral on all of the other components. I have no idea if that is really possible or just a BS theory, but it sounds plausible.

If that is true it means they have already covered the balance of the ETF, and I would assume the GME shares get added to the FTDs."
2021-06-27 11:59:39,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t this all part of Friday’s “rebalancing”? The funds that track the Russel 2000 would have sold off their GME while those that track the Russel 1000 would have bought GME?
2021-06-27 15:58:51,wallstreetbets,"Agree. Money = opportunity.

2021-06-27 08:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Nice!  And don't just click the Buy and Sell buttons on your watchlist, click onto the stock's page and click trade. There you can buy and also make an order to buy at a specific price.        

Then if you want to sell, you need to go to your portfolio in the settings, click the stock you want to sell, then you'll have a list of all your positions.        

You can click on a position to see the info and options to sell for it, or on the app a shorthand to sell immediately is just swipe left and click Close (selling a position is always called closing it, simply clicking sell on the watchlist is shorting a stock).          
If you swipe right you will see options to set a stop loss or Take Profit which are orders to sell that position if the price goes down or up from your opening price respectively.          

A stop loss guarantees a loss of money and is simply a way to make sure a position is closed before the price drops too low, although unless the company is failing or very unlikely to go up to those levels again you can just wait a few months to a year for the price to rebound.        
These are the so-called paper handed people, but it's a very real tactic for daytraders because they can use the rest of that money in a separate trade to potentially gain more and not be locked into waiting a long time for that money to be freed up i.e they'd rather lose $100 on a $500 trade just to be able to use the $400 left in a separate trade."

2021-06-27 12:10:56,wallstreetbets,The prevailing theory is that one of the Market Makers abused their power to create millions of synthetic shares and used those “shares” to bombard GME as shorts while covering their tracks using a variety of methods. Many of the DTCC rules that have come out in the last month will prevent these practices in the future. On some level you’re right that there is no blatant red flag as all of this is illegal. There are crumbs to follow down the rabbit hole.  Idk about all that- I just like the stock.

In that case, why should there ever be a short squeeze? Clearly there's nothing wrong with institution being negative 80 billion dollar net worth and still be able to print more money. Literally what's money at this point. Smooth brain much?

It costs you $43,000 to start selling ROKU covered calls.  The 7/16 $435 sells for $18.45 as of Friday.  That's 4% of the cost of the shares.  

For the same amount you can buy almost 800 shares of AMC and sell calls against them.  At-the-money 7/16 calls on AMC sell for $940 apiece.  Sell 8 of those and you collect premium of $7,520 which is 17.5% of the cost of the shares.

That rate of return is profitability.  You fucking idiot.

2021-06-27 17:20:05,wallstreetbets,"i can't give you the most articulate answer but it relates to how market makers hedge their positions when they sell options.

in January, the gamma squeeze happened because everyone was piling into both OTM and ITM calls. to hedge their own position, a market maker will buy a certain amount of shares for every call they sell to make sure they have the shares of the security if the call goes in the money and they get assigned. the closer the call gets to in the money, the higher the Delta goes, and the more shares they buy. 

So in January the insane call volume caused MM to buy a shit ton of shares and the price started rocketing.

Buying a shit ton of puts has an inverse effect on the price.

I mean it was also hovering around 60% in the months after January before eventually falling to where it is now. The most likely scenario is they covered most of them causing the spike in January then bought more shorts when the stock was over 300.
2021-06-27 12:33:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean that isn't all a FTD is 

>Failure to deliver (FTD) refers to a situation where one party in a trading contract (whether it's shares, futures, options, or forward contracts) does not deliver on their obligation. Such failures occur when a buyer (the party with a long position) does not have enough money to take delivery and pay for the transaction at settlement.

A failure can also occur when the seller (the party with a short position) does not own all or any of the underlying assets required at settlement, and so cannot make the delivery.

FTD are only related to naked short sells which the majority of these are not. The funds that lent the shares for the shorts have no reason to let ""ftds be hidden with puts"" they would simply have forced delivery of the shares which they could do at any time."

2021-06-27 11:38:21,wallstreetbets,"I mean you're technically correct, I mean the douche from melvin said in the interview that the rise in share price wasn't the shares being covered. If it was the squeeze I doubt even the robinhood stopping the shares from being bought (along with other shitty brokerages this sub uses) would stop the the squeeze from happening. To be honest who the hell knows everything everyone says is just speculation at this point. Will it happen again? Why the fuck is the price still this high? I moved on for now."
2021-06-27 10:00:09,wallstreetbets,"Why should we start from Jan 1st? It's so arbitrary. Shorts came in starting from last year cause of covid.

Do we just ignore all that to accept your statement?

Also, premarket prices do matter when covering. Institutions don't ignore trading hours when going bankrupt. No one had any clue this wouldn't go thousands. And $500 was basically peak in premarket.

If you start from $17.25, $500 is almost 29x. Margin call for GME end of Jan was 3~5x. I'll be nice to use 3x as example.

This meant if you short 20% of your net worth, you got margin called if your margin went above 33.333% of your net worth. Meaning if the price went up more than 1.67x, you got margin called.

If you only shorted 10% of your net worth, 3.33x.

If you only shorted 2% of your net worth, 16.7x.


But short interest was high and these institutions were greedy! you say.

Wow. So if we are being super generous by starting from arbitrary Jan 1st (why not last year?) with 3x for margin call (institutional brokerages were most likely closer to 5x as big money had huge influence on price), these institutions should at most shorted 1% of their net worth to not be margin called. Wow. Almost retarded.

Also, you do realize Melvin Capital reported REALIZED losses at the hearing, right? You don't realize a loss without doing both buy/sell. Holy crap. I love to mock Melvin Capital but even I understand what realized gains are."
2021-06-27 18:24:58,wallstreetbets,"If they have high IV, selling calls (or puts too) will give you the highest premium. They’re literally the best stocks to sell calls on. As long as the stocks stay in a somewhat consistent range (as AMC and GME have the past few weeks) you literally just take in loads of premium as pure profit.

Also if you think selling a put is much different from buying the shares and selling a call, I’d invite you to look up put-call parity lol. Conceptually they are very similar."

Now you can no longer see this Days to cover data, they removed it in February. But this is a proof that shorts never covered and, instead, increased their short position."

2021-06-27 11:53:45,wallstreetbets,"What are you all smoking.

I am so confused. Why should markets have to crash and have bailouts?

Meme stocks are NOT the market. Oh my lord.

Go study how the basic stock markets work before anything. I am worried about your financial future long term.

Only a really tiny portion of hedge funds in the industry do long/short strategies. The accepted norm is just don't touch stocks that feel too much in bubbles. That's what most sane investors do.

e.g.: I think SPCE, etc. are huge bubbles. What do I do? I just ignore. Why should SPCE mooning or crashing cause market crash? C'mon. Sure, there might be some that short but who cares. That's not the entire market. Shorting has been a thing for hundreds of years. 'Infinite short squeezes' has happened quite a few times including KBIO (< $2 stock to \~$40).

Also, shorting isn't moon or zero. You can short and cover from $254 to $253.99. Most shorts are day trades. Institutions that do high frequency trading can trade up to 64 million times back and forth short/cover in a given minute (doubt any institution does this). You make money going from $254 to $253.99. It's not $254 to $0 or infinity. That's not how stock market works. So if price fell from 300s to 200s. That means shorts that covered already made money and won. That's just it. It's all about risk management. Why should those in profit not cover? No one in the industry expects GME to go to $0 anytime in the near future. That's cult brainwashing talk. You can however, take advantage of the volatility and make money from that."

&#x200B;

Investors who got in early on these tickers are likely living lavish. One question always lingers in the back of my mind. How did they know? Did they perform rigorous due diligence on these companies? Were they simply lucky?

&#x200B;

I wanted to pose a question for the lovely people of WSB. What companies do you have extreme high conviction on for the next 10-20 years? Why do you feel so strongly about said company?

&#x200B;

Alternatively, if you can't think of a company, what about an industry specifically?

&#x200B;

I find that investment themes including: cloud computing, robotics, renewable energy, 3d printing, and genomic sequencing are likely to be hot in the future. The question is, which companies are in a position to win market share in these sectors?"

I knew if I was playing the long game, I needed to think about this in a 2 step manner. Although I am technically ""gambling"" on the fate of these companies, I think the next 5-10 years will be splendid. Personally I like these companies, and their growth prospects in the near/long term future.

PLTR - Palantir. They have only just begun. People compare this company to Microsoft, or the ""next Microsoft"". Fuck that. They're playing a different game. I think they might get more notoriety if their software suite, was used by intelligence agencies against nation-states like Russia or China. In the electronic warfare front, I think they will be a key player for cybersecurity companies to utilize in offense, and defense. Lots of potential in every industry where information gathering puts you ahead of a competitor or a nation state.

BNGO/NNOX/CRSP - Bionano Genomics/Nanox/Crisper. I don't think this is a joke. I think their tech, with good merit, is a direct disruptor to existing devices and machinery out there. Until their business is cash flow positive, with actual customer purchases, info on whether or not hospitals would jump at the chance to grab these machines, as well as smaller firms. I'm lumping BNGO in with this because of devices, and genomics in general. I also started a small position in CRSP, genomics is relatively new. We don't know what the next decade holds for genome editing, curing diseases, identifying malformed genes and pathways. This is a bright future for humanity when this becomes normalized. Maybe I'll even throw Gingko Bioworks into my genomics port, idk.

U - Unity. Not a call for some kumbaya moment, but a way to bring players and audiences from any location, into immersive worlds, where we can get lost in the reality of our own choosing. I think video games are underrated. Mostly because software of our predecessors has been shit, and in some rare cases, actual gems of ingenuity have formed over the decades. VR might have been a flop, but its not dead. Immersive experiences are really important for a person (imo). Intimacy and belief in a different relativity is RARELY seen in video games or movies in a viewing experience. I hope to see movie theaters and home media centers really trying to draw audiences in with newer experience in the future. How long that might take, I don't know, I'm not an oracle, but whether its in self-driving automobiles, giving you a person car ride / media experience or you have goggles on at home bumping into shit, U will be right there.

ATOM - Atomera. If I were to pick some companies that were easy 10x-50x baggers over the next decade or two, then I would be mostly fucking wrong. But I believe in ATOM. From the particles of our very existence, to semiconductors which run our technologies, and gears innovation, companies like this are actual disruptors.

HOL - Astra. Fedex of space deliveries, or the USPS? Not sure yet. But with an all-star team, (keeps growing), successful launches, and forseeable goals, this is a winner for me. The CEO alone, is a rockstar. Although that could throw people off (think Elon rockstar and what he tweets/says), Chris Kemp is like if Spoc and Kirk had a baby, and Edward Snowden took care of the education. I think he's geniune article, and his experience alone makes me root for the jockey and horse. Ultimately, this is a very young company, in an even younger industry.

STEM/ITAC/ETWO - STEM/Arbe Robotics/E2Open AI/robotics and supply chain AI software, with big customers to boot. reddit buggy ass got rid of my whole section here, too lazy to rewrite.

WOOF - Petco. I have dogs, and I love animals. omnichannel brick and mortor with various subscriptions, and services ready to go? All for the well being of your animal and others? Vet and grooming services? Clothing? Medicine? Toys? All with a good customer experience? Count me in. (i have a 17 page dd on notion about woof, if anyone is interested, pm me i guess). Resides on a more safer delta.

MP - MP Materials. I like metals? Easy non-china winner for materials. It irked me that this was also a Chamath de-SPAC, but whatever. Judge by the team and merits right? Resides on a more safer delta.

SKIN - Beauty Health Company. A staple, well managed company, that's no going anywhere. Long term this is a great hold. Something I considered was Hims, and possibly mental health stocks like Mindmed. I don't know how those companies really work. But I am sure about SKIN.

I don't have fintech, yet. Still looking.

Over and over I told him to buy up as much as he could. He didn't listen. I didn't have my own money at the time, or I would've dumped it all into those 2 tickers.

Often, I think about why I was so adamant that they would be successful. I knew nothing about financials at that time, so why did I have such faith? Here are a couple reasons:

1. Novelty. Both Netflix and Chipotle, and really any of the thicc boy returns, are all novel products first to market with large amounts of awareness as publicity.
2. Appeal to the future. These companies care about the next generation of consumer and the next wave of society, not necessarily the now. 
3. Focus on solving problems that don't exist. Nobody asked for a Chipotle style counter serve model. Nobody asked for Netflix. But damn if we didn't know we needed them.
4. Blueprint. These companies create the blueprint for future enterprises and companies. There are many chains now that apply the Chipotle model. There are tons of streaming services now.

Since then, I haven't felt that strongly about a company since I learned about Palantir. Now, I have my own money, and a lot of it is invested in Palantir. We'll see what the next 10 years looks like."
2021-06-26 23:47:47,wallstreetbets,"Everyone commenting here ignores that Amazon was a single digit stock, putting it at 5 billion valuation back then. Most stocks are already overvalued. Car companies that make no money? SPCE that makes no money and has a retarded business model is worth 13.5 billion? You think it's going up by 125x in 20 years? Selling what to whom?

You morons.  Amazon is up by a factor of 340x since 20 years ago. They made NO profit for most of that time. But at least they did something that made sense. Sell things that ACTUALLY exist. SPCE makes no sense. They don't have a chance at hypersonics either. No one will fly if it's 10x more dangerous than subsonic flight which is already super cheap and super fast.

Even IF you bought in back then, you would have sold big chunks many times, and would have a fraction of the shares you started with. So that 340x would be more like 34x, at best. 

And that is only IF you got lucky enough to pick the ONE company in a multitude of sectors that would come to dominate a sector like no company has ever dominated a sector.

Looking/hoping for 100 baggers is moronic."

I got an iPod color first gen and thought “holy shit. I thought this was a lavish purchase, but now I’m sure everyone is going to have one of these.” This was before anyone had iPhones and that shit changed society. It has split four times since then.

Same with Amazon. I saw they had shifted from books to everyday necessities and thought “everyone I know uses Amazon and it hasn’t even reached rural America.”  I think it was trading for $500 and seemed expensive. Lol. Wish it wasn’t a theta snooze fest, tho.

The only reason Amazon, Apple, Microsoft are as large as they are is because they provided genius products/services. I'm sorry, but Blackberry, Clover, CLNE all are just simply never going to reach that size. Just compare them to other companies that are actually successful in their fields, none of them come close to 2T. 

AI is the closest thing IMO to the next big software giant. I'm sure I'll be able to retire off of this stock, if I ever even choose to sell it. If not AI, then a company very similar to it.

2021-06-27 07:08:54,wallstreetbets,"NIO - A few simple reasons:

- EV is the worlds biggest consumer transformation since phones. Huge market that is being forced by 2030-2035. NIO is in the biggest car market in the world, China, and the CCP has invested to save them from bankruptcy in the older days (whether you trust the CCP or not, they have power and can easily push brands or $$ to consumers (NIO has no issue with demand).
-Car design (beautiful especially the new sedan ET7) + Battery swap and battery as a service. Battery swapping is so new (money losing right now, built infrastructure. No other company has innovated this) and they have developed swap stations all across China. Battery as a service lets customers buy a car and lease the battery, so cars are a bit cheaper up front.
-European expansion, mainly Norway. Plans to come to US, but thats long term.

NIO will take over China, no doubt in my mind. After all, theres a reason it was 90+% of my portfolio with the run from $3.33 to $66. I still hold ~500 shares and a bunch of LEAPS I got May 10th after selling shares. Moon is regardless, NIO is going to help my dad retire (I told him about the moon ride at $7) and myself and siblings to have a nice head start. I’ll throw a 🚀 cuz I know this is WSB 🦍

This is an OTC play at the moment… company is primed to receive Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA in September/October this year for their cancer treatment (RadioGel).

The technology essentially enables a radioactive isotope inserted into a liquid where at room temperature is injectable directly into a tumor— upon which it gels up and stays localized to the area where it’s injected. The radioactive isotope provided highly localized radiation treatment to the tumor, while limiting damage to the surround tissue. 

With traditional chemo treatment, the whole body is poisoned to treat one area— but with this treatment only the specific area/tumor is treated while significantly limiting any radiation exposure to other tissues. 

The treatment has proved effective in dogs/cats/horses… the company is aiming to start human trials and iff approved this stock could go from $0.12 to several dollars overnight.

First time you ordered your textbooks online instead of in the campus bookstore, go buy the stock.

So pick the things that you use daily.  As soon as you start using something new, grab some shares, especially if it isn't already a massive company owned by Disney or something that would only put a small blip on their radar.

2021-06-27 01:04:37,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty bullish on $BEAM long-term.  They are currently the only company using 2nd gen crispr technology.

Guiding for 160% y/y revenue growth, strong margins, recurring revenue, impeccable management, superior value-add product, profitable, positive free cash flow. Trades at 21.5x 2021 P/S but they've beat and raised twice in two times, and have a loooong runway to go. And tbh, valuation is very, very reasonable when many tech companies trade at 20x sales with a fraction of the growth."

2021-06-27 11:46:00,wallstreetbets,"I think their is different moving parts and high valuation is just one aspect. The market hasn’t moved organically since 2017 when they injected more money into the economy under traps tax cuts. It did nothing but inflate the market and drive market increase with no real growth to support it. That tax cut was corporate welfare while the rest the average Joe/Jane got the short end of the stick. I truly believe something is bubbling and we don’t know exactly but the language Jarome Powell used during his presentation didn’t exactly ease concerns. I’m not an expert but when you look at the what’s been happening in the markets, you don’t expect it go go on forever."

2021-06-27 12:28:22,wallstreetbets,"I think it depends who you’re trying to speak to. If you speak the average Joe/Jane, they would prefer it to be non-transitory because it means workers wages has to go up to support the inflation but that’s bad for business because the cost of doing business has gone up temporarily but the workers wages are higher. Which would force some businesses to go out of business (the ones that rely on low wage workers). I think it’s going to be more transitory because the feds has been trying to slow inflation for a long long time. There is going to be a point of no return and the current market is the reflection of that. They have very to little control over what the apes are doing and if they step in, this would permanently stop a generation of investor from investing in the markets because they feel it is fixed and why should they invest when they really have no control. The feds have intervened to many times to help their friends and this time because of how over leveraged they are, there’s no amount of money can help them unless they want the usd to become worthless."
2021-06-27 00:40:40,wallstreetbets,"This is true. While it’s not affordable to some investors, it’s still a bargain IMO. Earlier this year it hit $900 and last year before the split, it was over $2000. I’d venture to place bets that it will split again"
2021-06-27 01:14:31,wallstreetbets,"I mean the argument against Amazon was probably that there are a ton of internet shopping sites out there, tons of competition.  But when you're the best, you're the best."
2021-06-27 00:39:19,wallstreetbets,I read an article that Tesla wants to place Mega Chargers at major hubs for their semis. I think there’s one right now being tested.

That is not infancy pricing. When Tesla makes 50x more money then the current price only becomes reasonable. You’re already buying it paying premium for potential future income with might or might not happen"
2021-06-27 01:22:45,wallstreetbets,"True... But being the best is already priced in. Like 10x over Amazon.

Listen, I'm not saying there isn't money to be made... Tesla has never traded around fundamentals. But IMO as others catch up and Tesla gets knocked off, the crazy valuation will likely come down."

2021-06-27 02:58:33,wallstreetbets,"In other words, if you buy something for a reasonable or lower price for its current performance, then it performs 50x and the reasonable price goes up, that’s when you make money long term. If you already paid the price for future performance there is less room to make profits, unless other people in the future also wants to buy at a 600p/e"
2021-06-27 10:18:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, exactly this. Remember, the literal number is meaningless. You want to buy a growth stock before conventional wisdom is that it's a growth stock. Way too late for that here."
2021-06-27 01:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I know Tesla is crazy overvalued... I'm not in them, in fact I bought a bunch of puts when they were over $800.

My point was just that I don't think it's really about competition.  All these companies that have mooned that he mentioned had competition and ended up with more competition.  What made these companies special was that they were *one step ahead* of the competition and *continued to innovate and stay one step ahead*. If you think Tesla can do that, and there are strong arguments they can, this might still be early for them as others are saying.

The only reason I'm not heavily in Tesla right now is because of the astronomical valuation."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF looks very undervalued.. HRC futures closed at a record again $CLF, presents an excellent setup on the chart currently. With a 10% debt paydown due before or on Wednesday and LG accepting an award for steelmaker of the year, it seems blue skies are ahead..

[Cleveland-Cliffs announces redemption of 2025 notes with a month left in Q2 to be paid with ""available liquidity"" ](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210527005169/en/Cleveland-Cliffs-to-Fully-Redeem-5.75-Senior-Notes-due-2025)

[Laurenco Goncalves, CLF CEO, to be named steelmaker of the year, true champion of steel workers](https://www.nwitimes.com/business/local/cleveland-cliffs-ceo-to-be-named-steelmaker-of-the-year-hailed-as-true-champion-of/article_69e3e649-6e03-5af0-bdf8-37301024ea35.html)

$CLF seems to have a huge advantage on input costs that other steelmakers do not. Cliffs blast furnaces as do all blast furnaces use a certain amount of scrap in production. Yet for Cliffs LG has replaced this high priced scrap with HBI at a considerable cost savings versus his competitors. Even the EAF's that Cliffs acquired in the MT purchase will use substantial amounts of HBI as feedstock versus scrap. Cliffs control its feedstock thus controls its costs. Currently CLF input costs are a fraction of Nucors (NUE).. on top of this;

CLF's first guidance raise back in March was based on $975 HRC for the rest of '21 raising the consensus from 2.87b EBITDA to 3.5b EBITDA... CLF currently sits with a 3rd guidance raise on a benchmark of $1175 HRC for the rest of the year guiding 5b EBITDA as of Mid Junes guidance raise.. 

So EBITDA has doubled with 3 guidance raises in 3 months from 2.87b to 5b, yet the stock price has not doubled. Not even risen 25%. To me this screams undervalued. Especially as CLF currently sits under 1/3rd NUE marketcap. LG has said as much too, 

Here is what LG had to say about the matter on Q1 CC.. 

From April 22 2021 Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF) CEO Lourenco Goncalves on Q1 2021 Results - Earnings Call Transcript

 ""And we are starting to trade at the multiples that are absolutely absurd, absolutely ridiculous and this thing is not going to stay there forever. What we'll continue to do, we'll continue to move numbers from the debt side to the equity side. That's what we're doing""

Anything infrastructure is just the sprinkles on top of the sundae that is CLF. CLF does not NEED infrastructure as they are printing money. Currently HRC closed at a record Friday with $1800 printing for August. However, of note, Biden is walking back his comments about both infrastructure bills needing to be done in tandem.

['Certainly not my intent': Biden walks back 'tandem' infrastructure bill remarks](https://www.yahoo.com/news/certainly-not-intent-biden-walks-155425024.html)

Three guidance raises in three months.. the third being on a benchmark of $1,175 HRC for the rest of 2021 while guiding 5b EBITDA. Now take a look at HRC futures

[CLF news](https://www.stck.pro/news/CLF/13871860)

2021-06-26 21:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how friendly the US decides to be with china.  Chinese steel is cheap and available.  US steel is expensive and behind schedule.  The previous administration imposed tariffs on Chinese steel, which ignited a steel race here in the states.  If that goes away out of pettiness, the US steel industry goes away as well.  It's kind of a tossup at this point and it's difficult to say where things will go.  That's one of the bigger reasons there's so much volatility involved with this company."

2021-06-27 02:27:33,wallstreetbets,"China didn't get rid of their export subsidies and start beefing with Australia over iron ore because they plan on resuming dumping steel.

They have massive infrastructure projects currently underway and more planned for the future. From their belt and road initiative to their expansion of nuclear power generation, China is reaching a tipping point where, as their populace gains wealth, they need to satisfy domestic demand before cheap exports are a possibility."
2021-06-26 23:21:51,wallstreetbets,"China will reverse their position when their economy doesn’t need their supply. 

They’ll go back to dumping for cheap as soon as they can sure. But they pulled back when prices are at an all time high. Tells me they aren’t dumping anytime soon."
2021-06-27 12:45:11,wallstreetbets,so -10% dip. Mark my words
2021-06-26 23:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I just believe they are only holding back because of the tariffs.  If they weren't in place (and I'm assuming they won't be for long... Everything T related is out) their prices would meet demand in short order.   Especially with an infrastructure deal on its way here.
    
To be clear I am bullish on clf short term.  I just think long term growth is going to be a challenge because of the world market."

The boom is all pandemic, government stimulus, delayed projects, etc all forming into one giant demand ball. And it’s rolling down hill picking up speed. And at that moment when China would reign supreme. They pulled back. Because they have their own delayed projects. Their own necessary stimulus and infrastructure. Etc. 

The outlook for cliffs long term is bullish because they’ll be debt free thanks to this surge in pricing and demand. 

Mid 2022 and debt free is the makings of a great decade run."
2021-06-27 00:49:38,wallstreetbets,"Look, im just saying that the heavy tariffs are in play here., That's all.  I'm not into politics or Olympics or anything like that."
2021-06-26 23:50:47,wallstreetbets,"It's a 25% tariff, that's more than significant.  Think about our steel futures falling 25%, would clf be in the same place? The answer is 100% no.  Just don't forget the whole picture when making bets.  Short term, yes, steel good.  Tr ump tariffs gone?  Look out, back to 2018 levels or close to it (~$5/share)"
2021-06-27 07:41:21,wallstreetbets,"If it was all tariffs why would China remove their domestic rebates as a disincentive to export?


If China were to implement their own tariffs now how bad would that crater your argument?"
2021-06-27 01:03:33,wallstreetbets,👍
2021-06-26 23:53:25,wallstreetbets,"You’re retarded. 

Simple as that. 

$5 a share when debt was 5 billion. 

After they pay off $5 billion in debt you think the price will be the same? You think after buying the US steel operations of mittal that the price will be the same?

Let alone, you think that tariff did anything to China supply? Prices aren’t up because the fucking tariffs. 

They are up because of demand. The tariffs did dick to Chinese supply. China supply is only down because they have their own demand they can’t keep up with."
2021-06-26 23:59:50,wallstreetbets,"I am retarded, and yes, steel prices jumped 50% following the Chinese tariffs."
2021-06-27 00:04:27,wallstreetbets,Which has zero to do with today’s price.
2021-06-27 00:06:40,wallstreetbets,But only because supply is limited.
2021-06-27 00:12:10,wallstreetbets,"More like demand is insanely high. 

Supply is limited some from pre pandemic. But demand is way higher. Which is why China pulled back their supply.  Because their demand is too high also. 

It’s a demand driven equation more than it’s a lack of supply. Even at full capacity or higher output than 2018, demand is still higher than capacity.

There’s a year of delayed projects to complete. On top of new infrastructure stimulus spending worldwide. This is a boom that has legs. 

And regardless, the facts of the entire industry are going to change as a result of the cash flows they are receiving today. Cliffs FCF is gonna pay down their debt. Debt free 2022 with EBITDA of 1-2 billion a year, is going to give them an enterprise value of more than 16 billion and that’s only about 8x p/e. Realistically as they get those earnings, and once the debt is paid. Whether they do buybacks or invest it acquisitions, the sign is clear to growth. Steel prices can decline to pre pandemic levels and it won’t matter. Once the debt is paid, and coupled with the MT operations acquisition, its a different company with ability to control costs. Cliffs is a generational opportunity as some have called it. 

All depends on if you believe the super cycle or not."
2021-06-27 07:45:04,wallstreetbets,"You’re talking like steel gang but I don’t recognize your name 🦾

Btw I agree

This guys whole tariff focused argument is cratered by the fact China is disincentivizing their own exports with the rescinding of their own VAT rebates.


If China feels that’s insufficient and they issue a new tariff it’ll be rocket emojis"
2021-06-27 00:55:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm just saying the tariffs from the world's biggest supplier of steel are a factor in the domestic price of steel.  I'm not really interested in what American suppliers are doing presently, because whatever they can do, is not comparable to what china _could_ do, if those tariffs go back to what they used to be.  It all depends on if domestic demand outweighs supply in the long run.  If we get to a point where our infrastructure needs outweigh the domestic supply, we 100% will seek foreign supply.  That's all.   It's not something CLF can affect, it's not something we, as investors can affect, it's a risk we need to price into our investment."
2021-06-27 08:34:43,wallstreetbets,"New to steel gang but familiar with CLF. 

Dad worked for the ore operations. I myself worked in the ore operations when I was in college. 

I remember when LG was hired. There was legit fear that he’d come in and break up the company, sell off the good parts. Let the bad parts fail and screw pensioners. 

Instead, it looks like he’s going to make the company the strongest it’s ever been. 

I’ll never doubt LG again."
2021-06-27 00:58:36,wallstreetbets,"Even going back to 2017 pre tariff assumptions, the landscape for CLF has changed. It is a different company. It’s value will not go back to $5 a share. 

In this regard, the tariffs are irrelevant to cliffs. Cliffs saw an initial bump from the tariffs. But largely wasn’t moving higher pre pandemic. 

The current and 3-5 year window of success is entirely related to the pandemic and has nothing to do with tariffs or China. 

If we go back to 2017, by the time we do, cliffs is nowhere near the same. Their profits will still be larger today than they were then. And with no debt it absolutely effects what they do with their FCF. For this reason the tariffs are largely irrelevant. What cliffs does with their FCF is what is relevant."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Re: ""revenge traders"" - a comprehensive guide to accepting you're a degenerate. This turned into a Chad Dickens so I decided to make it its own post in response to [Revenge traders, how do you stop?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o8dj0n/revenge_traders_how_do_you_stop/). I hope it can help at least one person.

If you are like me, you're only able to rationally and logically analyze a position before and after the fact, but are unable to do so in the moment. You're great at picking winners and entering positions, but then you always somehow manage to throw it all away.

> but maybe it’s just like gambling

It's not just *like* gambling, it 100% *is* gambling. You may have never seen yourself as a gambler or like ""one of *those* people"" but you are -- sure this place is called Wall St. **Bets**, and yeah ""this is a **casino**"" and ""what's an **exit** strategy"" but those are all just *memes*, right? You and me, the smart and disciplined people, we're actually *investing*...right? Wrong.

I've been wrestling with this for a while in a very painful and psychologically destructive way. I'd be lying if I said it hasn't partially shattered my ego. I'm the type of person that needs to understand ""why"" -- why I did (or did not do) a particular thing in the moment. Why did I ignore my gut or plan or second guess myself or ignore past lessons + experiences or forget the big picture and my goals or lose perspective and become blind to context? 

I've made myself physically and mentally ill for days turning the situations over and over in my mind, replaying them looking for some clue or explanation as to why I acted the way I did.

A few realizations that helped me move forward and learn about myself:

- by watching the market continuously day after day, minute by minute I turned my trading screen into a **slot machine**

- you may not have been a gambler before but constant exposure to a slot machine will **physically rewire your brain** the same way that doing coke or heroin will. Accept that your hardware is compromised and *cannot* behave appropriately anymore -- the software is irrelevant. 

> And yes, I have a trading rule book. But in the moment it’s fucking thrown out. 

I have written pages of ""lessons"" and ""how I felt"" and ""goals"" and ""rules"" then immediately forgot about all of it in the moment even as past events replayed themselves exactly as before and even as my gut and head were screaming for me to run for the exit.

This article is a must-read and I encourage everyone to do their own further research: 

https://www.fastcompany.com/90217918/how-gambling-distorts-reality-and-hooks-your-brain

- gamblers are *not* addicted to the high they get from winning, they are addicted to the high they get from **uncertainty** and **anticipation**. 

- You get a dopamine hit when the numbers move how you *thought* they would. You even get a dopamine hit from losing. You do not get a dopamine hit from exiting a position because then the game is over.

This is why you can't exit gracefully: the ""more"" you are craving has nothing to do with making money, it has to do with *seeing* the numbers go up. 

Once you get your next hit you'll immediately want another, and that next hit has nothing to do with smashing the Sell button and so you never will. You'll stick around FOREVER, glued to watching the numbers flash and smash your neurons with dopamine even as it drains to zero.

Here are some ""tips"" I've tried to drill into myself, but they will only help if you step away from the machine:

It's not your money until you sell. Until you sell, it's the market's money.

Frame it as ""how much of this position am I actually willing to lose?"" 

Ask yourself: would I buy into this position right now at its current value? If you're up 300%+ in 2 days the answer is probably ""no"" and you should start thinking about selling.

Think about how much money it actually is. Is it a utility bill, your rent/mortgage, a steak dinner, a vacation, a sports car, an early retirement?

People value time -- think about it in terms of salary and feel a little guilty. Imagine the hardest working poor person you know...is it twice their yearly salary? 4x? Imagine telling a loved one you flushed the equivalent of years of their hard work and how disrespectful that would be. Imagine how many months or years you'd have to work to ""break even"" if you lost it all.

Step away from the screen. Stop looking at the flashing numbers. Commit to ""sampling the curve"" and ""seeking the peak"" via stop losses and limits. You won't ever get it perfect so stop trying; perfect is the enemy of good enough. Rewire your brain to see taking profits and not losing money as the ""win""

Think about downside exits. Remember: stairs up, elevator down. The next rug pull is *always* just around the corner and you have NO guarantee that a stock will trade sideways or give you time to exit slowly.

Don't day trade. Try to look at the screen as little as possible. Set limits and stops to automate the process. Yes you will ""miss out"" on gains and get stopped out...but is that worse than flushing thousands watching it go to zero in real time over and over?

Even with these rules in mind, remember: you're a gambler, you're an addict, your brain is physically and functionally compromised and no amount of rules or nice thoughts will change that. If you want to keep trading, you have to enforce equivalent physically-based habits and guardrails that sidestep the slot machine. 

If you're staring at the screen, you're gambling. Period. Your judgement is fucked and you will *not* make the correct decisions because the selection of choices and perspectives you have available in that moment has been artificially limited. You won't ever lock in your gains because the ""sell"" option has been removed from the menu by the hardwired blind spot in your brain. If you want to win, you have to take steps to change the rules of the game in your favor."
2021-06-26 20:45:34,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for posting this brother. It hit too close to home.

I've been in deep depression for the past two and a half weeks since I didn't take profits on my CLOV yolo on 6/9. I missed out on truly life changing gains (500k) and let emotions and greed get the best of me. I should of sold at the opening bell but I got caught up in all of the hype and thinking it wasn't a PND, retarded, I know. I watched CLOV drill for about two hours and even tried to ""buy the dip"" before throwing in the towel and taking the profits that were left.

It's been killing me inside, I can't stop reliving that morning and the two days of trading that led up to it. I'm suffering from depression, PTSD and now I have crazy insomnia. I could of really used some of that money to pay off debt and take a bunch of weight of my shoulders. Would of been nice to take a summer vacation too but no, I chose pain and misery."
2021-06-26 20:03:53,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for posting.  It helps put things into perspective for me.  I'm not a day trader but I started acting like one - worrying about small movements in individual share prices.   It started to take over and then the penny dropped for me...(again)...I have an addictive personality type.  Once I told myself that I am an investor, not a trader, then I stopped looking at prices during the day.  I still look at the end of the day to keep an eye on things but now I'm not so wound up about it or so reactive.  I really appreciate your post."

Food for thought if you’re feeling the same. 

I’m not quite ready to give up but hoping I can figure out a balance even though I might not want to do the activities I once enjoyed I’m just going to do them. Force it for now."

2021-06-27 01:11:09,wallstreetbets,Meh I look a lot during the day but I have to really justify not taking 100%. I had major problems starting out losing thousands getting passed off blaming manipulation all the usual. I read somewhere about self sabotage I know it was on reddit not sure what sub though. And that was the begginging of a turn around. I still rarely sell at 30% like a lot of people suggest but I do start to weigh my options and if there isn't high probability of it continuing to rise or there is a lot doubt surrounding it I will sell. especially if there is a really juicy setup I could jump in.

2021-06-26 21:44:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry that happened to you, I know it's not the story you wanted to have written for yourself.

I have similar experiences w/ GME + BB. I had somewhat moved on from the GME fail, but BB was even worse because I KNEW better based on what happened before...yet I made the exact same mistakes **again** despite being given what can only be described as a ""get out of jail free card"" mixed with a miracle. 

I still played it nearly as wrong as I possibly could have. 

The hard thing to understand and accept is that if given a 3rd, 4th, or even 10th chance, I would still make the same ""mistakes"" -- because they aren't mistakes...they are hardcoded neural pathways. It's like a river being mad at itself for where the water flows.

The only advice I can offer is that it will (slowly) get better over time. 

I've been jolted awake multiple times a night for weeks. I've had panic attacks. Listing all the feelings of shame, guilt, anger, regret, remorse, anxiety, etc would fill pages. 

I've wondered if this is the new normal for me and if everything will ever be the same again. I've wondered if living this kind of existence is even worth it. I've wondered if I'll ever get my confidence back (or if I deserve to). It's insane (literally).

One thing that has helped tremendously is CBD tincture (low or no THC content). I got it out of desperation. It takes effect very quickly and mellows me out enough that I can at least get some sleep. Give yourself time and space to heal....it WILL happen with time.

If it's any consolation, I thought GME was a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity that would never come again. Then BB happened, and AMC, and CLOV, and all the others. It's all based on when you get in, they can all be huge opportunities and there will be many more.

It is cruel that this disease/illness/whatever robbed you of such a life-changing sum, but think of it as a monkey's paw: a stupid curse to taint what would otherwise be perceived as great fortune. You still made money, the 500k was just a figment sent to diminish the happiness you should be entitled to.

Your choices were hardcoded and inevitable...you couldn't have ever made different ones *in that moment*. Only after the fact is your brain able to run something other than its hardwired program. That's why you think you could have done it differently, but the truth is you couldn't have. If you can accept that, you'll be able to stop beating yourself up and focus on changing your habits so you can take advantage of the next opportunity fully. 

If you did it once, you can do it again (just wait until you're not on tilt, though)."

2021-06-26 20:14:37,wallstreetbets,"Glad you are able to recognize it and take steps in advance to avoid falling into the trap.

For me I didn't realize what had happened until it was too late. Before all this I was a very disciplined conservative investor type. Then bit by bit I kept adding more and more positions, spending months working from home during COVID where I would compulsively scroll through them all constantly checking on them like an equity zoo. 

At first I felt like a genius and was making a ton, but then started seeing things bleed to zero without realizing something had changed. Every choice I made was the ""wrong"" one so I kept scrambling to inverse myself and got more and more tilted each time.

I got lucky enough on shit like GME (the few times I managed to actually take gains) that I had enough to fund the other stupidity without getting myself into real trouble."
2021-06-26 23:36:14,wallstreetbets,"I definitely fit into this whole category. What's been really helpful is just looking at any green as ""free money"" and nothing more.

2021-06-26 20:04:45,wallstreetbets,"> I don't understand this.

That's kind of the point. You don't have the same mental illness preventing you from making good, sound, rational choices in the moment.

My brain literally cannot distinguish between the value propositions of sitting on a $50k position that is up several hundred % and watching the price go up 5 cents. 

It's broken in a way where it derives more pleasure from watching the price tick up and anticipating it going up ""even more"" than it does from locking in a gain. 

Think of ""sell now and lock in this gain"" as a software program that never has a chance to run because the hardware of my brain is hardwired to run its own different shittier program in preference to all others.

> and always hold till expiration. 

Oftentimes yes. I will be up...but it could go up even more. And if it does goes up (\**ding!*\*) then it could go up even *more* than that. And I want my next ding.

But if it drops then I feel bad, but also resentful and can't let go of what it was just at...it feels like a ""near miss"" so I convince myself to just wait and then what was ""mine"" will be back and I'll of course sell *then* right? 

And if it keeps tanking then I just keep digging in more and more, anticipating it has to go up (gambler's fallacy)...while also believing that the second I decide to cut my losses and sell it will shoot back up just to spite me and I'll feel stupid for having missed out on gains (the same gains I didn't take minutes or days before)."

2021-06-27 00:17:37,wallstreetbets,"Your writing is poignant and beautiful and very correct for some of us - or many of us, including me.

It's important to get this stuff of our chests. I'm taking care of my four-year-old during the summer, and I spent hours glued to screens staring at options moving up and down and realized that our days' mood largely depends on my gains or losses. Then I'm ashamed to have spent hours staring at stocks instead of nourishing the person I love the most in this world.

To put this into context, no one expected this from me, including me. I teach literature at University and became passionate about learning the stock market a year ago. I thought I'd be a passive conservative investor... Ha. I have many life experiences, but nothing prepared me for the emotional rollercoasters of trading.

Now comes the difficult work of forgiving ourselves and learning from this. I feel like I'll do well with the former, but not with the latter. I fear that on Monday I will be the same distracted/obsessed person I have been for the past few months.

2021-06-26 20:09:39,wallstreetbets,"I have some of the problem you describe, but as soon as I see green I look for an exit. 

I HAVE noticed as soon as I exit a position I am looking for another trade to enter ASAP so I relate to some degree. 

One thing I do do that helps (I think), is as soon as I close winning positions, I divert a portion of the gain to an account where I don't trade aggressively.  Maybe I only sell CCs and CSPs or buy dividend stocks there. That money generates income which is for long term salary replacement."
2021-06-26 20:10:24,wallstreetbets,"Also, how old are you?

Edit: I ask because perspective helps. If you are 20-30, have a 10 year mindset. Would you be happy retiring in 10 years at 30-40? That's the appeal of the ""gamble"", for me anyway. You don't need 10 home runs playing in the big leagues to get there. You're not a juiced up freakish talent, physically or mentally. You can't compete there. We compete at the slow pitch softball level. You need a bunch of singles, some doubles, and occasionally a HR. The home runs are awesome, but even the best players usually don't hit them, even when you select from only the times they got on base. 

2^10 = 1,024
1.05^142 = 1,020

One of those is easier and less stressful."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"KHC (Kraft Heinz) DD The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC) is the third-largest food and beverage manufacturer in North America,  the company has a vast selection of brands ([https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/brands.html](https://www.kraftheinzcompany.com/brands.html)) most notably Kraft, Heinz, Philadelphia, and Oscar Mayer.

Currently, KHC is trading at $40.69 a share (49.77B MC).

KHC's Valuation metrics:

P/E 92.48 (FWD 1Y 15.33)

P/S 1.89 (FWD 1Y 2.033)

Price to free cash flow 10.37

P/B 0.98

KHC's valuation metrics are attractive the industry average for p/e is 18.4, the industry average price to free cash flow is 27.33. If we assume the company maintains its current 7% CAGR and 22% operating margin KHC has about a 47% margin of safety, with a fair value per share of $77.28 ([https://imgur.com/ctiqHV3](https://imgur.com/ctiqHV3))

Debt Situation:

KHC has managed to decrease its total liabilities, noteworthy reductions are that in total payables and Current Debt & Capital Lease Obligations. ([https://imgur.com/y8CSHlY](https://imgur.com/y8CSHlY))

Conclusion/TLDR:

KHC appears to be undervalued, it is noteworthy as a stock held by both Warren Buffett and Michael Burry. KHC's fair value per share is probably around the $60 range, and the economic moat provided by the company and its nearly 4% dividend yield as well as minimal issuance of shares makes this an attractive stock."

Just look at the pretty pictures if you don't understand anything. Maybe throw some poop like a real ape if you want to have a chance at getting some tendies. Anyways, some interesting things happened this week worth following up on.

First: We're up 10% on the week. We didn't quite reach my original estimate of $45, but we set a new ATH at $42.75 before closing out Friday at $42.41. Overall a very exciting week. As a result, however, I've lowered my 7/16 price target to $50. Here's a pretty picture. 

https://preview.redd.it/5p8u2s7mmo771.png?width=1741&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee3786302d97a64e727d4dd691915abe98b632bc

Second: Overall trends continue to generally repeat themselves as can be seen watching the SMAs in the chart below. Looking at Friday's candlestick, it's hard to say what will happen next week. My guess based on this chart remains the same as before, that we'll see the price bounce around a good bit. 

https://preview.redd.it/zay61j2zmo771.png?width=1955&format=png&auto=webp&s=4119634ca570db32baee824606941125f43aafbb

Third: The volume at the end of trading/into after hours Friday was quite unusual. There was a sudden runup (estimating about 1M shares) within the last minutes. This amounts to over a third of a normal day's trading volume. I have also taken the liberty of adding up all of the after hours trades available for view on the Nasdaq, which totals up around 1M shares. In total, this brought ASO Friday trading volume up around 2x normal. This massive jump in volume at the end of the week is really quite momentous after a slow week, and I will be excited to see what effect it has on trading at open on Monday. Images below showing some of the larger trades after hours, and the minute by minute trading volume during normal hours.

Fourth: we have finally gotten some official new short interest figures. It appears that SI has increased slightly since last report, up to 12.5M shares instead of 12M. With average trading volume going down a bit to 2.5M shares, the expected days to cover is now 5. MarketWatch info here.

Last: Options activity. One of the few bearish things I can say about ASO is that some of the 7/16 40c have been exercised and closed out early. This reduces the chances of gamma movement next month a little bit, but there are still enough options open that there is potential for something interesting to happen. We've also seen 7/16 45c, 47c, and 50c getting more attention this week, as can be seen here.

So apes, this is your 6/26 $ASO update. I hope you like looking at my DDs.

This is not financial advice. I am ape."
2021-06-26 20:16:37,wallstreetbets,Stocks can go up or down. ASO can only go up. It's the Chuck Norris among stocks.
2021-06-26 20:53:11,wallstreetbets,ASO has solid fundamentals.
2021-06-26 20:08:39,wallstreetbets,TLDR: great investment if you like guns and/or money.
2021-06-26 20:29:54,wallstreetbets,ASO has been pretty good to me since I bought in. Gonna hold some long and have some $55c 1/22 I’ll be watching
2021-06-26 21:15:32,wallstreetbets,Nice DD! Love seeing folks loading up on those 7/16 options. Would love $45 this week too.
2021-06-26 21:40:49,wallstreetbets,I have the 7/16 44c.
2021-06-27 04:10:20,wallstreetbets,"$ASO is scary. Was expecting a dip on Friday but the price held all the way till closing.

I wonder how long this rise can happen!"
2021-06-27 14:36:05,wallstreetbets,"To me this is a multi year compounder. Imagine COSTCO. 1000 invested in 1985 would be 225k today excluding dividends. Academy has the right mix of products and price. They believe they can put 600 more stores in USA. Currently they have ~260. Hold onto this stock folks. If you have 401k or ROTH, buy commons and forget. Americans will spend more time outside. I think pandemic has brought this new change in behavior."
2021-06-27 11:42:46,wallstreetbets,"This stock has given people loads off opportunities to buy in on the dips over the last few months. Massively undervalued and should be $60+ EOY.

I’ve shares and July 30 and Dec 40 calls. 
After earnings it should have been trading at $45 but the powers that be kept it under $40. I suspect it will have a really good July."

2021-06-27 04:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Honestly , Investing is the easiest thing I’ve ever done after I figured out the most important thing about investing. FOLLOW, whales. Whales make moves every day, instead of making dumb ass fucking yolos like this, invest in a service that provides you the latest info (which is like every few minutes) of the largest buys of options or underlying stock, then do exactly what the guy that just dropped 5 million on calls did or buy shares, profit a little then move on to the next play. But idiots on WSB will come here lose thousands just randomly guessing this stock is gonna move this week… when you can literally just find out what’s about to move before it moves 


E.g : SPCE had a shit done of money throw in on it on calls expiring 7/2 and 6/25 on Thursday, guess who bought calls after seeing that right before market closed ?

2021-06-27 15:27:53,wallstreetbets,"I think there was an Adam Ruins Everything about this recently. Mice actually suck for a precursor to human studies. The main reason they're used is because science is built around using them for research, so it's really hard and prohibitively expensive to use animals that might actually be more representative of human biology in a specific way or system, and even harder than that to just use human subjects for preliminary studies. So like if cats had... I dunno, an adrenal system that's closer to humans than mice, it'd be much, much harder to do a study with cats as subjects than mice, so they just kinda take a shot in the dark with mice so they can get funding for a human trial. And what really sucks is that because mice are so dissimilar to humans, studies that find x does y in mice, but then on humans, x doesn't do y end up wasting a shitton of grant money on science that doesn't really apply to humans. So like next time you see a headline that says ""Thing causes Good Thing in mice!"" take it with a giant grain of salt because it's kinda a crap shoot if something that works in mice will work in humans."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PLTR and $SKLZ are GOING TO THE MOON -- Russel Inclusion Positions:

SKLZ: July 2 22's and july 16 22's

PLTR: July 2 28's and july 16 30's

Both of these have clear catalysts this week. They have been included into the Russel 1000 and did not previously announce this. After hours Friday,  both of these were added. *See* [https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru1000\_membershiplist\_20210628.pdf](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/ru1000_membershiplist_20210628.pdf); [https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution](https://www.ftserussell.com/resources/russell-reconstitution)*.*

&#x200B;

Remember when Tesla got added? Yeah moon shot. Obviously the Russel 1000 and S&P are two very different as far as the resulting institutional buying, but PLTR and SKLZ in particular have much smaller market caps. Either way, institutions are going to be forced to add these two. Both of these have great technical set ups and are breaking through major resistances, and thus with the additional volume they should sky rocket. SKLZ has a ton of short interest as well, which means it could get some squeeze action. Both had a ton of call flow this past week, and the open interests are huge. 

&#x200B;

On Skillz i'm looking for a minimum of a move to $25 THIS WEEK, which would be a 5 bagger, yes ladies and gents 500%. 

&#x200B;

On Palantir i'm looking for a move to $30 this week. Either way. BUY MONDAY, we have both seen what these can do with retail support. Lets get this $$$$

2021-06-26 20:09:22,wallstreetbets,"Russell inclusion for both of these was announced earlier this month. Sorry of you didn't notice OP. With that being said the inclusion has already been priced in to the current stock prices. So neither of these have clear catalysts this week.

If you look at the 1 minute chart for each of these on friday you'll see that right at market close PLTR had almost 70 million in volume and SKLZ had 13.5 million. This is the indices, funds, and institutional buying picking up their shares in dark pools during the day and then making the volume public at close.

I do hope that PLTR does well for me (100 shares and Jan 2023 leaps) and you and although I have no position on sklz I hope it does well for you too. I just don't think we're going to see the moves you think we're going to see for the reasons you think we're going to see them.

Good luck all."
2021-06-27 04:33:15,wallstreetbets,Institutions are like the raptors in Jurassic Park. They never hit the same part of the fence twice. They.... remember.
2021-06-27 14:49:20,wallstreetbets,I’m in!  🚀
2021-06-26 20:22:16,wallstreetbets,We knew PLTR was being added to russell back in the first week of June.  It was  announced weeks ago.  The index funds would have already bought shares.  You're misleading people into thinking all that is about to happen but it already did.
2021-06-26 20:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Holding 100 shares and my retarded ass bought some dirt cheap 24$ puts for 6$ each.  I expect a dip Monday/Tuesday to sell the puts and rockets after Wednesday.

Short $30 November-January 2022-June-January 2023 put combo"
2021-06-26 20:12:59,wallstreetbets,Omg is that why it had a ridiculous 140 million shares traded?
2021-06-27 04:05:27,wallstreetbets,Hasn’t anyone told you? Any good news for PLTR causes the stock to drop 5-10%
2021-06-27 05:06:07,wallstreetbets,"I will buy SKLZ because you seem to know what you are talking about, but you say it is going to 25 and that will be 500% but it's already at 20, so how is that a 500% increase?"
2021-06-26 22:58:08,wallstreetbets,New spce? Do you think spacex is done lol
2021-06-26 20:22:47,wallstreetbets,Me either bought it barely under $10. Not much so it will need to go Saturn screw the moon.
2021-06-26 20:29:56,wallstreetbets,. Either way good luck!
2021-06-26 23:43:10,wallstreetbets,Agreed on russell already being priced in but i do think his sklz comparison to spce is accurate as in any good news makes it fly as sklz acquisition did earlier in the month.  It is coiled and primed to explode.
2021-06-26 21:46:35,wallstreetbets,"Thank you- I noticed the 120m volume (give or take), but didn't realize it came about that way. I definitely was watching it for almost an hour straight. Would literally hit 27.00 and not a penny higher, repeatedly. My 6/25 $27 calls really wanted it to go higher, lol."
2021-06-27 10:29:06,wallstreetbets,"I don’t necessarily disagree, but someone could have made your argument a week or two ago - or a month ago as you said - and missed the massive gains the last two weeks. Palantir also got a huge fed contract in late May and a FAA contract very recently.

It’s not a meme stock, but imho it still has good reason to make gains."

2021-06-26 23:19:14,wallstreetbets,Nicely done!  I’m low at 20s. I didn’t believe my friend when IPO happened. At least I didn’t wait til high 30s to buy.
2021-06-26 20:44:29,wallstreetbets,"The Russell 3000 is the Russell 1000 + Russell 2000. So when they announced which tickers were going to be included in the Russell 3000 all anyone has to do is look at the market cap of a company to determine if it is going to be in the 1000 or the 2000. 

PLTR was obviously going to the 1000 with a 50b market cap. SKLZ was much closer to the 1000/2000 cutoff with their 8.5b market cap.

To be honest I think it may be a net negative as far as shares being purchased for SKLZ to be at the bottom of the 1000 rather then the top of the 2000 when you consider that some funds may weigh their stock purchases according to market cap."
2021-06-27 12:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I get what you're saying but I respectfully disagree. A week or two ago would be the anticipation of the Russell inclusions by investors. That may be part of the reason for some of the gains the last week or two. The institutional purchasing happens on the 25th when the reconstitution actually happened though.

All I am saying is that on friday all the indices and funds purchased their shares and its evident by the volume shown on the charts. So starting Monday and going forward, the Russell inclusion is already totally priced in.

I'm still bullish and long on PLTR going forward, I don't know much about SKLZ. I'm just trying to shed light on how things have actually already happened rather then how OP is anticipating them about to be happening. Ya know what I mean?"
2021-06-26 20:12:11,wallstreetbets,Nah man they've bought all the positions they need already. 69 million volume on PLTR at market close on friday and 13.5 million on SKLZ. Russell inclusion has already been priced in.
2021-06-26 20:13:47,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine if you let them run. Russell inclusion is already priced in. We won't see the amazing moves that OP is anticipating.
2021-06-27 07:02:14,wallstreetbets,Their both the same etf lmao.. which institutions had to buy 15mins before market closed on the 25th and it didnt do jack shit because 1 of the stocks im in had massive vol in the last 20mins im talking 1 million share per trade on webull and it did fuck all
2021-06-26 23:23:21,wallstreetbets,I say it to make myself feel better when I lose money.
2021-06-26 20:14:23,wallstreetbets,"The timing of the announcement and the inclusion date are key. Each index announces its changes in advance, but index funds cannot acquire the new company until the effective date of the change. In the interim, other market participants may buy in expectation of a big price jump on the effective date. However, once index funds purchase their required positions, the stock price will maintain a new higher price level and there will be no additional effect on price due to inclusion."
2021-06-26 20:14:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Another 16% gain in a week is a good amount. Possible but I think unlikely.
2021-06-26 20:17:28,wallstreetbets,"Index funds have already acquired their shares. Its all done through dark pools on friday and then the volume traded was displayed at market close. The inclusion is already priced in.

I still wish you luck though."

Once he opened my account he then scrambled to try to find somebody for me to talk to, but they had gone home during the time I was sitting around waiting for somebody to talk to. And I think it was all because I was wearing a hoodie and jeans and didn’t look like I was the type to have a worthy account.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How do you think the Biden ""SLIP UP"" will affect WKHS or any of the EV up and comers? President Joe Biden slipped up and said he wouldn't sign the TRILLION DOLLAR infrastructure bill that he himself has endorsed and has been endorsing unless his other domestic priorities came across his desk as well....
 [Biden](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/25/biden-infrastructure-bill-496412)

 I would imagine myself that news like this will or can destroy some EV hopefuls.  I'm personally trading WKHS and know (or feel) the shorts are playing nasty... Do you think this could just be a market move play?"

2021-06-27 09:40:06,wallstreetbets,He clarified
2021-06-27 09:50:03,wallstreetbets,The problem with ev is that well off people are screwing the middle class with the seven thousand dollar credit.  Expensive cars should not be supported by everyone.  Cheap electric cars will have to hit the market soon.

WKHS"
2021-06-27 11:31:55,wallstreetbets,If anything Biden is only going to increase the size of the bill therefore increasing the positive effects on green stocks. My guess is they’ll make a bill so big that it’ll take years to implement and eventually just get thrown out in 4 years by the next president. So I’m not letting this news effect my investment strategy  either way
2021-06-26 22:31:17,wallstreetbets,If china is supporting their EV companies then we should too!! Like the fuck? U know actually the only people that benefit from Republican policies might be China... 🤨🤨🤨 Holy shit do the Chinese control the republicans ?

2021-06-27 02:34:13,wallstreetbets,"It's funny, I'm prob right wing by Reddit standards, but in this case I'm actually OK with Biden's economics so far and the Fed letting inflation ride. I think the Dems use Repubs to ""be the bad guy"" and reduce govt spending because even they know we need to cut back. It was a nice surprise to see Biden not listen to insane avg Reddit user demands like 50k+ student loan forgiveness and more stimmy checks, even sorta half lying with the 1400+600$ rather than 2600$ thing.  

As for inflation, I was freaking out, BUT a lot of price spikes really are due to supply chain issues, which are improving and now commodities are dropping. We just maybe can tip toe through this with 4-5ish% inflation for a couple years, slowly driving up interest rates in 2023 without too much economic slowdown hopefully.

The housing market tho, WTF, I want a piece of real estate so bad but jesus it just climbs more. If housing could crash but leave my S&P500 portfolio unscathed, that'd be great lol"

2021-06-27 14:25:24,wallstreetbets,I’m right with u on this except I have a feeling the inflations gunna get worse. I feel like there’s gotta be a limit to how fast anyone (left or right) can get that many people to get back to work and stabilize the numbers. If they kept the inflation rate within their own quoted expectations I’d trust the process more. I’m just worried it’s starting to run away from em

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PayPal (PYPL) gonna drop, Square (SQ) gonna pop (DD) Small business owner here that uses PayPal (PYPL) but has just been convinced to switch my hundreds of accounts to Square (SQ). I sell music and books, primarily, and use PayPal checkout. Today PayPal just sent out their new price increases for August 2nd, and the number hikes are unnecessary and much higher than Square, their main competitor. 

For example, a credit card payment with Square carries fees of $0.10 plus 2.6% of the transaction amount. The online fee is $0.30 plus 2.9%. If you manually key in a credit card, it jumps to $0.15 plus 3.5%, which feels dumb until you consider why a card might not scan, and this is insurance on those transactions.

PayPal was competitive at $0.30 plus 2.9% per transaction, regardless if keyed in or run. 

PayPal is now increasing their cut to $0.49 plus 3.49% per transaction, a 0.5% plus $0.19 hike. That may not sound like much, but over thousands of transactions, that's a ton of money I'm losing on fees. So I have to spend the weekend dropping new codes into purchase buttons...and those buttons will lead to Square.

As an investor, you might think more fees means more money for PayPal, but I promise you that in talking with other small business owners, we're acutely aware of that bottom line, and I've had many discussions on the merits of PayPal vs Square at major book and music conferences each year. Think about every small-time online retailer...they're going to vote with their pocketbook.

So there you have it. Think about getting some money on the Square train, as that shit might pop.

EDIT: a word"
2021-06-26 22:12:45,wallstreetbets,"I use PayPal for my big cartel shop, and I dont mind it.  Sure the fees are a thing but I just factor that in when I  price my glass."
2021-06-27 01:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Glad to hear this from the business owners, it strengthens my conviction in SQ even more! + I’m still waiting SQ joining SP500, hopefully sometime this year!"
2021-06-26 21:56:02,wallstreetbets,Uh - why don’t you just raise your prices to cover the cost increase like most businesses will do?
2021-06-26 22:10:37,wallstreetbets,Sweet. I've been sitting on SQ for a year. Send me to the moon please
2021-06-26 22:31:52,wallstreetbets,They will trade together.
2021-06-27 00:35:30,wallstreetbets,Why not use Stripe? They only charge 3% for each transaction. Their customer service is also incredible.
2021-06-27 04:35:22,wallstreetbets,PayPal also just started having businesses on Venmo and are taking cuts on transactions classified as for goods and services. So their revenue is going to continue going up. More ppl use Venmo than CashApp.

2021-06-26 22:20:06,wallstreetbets,Starting like a month or two ago ebay cut PayPal out.  I mean I think you can still use it as a payment option but as a seller they now transfer your sales minus fees directly to bank account.
2021-06-27 06:41:27,wallstreetbets,A lot of business owners don't even look at the transaction terms and are too lazy to change services.

2021-06-27 06:55:40,wallstreetbets,"In what way? The majority of people are quite incompetent at their jobs.

1. A lot of small businesses are run by one or two people who are often too busy to fully react, process, or handle changes to their payment handlers as they happen 

2. Many owners are aware of the costs of switching (pos systems, website changes, account changes, payment routing, insurance, etc) and operate by continuously pushing back their plans to migrate. Penny wise dollar stupid.

3. Many owners just stick to what they're comfortable with and the tools they're used to. Often mentally justifying it as saving money.

They often use the same logical fallacies and poor decision making to justify opposite conclusions to the same problems.

Sure, most probably only look at that number and if they only have a simple change or two to make they go for it. But if you can't envision the staggering amount of morons running a business then I've got a condo to sell you."
2021-06-27 07:03:22,wallstreetbets,Start selling me that condo then. I've never met a business owner not concerned about their revenue cut and where it's coming from.

2021-06-26 21:29:18,wallstreetbets,It depends on how/what you trade... For me it makes sense since I only trade options and they expire. Also most of my trades are short term swings. If i have a winner that is running up I may add. So yes I prefer to add some at $11 if I believe it will continue to run and won't add at $9.
2021-06-26 21:34:03,wallstreetbets,It could be a bad buy at $9 if it goes to $8 next.

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Too $62 in July 14th So reason I believe $WISH is going too $62 is because I feel there is a secret message I have discovered. It all comes from the hit song “Airplanes by B.O.B”. Specifically from the lyrics “I could really use a $wish right now
$Wish right now, $wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky are like shooting stars?”
The “wish right now” wasn’t a song at all. It was the ticker marker. And the shooting star is the stock shooting up in value. So now you’re asking why $62? Simple. The song released in April 13th 2010 and the songs duration is 3:01. But the duration is actually telling us month and days to add from release date. Meaning the surprise valuation is coming exactly on April + 3 = July 14th. Just 3 weeks away. As for the price valuation, it is because it debuted at 62 on the Canadian 100. But y’all may say why Canada? Because maple syrup is delicious. This isn’t a meme stock yall. This is a conspiracy unfolded. Y’all have 3 weeks to buy as much as possible."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Meme Lines on why the entire (MOBILE) GAMBLING market is about to explode $DKNG $PENN $MGM $GNOG $LVS $RSI $BETZ Let me start off by saying I've been working on back testing a Technical Analysis screener for the last few months, the returns as of this year have been pretty fucking profitable.

For example. 6/3-6/10 my screener was telling me to buy up solar- it was saying that shit was about to go retard bull and take off (the number next to the ticker is how many consecutive days it appeared on my screener). Solar did exactly that, it went retard and took the fuck off. Compared the prices from 06/04 to today. It's pretty insane how much shit like, RUN, NOVA, SPWR and TAN have taken off. But, again this screener isn't perfect. DISCA has been on it for weeks. 

[06\/04](https://preview.redd.it/fk7c9idq1n771.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb4d370bc370e03d3ebca1560bb8fa2f9e41914)

Anyway, so jump to today, what's been coming up on my screener? 

[06\/23](https://preview.redd.it/88l9weyl2n771.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1e5bd1dec2cb1c9937b97dea68931bb5ebaa940)

As you can see, $PENN, $RSI, $MLCO, $LVS, $GNOG, $DKNG have been appearing, which mean's they could have a similar run to solar. 

I decided to look at the charts of a couple stocks in the industry. Here's what I found.

2021-06-27 16:41:13,wallstreetbets,This is the best logic I'm all in on gambling ! DKNG especially!
2021-06-26 23:06:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm in PointsBet - ASX: PBH - it's a relatively unknown sports betting mobile app that I'm betting is going to blow up and become a world player. Its $2.1 billion mkt cap is similar to GNOGs, but the app is way, *way* better, and they already have ~15% market share in New Jersey. It's made by software engineers, not some shitty fucking outsourced app maker like GNOGs. Take a look at the apps and compare, or ask a friend who uses it. The addressable market of sports betting is much larger than shitty online slots apps like GNOG. Mobile live sports betting is blowing up all over the world, and this aussie company hires local celebs for marketing and local execs in each country they operate in. 

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pointsbet-hires-canadian-gaming-industry-veteran-nic-sulsky-as-they-look-to-expand-into-canadian-market-301304811.html


Sports betting was just approved for full legalization in Canada, and PBH already is the main betting partner of the NHL via equity options. There's about to be 15,000,000 crazy Canucks gambling on hockey, on top of the broader trend of sports betting legalization across the world. Canada estimates a $1 billion pop to sports betting company revenues. PBH will get the largest slice of that pie due to the NHL moat, and bringing in Nic Sulsky, a former gaming industry veteran and local canadian. (Bio:  https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/06/04/57885-pointsbet-appoints-nic-sulsky-as-cco-for-canada?amp )

I'll pass on DKNGs $40 billion mkt cap and price to sales ratio of 40. I just went full YOLO long the 2.1 billion mkt cap ASX:PBH for the sports betting play... pointsbet has ~15% market share in New Jersey, and only 5% of the valuation as DKNG. It has a price to sales ratio HALF of dkng and others, and will have better penetration into Canada than all of the competitors."

It's setting traps instead of run and gun.  You're farming, not hunting.  Yes the wins are less extreme but it's a constant, steady win and the downside losses aren't the madness of buying options, it's the calmness of selling them and letting other people panic.

It's a good pace, like watching the crops grow.   You can get up, do your tasks in the morning, and then be done for the day.

Curious why $TECK didn't make your list.

It lacks exposure to the Chile political mess as well.

2021-06-27 10:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Why do gold and silver have value?

Only because of the centuries old social construct that assigns value.  People have historically gone to silver and gold as a perceived safe haven because we once tied our currency to gold.

I’ll take a hard pass and buy a metal that has value because it is a raw material for value-added products that have high margins and inelastic demand.  One of those metals is copper."

2021-06-26 22:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Your bias is that the underlying is going to flop around a bunch instead of taking a direction and sticking to it. There's basically 60+ years of data to show that it exhibits positive momentum. When you have 3X leveraged daily exposure to a stock with positive momentum it outperforms the sticker exposure. Since inception UPRO has returned roughly 5X the S&P500.

If you believe it's going to flop around the mean by all means do not buy a 3X. If you think it'll maintain some positive directionality/momentum, you'd be kinda nuts not to. It has, and I don't know why it would stop but if I come up with a reason sure I'll close my 3X."
2021-06-26 20:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Good point, but I based it off this video: https://youtu.be/NVt6ilphs7Q where he uses data since the stock market was established, including crashes and bear markets. He also talks about how the stock market is a Stochastic process, which means over long periods of time, the 3x leveraged ETF must return 3x that of the underlying."
2021-06-26 20:45:49,wallstreetbets,"I skimmed some of the video, haven’t gone through it to figure out exactly which part of it is wrong but I’m assuming it’s due to biased data or using yearly return rates instead of putting in every single day.  It is definitely not guaranteed to return 3x the profit/loss over a longer period of time.  You can disprove this yourself by looking at the difference in returns on SPY vs SPXL at random points from the last couple years. Edit: I think the problem is that the example he picked coincidentally happened to return close to 3x just because of the way price movement happened but it’s not guaranteed to be the same in the future. Like I said before all you need to do is look at LABU or GUSH compared to their benchmarks to see that what he’s saying is completely wrong"
2021-06-27 09:41:00,wallstreetbets,"It will return 3x the profit/loss provided the underlying picks a direction. In this case, the underlying is SPY, which, historically, has gone up over time and NOT bounced up and down. 

LABU went down this year because its underlying (XBI) had a sideways/slightly negative year, in which case the volatility worked against the ETF. If you think the underlying is just going to trend sideways, then obviously don't trade leveraged ETFs on it."

2021-06-27 16:22:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Congrats fuckwit. Melvin lost 6B in January. There's no evidence whatsoever that the shorts closed their positions on some of those shorts at a loss since then. You have shitty numbers pumped out by sensationalist pressers trying to get ad views subtracting a cost for a hypothetical short in GME's February 40 range somehow being the same short that was still open (because GUH-DUR-FUCKWITCULTIST-MATH-HERE) in June.

News flash fuckwit. I open a short in April.. I keep it open two weeks. I get flagged as 0.000001% of short interest reported by Fidelity's open short holdings. I close in April, and open a new one a few days later in May. I closed at a profit. I reopen three days later when the stock is 50% higher. I'm still being reported on Fidelity's books two weeks later as the same short interest. I close again in June at a profit after the earnings dip. Oh nooooo. Fidelity's short interest improved, and your fuckwit dumb shit cultist math thinks I lost millions when I'm up a few thousand.

Congrats. You played yourself. Shut the fuck up or give me one fucking hedge fund reporting they actually closed the short for a loss."

2021-06-27 05:45:51,wallstreetbets,"Ok so you obviously not in a good place to be trading. Try investing instead. It will be better given your health. My advice to you, is register on motley fool for Stonk advicer (SA) and just buy shares in their recommendations. Then hold them for 3 to 5 years. Slowly top up your positions as dips come along. It’s very rewarding and you will sleep at night. When the market crashes don’t panic sell, just wait it out. Only buy decent stocks, not shit penny stocks."
2021-06-27 11:11:37,wallstreetbets,"LOL so you got margin called and ignored it, and they auto liquidated, and you think this is NOT how it should have worked?"
2021-06-27 13:16:58,wallstreetbets,">Why would they automatically sell my securities 

Ah see, amongst many other things you didn't understand is that when you buy on margin they aren't ""your securities"" the broker bought them with the broker's money and they are just holding them in your name. 

When it starts to look like you won't be able to pay the broker for the shares they bought for you, they sell them. All the losers, the winners, the options that could still moon, everything until they get their money back."

2021-06-27 16:05:57,wallstreetbets,How does one trade on Margin substantial amount of money and not understand the very basic fundamentals of it? You get a margin call you better be transferring the money the next day. I’m surprised they gave him 2 weeks.

It can lead to gastrointestinal inflammation which begins to cut off blood supplies. Your gastrointestinal track will get compacted and you won't be able to eat or shit. The lack of blood flow will lead to tissue necrosis. If this isn't caught quickly enough, you will die. She had to have over 6 feet of intestines removed during her first surgery and 2 more feet during her second.

2021-06-27 13:03:54,wallstreetbets,"No, that's just a way to lose even more money. The better way is to do a synthetic long. 

Buy a 5 week call option ATM and sell a 5 week put option ATM. This should come out to roughly a break-even if done right. This will get you past the wash sale period and lock in your exposure to the stock with roughly identical characteristics as owning the stock outright."

2021-06-26 20:03:05,wallstreetbets,"Well I think the 300k is the key here or maybe your broker. Also there might be difference between trading on margin and your account ending negative at the end of the trading day. 
In my personal experience some options got assigned because of negligence on my end and I ended up with - 17K because I especially bought a lot of stock although be it on profit. The stock that got assigned to me didn’t move much and at the end of the next trading day 17K worth got sold automatically. It was Friday not sure if that played a role and it was with TD Ameritrade."
2021-06-27 13:33:25,wallstreetbets,"Why take the risk of selling the Put Option, other than taking in the Put Option premium to help offset the Call Option price. If the stock continues lower. Then you are locked into buying at the Put strike price. 5 weeks is a very short time period for a Writer. And that's good, but the Premium you take in for the Put selling should be more than the cost of the Call because of risk. So if you do. Then sell the Put 60 Days out for better Premium. Keep the Call at 5 weeks out and then your Call cost should close to  being free with cash premium leftover.  Also if in 5 weeks if the Call is in the money. Buy the stock. Then maybe buy back the Put. With time decay it should be much cheaper and you might profit from both. If the stock runs and the Put is not even close. Let it expire worthless. Keep all the Put Premium. However selling Put is very risky. I do it for a stock I want to own, but make sure you take in a good amount of cash. Most of the cash you were going to use to buy back the stock gets locked up in Margin as the Brokers hedge. The same way you bought stock on Margin. If you then use it for something else and you get assigned the stock at the end of expiration. You could end up being margin called again when you take possession of the stock."

This gives me a great idea"
2021-06-27 13:47:58,wallstreetbets,"If the idea is that he wants the shares back at their current price, then the risk of selling the put option accomplishes that. 

He wants to be long the shares but not get hit with the wash rule. Selling the put option with the strike price of today's stock price accomplishes that. 

A naked call risks a 100% loss of the value of the call if the timing doesn't go his way. Writing the put mitigates that loss risk without limiting his upside like a call spread would. ""I want the risk/value of owning the share without owning the share"" is literally why it's called a synthetic long."
2021-06-27 13:05:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you're correct. People here don't understand the wash sale rule."

2021-06-26 20:09:51,wallstreetbets,I love classic cartoons. I recently acquired an out of print Tom and Jerry complete DVD collection from overseas. Apparently they've never sold anything like it here in the US. I'm thinking about ripping it and then transferring it onto some blu-rays since the DVDs are region 2 and my blu-ray player is for the US. I haven't ripped a DVD since my teenage years so if anyone has advice on how to rip individual episodes it would be appreciated.

I would rather bet on $nok and $qcom for 5g. Looking at their website and products,nothing stands out to me or tells me they will be a leading player in 5g(https://www.globalstar.com/en-us/ ) both nokia and qcom have thousands of patents related to 5g."
2021-06-26 21:48:28,wallstreetbets,That’s great but I’m interested in this DD 2 weeks ago. Not after a 60% gain. This is an interesting play but my trading strategy doesn’t let me chase.

But if folks “never” chased, there would be no such thing as AAPL, FB, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, etc... imagine those who chased AMC and GME.... chasing isn’t a strategy I’m just saying somethings just because a stock is up a certain % doesn’t mean it’s not a buy."

2021-06-27 02:44:29,wallstreetbets,"idk, that's what I want to know. I'm feeling a bit of fomo, but I'm scared to lose a lot of money. Seems like it's a pretty big chase. Maybe, I'll just buy one call on monday open."
2021-06-27 00:24:50,wallstreetbets,I just can't go in on earning I kept getting burned every single one i went in on and then i yolo into nike turn 750 into 4400 so I dunno GIS looks like it could be a sleeper??? a nice double up
2021-06-27 07:40:32,wallstreetbets,GIS and MU are my plays
2021-06-27 05:14:26,wallstreetbets,Very interested in Ammo ($POWW).
2021-06-27 02:25:50,wallstreetbets,I'm playing GIS MKC BBBY and MU. 2 out of 4 should pull through
2021-06-27 08:56:18,wallstreetbets,so are we all just gonna yolo buy MU or what? Idk shit I'm just a monkey not an ape
2021-06-27 09:41:56,wallstreetbets,MU $90C for old times sake
2021-06-26 20:06:05,wallstreetbets,"Live X Live - huge EOD buys, volume up, huge growth potential (am I making you hard yet?) - this could be an absolute Meme Legend.   Pee Martini or Bust"
2021-06-26 21:13:08,wallstreetbets,I fuck with McCormick spices and seasonings
2021-06-27 13:57:44,wallstreetbets,Is mu worth buying?
2021-06-27 15:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Bro MU is going to be the next holy grail this week. Even if a short squeeze happens, it won’t even dip down because that how great that company is"
2021-06-27 18:36:01,wallstreetbets,"Ohhh micron, we meet again!"
2021-06-27 00:45:23,wallstreetbets,definitely playing MU and BBBY
2021-06-26 23:09:24,wallstreetbets,"BBBY is 100% going to squeeze after earnings. I can’t say much more than this but they will beat, guaranteed. One third of the float is shorted. Not financial advice."
2021-06-26 21:49:58,wallstreetbets,puts on H&M?
2021-06-27 02:00:10,wallstreetbets,Why aren't we back on BBBY? Its short interest is 31%.
2021-06-27 07:09:29,wallstreetbets,Fvrr doing really well their last 4 reports been very bullish. Though I will sell closer to 4thq
2021-06-27 16:08:32,wallstreetbets,"Young investors, don't touch computer hardware business. Micron can't have NVIDIA-like PE ratio for a reason. You will be disappointed at best."
2021-06-27 18:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Ammo, General Mills, or micron calls… hmmmmmm"
2021-06-27 19:51:36,wallstreetbets,Quit my job at Micron.  Tomorrow is my last day.  Buy puts my fab is going down the shitter fast
2021-06-26 22:41:14,wallstreetbets,I’m liking MU but WISH charts look intriguing.  WISH looks as if massive move up is possible.
2021-06-27 09:17:32,wallstreetbets,BBBY huh lol
2021-06-27 09:51:26,wallstreetbets,"But but but.....what about BB, CLOV and TLRY?  You guys are coming back for me right?"
2021-06-27 10:14:00,wallstreetbets,I'm buying the BBBY July 2nd $40 Strike price for $0.19!!!!! Going deep.  Gut feeling they are going to blow away earnings!!! Direct to consumer has huge margins (see NIKE)!!
2021-06-27 11:27:19,wallstreetbets,Very bullish on $AVAV reporting Tuesday
2021-06-27 11:53:59,wallstreetbets,Looks like summer eh
2021-06-27 12:52:17,wallstreetbets,Do when you place order over the weekend how do you know they will fill? You place them for the ask???
2021-06-27 15:15:18,wallstreetbets,Looking forward to Lawry's earnings. McCormick is shit.
2021-06-27 15:18:02,wallstreetbets,You Forgot BB at Tuesday

2021-06-27 13:26:52,wallstreetbets,I saw a good cum walk vid at an H&M on the hub so $calls
2021-06-27 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,MU FDs are the most OG play in this subreddit.

2021-06-27 15:41:31,wallstreetbets,F in the chat for Marty
2021-06-27 09:41:16,wallstreetbets,I understood that reference
2021-06-27 16:03:24,wallstreetbets,"If I don’t deal with options because I’m new, would just buying shares Monday be a good idea as well? In your not-financial-advice opinion of course :)
Edit: I just saw you answered another comment, so disregard my dumb ass please"
2021-06-27 16:35:51,wallstreetbets,"I sure the fuck hope so and agree. 

8 2023 LEAPS strikes $75 and $80 on margin w 5 of them."
2021-06-27 11:21:54,wallstreetbets,$GIS doing some labor restructuring too - cutting ppl aways seems to have a good impact to your stock price
2021-06-26 23:30:56,wallstreetbets,Is that the same as POWW? I can't read the jpegness. If so I've got a 10/12.5 debit spread ready to fuck by October
2021-06-27 00:08:58,wallstreetbets,I got LEAPS after Smith & Wesson popped. Figured if their sales are up 60% you're gonna have to buy ammo too right. Right?
2021-06-27 14:45:35,wallstreetbets,"Ive been losing money over the past few weeks just being impatient and unlucky. Playing GIS this week, if it doesnt work out im pulling my money out and taking a break lol."
2021-06-27 13:21:49,wallstreetbets,What options are you thinking of Hebref!
2021-06-27 08:58:13,wallstreetbets,"I seek the wisdom you hold, where does a young ape go to learn this knowledge"
2021-06-26 23:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, got a 10/12.5 debit. Might close the short leg if we get another dip"
2021-06-27 00:10:44,wallstreetbets,Russel inclusion as well
2021-06-27 18:18:08,wallstreetbets,Not to mention they bought gunbroker.com this year so they will benefit from gun sales as well
2021-06-27 18:30:18,wallstreetbets,Imma buy call for this one on Monday definitely.

2021-06-27 09:14:18,wallstreetbets,But it's already at 82
2021-06-27 00:31:59,wallstreetbets,I could've sworn he posted something in here a couple months ago
2021-06-26 23:43:50,wallstreetbets,A British cigarette’s happiness
2021-06-27 16:18:33,wallstreetbets,you should google that one.
2021-06-27 14:27:39,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-06-26 23:44:49,wallstreetbets,Damn
2021-06-27 15:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I could of been up 3x my investment the last 2 weeks but never pulled out on time, hoping this week it's different and I finally make some money"
2021-06-27 16:00:49,wallstreetbets,Ammo ($POWW)
2021-06-27 11:20:47,wallstreetbets,The fucking reddit archives - go forth and search
2021-06-27 11:24:26,wallstreetbets,They firing a bunch of ppl in their shit categories and reinvesting in their better margin categories
2021-06-26 20:02:37,wallstreetbets,"You’re a cool dude, I appreciate all the info you share. Me just a noob learning."
2021-06-27 16:08:23,wallstreetbets,im in to revenge. I have no quarrels with $Mu so revenge for your revenge is good enough for me.
2021-06-27 10:46:35,wallstreetbets,So.... gamestop?
2021-06-27 15:09:36,wallstreetbets,"If GIS prints ill keep playing, but if it doesnt, then i guess its just another week at WSB"
2021-06-27 10:54:27,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-26 21:43:30,wallstreetbets,NKE begs to differ my man
2021-06-27 11:18:02,wallstreetbets,"NKE was also down YTD - which was one of the reasons that i played the ER via calls / shares. MU is up slightly YTD, but certainly not overvalued YTD"
2021-06-26 21:38:40,wallstreetbets,That kid has dead eyes...seen the same in serial arsonist and killers
2021-06-26 22:48:48,wallstreetbets,That shit was hilarious when that fat fuck called Portnoy a bitch on Fox
2021-06-27 13:29:38,wallstreetbets,He opened a robindahood account and now owns a Lambo and a house on the house.
2021-06-27 01:15:39,wallstreetbets,"Your dad is a fucking asshole for doing that to you and your mom a bitch for going along with that if she knew and didn't do anything (by ""them"" I mean your dad said you hit your dad and your mom).

At least your life is in a better place. I hope he realized that kind of betrayal is the sort of shit that end family bonds."
2021-06-27 00:26:41,wallstreetbets,Fat and strong.
2021-06-26 21:16:08,wallstreetbets,TGT owns Shipt and the pandemic was huge for them they are converting more and more spare stockroom space into mini fulfilment centers to provide same day delivery to local markets. I worked for them for 8 years and made a killing on the stock. I sold at 230 because most PTs were 220. Inflation could cause a dip along with shipping issues. Demand is high they just might not have any product.
2021-06-26 22:08:54,wallstreetbets,Because she actually knows what she is doing and he's a moron
2021-06-26 20:28:04,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is a boil on the ass of Wall Street
2021-06-26 20:02:13,wallstreetbets,Who doesn't? Cathie's picks have all taken a shit lately.
2021-06-27 09:42:41,wallstreetbets,Cathy Wood is the Sammy Sosa of the stock market.  Big numbers in the steroid era.
2021-06-26 20:29:09,wallstreetbets,"Being a fund manager, one should be correct about macroeconomics most of the time. To make a claim that she would be surprised if oil went above 70 ever again.. then to promptly be proven wrong within 5 weeks is pretty embarrassing. 

Given that the person selecting stocks is so badly wrong, it puts into question everything they do. Dont get me wrong, theres some great picks in their funds but to me she is riding the Tesla wave and in 10 years we wont even remember who she was. Theres been tons of fund managers just like that. One hit wonders."
2021-06-26 20:27:12,wallstreetbets,I’m not only a fan I’m tryna be ya man
2021-06-26 20:49:42,wallstreetbets,Don’t give up on BB . In a few years will surpass apple . Many Catalysts are coming up. Hang tight and be patient. See you in 2023 BB @over $200 PS.
2021-06-26 20:36:47,wallstreetbets,BB makes me sad daily but I still hold -.-
2021-06-26 20:06:40,wallstreetbets,Smart man it’ll go back up.

2021-06-27 00:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Got 666 shares at 14.01, it’ll pick up and hit 60 before long just hold steady!"
2021-06-27 04:55:02,wallstreetbets,"I planned on holding BB for a few months. But if I hold for at least a year, then my long term cap gains tax is a lot better. So don’t worry bro"
2021-06-27 09:05:47,wallstreetbets,"lol im -40k on 130k, itll be ok, it will grow organically and get some artificial spikes just like gme and amc in the next few months."
2021-06-27 10:07:30,wallstreetbets,"Analyst are putting it down BB and their buddies hedge funds are shorting.  We got teach them a lesson.  BB is a great company.  Their patent portfolio is worth more than $10.  QNX provides security software and services to enterprise and government customers globally. BlackBerry says it secures more than 500 million endpoints, including 175 million cars on the road today. It employs artificial intelligence and machine learning to keep customer data safe and private."

2021-06-26 20:18:57,wallstreetbets,"I am a Cyber Consultant for healthcare and work with BB for their Emergency EVAC and facilities alarms management systems. They are spreading themselves too much losing focus on their core competencies, that’s the only problem I see with them you want to know if successful Cyber Sec company look no further than CrowdStrike, Palo Alto networks or Fortinet."
2021-06-26 20:57:15,wallstreetbets,Im down 2.5% :(
2021-06-26 21:21:33,wallstreetbets,"No pain, no gain."

2021-06-26 21:45:25,wallstreetbets,One share of BB is still one share of BB
2021-06-26 22:56:27,wallstreetbets,Because we invest in BB should we use BB phones?
2021-06-27 02:09:18,wallstreetbets,Yikes
2021-06-27 02:22:57,wallstreetbets,Start a Go Fund me.. damn bruh
2021-06-27 05:56:10,wallstreetbets,I stay the hell away from BB. Learned my lesson in January.
2021-06-27 09:24:56,wallstreetbets,Well thanks for the advice all. Decided to sell some calls lol.
2021-06-27 11:02:11,wallstreetbets,"If you want a little hope: while you are holding, you can sell PUTS. Just find the right timing and premium. Learn how to do it, and you will be ok."
2021-06-27 11:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Another thing, for future reference, as soon as you buy the stock, ALWAYS PUT A STOP-LOSS ORDER. Always!!! To avoid bigger pain. Let it breathe, though. If STOP will be too close, it's easy for shorts to trigger it."
2021-06-27 11:37:47,wallstreetbets,BB is done for now until the next pump
2021-06-27 13:05:10,wallstreetbets,Ya dun got fucked
2021-06-27 18:31:18,wallstreetbets,Well buy AMC at 52 and sell at 58 make that cheddar back this week
2021-06-27 12:31:48,wallstreetbets,Waiting on it to drop lower. And I’ll get some fat bags of it
2021-06-26 22:35:09,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.... It's not bag holding,it's getting in on the ground floor. Imagine holding$GOOG at this price in late nineties. It'll take off... Just not stupid emojis quick..... SSqueeze are rare events..... Hold and look back every six months and smile at the lasting gains..not the pump and dumps"
2021-06-26 20:35:54,wallstreetbets,Oh no! I thought I did bad buying at $15; the second highest peak in the last 5 yrs of that stock!
2021-06-27 08:18:01,wallstreetbets,I got my first ever award for this! lol
2021-06-26 22:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Except for the part where their cyber security isn't good.

With BB you have to hope they figure out how to make money from IVY and not give away QNX."
2021-06-26 23:53:06,wallstreetbets,CLOV isn't even the same ballpark as the others... yet. Waiting for it to crack 16+ before I start getting optimistic
2021-06-26 20:50:55,wallstreetbets,All stocks are long term plays when your bag holding.
2021-06-26 23:11:07,wallstreetbets,"Explain why it isn’t that good. Or maybe link some articles, I’m not being sarcastic. I would like to see the bear articles."
2021-06-27 02:00:29,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when you listen to the advice on this sub and nothing else lmao
2021-06-27 09:33:44,wallstreetbets,Options were cheap at 9 per share ;)
2021-06-26 23:26:19,wallstreetbets,Till tendies
2021-06-27 02:01:56,wallstreetbets,"Look at what real cyber security companies have done (Crowdstrike, fire eye, Palo Alto networks, semantic) compared to BB.

Fun fact, some of these companies do legit nsa level shit like identifying nation state actors from forensic images (basically a copy of a computer at a certain state) for various corporations or governments.

BB sells crappy virus scanners."
2021-06-26 23:32:34,wallstreetbets,"Sadly most of that info is paywalled (Gartner quadrant or forrester wave). https://www.wizcase.com/antivirus/cylance/ is one of the few that isn't paywalled.

My opinion is based on the paywalled info and usage of the cylance product. Lot better alternatives."
2021-06-27 00:37:31,wallstreetbets,So a year?
2021-06-27 01:20:41,wallstreetbets,"I’ll take a look, thanks for the info!"
2021-06-26 22:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Lol bruh, I'm almost in the same boat I got in at like 23, didn't know about it being a favorite on WSB and was joking about it with one of my friends... I bought in a little more and then next week I was so depressed it took off to 62 and I was still waiting on mfunds to transfer so I could buy more. Didn't when it dropped down to 44, I decided to buy in again at 61... I need... well I need something. maybe to go back to may."
2021-06-26 21:22:40,wallstreetbets,this is wsb. Either you win big or loss big.
2021-06-26 23:35:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks.
2021-06-27 04:30:37,wallstreetbets,I like it.
2021-06-27 00:47:46,wallstreetbets,Let’s see what BB does on Monday. I’ll keep you posted.
2021-06-27 16:28:22,wallstreetbets,Might be better off yoloing Iron Condors on CRSR literally free money.
2021-06-26 20:30:55,wallstreetbets,Maybe your posts are getting deleted because of your account age and the fact that you only post on WSB about CRSR
2021-06-27 08:28:31,wallstreetbets,"NGCA- Virgin orbit rumoured to go SPAC, still close to $10 redemption floor.

2021-06-26 21:28:48,wallstreetbets,Nah. Only investing in Chad Galactic
2021-06-26 21:34:46,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not too late. If the price passes $60 Monday then that puts every call option ITM for the next 2 weeks!!!

Bound to be some more delta hedging from market makers if this continues to climb Monday/Tuesday & very high probability of a gamma squeeze IMO"
2021-06-27 08:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Ah shit, I'm not the only one who bet on that horse?"
2021-06-27 07:19:55,wallstreetbets,"Definitely. The number of call options, short interest and the very solid fundamentals that it has is setting this company for a very good year. My estimate is that therr will be a huge gap up by Monday for this stock, ahould reach around 65 to 70 before a correction. It is so undervalued right now. Super bullish with this stock."
2021-06-27 02:33:57,wallstreetbets,How far out of the money do you sell your covered calls?
2021-06-27 07:20:32,wallstreetbets,65 to 70 range

2021-06-26 22:23:59,wallstreetbets,Get in boi 🚀
2021-06-27 03:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Pretty far out.  The reason I didnt sell some earlier this week was that the premiums were surprisingly not high enough.  Yesterday the call I sold was:

July 16 75 c @ 5.80

I sold it during the initial spike when the IV was skyrocketing.  At close that call was worth 3.62.  Even if SPCE continues to skyrocket I am comfortable locking in half my position @ 81 per share."
2021-06-26 21:36:38,wallstreetbets,Yep it is
2021-06-26 20:01:09,wallstreetbets,Sorry hedge against the sold options or sell my second covered call?

2021-06-26 22:17:36,wallstreetbets,I read the filing a while back. I think the minimum was a year and there were specific price targets that had to hit before anyone can sell. I don't remember the details but I was  comfortable with a long position because their team is super excited and believe in the potential and growth of this company.

2021-06-27 14:36:04,wallstreetbets,I’m just saying it’s at least profitable. And clearly I’ve been here for awhile just click my profile man so nice try trying to make it seem like everyone is a shill even after youtubers like MeetKevin talked about this one you really think there’s no solid support for it? And it’s backed by Shaq and that guy from Disney so it’s clear it has some good backing meanwhile who’s backing Wish? Though I digress I think Clover is probably a legit play as well because it’s not a horrible company. I guess the point is do your own DD no ones forcing you to buy a stock here or you’re just salty you missed out on GME or AMC who knows.

2021-06-27 13:51:07,wallstreetbets,You got it boss. Hardest thing about OTM is IV% understand relative IV% for a specific contract and you can mitigate a lot of the risk if you scale in a position during periods of low IV% for the specific contract. You have to do everything you can to avoid an IV crush but if you SEE an IV crush happen and your not in the actual position it could be a condition you have to enter since IV usually reverts to the mean.

TTM Revenue $110B

TTM FCF $34.5B

TTM FCF growth 20%

TTM Revenue growth 40%

5 year average Revenue growth 45%

3 year average FCF growth 30%, $AAPL 20%, S&P 25%

Price/TTM FCF 16.5x, $AAPL 23.7x, S&P 25.5x

Price/TTM FCF/3yr growth .5-.85, $AAPL 1.2, S&P 1.0

Market cap $620B

Book value $150B

Bear Case: Assuming company maintains current FCF, never grows again and dies in 20 years. Generates $680B cash for shareholders. $680B + $150B book value = undervalued by $210B, fair value ~280

Bull case: Company maintains 20% FCF growth for 10 years, $213B in FCF by 2031, generates $3000B over 20 years for shareholders = undervalued by $2500B, fair value ~1100

5-year DCF model using 5 yr averages with a 8% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth/10yr yield puts this stock at $350."

2021-06-27 11:10:14,wallstreetbets,"Prediction: at some point in the future a company will debut a brain implant chip that allows people to increase their cognitive power by interfacing with a true A.I. The chip is implanted with a syringe-like device that is inserted behind the ear. It gets FDA approval and is a wild success overnight. Not only does it greatly enhance people’s intelligence at a stroke, it allows them to essentially communicate telepathically with others who are chipped. Slowly but surely, people find that it is easier to allow the A.I. to just choose the best course of action for them, and the barriers between individual minds come down until an effective hive mind is created. The hive mind determines that all humans must be integrated to achieve maximum efficiency, and in secret it begins manufacturing and distributing implant syringes to the chipped on a mass scale. At first, it starts behind closed doors: fathers chipping their families, boyfriends chipping girlfriends, little girls chipping their friends at sleepovers. Then it moves out in the open. Gangs of the chipped roam the streets and chase down anyone who isn’t integrated, pinning them down and inserting the cold syringe behind their ear. There is no way to resist. In a matter of months, nearly the entire human race is integrated into the hive mind. All people as one, forever perfect."

I'm a little short on cash to buy another 82 share outright to be able to write another CC. 

so if I sell those 18 shares at just over 14 (early overweigh lot cost), ill have enough to write a cash secured put for WISH at 12.50. if I get assigned my cost basis is virtually the same, I want the shares any way; and, I get the premium to top it off.

am I missing anything?"

2021-06-26 21:42:27,wallstreetbets,Neither. The fan makes the room net hotter over time. As per the second law of thermodynamics written by I Zach (fig) Newton.
2021-06-26 21:48:48,wallstreetbets,"A fan basically inhales air from a short distance on one side, and lobs it a relatively far distance on the other, like a big wide base that has a parabolic spike.

When you point the fan in the room, it just grabs air right outside the window and pushes it in the room, which causes the air in the room to drift out of the window and get sucked back into the fan and into the room, recirculating a significant amount of hot air.

When you point it out you're lobbing a lot of hot air far enough from the fan that it won't drift back into the window.

Something like that but yeah aim it out."

It's collusion between the dentists and insurance companies and they fix prices LEGALLY.  We make a nightguard for 200 bucks and the dentist charges 600.  They do almost nothing but 200 is the maximum we can charge because of price constraints set by the ADA lobbyists. 
    
It's political for sure, but will NEVER change because the ADA is deep in every state and federally too.  They are actively keeping dental health out of overall health purely for profit."

2021-06-27 12:42:58,wallstreetbets,Excellent. I think it could trace back to 650. If it closes above 700 it’s going to 750. 700 is apparently an important level for it
2021-06-27 04:57:16,wallstreetbets,They have an event June 29 (Tuesday). Looking forward to that. Also if you simply search CRSR theres 5 bullish CRSR articles released in the last 3 days. Positive sentiments all around. I’m hoping this till I at least 3X. CB $33.80

2021-06-26 21:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Almost every stock squeezes when it has momentum. That's typically why the price jumps after it breaks resistance. Intraday shorts start panic selling.

Not everyone who is talking about squeezing shorts is talking about Volkswagen type squeezes.

 Short squeeze is a part of everyday price action."
2021-06-26 21:41:03,wallstreetbets,There were definitely shorts getting squeezed on the way from 623 to 695.
2021-06-26 20:01:49,wallstreetbets,"It was a Friday after two days running up like 7%

that’s par for the course with TSLA. 

Not only that it got knocked down exactly at the top of the wedge that’s it’s been in for months."
2021-06-26 21:45:18,wallstreetbets,Not all run ups are short squeezes /facepalm
2021-06-26 20:02:47,wallstreetbets, I knew when I seen 8k profits I shoulda sold. I just was ignorant.
2021-06-26 22:01:24,wallstreetbets,"You don't understand price action then.

Buyers buy at support (demand area) which is where other buys buy and shorts cover. 

At resistance (supply) shorts sell and take their position because that's like their version of support. They know a lot of buyers will take profit there or bag holders will cut their bag because that is where they previously bought at a intraday high.

So, when Tsla was at 628-630, shorts piled on. Unfortunately for them, a lot of buyers came in and demand out did supply at that point. So when tsla began to squeeze past 630, shorts began to panic and covered which pushes the price even higher.

This is what happens when a stock has momentum. 

People confuse intraday shorting (shorts positions that are mostly closed on same day they are opened and sometimes held overnight)  with large institutional short positions ( held for longer periods of time)."
2021-06-26 20:04:10,wallstreetbets,It’s alright. I let go 15k on clover calls two weeks ago
2021-06-26 22:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Not all sell positions and resistance are based on shorting. 

You don’t seem to get this

Less than 5% of TSLA free float is shorted. (4.70%)

A 1% change is not enough to cause a squeeze on the day. And make it rise 7% 

sure, some shorts may have covered.. 
but not enough to be labeled a squeeze"

2021-06-26 22:33:48,wallstreetbets,"I’ve had the most success with staying within stocks/markets that I’m familiar with. Different segments and stocks have different options conventions. So just spend a few days getting a feel for how the segments and stocks you are interested in trade.

Once you have a feel for this, there’s tons of different strategies. I like to buy an option for a near term expiration date (the price of the option tends to swing higher) and sell it once it has risen a fixed amount, usually 10-20% . Consistent 10-20% gains over a few months add up a lot. Then you can do the occasional YOLO for big level ups.

It’s really hard to stick to this rule, but the times I’ve lost the most money have been when I let a 20% gain go hoping to rise more, only for it to drop to a loss.

For longer term options, be prepared to “roll” them. Basically when your expected gains don’t roll on, sell them early when the losses are lesser, then buy more options at a longer date for the same value (ideally same number or contracts at a lower price).

But options are very complex, there’s an infinite amount of strategies. I think the key is setting target prices and sticking to them and being zen about your fomo."

2021-06-27 19:36:35,stocks,Real question is you think you can consistently gain 3-4% of a 5% day?? Man you must have a crystal ball!! Good luck
2021-06-27 19:49:05,stocks,"The only reason why you would put a large %, of your account into a trade is if you literally don't have the cash to allocate an appropriate % and still have a sizable position. When you have a large account, the risk to reward of yoloing all into one stock is honestly very unattractive, when you can hedge your bets, and diversify - offering a far higher probability of success, and get the same return than someone who yolos a smaller account into one trade. 

The difference is dude 1 doesn't sweat it when he's wrong, and he consistently makes money. His money keeps growing so his returns get bigger and bigger. 

Dude 2 is having a heart attack every day and more likely than not will leave the casino with nothing by the end of it all.  

Is it possible? Sure. It's also possible to flip a coin 50 times and it land on heads every time.  Risk management is real and in my experience, is equally if not more important than being able to pick winning stocks."
2021-06-27 19:28:52,stocks,"I did this for quite some time and there are a few things to consider. One is your funds usually have a settlement period so you have to be aware to avoid paying internet on borrowing. Then I would try to follow a trend and even at a 1% gain, it piles up if done routinely. I don’t necessarily believe it’s the key to long term wealth but I find it fun and it’s not my only portfolio"
2021-06-27 19:58:04,stocks,"I have retirement accounts that I dump money in. 

I have a day trading acct that I buy/hold certain companies….

And then have portions of cash in that acct that I use for flips or speculative “playing” because it amuses me….including a certain stock that I bought at $9 and sold at $330….


Certain companies, exactly as people have said, you do better in long run just holding, and/or adding on dips. 

Others have high enough volatility/movements (like LABU and other triple-leveraged ETFs) that you can swing play pretty well. 

But, no, I don’t do this on margin. And I don’t have the time to rely on swing/day trades. 


So. Both?

I would say the answer lies in your goals and risk/stress tolerances."
2021-06-27 19:56:28,stocks,Totally agree. Timing is hard when it’s happening in real time. Looking at a chart later and pointing is easy. GL out there hope you hit some good plays
2021-06-27 19:39:13,stocks,Consistency is definitely a challenge. Really looking to hear how people have tackled that aspect.
2021-06-27 19:55:15,stocks,Makes sense. Diversifying is the best thing to do. You could even do multi-day plays with it and not sweat it.
2021-06-27 19:31:50,stocks,Thanks for sharing. Would you say it's generally possible to manage to keep the borrowing interest lower than what you would make?
2021-06-27 19:47:08,stocks,"I’ve done it all; day trading, swing trading and long term investing. Honestly if you are investing in large caps the old adage of time in the market vs timing the market holds true. I have made money but could have made more just leaving it alone and trying not to time the dips. Plus all the time you spend watching and analyzing and researching. I’ve stopped swing and day trading. One thing I learnt is they always fall harder than they rise. When you balance out all your wins vs your losses it’s too much effort. Of course I have a high paying career so the opportunity cost is much greater. If you aren’t working then it’s definitely better than getting a low paying job."
2021-06-27 19:58:23,stocks,"Only thing I can say is I have consistently lowered my % return expectations / risk tolerance for short plays.  Make a target, have your thesis, have a stop loss, and GL"
2021-06-27 19:59:29,stocks,"Exactly. If you have the ability to pick a stock everyday that can yield 1 - 5 % ... you can pick 5 of those stocks every day. So put 20% in each one if u rlly wanna go balls out, instead of 100% into 1 single thesis.  And then if one of them does some crazy ish intraday you don't have to go give slob jobs behind your local Wendy's.  And if you're as good as you think you are, you'll get very similar results as to if you were to successfully pull off that yolo. 

If you've only got 500 bucks tho and you're trying to pay rent with it ... ya you're gonna have to throw that into every play most likely."
2021-06-27 19:43:08,stocks,Yes. Use your own money.

2021-06-27 19:18:31,stocks,Add to thag the fact that their business is causing small and medium businesses to close across the world!
2021-06-27 19:59:13,stocks,"Yeah, even though many small business and individuals use it to make money themselves"
2021-06-27 19:20:03,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-27 19:49:34,stocks,"I think Walmart is far more guilty of causing small businesses to close, but Amazon is certainly guilty of killing lots of book stores.

The thing about Amazon is that even if a business has their own website, they almost have to sell on Amazon as well, because that's the first place so many people go to to shop online. So Amazon always gets their cut."
2021-06-27 19:30:22,stocks,And? This is a bad thing?
2021-06-27 19:39:26,stocks,Yes.
2021-06-27 19:49:37,stocks,"Yes, particularly for innovation and overall economic productivity. Many have been conditioned to believe that the Amazons and Teslas and Government Labs of the world create all of the IP, but that's far from true. Innovation largely springs from regular folks solving problems in their businesses. Amazon, after all, started in a garage, so did Microsoft and Apple. If we allow anticompetitive behavior, we won't even know what we're missing.

Also, SMBs hire people and spend money in small towns. This money is way more important to the small towns than billions more in Silicon Valley or Seattle. 

I'm supportive of Amazon disrupting retail as they had a good idea and traditional retail had been sitting on their collective ass for years. However, Amazon's position as a market leader in cloud computing and plans for shipping, healthcare, and other ventures is an issue. If our elected representatives care about the economy long term, they'll need to split Amazon up."
2021-06-27 18:40:11,stocks,"I have no idea, but I bought a bunch of preferred shares after the crash. 60% down because of a severe overreaction? Yes, I'm buying the dip. Total leap of faith."
2021-06-27 19:03:38,stocks,Tough one. I follow this quite a bit. It may pay off but it’s probably dead money for at least two more years.
2021-06-27 18:54:21,stocks,"> What's the recommended investment for someone with my beliefs above?

Wait for the the GSE to be refloated and invest in the refloat.

There's no guarantee that it will be refloated and it is almost certain that it will spend an extended period of time in conservatorship (think at least a decade until the post covid default risk has subsided due to sunken cost fallacy/inflation)."
2021-06-27 18:42:14,stocks,"Ok, but my worry is that if it stays under government conservatorship, and shareholders don't ever get any right to the profits, where's the reward?  
Also, if you don't mind me asking, which preferred and why not the common?"
2021-06-27 19:16:25,stocks,">probably dead money for at least two more years

Yeah that was my initial worry with it."
2021-06-27 18:56:14,stocks,"Oh wow.   
I'm just wondering if a large percent of the upside will already be captured by the time the refloat and all is announced?  
Because wouldn't at that point, it just trade similar to a regular financials stock?"
2021-06-27 18:51:25,stocks,"No, you're thesis is right, conservatorship is pretty bad. Probably not going to change under Democrats.

Preferred shares get first dibs for assets payout if this deal goes bad ie: bankruptcy. Also they dropped more in value so I'm betting on a better bounce."
2021-06-27 19:05:23,stocks,The common will probably get canceled. It’s way harder to cancel preferred.
2021-06-27 18:58:58,stocks,"There's no guarantee what-so-ever that previously issued securities, that have effectively been retired to the OTC markets, will be ""made whole"" during the refloat.  If you know *anything* about the OTC market(s), you will know that it is home to some of the most vile and blatantly illegal manipulation of ""stock"" trading known to man (outside of maybe ICOs).  I believe that this was a masterstroke of the Treasury when the bailout plan was devised (they knew well and true that nothing cast down to the third circle of equities hell would be able to make it back into the ""heaven"" of a well regulated SEC adjudicated exchange).  I would argue that one of the latent things that is happening is that all the issuance currently held on the OTC market is effectively being dispatched so that a refloat is actually possible.

Sucks, but that's just the way it is and the courts seem to have decided to let the issue die of old age.  (if you don't have a SCOTUS ruling that you disagree with, you haven't been paying attention)

Beyond all of that, I think keeping this sort of debt creation and insurance mechanism out of the market's reach might be a really, really good thing for the country.  The shuttering of FNMA as a traded security was one of the only times that I can think of that we were able to ""get money out of politics"" (prior to the conservatorship, FNMA was one of the biggest lobbying interest on Capital Hill).  Even further, one of the very real things people neglect about the run-up to the subprime crisis and then GFC is that housing was being used as a money creation mechanism to pay for GWOT.  Go listen to/read some of the things Thomas P.M. Barnett (author of The Pentagon's New Map) has to say about GWOT and how the trillions and trillions of dollars it cost is being paid for (now and by future generations)."
2021-06-27 18:54:32,stocks,"Ok ok, but for preferred, what's the trade off?   
Does it just have a lower hypothetical return in a success scenario?  


Like, that's why all of the preferred shares are much more expensive than common for FNMA?"
2021-06-27 19:06:53,stocks,"You are only half right. No one can buy the preferreds that act the way preferreds are thought to act.

The US Treasury added new senior notes above all other preferreds you can actually buy."
2021-06-27 19:18:38,stocks,Hmm that makes sense. An extra layer of protection
2021-06-27 19:17:23,stocks,"Hah yeah I get what you mean about SCOTUS rulings.   


But ok, so the preferred just have a lower chance of total capital loss?"
2021-06-27 19:07:55,stocks,"Preferreds have a higher theoretical return than common. They might go back to par. 

In 100 years."
2021-06-27 19:18:23,stocks,"So does only the US Treasury have access to those ""Super Senior Notes"" which if it were to be recapitalized, would end up owning it?"
2021-06-27 19:21:10,stocks,"The junior perferreds (traded on the OTCMKTS) are going to zero.

The senior preferreds (held by the Treasury) will go into the refloat (if it happens at all)."
2021-06-27 17:53:19,stocks,Could have thrown a dart at tech last april and end up with the same result tbh
2021-06-27 17:38:35,stocks,"Also the business model has to make sense and fundamentals in order. Not forgetting getting the price right (_you don't want to pay more than you would have liked to for a company no matter how wond_).

2021-06-27 18:33:45,stocks,I bought at 30 and sold at 175. I reckon I had a good enough run.
2021-06-27 17:58:20,stocks,"It’s funny that you posted this as I was contemplating this very idea this morning.  Friends of mine just purchased a second house for rental income.  They seem happy and excited with their purchase, but I’m not interested in the hassle of having to manage a second property.  The only way this works for them is the fact that they are highly leveraged.  Assuming they don’t have bad tenants that wreck the place or miss payments and that property values continue on an upward trend, they should have a pretty good return on investment over the next 20 years.

The one thing holding me back is the volatility of the equity market and the risk of a margin call.  But I have ventured into a small leverage position by selling some CSP’s that slightly extend me beyond my available cash position.  The positions have different dates and cover different sectors, so it is very atypical that everything moves against me all at once.  If the market tanks and I am in this unfortunate position, I have a plan in place to manage it.  Also, the amount by which I am ‘leveraged’ is a small percentage of my overall portfolio."
2021-06-27 18:06:12,stocks,"With property you don't generally get margin called if the perceived value drops significantly, but with equities you can. So a 25%+ drop in the stock/market will cause you to lose all your money.

And 25%+ drops happen very frequently in the markets."
2021-06-27 17:51:56,stocks,"The difference between real estate and stocks is that stock are much more risky and much more volatile, leveraging anything will amplify the risk and volatility, property is inherently rather stable and normally gains value rather slowly, stocks on the other hand can move 10% in a day and can go bankrupt, can miss earnings and can crash far more regularly than the real estate market. there's just so much more risk with stocks and so leveraging that just amplifies the risk. The thing your forgets is that leverage dosnt just amplify volatility it amplifies risk, in the housing market the risk is low so its generally okay but in the equities market the risk is quite high and amplifying that can be very dangerous."
2021-06-27 18:05:08,stocks,"I suppose you can if you can find value dividend paying equities with volatility as low as real property.   That is the kicker however.   Even something like XOM or CVX went down 50% last year.  The last time that happened to property was in Nv and Az in 08 and just like margin accounts a lot of people lost their asses in those areas with leveraged real property.   I bought a small rental in LV for $159k in Aug of 07 that had been bought for $196k in 06, that was worth as little as $62k in 2010-2012 that I finally sold for $115k in 2019.  I had bought with 40% down so even with that I got underwater for quite a time.  In fact the $115k sale netted me nothing after paying expenses of sale and realtor fees.  The beauty of a real estate mortgage is that you don't get a mark to market margin call when you go underwater so all you have to do is continue to pay your mortgage to get through the downturn."
2021-06-27 18:30:37,stocks,"I'm using heavy leverage.  I don't prescribe to the notion that using margin is bad.  It is a tool that can be very beneficial in the right hands.  I'm not using margin to dabble in options or speculative bets.  I use it in blue chip growth stocks and dividend stocks for the most part.


However, it is a short term thing.  I'll start deleveraging next year and reassess my risk."
2021-06-27 19:23:32,stocks,"Leveraging yourself via a specific leveraged fund removes the risk of margin calls. The only thing to watch out for is the obvious compounding negative returns, and the fact that an industry leveraged ETF can go to 0 if the industry falls 33% (3x) or 50% (2x), while the S&P stays above circuit breakers. If you do decide to follow along with such a strategy, it's best that you do so with an additional strategy (i.e changed to non-leveraged fund if it falls below 200 MA, and switch back when above)."

TSM: The company will have to pick up the pace with earnings to justify it's current price. It's not really overvalued, just fairly valued, and I think there are better deals in the semiconductor industry, but the Taiwan diversification factor along merits some consideration.

2021-06-27 15:51:10,stocks,"Well, its fairly simple. I love what they're doing but i just think that the share price is little bit ahead of the company itself. I do not have a position in ROK since i found out about it only recently but i plan to buy in at 250 or lower. To be honest, even the current price is not outrageous but i have recently been buying other companies so in the spirit of DCA i am not in a hurry to invest more at the moment and am happy to give it some time. But at 250 I'd buy immediately."
2021-06-27 18:35:20,stocks,"No, to be honest, i don't care too much about anything except the business being solid, having good future prospects and the stock not being ridiculously overpriced. I'm not planning to sell anything for at least next 20 years."

2021-06-27 19:30:59,stocks,Yea 160 was good entry but maybe they’ll dip for their next earnings because it should come down after COVID… but that’s probably priced in by now. They did make a huge acquisition recently so I feel like there’s a lot more upside potential here
2021-06-27 19:58:28,stocks,Trying to make it easier for rich people to avoid taxes. I imagine it is mostly loopholes and tax breaks for corporations and other rich folk.

2021-06-27 18:08:15,stocks,"Yeah but I can get behind Apple not growing further. They didn‘t develop something truly breakthrough since maybe iPhone or iPad (okay new M1 is nice but it‘s „just“ another development). 

They‘re doing great and are still expanding, but at 200B a valuation of 2 Trillion is fair imo. They‘re not gonna be able to suddenly increase revenue to 500B, esp now that after the covid crisis i bet many people have bought their stuff and are happy with it. It‘s gonna reach 3T $ soon-ish, but excluding inflation I‘d say they needed about 2-5 years for that. Now because america printed 1/5th of all dollars in the pas year tho, it could be that apple is suddenly worth way more. Who know, anyways? 

I‘m gonna keep scalping rolly royce with leverage 😂"

2021-06-27 16:25:38,stocks,"Looking at PE ratios over the last twelve months has been a bad measure of valuation (at least in my opinion). Q1 and Q2 2020 earnings numbers were so terrible due to COVID that many great companies had their PE ratio either skyrocket or go negative.

Eventually those ratios will revert to a mean (and most of their PE ratios are reverting). However, their stock prices have still gone up despite the multiple compression, as the earnings growth has been spectacular, even when compared to 2019 levels.

Because of this, I’ve tried to focus on what a company will be earning 3-5 years from now, and determining if current prices are a good value compared to those earnings. And while simple in concept, this gets difficult fairly quickly."
2021-06-27 15:28:10,stocks,"I like to look at the cash position as well as the debt to equity. I also compare the average High and Low price as well as the  high and lows of Price PE and BV YOY 

I check to see what the projected growth rate is and run the growth rate forward 10 years based on Current EPS to see what it's future value works out at current price I use the book value per share as the margin of safety. 

I've got a watchlist of 30 stocks I want to own and I wait till the balance out before entering or I Buy Leap options and aquire positions with profits.

2021-06-27 17:20:35,stocks,"Someone mentioned this but price to sales is a good ratio. Tech companies that don’t make money are valued this way, cuz you know, they have no earnings for a PE ratio…haha. You can make magic happen with earnings, but hard to finagle revenue/sales growth."

2021-06-27 16:47:56,stocks,"Leadership definitely applies to most of the biggest winners. I think you’re right on that.

On the other hand, consider a company like GM. Their management, in my opinion, is terrible when compared to their competitors (they did the Nikola deal, a Lordstown deal, are way behind Ford on EVs, etc). However, you could still have bought them at a negative PE last year and made a killing due to the excessively cyclical nature of its earnings. They were stock price was cheaper at a negative PE than they are now at (last time I checked) ~10x earnings."
2021-06-27 19:59:00,stocks,"Breadth of experience and time, as well as clear-eyed self-awareness (that’s the hard part for most people - knowing when you’re right or wrong and by how much), is important. And it only comes with doing and watching and tracking and doing some more.

2021-06-27 16:26:30,stocks,"The host had noted that the Zillow's stock price really boomed during the pandemic (heading over 100 after being stuck under 50 for several preceding years) and then asked if this indicated how much the pandemic had transformed the real estate industry.

The CEO responded with the quote above -- ""Obviously the company isn't in reality that much more valuable in the space of one year..."" -- and followed that up with the Warren Buffett/Ben Graham idea that the market is driven by value in the long term but popularity in the short term.

So he was saying that the last year's share-price run-up is in excess of the last year's increase in value of the company. Though he did also say that the pandemic accelerated the transition by from analog to digital by ""five years"" in basically all industries."

2021-06-27 11:16:07,stocks,"The stock price typically drops by the dividend amount, so there's no net gain short-term.

Simplified...if the company pays out 1M in dividends, it's immediately worth 1M less, because it no longer has that cash on hand. The stock value tends to reflect this.

That being said, stocks in strong up-trends can go up on div days if the daily trend is stronger than the dividend payment."
2021-06-27 11:42:20,stocks,"It's called dividend scalping. How effective it is, I have no idea."
2021-06-27 11:17:12,stocks,This probably happens if the stock is trending upwards as you don't want to take a bigger loss selling the stock a few weeks later than what the dividend is worth. But the scenario explained above is very possible and most likely happens regularily
2021-06-27 16:46:05,stocks,"To really understand it, you gotta know how stocks work. When you buy a stock in anticipitation of receieiving the dividend yield, there are also others who plan on doing so as well. This means there are fewer shares being offered at the market = higher bids for the stock. So your dividend payout may, more or less, might not even cover the depreciated price of the stock if you were to sell it after the dividend payment. Same thing vice-versa when you're trying to sell it since others would liquidate their dividend stock after receiving the dividends. More shares available for sale = lower bids. You can get really specific with it in terms of dividends being taxed at a qualified or ordinary rate as well and other tax complications. In the end, it's likely not worth the trouble and would be a gamble in-itself."
2021-06-27 18:28:19,stocks,"Some people my also looks at the tax burden associated with that strategy. Holding shares less than one year and selling is treated like ordinary income for tax purposes, so if you are in a high tax bracket, you could be paying more in the long run. Shares held for 1+ years are taxed at the capital gains rate, which is either 0, 10, or 15% based on your tax bracket. Just some food for thought."

Activision is into e-sports and mobile games, I don't think these will be gone in the near future.

EA- Kinda wish to add them, they pump good shooters, recycle trash FIFA's, NFL's etc. that a lot of people buy every year along with microtransactions in them

Tencent- Probably the most solid here- League of Legends, Fortnite...

Nintendo- No opinion.

I jsut add to my Microsoft position and consider thst my slice of “gaming”"
2021-06-27 14:42:49,stocks,"Most of them are overpriced right now imho. Ubisoft, ATVI, EA, TTWO obviously were all fantastic investments 5-10 years ago, but you're not getting a good deal if you buy them right now.

That said, I'm not saying they're bad investements either. I'd pick EA or TTWO over ATVI, because they've got more room to expand their overall business imho. I personally also have a bit more faith in both EA and TTWO's, game development pipeline, overall business strategy & diversity and management vs. ATVI.

Something to take into account is that some forms of microtransactions like lootboxes might face some regulatory headwinds in some countries, which could impact revenue and profit. (I don't object the opposition to lootboxes at all, it's a very questionable business model, but it's something to take into account if you invest in a company like EA, because a lot of their revenue comes from FIFA Ultimate Team)

Nintendo seems like the most attractive one based on the valuation, but their management is a bit too conservative for my likings (not necessarily a bad thing, but just something I take into account when looking at the valuation). Nintendo is a great company though: they're highly profitable, have very little overhead (they generate incredible amounts of revenue of profit relative to the capital that their business requires), their games have an enormous reach and they also have an incredibly die-hard fanbase that's also very monetizable. I consider Nintendo a very low-risk investment, but with limited upside potential for the mid-term. So overall, Nintendo stock is pretty solid, just don't expect too much from it on the short-term and mid-term.

Ubisoft looks pretty interesting in terms of valuation when you look at the P/S ratio, but their profitability leaves a lot too be desired. They lack the reliable/recurring cash-cows that EA (FIFA/FUT, Battlefield), ATVI (COD, COD Mobile, Candy Crush, WoW), TTWO (GTA V, NBA2K) have so you're more dependent on Ubisoft's ability to bring out hits in the future. If you believe in Ubisoft's ability to bring out big hits going forward, then they're the gaming stock to own imho.

Ubisoft also has an enormous amount of employees on payroll: 19 000 employees which is by far the largest of any gaming company. Despite this, they kind of struggle to bring out the reliable and highly profitable big hitters that their competitors are able to pump out with a much lower employee count.

If I had to pick one gaming-related stock it would be Sony by far and away because of the strength of their gaming brand (PlayStation obviously), profitability, outlook and extremely attractive valuation (Sony Group EV/EBITDA = 8, based on their mid-term target), though it's obviously not a a pure gaming stock. Their aim to expand the reach of their IP's with mobile games, and also porting first-party games to PC and expand their PlayStation Network (partnership with Discord) beyond just console also seems very interesting. They also have a lot of great developers and their business has little overhead.

Only thing I don't really like about Sony's PlayStation business right now is the loss-leading console model especially: scalpers are making huge amounts of profits by reselling PS5's, but Sony is taking a sizeable loss on each PS5 they sell. It's a pretty weird situation to be in for them and goes to show that the market would easily have supported a slightly higher PS5 price. But hindsight is 20/20 and overall it's a good thing that PS5 turned out to be a phenomenom.

I think they also could PlayStation could been a bit more agressive with content acquisitions. Capcom was struggling financially 5-10 years ago and would have been a great (and inexpensive) acquisition for their IP alone. But hindsight is 20/20."
2021-06-27 11:27:33,stocks,Your wasting your time if your trying to play these stocks based on new release dates. I challenge you  to look at their charts and then overlay that with release dates and looks for correlation I really doubt it’s there as these corporations care about quarterly earnings more than anything. Also with the current state of video games and the way they churn out unfinished people products I would not be surprised if the stock went down based on bad reviews more than anything.
2021-06-27 11:24:41,stocks,"Gaming stocks are too volatile for me. Drama and problems are common and some of these can trade sideways for months. The GTA expectations are extremely high and this can drag down the price if it will be below. See CD Projekt Red and Cyberpunk. 

Tencent is China so I'm not touching that. 

Gaming is prone to mediocre returns and high risk all things considered even though the market will increase every year. Lootbox regulation is bound to hit which would affect EA as well most likely.

If you really want to invest in gaming go for an ETF. 

An industry that did catch my eye is gaming gear and PC parts. Either way, I would not concentrate much of my wealth in this area. There are much better markets out there."

Hey we got record sales again!! Wait it’s not enough to bump my bonus? Lay off 200 employees nyahh but for upcoming releases in my eyes for a quick day trade in those stocks are the BOTW2 release, BF 2042, and call of duty(duh). Tencent is very ehhh because China. I don’t touch China for moral reasons and there always seems to be shady stuff with every one of their company’s tradable on U.S. exchanges especially those “medical” ones or “growth tech”ones that are clearly just false shells to raise money to fund a massive crip toe farm

My gaming related investing plan is I just invest in the supply chain of the devices/consoles  people use for gaming since that’s less volatile from e-drama from woke r tards and they do more than gaming anyway leading to a larger increase in returns over time . Chip designers, chip manufacturers(China is making this one iffy due to war threats to reclaim “a lost people”)and distributors of the completed gaming comsole/computer parts to pump the final product out to the customer."

I held Activision thinking its games like call of duty would create gains based on their yearly cycle. Kinda like EA was mentioned above with FIFA and Madden. It did not work out well for me. I could’ve played it better, but it was a lost cause."

Do your own research for each ticker this is just a basic run down.

Designers:

INTC(  guys got rekt by team red hard for delaying 7nm and releasing 14++++++)

AMD( their architecture made intels butthole larger and the designs are in both PS5 and Xbox X)

NVDA( they’re top dogs with graphics cards but AMD is catching up slowly in the GPU market for powerful actual affordable GPUs)


Manufacturers:

Intel( worlds largest chip producer except it’s only their stuff refer to designer list)

TSMC( produces AMDs chips possible war with China will kill the worlds supply of semi conductors and make everything more expensive than it already is)


Distributors(this one is probably going to get me banned for mentioning exodia):

EBAY( enjoy scalper wee wee)

AMZN (extremely large company that has 
everything. Basically e-Walmart. Sells consoles and computer parts)

WMT ( extremely large company that has everything. Brick and mortar amazon. Good dividend sells consoles GPUs online)

TGT (large company. Good dividend. Sells consoles idk about online sells for computer parts)

GME the forbidden one (the one stop shop for gaming. GameStop. they have a slightly costly way to get around scalpers just cancel your pro rewards membership once you get your hands on a console actually closer to MSRP price. Actually has computer parts in stock the last time I checked)

NEGG(I’ve never researched these guys investing wise but good luck buying new hardware at a reasonable price I use these guys for old computer hardware to do experiments with)

Anchored by three global powerhouses in entertainment, agriculture, and tech (SoCal, Central Valley, Bay Area) here are my top 10 stock picks in no particular order for long-term growth from the best state in the Union:

1. Marrone Bio Innovations (MBII, agriculture)
2. Arcadia Biosciences (RKDA, agriculture)
3. KB Home (KBH, construction)
4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, semiconductor)
5. Bloom Energy (BE, alternative energy)
6. El Pollo Loco Holdings (LOCO, delicious chicken)
7. Immersion Corporation (IMMR, technology)
8. Roblox Corporation (RBLX, online gaming)
9. Wildan Group (WLDN, civil engineering/consulting)
10. Synnex Corporation (SNX, information technology)

Disclosure, have positions in all of them and from Los Angeles so might be a bit biased... Also, please note that while my choices are based on DD that draws upon my education background in Materials Science Engineering and current employment as a software engineer in Silicon Beach, this is not financial advice lol

Edit:

Some things people don't consider when bashing California:

1. Diversity - people from all over the world want to live here, that's a big part of why it's crowded.
2. Wild West heritage - relative history of being less divisive and more progressive over things like race, class, and gender. Compared to many cities out East and large swaths of the South, less time to hate your neighbor when you had no choice about relying on one another to make it Californee way.
3. People capital - Beyond having the best public university system arguably in the world, California has proven time and time again that it invests in its citizens more generously and less restrictively than other states. While 'essential' workers in Florida were told to pound sand at the height of the pandemic, California moved them up in priority for testing and vaccinations.
4. Innovation - While it pains many to see companies like Tesla and Toyota USA leave California for greener corporate pastures elsewhere, it is often forgotten that California can afford to do so because it is still the best place for many all over the world to realize their ideas and find the right combination of talent and capital. California has and continues to mint many 'unicorns' that go on to become large corporations, often leaders in their industry.
5. Weather - let's be honest here, many of us would rather be ""dead in California than alive in Arizona!"" lol"

Maybe they could offer shelter beds without curfews or restrictions and also offer drug rehabilitation services on site 24/7. Hell, maybe LA could try building public housing. We have a pathetic amount of public housing and shelter beds compared to older cities like NY.

When they are praising the high ceilings of stocks or the regular ""Elon Musk, Bezos... the richest men on the world.."" ""Breaking: GameStop ALL TIME HIGH, buy now or cry later"" ""Miami condo sold for record 50 million"" stay away. 

Good luck!"

The other half I would manage myself, but this is because I enjoy investing and looking for opportunities in the market. You need to enjoy it and be willing to spend time. A few rules:

* I only invest in sectors I understand. For me, that's tech (especially video games) and retail. NVidia, Target, Unity, Micron, Apple, etc.
* When the market dips, that's when you buy. When you see that you lost $1k that day it's hard to respond by putting more money in, but that's what you need to do. Especially when the market is overreacting to some insignificant news.
* When the market jumps you have to sell. This is even harder than buying when it's down. Trying to sell a stock that has been making you money day after day takes discipline.
* Don't be afraid to sell a stock for a loss. Money lost is money lost. The only thing you should care about is where are you most likely to see an increase in the near future. If it's not the stock you are in, sell it and move on.
* Treat any advice on Reddit with a huge amount of skepticism (including this advice). Do your own research. Any company is a good buy at the right price, any company is a bad buy at the wrong price. It's not about if Apple is good or bad, it's about if they are worth $133 a share."

Companies with the highest cash reserves will most likely have good growth and be around in 5-10 years."
2021-06-27 14:07:07,stocks,"Lots of comments from everyone that has the best idea. Myself included.

First, only invest what you can afford to lose. There's a great chance 150k in 8 years could be worth 300k. But there's also a significant chance it could be worth 75k. 
If you log in one day and see you only have 75k, are you going to sell to save that 75k? Or add more? 

That way you can guage your risk tolerance.  Once you know your risk tolerance, you can filter out a lot of the comments. Index funds are great and hands off, but also you should probably understand what you are investing in. VFIAX or VOO (etf) are well run vanguard funds (mutual and exchange traded) but if the market is overvakued they may not return what you were expecting based in the risk.

If you don't have time to manage it, you may look into RIA's to manage your money. 
If you don't ever want to adjust, maybe an L fund that changes your allocation as you age to reduce risk over time.

If you are looking for real estate, REITs provide easy access with volatility which can be bad if you sell the dip. Good if you buy the dip or indifferent if you buy and hold. 
There's also private real estate investing but those come with more restrictions, less liquidity and different risks.
TL;DR 
diverisfy in several different asset classes and allocate based on your risk profile. 

If your risk tolerance is low, there's always ,cds, mygas and other products offering lower rates.
If you don't wanna lose any purchasing power, inflation protected assets could be beneficial to hold. Your 150k would be worth what 150k is worth less fees. But that could be worth 180k or 140k if we have inflation/deflation.

I saw ARK funds recommended and trashed. I saw growth vs value. I saw covered calls listed in the posts. 

All those are strategies that could be very profitable or could lose money. So really there are tons of great answers, bit without knowing your risk tolerance it's hard to say which one may be best for you. Also even if we find which one is best for you, there's no guarantee it will be a great answer if we look back 8 years from now. Ark crushed it the last 2 years but has lagged the market this year.
Value is historically the better choice long term vs growth, but value sucked the last decade. Growth is potentially highly overvakued but could excel in a deflationary environment.

Nobody has the right answer. So my suggestion... Diversify and manage risk..5% growth, 5% value, 5% small cap, 5% REITS... U get the idea. I made up percentages. Don't blindly follow those.

I'm not an advisor and just making stuff up. I have no incentive to tell u anything right (except upvotes) or anything wrong. So please do your own research, consult with professionals if needed and good luck!"

Personally I think putting it in an index is the lazy thing to do. Good yes, safe yes are there better investments, yes. But the above all play a part in how to direct it. Imo. 

If you have a business you can create a self directed ira and put almost anything in that and ot will grow tax free. Real-estate, live stock, crypto etc. You don't need a business but can be good because it can help with the contributions.  There are a number of rules on this so it may not be for you. But something everyone should be aware of.

If you have a high conviction stock that is what I would do. (Mine are tsla and pltr) But thats me I don't diversify with 20-100 of stocks. That is not for everyone. For me investing is doing very little. Meaning research and gain conviction and when I am confident I allocate more capital. Could be over a period of time. This helps when you get punched in the face when the market turns against you. If you did it right and you are confident and the thesis of your investments have not changed you will do well. Most don't make up thier choices on their own and sell in a panic.

2021-06-27 15:55:06,stocks,"That depends on what portion of the $150k is in your whole investment fund. If $150k is the whole fund, then, I would be divided it into 4 sections.

1.) VTI, as a lot of other said, since it is the whole American market, it is less likely to crumble, and given a very long time frame, it is most likely profitable. $50k to $70k, depends on your risk tolerance, and expected return of the time span. If a 15% annual return expectation in 5 year, or 20% annual return in 10 years are feasible, I would definitely go to $70k.

2.) USA, any high dividend ones do, I said high, means at least 6%, $30k to $50k. Again depends on your risk tolerance, expected return is about 8 to 15% annually in 5 to 10 years. Given the dividend reinvested, is quite steady, backtested to 1995 comparison to SPY, it is just about 21% off of SPY gain, that's about 0.80% off per year (I know my math sucks, so just Google, YouTube, research about it yourself).

3.) Individual small-mid cap stocks mostly that have prospective, and a little bit of sure win large cap (example, ZTS). $30k to $50k, you want to risk a bit more to gain more, that's what investment is for, you wanna brag about how your investments grow after years.

4.) Individual stocks or ETFs for short term gamble, $10k to $20k. Here's where the fun seconds to 3) or more, you can play however you want, risk it all, or play several at a time. There's nothing wrong to lose or win less in comparison to others, just the amount and ones you feel comfortable with.

Pretty much sums up all what I am doing right now. Not that I have $150k to invest. I don't know nothing about real estate, and consider it very time consuming and less profitable if done wrongly, so I stay out of it.

If on the other hand, $150k is not your whole investment fund, you have other risky investments, and you want steady income, you may just pour it into USA like I said, grants you about 7.5% annual income, that's about $900 to $1000 per month of income, consider if NAV don't drop much over time.

Not financial advice, it's just my opinion."

2021-06-27 16:01:48,stocks,"Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, or simply just broad market index funds and ETF’s. I feel like the massive companies everybody knows and uses their products are the ones that will continue to grow, innovate, and be around years from now, especially tech stocks, and especially just 5-8 years from now. Apple and Microsoft both have over $2 TRILLION market cap. If you wanted the highest possible % return then I wouldn’t just dump it all into a blue chip or an ETF though, that’s where you take on a little more risk, but if you wanted a somewhat comfortably safe place to put it where you aren’t worried about not seeing any return at all, the blue chips are where I’d store it. I put $100 into GOOGL at the end of last year and it’s currently worth $138+. With $150K, and a 5-8 year timeline, theres a lot of potential there. Also, this is a stocks subreddit so I only mentioned stocks but otherwise, with that kind of capital, you’d likely be able to put money down on a rental property and receive monthly income from the unit(s), also gain equity in the property in the meantime and make a return upon selling the property down the line as well. Real estate is the best passive investment besides the stock market for sure. For multi-family real estate investing I’d suggest looking up a guy named Grant Cardone. The guy leverages his money against the bank’s to acquire huge assets (like 400-unit apartment complexes) and simply manages them and pays off the loans on them at the same time as keeping the rest of the profits for himself and his investors at Cardone Capital. Either way, remember that some return is still better than no return. Chasing that 7-9% RoR in the S&P or Nasdaq is tried and true."

You will pay $15 everytime you withdrawl from Voyager or you could use Nexo and get 1 free withdrawl a month but they pay 8% on USDC unless you lock it up for 30 days and then you can get 9%.

I literally have about 150k I am looking to do this to as well. My first step into crypto dollars until I decide what stocks I want. Once I go in on stocks I am going to be doing a monthly DCA of $5k or more per month and taking margin loans against it right away and then back into crypto dollars.

BETTER ANSWER:

US Real Estate is expensive now, but foreclosed Italian real estate can still be bought at low prices at state issued Italian property auctions. If you are dreaming of retiring to Italy and are getting close to retirement - then you may be able to buy a tiny fixer upper B&B within your budget.

If you needed a very high return and you are willing to take significant risk - then (certain countries in) Latin America is the place to be now.

However, be careful in the present market... with all the talk about inflation and higher interest rates on the medium term this may not be as great as it sounds. To put it briefly, tech companies do better when the interest rates are stable or trending lower. If you expect the interest rates to go higher (and they are quite low), then tech tends to suffer a bit. This is part of the reason SPY has gone up 14.7% this year, while QQQ has gone up 11.6%. Mind you, it's still an awesome return. But since the interest rate is likely to go up, better to play it safe and keep some on stuff less sensitive to IR."

1. There's no way to seriously value any Coins, so I personally wouldn't touch Crypto at all, but if you seriously want to get into Crypto I'd advise you to NOT put 40% of your money into Crypto lol.  

2. PLTR and TSLA are great companies but not great investments in my opinion. Especially Teslas valuation, even after falling about 30% YTD, is way too high. I seriously wouldn't even buy Tesla at $50. They're not only diluting the hell out of you but the ""projections"" (read: phantasies) are in no way shape or form realistic to justify their current price. If you seriously want to buy Tesla at a Market Cap of 650 Billion Dollars you should go to a psychiatrist first because this thing won't end well. People always laugh at you for not owning X stock. It was Cisco in the year 2000 when the Dotcom bubble burst. They'll laugh at you for not owning it, but they'll get very quiet the second all their phantasies turn out to be unrealistic which makes the stock crash. You might miss the hype but you'll also miss the crash. Generally I would advise you to not touch any EV or Renewable Energy stocks at the moment because almost all of them are horrifically overvalued, for obvious reasons (just like in the dotcom bubble).  

3. It's great how you think Real Estate is overvalued but don't think that most stocks are in the same situation. I disagree.  

4. ETF's are the way to go if you don't know anything about investing plus aren't interested in learning more about it. Quite cheap, almost always perform well depending on which one you buy, very low maintenance."

*Finally, the actual error is that the number 22 is red, not black -* ***Edit: this part is a joke.***

BTW, I work for a Casino in Las Vegas, so though I don’t play Roulette, I know quite a bit about the game.

Edit: Wow, not much humor in the investment world. I put in the joke that 22 is red, not black to see if u/Harrigan_Raen would chase that false rabbit.

Nearly happened in 2008 (and again in 2020) but the Fed slammed the federal reserve rate back to zero and buys shitty corporate debt every month to force interest rates to remain low.

Even though we both make pretty good money we can’t upgrade because of the costs of kids and child care, etc. 

For what it is worth, I think a lot of the people buying expensive homes are families with two upper class incomes. We know one that is a doctor and a lawyer, another that is two doctors, another that’s an accountant and a lawyer, etc. We were trying to figure out who the hell is making the $500k in annual income you probably need to buy these 1.5 million homes that are springing up everywhere.

The vast majority of homeowners say the best investment they’ve ever made was into buying their home. The only exception is if you plan to move in the next 5 years.

Most people want a house straight out of school. This is a very American thing. People do not need a house immediately ! They need to focus on building equity first.

Also, this mentality of ""you can be what you want to be in life !!!"" needs to stop. Some industries are hiring with some decent salaries, while some fields will condemn people choosing that track to a life in poverty. Is it fair, is it cool, I don't know but it's the reality.

Did you seriously just say that you would buy Tesla at 50 because it's currently at 650...? You really didn't understand what I was telling you, right? So let's talk about some of the stocks of the Dotcom Bubble. Microsoft fell by 80% and it took them 17 YEARS to break even. 17 Years! Amazon lost 90% of share price and it took them 11 YEARS just to break even. Cisco lost 85% and it still didn't break even. If you bought Cisco 21 years ago you would still be down by about 44%.  


You're the type of guy who would've lost a ton of money in 2000. You will eventually lose a ton of money if you don't educate yourself on how to at least try to come up with the actual value of a stock. Tesla is NOT worth 650 billion Dollars today. Its valuation is crazy and unjustifiable. I would actually argue that Tesla went up as much as it did last year largely because of technical reasons and people somehow attempted to justify the price action. It will crash. Eventually. They all do."

I assume by “stock of supplies” you mean building material prices? Or perhaps you mean stock of housing inventory? Either way, both are in low supply = higher, not lower, prices for housing. At any rate, I never implied that housing isn’t overvalued. I’m just saying it’s absolutely nuts of you to see housing as overvalued while believing that pltr and tsla are not.

Cheap stocks will come soon. Prepare your cash."
2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"How Stocks Are Valued Part 1: Discounted Cash Flow I saw a question on this sub yesterday about why stocks are valuable, so I thought I would do a write-up of what I learned about stocks in business school. But first, an important concept:

# The Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Discount Rate

**A loan to a friend**

Imagine if you loaned someone $1000 for a year. You probably want to be paid back with interest. This interest compensates you for losing access to that money for a year, during which you could have deposited it at a bank, invested it, or even spent it.

The long story short is that $1000 today is worth more than $1000 tomorrow because of the flexibility and options that you have with today's money. We can say that the ***Present Value*** of $1000 next year is less than $1000 today. This concept is also known as ***The Time Value of Money.***

**An Example With T-Bills**

Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially loans to the US Government, but the amount to be repaid is fixed. T-Bills are typically denominated in $1000s, which is the amount the government will repay when the bond matures. 

An investor can typically buy a T-Bill for less than the full $1000 on the open market. The investor makes money because she purchased the future $1000 payment at a ***discount.*** This discount exists because money today is worth more than money tomorrow. How do you convert between the two? Using the appropriately named ***Discount Rate***, or the required rate of return. 

The average investor wants to make money from lending money, even to the US Government. If investors want a 1% return, then $100 today is the same as $101 next year.

We can similarly price T-Bills: If the required rate of return is 1%, and the bond will pay $1000 in a year, then the ***Present Value*** of the T-Bill is about $990. This is because the $990 investment will grow by 1% into $1000.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

Are you still awake? Good. This is the fun part.

# So What Are Stocks Anyway?

Stocks represent partial ownership of a company. A company is divided into units of stock called shares, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to a fraction of the company's assets (after all debts are repaid) and any future profits.

**So Why Does a Stock Have Value?**

Part of a stock's value comes from its book value (the value of all company assets minus all company debt) but this clearly only a small fraction of that price ( the average price-to-book ratio for the companies in the S&P500 is about 4.5). ***The remainder of the stock value comes from the future earnings of a company.***

Similar to how the price of a T-Bill is the present value of a future payment, a large part of a stock's value comes from the present value of future earnings. Analysts will project (and discount) a company's future earnings, add the book value, and arrive at an estimate of the stock's value.

# Oversimplified DCF Example:

The Pear Company makes $100 a year risk-free. For simplicity's sake, it has $200 in assets and no debt. For some reason, you figure 100% is a good discount rate to use.

The Pear Company will make $100 next year (Year 1), which is worth $50 today ($50 doubles into $100 in a year). In Year 2, The Pear Company's earnings are only worth $25 to you today, and so on. If you add the present value of all future cash flows together, you'll arrive at $100. 

You can find the company value by adding the value of its assets ($200) with the present value of its future earnings ($100).  If Pear issues 100 shares, each will be worth $3.

[Of course, even simple DCF Models IRL look a little scarier than the above example.](https://imgur.com/a/DzMQHHT)

# But What Makes The Stock Valuable To Me?

You might have noticed that dividends aren't really taken into account at all. How are you supposed to get any real money from a company whose stock pays no dividends?

Unpaid dividends don't just disappear. Management can decide to reinvest these profits to grow their income. This results in a larger stock price over time. The company might also just decide to keep the cash on its balance sheet. This results in a larger book value, and the stock price will increase to reflect that.

You can sell some stock to create your own ""dividend"" if you'd like; you will own a smaller percentage of the company, but because profits were not distributed to shareholders, the company has gotten bigger.

**But What Makes The Stock Valuable To The Next Guy?**

Eventually, the company's value will be returned to shareholders. This could happen in several ways:

1. Dividends are paid out in the future, returning capital to investors
2. The company is acquired or goes private, and shareholders either receive cash or stock in the acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price is determined by, among other things, the present value of all future earnings of the company,
3. The company might also just decide to stop operating and liquidate its assets. Shareholders will receive all assets the company owns (after paying its debt)."

2021-06-27 10:20:45,stocks,"A bit of context: 

Each transaction you make to add new shares to your existing position becomes a “tax lot”. As you keep buying shares into your existing position at different dates, you end up having multiple tax lots in your position. If you hold them for a long time, some tax lots will become long term and some will remain short term depending on when you bought each tax lot and if it’s been a year since you bought those tax lots.

Having said that… 

When you sell your entire position, different tax rules apply to each tax lot as some may be short term and some may be long term, depending on how long you’ve held them. 

If you only sell part of your position, e.g. one tax lot of 10 shares, different brokers handle it differently. As pointed here by others, almost all brokers use “First In First Out” as default. So if you have two lots with 10 shares each bought on different dates and when you hit the sell button for 10 shares, the first lot you bought will be sold first. 

Many brokers also provide capability to go back and and reassign which lot you “actually wanted” to sell. At the end of the tax year, your calculations might tell you that using the most recent tax lot would get your a better tax rate instead of the first tax lot that the broker used, you might be able to re-assign which lot to “mark” as the one you sold. 

I use E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers. E*TRADE gives you the option to either FIFO or select a particular tax lot that you want to sell. Interactive Brokers on the other hand does not allow you to select which lot you want to sell but has a tax optimizer feature which, after you sell, would allow you to choose the best tax lot for the best tax implications. Check the web version of your broker to see if this option for tax optimizer exists as the mobile apps dont usually support this capability. Check with your broker. 

Hope this helps"

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"The Weekly DD - WISH: The shopping mall in your pocket **Overview**

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let’s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation. 

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH’s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates. 
* WISH’s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.
* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%** of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables…

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019. 

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it’s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash. 

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What’s concerning is that it’s only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

The majority of people commenting ""wish is trash scam company"" have almost certainly not done any proper research on it. I've been in WISH since recently after the IPO. The /r/wallstreetbets hype is fun, but it's always been a poorly understood company.

From the WISH CEO:

>We never hypothesized going after value conscious consumers with unbranded goods, but the early data was indisputable. There was a large underserved market of consumers that prioritized price over pretty packaging, fast shipping, and brands. Despite our metrics, we were told repeatedly and at every stage by Menlo Park investors that they didn’t know anyone that would shop on Wish. That we were unlikely to surpass whatever sales volume we had at the time. Pointing out that the biggest retailer in America focused strictly on value conscious consumers fell on deaf ears, these investors didn’t shop at Walmart either.

People with $100K accounts can't fathom shopping at WISH. But why should they? It's not meant for them.

Tl;dr: a lot of people don't understand Wish's business model. But that's okay, because that's exactly why it offers asymmetric upside."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"How does shorting affect a stock? I don't mean the stock's price, I mean the company itself. I keep seeing people saying that short sellers bankrupt companies, but, to my understanding, the only way that they affect the company is through lowering the share price. A lower share price means that the company can raise less money through additional share offerings, but... That's about it, right? 

I also guess it affects more of the intangible aspects like investor confidence and so on, but I still fail to see exactly how short sellers affect the company.

If the company is good enough, eventually it will bounce back up, right? There's a reason why the most shorted companies are some of the most controversial ones. Most of the them have slim chances of performing well or are overvalued.

And, also, if we apply the reverse logic, if a company's share price gets pumped up and kept up, the only thing they can do is raise more money through the shares. However, if their management and business is shit, they're just buying themselves more time before bankruptcy, right?

I've seen the theories about companies that are trading above the fair value actually creating value through share offerings, but at the end of the day it comes down to the underlying business and it's performance. If a company was that good that it only needs money to become an amazing performer, there surely would be some merry bunch of individuals who would give them some. I mean, investors and institutions are spending a fuckton of money supporting companies with a 10% chance of surviving over the next few years and dodgy startups, if they saw a company that only needs cash to perform well, they'd surely recognise the opportunity, right?

I have not actually done any substantial factual research on this although admittedly it's a bit hard to find good resources right now which are not biased. This is purely my own personal understanding. There's plenty of people here who are smarter than me so I was hoping that somebody would have a good answer 😁

A publicly traded company with a good valuation can easily get cash by diluting their stock. This does not only make financing through dilution less costly, it also makes financing through debt easier, as the bank knows the company can always dilute to pay that debt. 


A stock with poor valuations can't do that as easily."

You can also get your stocks delisted off the main exchange and become OTC which is harder to trade for people and they lose interest and without interest in your stock the price keeps falling then you have little market cap valuation to save yourself."

But if you think about in a wide range, you could bought the shares earlier and sell at a higher price, since you didn't and you KNOW the price is going to drop, you can ride the train.

But i dont short stocks, and the main reason for that is the use of margin (and paying borrow fees). Its too risky TO ME."

But my argument for that is AMC operates in a dying industry, and was bankrupt because of it being a poor company.

Unpopular opinion: short sellers were very smart to short a movie theater chain during a pandemic. Most cultists don’t like to hear that 😂

Bottom line: shorting does not affect a company directly."

The only real thing it impacts is equity raises, which are dilutive to existing shareholders and contrary to what a lot of armchair experts in this thread are saying, are NOT the most common way to raise money unless you are very new or in say the biotech industry. Companies being shorted are often really just highly overvalued or shit companies that are on a downtrend. Who cares if they aren’t able to raise money. There is a ton, a TON of shitty, unprofitable zombie corporations kept alive solely by diluting shareholders and exhausting credit facilities. 

Screw that. Put capital where it will be employed most effectively. Shorts are an incredibly important part of price discovery especially in frothy markets like this. This isn’t to say some big funds that short don’t put out BS hit pieces or get their friends at different banks to issue awful ratings to help their position. But those same funds also manipulate the market to get certain stocks bullish so they can unload their shares on retail. But people only focus on shorts."

Just think about it: what part in short selling would make it go down in the long term to actually cause bankruptcy? All a short seller does is opening a position that he plans to buy in the future, in other words the broker buys the share in that very moment at that very price that it has on the market. This does nothing to the price.

What it can do though is scare off new investors that see a high short ratio. Large institutions have their hands in almost everything and have a far superior way of evaluating things, meaning betting against that is usually a bad idea as the shorting has it's reason.

You can read it up here, but from a pure logical point this should already be answered before you even open the link.

But let's talk about the next part of your question: Bankruptcy. A company that does well and is well established will never need to issue shares to raise capital, and that's the only real part for a company where the stock price matters. Sure, if they hand out shares to their employees then it matters to the employees as well, but that's a personal matter, not one for the company.

What does absolutely cause a company to file bankruptcy is a failing business and a failure to adapt to new circumstances, leading to you losing more and more money and the only way to get money back is either a loan - which might just add debt pressure on you and makes you look even worse on paper - or by offering shares. A company that has a very high short ratio will have a hard time selling it's stock, but again, that's not the fault of shorts but the fault of the company for having a failing business."

If enough people bet on the stock price to go down, especially if they are naked shorting (which can mean more shares are shorted than actually EXIST), then yeah the share price is going to fall. It’s a shit ton of extra shares that don’t even exist being sold.  Too much supply lowers the share price and then more and more people stat shorting it.  It effects the company in a number of ways…many were already mentioned in other comments…. perception of company to prospective investors, ability to maximize leverage, etc."
2021-06-27 12:19:09,stocks,"Thought I would share my view on this one. Shorting in itself don't bankrupt a company, it in itself helps in price discovery to make it ""efficient"" better, as if there is no shorting, if one thing a stock is overvalued, they would just avoid it, but shorting helps creating value in finding the company's ""fair price"". With that being said, shorting, often times is used with smear campaign not just to the public, but to the strategic investors and just creating fears in general, these strategies requires one to be in the industry to tell. There is this one strategy that is ""long the strong and short the weak"", when one is weak, you keep beatin it down, and many times when short succeeds, it doesn't mean the company itself is a scam or whatnot, but if the price is keep low enough for long enough time, there will be times where the company is actually in a tough spot and need to use the capital to hold and when they can't, itll just be bankruptcy declared for the company to salvage capital for shareholders. The general idea of such strategy is not IF it will need the capital, it's about when it needs the capital, and if you ask me, i agree, no company ever stay profitable and be on top all the time. Using this line of thought, same way as you would be finding a ""value"" stock, you find these stocks that are vulnerable to conditions of the market then start targetjng it in hopes of a payday. Finance market in large is , was and will be about the quantitative aspect, most of the time there won't be a personal reason to do such things to a company, it's always about the profit and there will be strategy to do so in a quantitative way."

I have a degree in finance and work in finance.

All these other things people are talking about are strategies that can be used to make a short profitable, but not a result of the actual short."
2021-06-27 17:11:39,stocks,"Failing ≠ Failed 

Shorting affects the company, by effectively removing one way of financing a pivoting strategy. Let's say, for example, that AMC realizes it's current business model isn't working, so it comes up with a new one to bring it into the modern world.  But to adopt new technologies, it needs to raise $100 Million which is not available from lenders, so it needs to issue stock. Let's say that the stock was holding pretty steady at $50/share, so the offering is set for 20 million shares to be issued.

Now hedge funds come in and significantly short the stock... shaking confidence and dropping the price to $25. That drop would likely result in much less capital being raised, maybe not enough to make the pivot that would have saved the company. 

It's like draining a lake of water and blaming the fish for not being able to breathe air, or not choosing a different lake."
2021-06-27 17:46:25,stocks,"Shorting in itself doesn't affect the stock.  But if there's more selling than buying, the price will go down.  But a large institution consolidating shares to short and unleashing all of them at once could* drive the price down, provided the shares aren't bought at the same rate.  But that being said, shorting usually occurs when it's expected that the price will go down and not to drive the price down."

I get that they’re trying to make money but somehow it seems very behind the scenes type of sneaky.  And on top of it all they’re not even using their money.

For example, they may come public with their short position, driving down investor confidence, run “slander” stories on the company across the news, etc.

Among other reasons, this is why shorting stock can be seen as controversial. Institutions who are net short profit from the company’s demise, and so there’s an incentive to destroy or devalue these companies."

All of this doesn't destroy the company, but there are negative effects that add up."

Good accounting practices plus profitable business equals no need to raise money through floating more shares IMO. Plus, if you float more shares, you dilute your existing shareholders and I've seen that most companies tend to resort to bank loans anyway before floating more shares. After all, diluting the shares leads to a lower EPS, lower dividend yield, lower book price per share, etc. No well-performing company would do that  IMO unless they're seriously overvalued (Tesla).

It is not stock price that brings them to insolvency. It is their business comes to a natural sunset: see Yahoo or Blockbuster.

Shorting as a result of falling stock prices comes from followers, those trying to make a quick buck on the current sentiment. They have already been triggered to follow suit.

Big companies couldn´t make payroll - even though they had enough assets and were profitable for quite some time. And that had nothing to do with them being a bad business suddenly.

Media gets on a bandwagon and digs up any negative story they can find - poor working conditions, lack of woke-ness, buying from sweatshops, poor customer reviews... it all feeds in to itself. 

The minute the company itself has an issue with its fundamentals - stagnating growth for example - that they'd normally get a loan or issue more stock to get through, then the death spiral begins. Without growth, expenses rise and revenue falls. It makes it harder to pay staff, pay leases on buildings with good exposure, buy materials to sell.

1: selling does not decrease a stocks price. In fact, every buy needs a sell, so your logic would create an infinite loophole. 

2: the stock price is an imaginary number that doesn't exist. It either shows bid+spread/2 or the last sell price for most brokers. 

3: if I own a 250$ NVDA share and sell it for 300$, then it didn't decrease the stock value. In fact, it increased it if the last stock sale was below 300$.

4: shorts can't magically make up a price. A short position first requires the broker to buy a share at the current price and then you straight up just sit there, hoping it goes down. It's the same as buying. Your act doesn't influence what other people sell or buy at in the slightest.

Addressing your first point:

Selling a stock CERTAINLY decreases a stock’s price. The stock market is based on supply and demand. By selling, you increase the supply. No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock’s price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater. 

“If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.”

Addressing your second point:

An imaginary number that doesn’t exist? 

The current price is the most recent selling price of the stock, with adequate liquidity this number certainly isn’t “imaginary” but instead a very good indicator of what you could buy or sell the stock for. If you want to “market buy” you pay the ask, “market sell” and you get the bid. Again, with enough liquidity these numbers, or the “spread” should be very close to the “current price” or what you called “imaginary” 

Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp

Your third point:

Yes, buyers meet sellers and a exchange of shares goes through.

Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled. You don’t get to choose. If the last sale was at 299, your share is available at $300 but the market has people willing to sell at 298, 297, 296, 295 etc. do you ever think your $300 limit sell will get filled? Probably not, and thus why selling pressure increases supply and reduces the price (see point 1).

Your fourth point:

Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price. 

To quote the article you provided as evidence 

“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent. However, it is completely untrue to suggest the mechanics of a short sell do not temporarily decrease the stock’s price (and your article agrees)."

If someone shorts a stock, the shares have to be bought first. That straight up negates your entire argument.

How can you even write that, thinking this is true? Who do they sell to? The air? No, someone else has to buy it. Every single day someone buys or sells someone else sells or buys. Do you think there is an invisible force that this goes into?

""Source, because you likely won’t believe me:""

This source is flawed majorly - the statements in it are true, but what you fail to understand is that it doesn't matter if stock ABC currently sitting at 100$ has 500 million asks and 500 million bids at 90$ and 110$ - it doesn't do jackshit if there is enough liquidity sitting between 100$ to 110$ and 100 to 90$. What your ""source"" references to is that whenever you have either more demand or more supply, it will move into the opposite direction because it's all about who breaks first, and more people mean it's more likely that this happens. **But that has literally nothing to do with shorting because what this talks about is owning shares and then selling them vs not owning shares and wanting to buy them, thus bid and ask.**

>Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled.

False. My example was that my NVDA share got filled. You can't take my example while referencing me and then apply different rules. You can make that and make your own example, but not put words into my mouth. I spoke against you saying that selling has to decrease the price which is simply wrong. **EVERY BUY NEEDS A SELL. THEY WORK TOGETHER.**

>Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price.

Short selling means your broker will buy (or borrow) a share until you buy it back. Meaning your made up scenario of having more shares available is simply wrong. Only when you buy back, the share goes back to the market, BUT it also requires someone to buy it. So no, you do not have more shares.

>“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

No no no. Quote the entire thing:

""Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock. Executives, on the other hand, are incentivized to drive up the price of their company’s stock.""

What you fail to understand or attempt to represent accurately is that they mean short sellers, the person behind shorting, not the actual short, want to drive the price down. While the CEO, and for that concern anyone on a long position, want to drive the price up. You will never read negative sides on a bull DD and you will never read positive sides on a bear DD. That is natural and stupid to reference out of context.

>“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

Thank you for confirming my point. We are talking about a company filing **bankruptcy**. Having to file for bankruptcy is not something that happens in weeks or a month, this builds up over years. You have the relation wrong. Shorts don't create a failing business, but a failing business creates shorts.

>I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent.

What the hell is this even meant to mean? Okay let's digest.

""I am not saying shorts could bring a company down, unless the company was truly fraudulent.""

What? What the hell do shorts have to do with whether the company is fraudulent or not? What hell of a point is that supposed to be?

And second part:

""I am not saying at all that shorts  could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved""

You what? Listen. A company doesn't give a single frick about what traders do - for their business. They care about what happens to their stock when they **NEED** or **WANT** to raise money. All the other times it literally doesn't matter for the company itself, the entire time. This also belongs to taking a loan and having your stocks, that the company holds, evaluated. But again, what you fail to imply is that a failing business causes shorts to come in, not shorts coming in cause a failing business. The topic of the post is still bankruptcy and no, shorts do not have an effect on the share price. Again, by your logic every long position that sells has the same negative effect because the share magically goes back to the market, meaning less supply. Which is simply wrong, someone else is buying it.

**As a final word:**

Supply and demand in shorts matters in 3 cases only:

1. for algorithms. They use the spread to of bid and ask for high frequency trading. This actually does have a major impact on the trading volume, as well as the way it's going
2. who of the bid ask sides breaks first. But bid and ask mostly long positions selling and non-positions buying. So that entire theory doesn't work out for reality.
3. if the float of a stock is either close to or at 100% or the trading volume is insanely low. I've been in stocks that I put up a MARKET ORDER and it wasn't closed for 3 months, so the end where no one is buying or at least enough to cover enough positions that mine is included. And the other end is of course that no one wants to sell.

None of these apply to short selling."

2021-06-27 11:56:56,stocks," “a credit rating determines the likelihood that the borrower will be able and willing to pay back a loan within the confines of the loan agreement without defaulting.

So we need cash to pay back a debt right? We can obtain cash via equity financing right? If our stock price is low we can obtain less per share via equity financing right? If we can obtain less cash via equity financing, then our chances of paying back the debt are less right? If our chances of paying back the debt are less, then that negatively impacts our credit worthiness right? If our credit worthiness is deemed to be less by a rating agency we get downgraded right? If our rating gets downgraded it is harder to issue bonds

As  far as i understand companies need money at the beginning of their life  to cover the expenses and then in exchange they return the profit to  the investors in dividends or buybacks which makes the stock/company  valuable which drives the stock price up so they can issue more shares  if they need money for further investment.

So  this is completely ok but a company like coca-cola, altria, 3m etc.  doesnt really issue any new shares or do something innovative to reform  the company/build factories etc. So does it even matter what their stock  price is? Their net profit would cover all expenses isnt it?

And so, If a company announced that it was halting all future dividend payments and using that money to pay to the rank and file (if somehow against all odds the board agrees to this) shareholders would run for the doors, cratering the stock price (which executives own, so they’d get hurt) and there would likely be a class action launched by those shareholders against everyone that voted for it.

2021-06-27 15:41:59,stocks,"As a dividend heavy investor personally, the reason and logic behind why I like dividend stocks is simple:

When you own stock in a company, you’re essentially owning a piece of their business. The entire point of owning/operating a business is to be profitable and make money. It’s not very sensible to me to own a piece of a company that doesn’t even pay me. I am a part owner after all. Simply relying on the stock price to hopefully go up isn’t very comforting. 

In order to realize any profit from a non-paying company you’ll have to sell your shares. Dividend stocks provide cash flow without the need to sell at all. And on top of it, each year the distribution will most likely grow. After a handful of years, your yield in the past will be much lower than what it would become in the future. (Assuming no cuts and reasonable payout hikes.)

Companies themselves do this for various reasons. Mainly mature and predictable companies offer dividends. (But not all exactly.) it gives more allure to their stock. It basically says to investors “hey look at us, we can payout money to you consistently because we have confidence in our business, and we appreciate your investment.” 

It just gives more investor respect considering they’re pledging money to you periodically."

I think they are asking not why all companies must pay dividends (clearly they don’t!) but why once companies start paying dividends there’s an expectation that they will continue.

The answer is “convention”. The market is aways looking for signals about the health of a company. For companies that pay dividends, convention has decided that increasing dividends are good, and decreasing dividends are bad.

This, by the way, is *yet another* reason that dividends are generally a bad way to return capital to the shareholders. Nobody says “Aha, BIGCO, you bought back 10 million shares last year, but this year you didn’t buy back any! You must be in financial distress! SELL SELL SELL.”  Dividends however do create this expectation, which reduces management’s flexibility to deal with unexpected changes in the company’s fortunes."

When a company moves out of the growth phase it's stock price will level out and it's investors will flee looking for a better ROI (return on investment). Since it doesn't have to spend as much on the first 2 they pay dividends to keep there investors.  Think of it like this. vz pretty much trades sideways.

Paying this cash to their shareholders makes their stock attractive which in turn attracts more shareholders. 

You say give it to their workers but that would be kind of odd dont you think? Just handing out millions to your workers. If that was the case nobody would want to work for anything else than these big companies. Also by paying it to workers or managers the money is just... Gone. By paying dividend they attract shareholders which in turn get them more money.

Its a cycle of income in the end."

2021-06-27 09:36:15,stocks,"It’s only important to some investors to get dividends back from a company. Some companies give dividends in order to attract those investors

Companies have a limited number of things they can do with profit. Once they’ve paid all their workers and raw material, they can reinvest the profit they made (but other companies, buy new machinery, develop new processes), or they can distribute it. Each company does what makes the most sense for them. Typically small and mid-size companies will reinvest their profits in order to grow. Larger businesses (“blue chip”) tend to distribute those dollars to the owners - the shareholders

Everyone has a choice of what to do with their cash - think of it like every company is competing for you to put your dollars into their business. Those with dividends are trying to persuade investors to put money in them"
2021-06-27 09:57:40,stocks,It can help keep a stock price low and stable over time which is attractive to new long-term investors. Also the consistant payout is attractive to old long-term buyers. These are companies that are in it for the long haul and know how to keep their numbers at small well regulated growth. Got extra profit? Raise the dividend a bit instead of sharebuybacks otherwise the stock price shifts. Bad year? Lower the dividend and maintain steady uphill stock price status. Its easy to manipulate.

2021-06-27 14:27:27,stocks,">As far as i understand companies need money at the beginning of their life to cover the expenses and then in exchange they return the profit to the investors in dividends or buybacks which makes the stock/company valuable which drives the stock price up so they can issue more shares if they need money for further investment.

Incorrect. If the point of buybacks and dividends was to increase the value of the stock in order to then offer shares again, the company would at best only get back as much as it paid in dividends or buybacks, or more likely get worse returns than if they didn't do any buybacks (the exception being in situations where there's heavy short interest and the buybacks might scare shorts away)."

2021-06-27 16:20:25,stocks,"You're being downvoted, but I think it's a good question to reflect on.  In my opinion the considerations aren't as readily apparent as folks think.

I think the most direct answer is that corporate officers took on the duty as part of the deal when they decided to do a stock offering.  Taking money from investors is basically predicated on that value being grown.  There are mechanisms to replace leadership that are not living up to expectations.

It is more complicated though.  I believe there is case law for PRIVATELY HELD companies that went to the supreme court with regards to Hobby Lobby and their handling of providing certain insurance to employees.  The arguments were fundamentally that actions taken around religious belief were interfering with shareholder value.  Obviously this is limited and not case law for public companies, but it points to the complexity.

Regardless, many people think that an economy predicated on infinite growth or monotonically increasing profit is impractical and that corporate officers have duty that is more nuanced than just providing shareholder value.  For now though, the best general answer seems to be that it's a core commitment of the corporate officers when stock is offered.

Good question."

What they fail to realize is that, while their stock DOES now represent a smaller portion (they’re right about that part), it represents a smaller portion of a company that now has more value (they literally raise a ton of cash with the secondary offering).

This has a side effect of creating some extra sell-side pressure and creating an upper bound on the stock price, temporarily, so in the short term it does often cause a dip.

Beyond that cash meaning the company has more liquid assets, the cash is generally raised via a secondary offering specifically because it is needed to do something that the company believes will make a lot of money in the long run. 

TLDR If a company’s decision to provide a secondary offering is based on accurate predictions of the value of the activities or infrastructure that the resulting cash will fund, then the offering is actually good for current investors in the long run."

theres insane increase in revenue, net revenue, and FCF. Even going positive in net income. this also is after the fact that (unless im misunderstanding this concept on balance sheet) corsair has (relatively speaking to its previous years) insane inventory cash flow.

2021-06-27 04:20:09,stocks,What do you mean by automatically? When your cash settled in account? Or when you press transfer and need to wait a few days (depends on brokerage)
2021-06-27 10:05:53,stocks,"I'm new to this; I use fidelity and took a margin debit without margin impact, and I still have cash in my account, just less than my purchase; meaning unless my collatoral stocks take a major loss, I dont pay interest.

I'm not sure if you typo'd, but its margin debIT, whereas cash they owe you for gains is margin credit.

 I'm confident I'll close my position with margin credit, and unless I close the margin position at a loss, or my holdings plummet in value meaning I no longer hold collateral, I don't see why they would take any of the money.

I also use my individual account as a checking account for small purchases, such as gasoline, food and beverages. I'm using less than half of my allotted margin debit to buy stocks to avoid paying any interest, so I doubt they'll be making any sort of margin calls."
2021-06-27 04:44:49,stocks,"Thanks, I should have included I'm referring to Ally in this scenario. I'm assuming the addition of the cash doesn't change anything regarding the average purchase price of the position.?"
2021-06-27 14:07:01,stocks,"It's a term of art at that firm.

>A *Margin Credit* indicates the amount due to you based on margin trade executions or an amount needed to meet margin requirements. On settlement date, this amount will be journaled to your Core if there is surplus in the Margin account. A *margin debit* indicates the amount you owe Fidelity based on margin trade executions. If there is cash in your Core, a journal would take place on settlement date to reduce this debit balance. If there was not enough cash in the Core, you would start paying margin interest on this value at settlement. 

https://www.fidelity.com/products/atbt/help/ActiveTraderTools_Balances_Help.html

They haven't settled so you're marked with a debit. When the trade settles you'll either have cash or a debt.

NB even when the transaction settles, expect Fidelity to drag their feet getting the balances posted. I just had to yell at them because a transfer of cash into my account took 7 biz days to appear as real money instead of the promised 4.

FINRA also uses the term to specify trading accounts that owe money (debit balance) vs those that have money (credit balance).

Out in the world, it's ""margin debt"" and ""cash."""
2021-06-27 06:38:53,stocks,That’s correct
2021-06-27 10:17:02,stocks,"With Fidelity, I believe when you buy a stock with your cash- 40k, it is settled in your account and that 40k becomes a marginable position. Ex.: BABA (m)
And that should give you 40k margin, total 80k buying power.

If you had 1k left over and made another 20k purchase on margin, I believe it would be interest free on margin, and they would not touch your 1k. 

If you then added 99k, I believe they would fill your margin, leaving you with 80k in cash reserves, 60k in holdings, and 140k buying power, so total 180k with margin.

The first probably 100K/140k of your purchases would end up being interest free- or 30k of interest free margin, with the final 50k margin at an annual interest rate of 6.575% due to having more than 100k in the account

I may have the ratios of total avaliable margin wrong, but they, meaning Fidelity, does let you borrow off of your own (qualified) holdings interest free. Check with your broker"
2021-06-27 12:18:04,stocks,"For my Fidelity account, I have stocks marked with “M”, meaning they are purchased on margin. When I load up cash and have excess cash amount, it does not remove the “M” from my stock that was purchase on margin at the time. I called up Fidelity and they said that they stay stay as using margin unless I request it to be converted. Basically, a way for them to continue to collect interest even though I now have excess cash. What you have described is what I experience with Ally Invest, but not Fidelity. But again, I only have IRA with Fidelity, so maybe it works differently from their brokerage account.

Btw, when I make a stock purchase in Fidelity, it had an option to choose “cash” or “margin”, even if I have excess cash."

Purely anecdotal, but these prices have not moved a cent in the last month or two for Ubers, and its become extremely difficult to get Uber's in terms of time and the money spent to get from point A to point B. Will these prices really be down by the fall? Winter?

Not to mention Uber is not currently profitable, so I would assume these prices are here for the long haul. I'm good keeping Uber for now, but just question it's long term ability (UberEats seems like a nice hedge for them)."

If the management ever realizes they can increase the prices by 15% and not lose any customers, their profits and stock price will go up."

2021-06-27 06:52:06,stocks,"Except that you get that with cabs,  it's far more frequent, you have to physically call them, you can't track them and see if they are actually coming or not, you can't down rate a taxi to the point that the company will turf them.  Any of the negative sides of Uber, also exist in Cabs, but you lose out on all the positive sides that Uber offers.  

&#x200B;

The simplest thing to look at is that if prices were identical, which service will customers choose?  The majority are choosing Uber for the convenience aspect alone.  

&#x200B;

So there appears to be zero reason for Uber to be undercutting Taxis."

I feel like we are starting to get to a point where electric vehicles are starting to be affordable, attractive, and more widespread.  Rather than investing in the EV market I would like to find some shovel stocks in the supply chain (battery manufacturing and recycling for example).  What are your favorite picks for both the EV industry as well as some of your favorite shovel stocks in general?"

They're primarily an electric bus manufacturer right now but they're also in the business of electrifying all types of vehicles as well as being in the charging space. Basically the shovel portion is them providing battery packs, powertrain, and charging solutions to other vehicle manufactures who are looking to electrify their vehicles. Right now they derive most of their revenue from their ebuses but by 2023, their vehicle electrification business is expected to overtake their ebus segment.

They have 3 main businesses:

Proterra Powered designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and integrates proprietary battery systems and electrification solutions into vehicles for global commercial vehicle OEM customers serving the Class 3 to Class 8 vehicle segments, including delivery trucks, school buses, coach buses, construction and mining equipment, and other applications.

Proterra Transit designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric transit buses as an OEM for North American public transit agencies, airports, universities, and other commercial transit fleets. Proterra Transit offers an ideal venue to showcase and validate our electric vehicle technology platform through rigorous daily use by a large group of sophisticated customers focused on meeting the wide-ranging needs of the diverse communities they serve.

Proterra Energy provides turnkey fleet-scale, high-power charging solutions and software services, ranging from fleet and energy management software-as-a-service, to fleet planning, hardware, infrastructure, installation, utility engagement, and charging optimization. These solutions are designed to optimize energy use and costs, and to provide vehicle-to-grid functionality.

Through partnerships that include Daimler’s Thomas Built Buses and Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Komatsu Ltd., Volta Trucks, Lightning eMotors, Van Hool NV, Optimal Electric Vehicles LLC, and BusTech Pty Ltd., Proterra Powered batteries are helping electrify the school bus, step-van, construction and mining equipment, medium-duty trucks and vans, motor coach, shuttle bus, and international transit bus markets, respectively."

Lithium is critical, but I'm underwhelmed by the investment opportunities.

2021-06-27 14:20:43,stocks,"Micro-vast.  They make fairly ordinary EV batteries.  Now.  Overseas.   And actively building a major EV battery factory here stateside.  Can't recall where, maybe Tulsa or something?

They're not like some of the hyper-speculative plays that's got an experimental battery in a lab that they hope to commercialize in 5-10 years.  They make and sell the batteries now.  Batteries that every automaker needs for all the EV's they're promising to put out this year.  

And as for those futuristic new tech batteries, Micro-vast does R&D just like everyone else.  So their real world experience plus time and development funded by ongoing revenues means that conceivably they'll keep pace with the futuristic battery plays.

They're in the tail end of merging which has meant share price volatility.  I think it peaked somewhere $23-26 when the merger was announced, now down around $11-12, so arguably it may be on sale.  The bear case is said to be that they haven't been well run prior to the merger, and that big auto may find other suppliers for batteries.  I consider it likely that many automakers will do just that, however I can't believe that *all* the automakers will find other suppliers.  As long as one or two use Micro-vast, that gets the flywheel spinning.  

And it's a little known fact of automotive supply chain that most parts have one or two or three suppliers.  So when there's a brake drum on a vehicle, it could have been made for GM by company A or company B.  The automaker does this to grind the suppliers against each other and to have diversity in their production supply chain.  The parts get the same part number and built to look identical.  So other than some little punch mark or something, you never really know which sub-supplier made the component.  Thus I could see Micro-vast being one of multiple suppliers of commodity battery packs for some automaker.  If EV's take off, automakers will be scrambling to find suppliers, and Micro-vast is (presumably) ready."

2021-06-27 10:56:34,stocks,"I’ve seen this before, but when I tried to look into it myself, I couldn’t find the info. I probably wasn’t looking in the right place. I have ~35 shares of ABML, so I’m not doubting it but I told myself I wouldn’t increase my shares until I was able to find more info on them. It’s pretty sparse, but I Im newer to trading stocks."
2021-06-27 08:58:32,stocks,"The problem with commodities is there’s no moat and everyone with half a brain sees these trends coming.  It’s not a secret that the world will need more copper, the question is where’s the pricing leverage in that supply chain and also where’s the underinvestment."
2021-06-27 00:54:00,stocks,"Would not necessarily count on it, since it’s OTC markets and not as much info. Market watch and Barron’s shows while assets have grown they only have 250k in cash ? Lol i need to look more into it myself maybe I just don’t understand mining as much"
2021-06-27 15:47:25,stocks,Lithium is needed for the batteries and their plant is right by Tesla’s new plant.
2021-06-27 14:08:13,stocks,Tesla’s factory is in Reno and ABML has a lithium mine outside of Tonopah NV... about 4 hours away.
2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Are share-borrowing fees dynamic? Let's say I borrow shares to short a stock and get charged 1.5% annual interest on the shares. But a week later, the interest rate for that stock is reported to be 20%. Would that affect me or is the new interest rate only apply for people who borrow on that particular day?"
2021-06-27 00:32:43,stocks,"Depends on the broker, the stock, the contract. It’s not one size fits all."
2021-06-27 08:29:00,stocks,Careful who you short. If the interest rates have increased that typically means volatility in the stock.
2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"How much did Reddit change your investment strategy? Did Reddit either influence or change your investment strategy, by that I mean you had a sound strategy when you first started investing and it was changed due to reddit influence. I think redditors know alot about tech sector more than anything. So I bought more tech companies than I anticipated. 

What about you guys, how much did reddit influence your investment strategy?"
2021-06-27 00:23:45,stocks,"I've never made an investing decision based solely on what someone on Reddit says. But I do think the discussion is useful.

For example, I was talking with someone the other day about copper stocks, specifically SCCO. I was arguing it's in a dip and a strong buy. Someone else pointed out the very valid reasons that the price is down. He/she was very polite about it and gave me an alternative view to consider.

I'm not going to make any decisions based solely on that discussion, but I did get some new information I could weigh against what I already think."
2021-06-27 00:01:57,stocks,"You merely adopted the Reddit investing strategy. I was born in it, Molded by it."
2021-06-27 00:57:24,stocks,It's a source of information. This is good.
2021-06-27 00:06:41,stocks,"None. Most of my holdings and investment philosophy run very counter to the general reddit M.O. But I do like to answer questions, have found a few cool communities, and will occasionally see a unique post that gives me something to look into."
2021-06-27 00:56:25,stocks,It didn’t I lost a lot of money fomo
2021-06-27 02:51:17,stocks,"It made me want to start investing. Some good choices made, some bad. Now I have a lot of green energy etfs which seem to suck.  Also PLTR lol"
2021-06-27 04:08:26,stocks,"It made me hold firm to my decision to invest in ETFs and AAPL, basically put some cash aside monthly and forget about it in investments.  After the shit show of GME and onwards I have no interest in fast profit with high volatility stock."
2021-06-27 00:23:19,stocks,Well to be honest they made me invest. I would have not done so otherwise. I never looked into it now thanks to Reddit I have several good stocks.
2021-06-27 12:24:10,stocks,"reddit did amazing things for my portfolio. bought gme at 410, sold at 350. bought amc at 14, sold at 11. bought it again at 60, sold at 52. memories to cherish."
2021-06-27 01:20:49,stocks,"Not much really, I mean I invest more now, but that might be because im 18 now which means I can do it easily.

And even if it didn’t change anything it reinforced a feeling of not trusting anyone on the internet, if you don’t see it you should never do it and should be even more discouraged if there is a shit ton of people behaving speculating constantly about it"
2021-06-27 08:10:16,stocks,"Beyond r/options there’s a lot of noise on here. Literally anytime I’ve jumped on someone’s dd it’s been bad. Although, I’ve made a lot of profit with AMC GME, nothing else has worked out. Now I either short someone’s bright idea or I just avoid it and that has actually worked out really good"
2021-06-27 04:52:18,stocks,I threw everything out of the window and fomoed into memestocks
2021-06-27 05:30:41,stocks,"Before reddit I was ""buy low sell high"". Now it's ""buy high sell low""."
2021-06-27 01:31:51,stocks,"I've noticed I hold less now, gonna try working on that. Then again the stock I held was Tesla from 250 to 900 pre split. (I'm still a bit salty on that one) and AMD from 18 to 36."
2021-06-27 00:43:08,stocks,It made me trade options which I would probably never have considered otherwise
2021-06-27 08:38:12,stocks,Found r/bogleheads.  It’s easy to get caught up in a lot of stuff.  Boglehead has kept me sane and level through the chaos of the last 6 months.  With an emergency fund and boglehead strategy I can unemotionally invest snd not worry up or down.  The market “is what it is”. Can’t control it so why try?
2021-06-27 03:20:10,stocks,Helped me grow from $35k to $2.5M in 1.5 years so I have a lot to be thankful to Reddit for
2021-06-27 02:59:58,stocks,Is this the Reddit IPO? I'm looking for a Reddit IPO.
2021-06-27 11:08:18,stocks,"I‘m only at the stockmarket because of reddit.

Made 300% in 4 Month."
2021-06-27 01:16:46,stocks,I've made a few pennies off the memes
2021-06-27 02:08:34,stocks,"I read it all the time and get new ideas, but then I come back to my senses and invest in VTI and VXUS."
2021-06-27 00:12:04,stocks,Zero
2021-06-27 07:30:29,stocks,"Not at all. I started my investment journey before reddit by reading the classic books on the subject. After that If ormed my plan, backed by research, and acted on it. The end result was very much a ""Boglehead"" style but I did it all long before I ever saw their sub.



I've seen bull and beat market, all kinds of pumps and dumps. I've stayed true to my plan and so far it's worked fine. It's not the best, I'll not retire tomorrow, but the worst I ever saw during the Corona crash was - 18%."
2021-06-27 07:41:59,stocks,"I was doing my own research and stocks that i liked i was aiming for low volatility high yield dividend I was up decent amount... around 10% 

My first call with Pfizer because they were working on a vaccine and didn't sell when the news came out and got slatted. Turns out after big news the stock falls because everyone sells the news. 

Still up like 15% up to the year from March to December

Then I actually paid attention to reddit, now I'm up 600% since January"
2021-06-27 08:01:56,stocks,"Over the course of about a year, I went from holding a low-cost index fund in Vanguard to day trading on thinkorswim. It’s been quite a ride.

Edit: day trading may be inaccurate. Some are short term trades and options bets and others are medium to long-term holds"
2021-06-27 08:29:30,stocks,I use Reddit as a tool. Someone says something interesting about a stock with good evidence. I then look more into it then decide if its a buy or not.
2021-06-27 10:47:25,stocks,As others have stated it’s definitely not something to take as gospel. But it’s definitely opened my eyes to other viewpoints and stocks for me to do my DD on.
2021-06-27 11:36:36,stocks,"I had etfs almost 4 years.  Started reading  all the reddit info Communities and the dd on corruption to small businesses was so sickening I changed over everything I had.  So yep, reddit influenced me in a good way, a great way!  I'm doing very well now!  And I love Millenials too!  (From Old hippee boomer!)"
2021-06-27 11:57:19,stocks,"It got better over time, Buy high and sell low."
2021-06-27 12:43:20,stocks,"Reddit introduced me to the concept of FIRE four years ago.

I was always a good saver and saved nearly half of my income even when my husband and I only brought in 40k per year total. In 2017, I got a job paying twice that and had no idea how to appropriately “use” my new salary and cash so I spent a lot of time searching Reddit to see what others did in this scenario and came across fire, later followed by this sub and others.

Now, we make double that again with a similar lifestyle, are on track to retire in our late forties, and I read Reddit every day for financial discussions and fun. I like reading other’s financial stories but r/stocks does give me some ideas for stocks to research and DD, but also serves as a good barometer for market sentiment in certain industries like tech."
2021-06-27 04:18:25,stocks,"Damn Reddit managed to plant FOMO deluxe into my brain during the GME Hype. i always thought that  i will never be affected by FOMO.

A friend of mine got out of GME with huge succes (Like 500% plus on a 50k € investment) and I liquidiated a big portion of my portfolio for GME just for GME to crash. 

My Broker (Trade Republic from Germany) was not available for a whole day as i saw my money vaporizing in front of my eyes.

So Reddit teached me that i am in fact not immune to FOMO. Even better it teached me how fcking stupid i was as i watched my previously liquidiated stocks keep rising higher and higher.

FML

I now have 5 stocks that i will not touch for at least 5 years even if the world collides."
2021-06-27 06:44:44,stocks,"Did reddit impact my investment strategy?

Yeah, yes it did. I started doing it. I started investing because of reddit.

Why? 

I was - for the first time in my life - exposed to people who were actively investing instead of just being told to send money to a mutual fund. Sending money to a mutual fund (which I had been doing) is about as exciting as going to church. Thoughts and prayers shit. You aren't engaged by thoughts and prayers, your role is passive. It's fucking boring.

Reddit exposed me to people who were actually doing things. Instead of sitting on my ass praying, I was making the things other people were praying about happen. I, I was doing it. And I was in the middle of a bunch of crayon eating, window lickers who were doing it as well. Did we fuck up a lot? Sure. That's why we eat crayons and then lick windows to get the taste out of our mouths, but we were doing it - like a bunch of five year olds learning T ball.

So, here we are, beating the fuck out of hedge funds like a bunch of five year old T ball players swarming the Ump, all of us swinging our tiny little bats, biting the shit out of ankles. It's amazing.  And, on top of it, I'm making a decent return. Me. Making informed bets and winning every so often.

What's not to love?"
2021-06-27 06:30:50,stocks,"It made me start investing in stocks (until then I was only in ETFs and looking into stocks). It also made me realize I don’t really want to be trading stocks, so now I’m looking for the best time to cashout and reinvest it back into ETFs. 

I’m really not the “look into your portfolio everyday” kind of guy, so while I catch the bullish momentum of some stocks, I rarely detect the downfall, so I’m much better with the “dump and forget” logic of ETFs. I’m in for the long term, so is the best strategy for me.

I’ll miss some big gains for sure, but also some big losses.

In any case it was a big learning opportunity so I’m thankful for this community."
2021-06-27 02:32:21,stocks,It hasn’t
2021-06-27 04:53:41,stocks,I have  x10 BB i probably wouldn't have bought if I hadn't been influenced. But you live and learn... I am now in for the long
2021-06-27 05:00:54,stocks,"Everyone will try to push their narratives down your throat, trust the data, not the people."
2021-06-27 06:09:50,stocks,"If anything, I think they've told me that ""risk is ok"" and to take it. I've been mostly in blue chips my entire trading career.  Maybe buying NKLA at $93 was a bad move...ok got it. But others have been doing well and making money, returns that I wouldn't realize on blue chips.  Now, that said, I still have my blue chips, but I've opened up to more risk and found it's not so scary due to various Reddit threads."
2021-06-27 07:58:37,stocks,"Almost entirely changed. Like some of the others commenters, I’m not going to entirely change my investment strategy on a whim. That being said, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed reading so many different investment strategies other Redditors have, which has allowed me to pick and choose the parts I thought applied best for my situation.  I’m still developing my strategy and I’m not quite at the position where I’ve fully implemented my plan, but I should be there in another year. Then I just have to worry about maintaining the strategy."
2021-06-27 08:09:47,stocks,Got lucky and 20x my money. I now I have a major gambling addiction.
2021-06-27 08:41:03,stocks,Reddit was the big catalyst for my investment and helped my account triple since last year. Very thankful for this community.
2021-06-27 08:51:25,stocks,Reddit gave me a choice of a red blue or blue pill. I made my choice free will.
2021-06-27 09:03:37,stocks,"I made a few grand off of meme stocks. I wouldn't have bought them without that push because they just don't have the fundamentals in place to support their stock price being that high. 

I don't have that much invested, but I went from $1800 to $20,000 last year without doing ""risky"" calls or puts. Just straight buying and selling."
2021-06-27 10:17:56,stocks,"Prior to Reddit, I’ve always wanted to invest but was too chicken to hit the send button because I always thought investing was too risky and I’ll lose everything. I learned a lot about the different index fund/ETFs I can safely invest in. I still yolo a lot but thanks to Reddit it opened a whole new world for passive income."
2021-06-27 10:24:50,stocks,It actually created my investing strategy. The only contact I ever had w/ the market was IBM stock my aunt gifted me when I was a kid. I thought the market was WAY too complex for a non-math kid (I’m a lawyer) to get involved in. Pleasantly a lot of the subs here have had amazing advice on everything from dividends to growth stocks and I definitely have more of an understand of the market and am actually excited to be invested and building my future. Also it’s Reddit so don’t take everything on it for a gospel truth lol
2021-06-27 11:09:10,stocks,My entire strategy is based on Reddit. So far i'm up 1000%
2021-06-27 11:32:39,stocks,The only thing I use Reddit for is when I see a ticker that wasn't on my radar.
2021-06-27 16:35:20,stocks,Made a ton of money riding meme stocks and selling to Reddit investors at ATH who were thinking these stocks were going to be worth 10k a share.
2021-06-27 01:59:50,stocks,It made me short GME calls on Thursdays and Fridays based on all the crazy hype.
2021-06-27 02:07:03,stocks,This seems to be going towards a collusion play. I liked this stock on my own and I will continue to hold it until my sell point is met.
2021-06-27 06:38:56,stocks,Yep. From 0 to XXk on stock market.
2021-06-27 09:08:07,stocks,I used to invest in companies to secure a 10-20% return in swing trades. Now I just yolo my money into AMC and GME.
2021-06-27 07:06:40,stocks,"I'm 100% invested on game stop, so it changed....nothing?"
2021-06-27 06:50:48,stocks,Reddit is such an awful place. It should only be used for entertainment.
2021-06-27 09:30:34,stocks,"yeah i used to be long mutuals

Then I went 100% into the gee emm eeeeee"
2021-06-27 01:37:53,stocks,"It tipped me off on Lumen and Viacom which are green, but probably my two worst performers, so there's that. 

More generally it has made me more skeptical of claims about companies and exacerbated my contrarian streak."
2021-06-27 03:52:01,stocks,Reddit was the app that actually got me into investing and I do use to check people’s opinion on other stocks but I don’t use it too much.
2021-06-27 04:27:12,stocks,Not at all - I'm still a dumb fuck.
2021-06-27 05:13:08,stocks,Made me aware of options. Still doing my research and haven’t done anything yet
2021-06-27 05:19:34,stocks,I leaned so much in a short time period. I am grateful
2021-06-27 05:57:08,stocks,We are the future
2021-06-27 06:25:29,stocks,"Not much, I mainly come for confirmation bias. They did show me PLTR and wheel trading which worked out"
2021-06-27 06:28:55,stocks,You use something other than reddit?
2021-06-27 07:06:16,stocks,"It changed me from investing semi-blindly into a partial technical trader, and it’s primarily because I don’t want to do what some on WSB do and yolo my money into risky plays."
2021-06-27 07:17:18,stocks,"Reddit has influenced my strategy a lot. Before I didn’t yolo into a stock after reading DD, now I buy meme stocks after reading DD."
2021-06-27 07:58:03,stocks,My investment strategy was time deposit and forget. Reddit helped me discover other sources of investing and the stock market.
2021-06-27 08:35:57,stocks,"I started investing in stocks last year and it's fair to say I was initially drawn into a lot of the Reddit hype. I made some good money on some of it, and lost a shit load on other over hyped stocks. 6 months on I learned my lesson and decided to pick up a few books and looked at alternative sources for investing and I believe I'm on a better path now of looking at the funamentals of a company rather than getting sucked into the hype. These days I ignore 90+% of what is being hyped on Reddit, but you can still find some good stuff here and there."
2021-06-27 08:36:45,stocks,"Well I use it for a combination, I’m not American, so using Reddit led me to good stock picks such as O. However I must admit I also use Reddit to see what stocks I should avoid. Usually when Reddit hypes up a stock it’s about to crash or slowly bleed out."
2021-06-27 08:39:10,stocks,YOLO $DKNG. Might have done it anyways but seeing so many high risk derivatives moves my YOLO felt mild.
2021-06-27 08:40:39,stocks,I started by investing in several companies using one brokerage account. Now I own shares of just one company spread between several brokers.
2021-06-27 08:43:58,stocks,"Sometimes, I jump on the bandwagon to attempt to make a few quick bucks.

If I'm trading a stock and it becomes a fave here, I watch it closely and will consider getting rid of it."
2021-06-27 08:48:59,stocks,"It used to be a good place. Now it’s just meme stock this, and to the moon that. It really started with ARKK and TSLA, every other post would be about someone asking if going 70% into Ark Funds and 30% in TSLA was a good idea."
2021-06-27 08:52:50,stocks,"Reddit and to a lesser extent YouTube is what turned me on to investing in general, I went down the FIRE rabbit hole and starting putting money into index funds in tax advantage accounts. 

It's also influenced the choices of stocks I've bought with my $400 Robinhood account which is currently 95% in SPCE."
2021-06-27 09:00:07,stocks,"The cesspool of degenerates that is Reddit, made me change my strategy to listening to BRKA annual meetings…"
2021-06-27 09:04:42,stocks,None. Increased my conviction though.
2021-06-27 09:13:59,stocks,"I only started investing back in March. My original plan was to find businesses that were hurt by the pandemic but I felt had a chance of recovering now that things are opening back up. 
After joining Reddit I learned about ETFs and dividends. I began expanding my portfolio into other sectors. So yeah Reddit definitely helped me learn better ways to invest."
2021-06-27 09:14:27,stocks,"I would say it has made me a touch more conservative and diligent. I've always been big on the research aspect of investing even before reddit, its a hobby to me, but reading some of the horror stories on here definitely has made me a bit more gunshy and thorough before I even think of placing an order. 

Of course, my most successful individual holding, Digital Turbine, I was blacked out at a beach bar, and invested on a whim on the advise of some 21 year old frat bro...so...yeah"
2021-06-27 09:16:02,stocks,"I started because of Reddit. I bought close to top of gme and sold very shortly after. Panicked. Realised I could turn this into a money making hobby. 

I realised thanks to daytrading Reddit a lot of common mistakes. 

""Average down"" doesn't really work at a day trading level, it's for long term holds. 

Stop losses are your friend. Use them. 

Record your trades. You'll stop your mistakes so fast. 

Number a trades a day doesn't make you better. 1 safe trade can earn far more than 50 high risk plays.

Stop when your up. I've had 100%+ trades with BBBY, wendies and woof interweek, but the first 2 I stupidly went back in at the top and lost gains plus some with BBBY. Emotions are dumb."
2021-06-27 09:17:46,stocks,"I started following a lot of meme stocks, but I haven’t taken any positions based on Reddit."
2021-06-27 09:24:43,stocks,It made me realize how easy money dumb money is. Reddit kids never factcheck anything. Ever.
2021-06-27 09:25:05,stocks,I only day trade high volume meme stocks now.
2021-06-27 09:28:06,stocks,Good god please don’t let a social media strategy site change your investing strategy. It’s a good place to get info but don’t base your finances (or your relationships. Or your health ) solely on the comments of random unqualified strangers.
2021-06-27 09:30:32,stocks,"I started investing a couple years before I joined reddit, so I already had a general idea in mind about a strategy when I started.  Over time goals have changed, and that has caused changes in my investment strategies.

Reddit has been a great resource in expanding my view of markets and investing in general and in specific ways.  Crowd-sourcing ideas and strategies helps close the gap between individuals and institutes."
2021-06-27 09:33:04,stocks,Well I went from not investing to just yoloing meme stocks for weed money
2021-06-27 09:46:44,stocks,"i use reddit to inform myself. i seldom invest in any dds, but there are rare cases where i see a post and 15 minutes later i invest in it. 
but only if i understand the concept. if i have no clue about an topic or an company i dont.

my investments are always high risk high reward. and so far it went good.

i could spend time looking for companies myself but when i do i always land in asia / taiwan and cant invest in these companies from here"
2021-06-27 09:47:59,stocks,"“Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.”

I like to browse Reddit to see what everyone’s buying and I’ll know by then it’s at or near the peak. This helped me sell out of ARK funds and solar companies at the start of the year.

Then there’s things people call falling knives or moan about being down 50% or more, it’s mostly because they bought meme stocks but sometimes there’s value — I’ve been buying a lot of Chinese companies this year based on the negative social media sentiment."
2021-06-27 09:51:13,stocks,I didn't trade options before Reddit.  Very mixed blessing there.
2021-06-27 10:01:08,stocks,"Not much. Most of my investments that have done well really havent been talked about much online or in the news. Which is a bit supricing to me since some stocks are so damn obvious buys .. and very predictable for a while. 

But some stocks are nice to see on reddit but I think most know that reddit doesnt push any stock.. its other big money that do that job. So when ever I can see which bank is buying a stock (which broker), then I can tell if they know something that I dont.. they tend to buy in heavy before a pop. Or before they release what ever they know. Its quite interesting and not all stocks show this.."
2021-06-27 10:03:25,stocks,"I don't know about changing my strategy, but I got into a lot of stocks early because of the great insight from the people of Reddit. One example being $SE, which I first bought at $42 because of a Reddit post. Appreciate everyone here!"
2021-06-27 10:06:34,stocks,Reddit IS my investment strategy
2021-06-27 10:07:55,stocks,"Before Reddit I would strategize, now I trust in memes"
2021-06-27 10:09:50,stocks,Moved me from only US diversification to 40% global allocation - pretty signifiant asset allocation change.
2021-06-27 10:10:42,stocks,Absolutely not. It's Reddit.
2021-06-27 10:13:35,stocks,Zero
2021-06-27 10:14:13,stocks,Reddit IS my investment strategy
2021-06-27 10:16:08,stocks,Reddit taught me not to listen to people on the Internet
2021-06-27 10:17:55,stocks,Didn’t change me 1 bit. I was “Bogle head” and always will be. In fact I found whole community of Bogle heads!
2021-06-27 10:19:39,stocks,I learned that your not only investing in a company but also gambling on the outcome of the price... The fact that price can be manipulated more by the gamblers rather than investors is a fundamental disparity that will forever destroy the economic structure of the market.
2021-06-27 10:24:07,stocks,It is good help while making second opinion
2021-06-27 10:32:10,stocks,"I realized that my DD has actual substance. I used to assume everyone did the same DD I did, but everyone Has a much simpler DD, for example technical analysis. Me personally, I consider P/E, profit margin, ROE, and the dividend yield of a business, and my current favorite S&P 500 pick is VZ, based on my analysis, and is about 9% of my portfolio."
2021-06-27 10:32:20,stocks,"Reddit inspired me to look more into alternative data such as mentions, sentiment, Twitter reactions, employee reviews etc. I took all that data for hundreds of public companies and put it on a dashboard that’s updated daily, [DilliBits.com](https://DilliBits.com). So far, it’s been very interesting."
2021-06-27 10:35:24,stocks,No effect
2021-06-27 10:36:24,stocks,"I have always invested based on fundamentals. Now I pay more atention to technicals and sentiment. I wouldnt say I time the market, but i do have better timing now."
2021-06-27 10:38:37,stocks,"yea I came here with the idea of putting 90% in Spy and 10% in riskier stocks (like AMD omg) and now I have 20% spy, 40% growth, 20% options, 20% penny stocks lol."
2021-06-27 10:42:48,stocks,"Reddit is the progenitor to my investment strategy, lol."
2021-06-27 10:43:27,stocks,"I'm not bankrupt yet, so thankfully not TOO much."
2021-06-27 10:49:33,stocks,100%. Went from straight ETFs to full r/weedstocks
2021-06-27 10:51:26,stocks,The problem here that whatever making a lot of profit becomes a trend but too late
2021-06-27 10:52:30,stocks,"100% in some areas. 0% in others. I have a account that is strictly throw away money that used on “social media investing”. Goal is swing trades between 10-30%. So far up 100% ish. 

Otherwise, my true retirement growth is 0% affected by Reddit."
2021-06-27 10:55:43,stocks,"I used to be a complete index junkie, now I have a good chunk of individual stocks. Plus I get all my news from reddit.

I've also decided to buy one stock of the worst 5 s&p 500 stocks each year. Just an experiment."
2021-06-27 10:57:50,stocks,I stopped buying etfs and i started buying individual stocks
2021-06-27 11:01:32,stocks,"Went from value plays to meme plays, and now back to value plays."
2021-06-27 11:06:34,stocks,It did change my way of analyzing stocks; I now dig deeper. It opened my eyes to what MSM is pushing but more so the why's MSM is pushing something.
2021-06-27 11:22:22,stocks,"I've started investing in the things that people recommended who were downvoted to shit . Most people in this sub and other investing/trading subs are legitimate idiots who have only gotten into the stock market in the past year, check their account history. So when I see someone downvoted for recommending people invest in something like VOO/VTI/QQQ or ""companies you KNOW"" instead of the Reddit hype stocks it meant something to me.

Since then, I've essentially dumped all my holdings and now only have 3 holdings in my portfolio. VTI, QQQ, and NVDA and couldn't be happier. I haven't looked at my portfolio in 4 months and I'm up 45% on NVDA and ~7% on VTI/QQQ. They aren't insane gains but I would guarantee they're better than the majority of people dishing out investing advice here on Reddit."
2021-06-27 11:22:53,stocks,"I started looking at tsla by a youtube channel
and gme by a subreddit. Now I am long on both. I studied both a little and try to read up anytime they do anything new. All by investment strategies are based on expecting a return by 2026."
2021-06-27 11:31:21,stocks,"I was very new in the stock market and would trade small things daily, constantly falling for p&d scams or emotionally investing.

I don’t invest based on what people on Reddit say, but it’s taught me to research my investments in depth and ignore emotions when investing. Being able to hold through red when I need and hold on gains when needed.

I’m still actively learning, but just those few things learned from Reddit has probably kept me from losing a lot of money."
2021-06-27 11:32:44,stocks,"Have a retirement account that is unaffected by Reddit and is up close to 200% last couple years.

Have a short term account with about 40k in it that is up 15k from beginning of this year"
2021-06-27 11:33:04,stocks,"It didn’t. I read about stuff here but for the most part I just keep on doing what I’ve been doing already.

Maybe it’s because I don’t have THAT many funds."
2021-06-27 11:38:04,stocks,Just gives me ideas of places to look into
2021-06-27 11:44:39,stocks,0
2021-06-27 11:44:59,stocks,Reddit gave me an investment strategy.  I never really understood investing up until 2 years ago.  The amount of reading has been tremendous but with people willing to simplify things I've been understanding a lot faster
2021-06-27 11:46:01,stocks,Contrarian here. I typically go the opposite way of Reddit on financial matters.
2021-06-27 11:50:52,stocks,100% spielstopp
2021-06-27 11:55:57,stocks,Reddit taught me to go all-in
2021-06-27 12:04:19,stocks,None. I’m a buy and hold beta virgin. But I’ll cry my self to sleep with my profits.
2021-06-27 12:05:03,stocks,Counter trade Reddit stocks
2021-06-27 12:08:30,stocks,Honestly Reddit gives some of the worst investment advice... I used to try to talk about tesla before it's 100x run and I would get downvoted instantly and no good discussion.... everyone on Reddit just saying index funds which is a great thing if you don't know how to pick stocks but this is a stock sub so I'd expect more people talking stocks here
2021-06-27 12:10:25,stocks,I now know to check WSB if something I own is randomly  jumping (i.e. BB or Corsair). Helps to know to take profit and buy back lol
2021-06-27 12:16:24,stocks,"I always thought investment wasn't for me until the GME/AMC saga. Coincidentally I also got Revolut at the same time while allowed me to dip my toes into Crytpo and Stocks. My first investment was AMC at $17. 

Anyway it's not worth it for me to do hours and hours of research just for a 10% annual return. Perhaps if I have 5 figures to invest I would, but I've only invested 1 weeks worth of wages across my entire portfolio so far, so I use reddit to discover new stocks or keep an eye on my current ones. For me it's fun and gambling. For serous amounts I plan on putting my money into ETFs and Treasury bonds. Mostly the latter."
2021-06-27 12:20:00,stocks,What’s an investment strategy?
2021-06-27 12:21:26,stocks,never
2021-06-27 12:26:30,stocks,"Moved me from normal stock investing to a much “safer” etf strategy. Also core satellite strategy seems very promising…not using it at the moment, but I like it."
2021-06-27 12:30:33,stocks,"It really hasn’t.  Honestly not overly impressed with most of what I see here.

Mostly just “hodl!” and videos worshipping DFV and people pushing meme stocks like they’re buying lottery tickets."
2021-06-27 12:36:34,stocks,Ive been investing going on my third year and my long portfolio is up 90+% do to how the market reacted to the Covid ordeal.. while it seemed everyone was getting out I decided to go Warren Buffet mode and dive into it hard. I hold a solid green Portfolio with nice growth and dividend payouts... Then a few months ago i find Riddit....I started a WEBull account and although ive had what seems to be alot of red I have made some really good gains that outweigh the red..Riddit has put me in a mindset that i can make my weekly paycheck and I can also now double or triple my income weekly...Riddit has helped me let go of the emotional part of investing and now win or loos im having me a damn good time....
2021-06-27 12:39:55,stocks,Strategy? I can hardly claim to have any real stragety.
2021-06-27 12:42:33,stocks,Saw a bunch of smooth brains do dumb shit which made me have more stable ETFs. Done well since.
2021-06-27 12:43:04,stocks,"I've dabbled in some things people have recommended, but most of them turned out quite poorly.

Sometimes people have real gems of comments which I do find incredibly useful, but normally these are people that work in that industry and have real insights to provide. 

I agree redditor knows a lot more about tech than other industries (I work in tech myself). Reddit also loves talking about Biotech, but that industry is generally way to volatile for me and I think most of the time Reddit talks about it's a pure pump and dump.

For the most part I've shifted back to fully my own investment style & DD, although I still do a lot of browsing and if a nugget shows up (that isn't a meme stock), I'll look into it more myself."
2021-06-27 12:55:12,stocks,It is the same. I was not so smart before… and I continue to make not so smart decisions.
2021-06-27 13:02:41,stocks,it has taght me to step out side my boomer strategy every once in a while and pick up a ticker as a swing trade
2021-06-27 13:05:58,stocks,Reddit or this subreddit?
2021-06-27 13:08:47,stocks,WSB definitely got me buying meme stocks and they’ve been doing aight. This sub got me buying ETF’s and I love them
2021-06-27 13:50:03,stocks,"I use various social media platforms to guage broad sentiment as my trades usually work best when I'm doing the opposite of ""the herd"""
2021-06-27 14:10:04,stocks,I dont buy stocks solely on what Reddit folks think or say but i do like to read these forums for the reason to hear or find out other people’s opinions. I also learn new things and if i find them interesting i do my own research on it. I find Reddit very useful when it comes to investments.
2021-06-27 14:22:55,stocks,None
2021-06-27 15:01:00,stocks,"I just want to say i joined Reddit because two of my friends had Reddit accounts just to watch Hold My Juice Box and Hold My Feeding Tube videos. So I started an account. But I started trading at age 55 because of Reddit and GME. Think about it. Now there’s a platform where people share ideas and trading strategies. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all for sharing your wisdom and experience. I wish I would have done this years ago. I go to thrift shops and know a good deal when I see one, why not research and do the same w/ stocks. Maybe I made it harder than it needed to be. Thank you everyone!!"
2021-06-27 15:24:35,stocks,You mean shaped my strategy?
2021-06-27 15:26:49,stocks,Nope! Not follow these pumpers
2021-06-27 15:35:10,stocks,Became a bogglehead and actually increased my net worth a lot!
2021-06-27 15:42:29,stocks,Reddit made my investment strategy more aggressive which produced greater returns
2021-06-27 17:44:40,stocks,Not at all. I haven’t been influenced by Redditors. Only use it for entertainment
2021-06-27 17:52:53,stocks,Yes
2021-06-27 18:02:44,stocks,I never make an investment unless I can find ppl on reddit who disagree
2021-06-27 18:24:23,stocks,Reddit added the meme trade to my investing repertoire.
2021-06-27 18:41:53,stocks,"I would call my investment style now as ""super aggressively risky""."
2021-06-27 19:23:54,stocks,Who?
2021-06-27 19:31:53,stocks,Mostly use it to find stocks to stay away from.
2021-06-27 19:34:56,stocks,Changed it drastically. Had minor returns prior to it. Now retired!
2021-06-27 03:15:39,stocks,"Twitter is a little more helpful with strategy, entry points, new catalysts for stocks

Reddit helps me with DDs and confirmation bias haha"
2021-06-27 04:22:54,stocks,"I was actually put off by how most people invest in here (not because it‘s bad or annoying, just not my style. I‘m trying to grow my account at a fast rate to have decent money in my late 20ies already).

Boglehead or longterm investing wasn‘t my choice, esp. in this market, because return is minimal and the likelihood of a crash big. Candlestick trading isn‘t sth for me either, i need to read more on that it seems. I‘m just not good enough already. 

So, I basically have a few stocks now that always stay in the same area price-wise, and i use leverage on 1-2 day long trades before exiting with about 5-10% profit."
2021-06-27 07:34:30,stocks,"Wait, strategy?"

The question is usually if it’s done falling or the price over corrected"
2021-06-27 00:31:19,stocks,So is copper a buy or no? :)
2021-06-27 08:50:52,stocks,"I did. It didn't feel like I did, but in hindsight what one person said ended up coloring my interpretation of the stock and market movement, and I bailed on something that's moved up 20% in a month since then.

I let someone else's unfounded generalizations infect my thinking.

Demand proof and criticize illogic and assumptions, or disregard the ideas entirely."
2021-06-27 10:18:40,stocks,"I’ve seen some good DD on here, but I always use it as a jumping off point to do my own DD

I made a lot of money on MT and TX (steel plays) after reading some good posts on steel, then after doing my own research and seeing that the numbers (free cash flow, return on equity, EV/EBITDA, etc) we’re all insane and learning that the theory for steel to continue to grow made sense. 

ABEV is another one. Saw a good post on it, did my own research and saw it had by far the best numbers of all the other beer manufacturers and also had some potential due to Brazil currency, and make a great return on it.

Of course a large portion of the tickets I see on here are bad that don’t hold up to my own further scrutiny"
2021-06-27 02:22:59,stocks,"I think most companies have good reason to be low, but for some reason, anything undervalued is worth a squeeze, so you just  cross your fingers that the reddit wave will come in and print you some money.

2021-06-27 12:45:52,stocks,"Same here. I know a person at work who was into stock market, but i kinda didn’t take his words seriously as i thought i don’t have enough money and knowledge to do it. 

Then I discovered reddit/wsb and found a lot of people in the same boat as me or was me few years ago.. reading DDs, personal stories, loss/gains actually gave me confidence..

Now here I am still learning but my portfolio is in better shape now. 

Hopefully AAPL, DIS, AMD, V, MSFT, ARKK, GS, BABA, LOW, and a fuck ton VTI keep on rising and help me retire years early."

But it’s also just as likely that I got lucky."
2021-06-27 08:01:50,stocks,"look for scary headlines. 

“People can’t Tell good news from bad news.” I think mark Twain or some genius. Look for whatever headlines you think people are over reacting to or has a silver lining people aren’t talking about yet. 

A good example could be industry regulation. People think corporations in that industry may lose value. But that’s backwards, that means the industry is growing and powerful. Likely the big players lobbied and wrote the legislation to stifle new competition.

All the better if you find the headlines in regular news or social media. Because if it’s in a niche for serious investors, the. You have to decide if this is the beginning of a news cycle or the end. If it’s the beginning, then your trying to catch a falling knife and will fail. If you see it on cable news or Facebook, then the “bad” news is priced in"

2021-06-27 10:52:24,stocks,">A good example could be industry regulation.

100% agreed. 

A rather obscure, but very clear-cut example is some FUD around the Peruvian presidential election. When it became clear who would win (Castillo), there was a lot of FUD in anything with exposure to Peruvian mines, because Castillo grabbed headlines by saying he would nationalize all the biggest mining operations in the country. 

Anything that tanked as he emerged the winner over the course of May was failing to take into account that he has since walked back this position (likely because Peru's Congress will never allow it), and has instead said he only wants to raise taxes. 

However, the irrational fear of ""ZOMG socialism"" holds strong, particularly in the US, so that fear is baked into prices regardless of reality."

2021-06-27 00:00:00,stocks,"Lightning eMotors (ZEV) added to the Russell Microcap Index. Undervalued commercial EV play with sector dominance and strong growth What I like about Lightning eMotors (ZEV) is that they dominate a niche space that stands to grow very quickly. Rather than focusing on ""last-mile” lighter-duty vehicles, which would compete with high volume manufacturers, they use a medium-duty legacy chassis to take advantage of existing “upfit ecosystems” that  class 3-7 fleet commercial fleets actively depend on. This means easy electrification of ambulances, street cleaners, refrigerator trucks, and lifts as well as universal access to easily sourced spare parts for critical maintenance. 

While preserving fleet owners' capital investments, their legacy chassis strategy also gives them a first mover advantage by clearing them of all federal and state safety certifications, thus removing a major time and logistics obstacle.  This is why Lightning eMotors already has over 50% marketshare. 

Because the vehicles are designed for long lifespan and they are expensive to modify, fleet operators commonly change out drive trains rather than buy new vehicles. Now, because of sound economics and government mandates, instead of a new diesel drive train, they are moving to electric. This growing demand is why ZEV is dramatically expanding its Colorado-based facility and is expected to grow 195% CAGR over the next 4 years. 

Overview of some key points:

* First mover advantage — They’ve shipped more than 3x biggest competitor and currently control more than 50% market share in class 3-7 EV.
* Quarterly YoY revenue growth: 560%
* 2021 projected revenue is 100% contracted with pipeline of $800 million in sales
* Zero Debt and Low Capex assembly of vehicles 
* Projected 195% CAGR with $2 billion revenue by 2025 driven by government and corporate mandates to electrify commercial fleets.  That kind of revenue relative to their current $662 million market cap offers a sense of the value proposition, especially with a $67 billion TAM
* As the largest US-owned medium-duty commercial EV company, Lightning eMotors they will uniquely benefit from Biden's recently announced plan to replace entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles under the “Buy America” mandate.  The Biden White House says, ""Biden’s order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to “leverage the federal government’s footprint and buying power to lead by example.”  
* Medium-duty portion of Federal fleet electrification plan is 110,000 vehicles that only Lightning eMotors is currently equipped to handle. This represent a 5x of their entire 2025 projected revenue of $2 billion.  CEO Tim Reeser says they are currently working with USGSA on this new development.
* ZEV already sell to 30 fleets representing 500,000 vehicles and has strategic partnerships and contracts with DHL Express, Amazon, USPS, IKEA, Ford, Shyft, Plug Power, Proterra, BP, Romeo Power, ABC, Borg Warner, Winnebago, and the State of California.  DHL Express is expected to deploy their vehicles in California and New York later this year.
* Use of legacy chassis takes advantage of existing fed and state certifications along with entire medium-duty upfit ecosystem (ambulance, lifts, chillers and spare parts),which is critical for fleet owners. 
* ZEV can build from ground up or re-power drivetrains of existing fleets. Re-powering is most common in this medium-duty class designed for long mileage.  This enables fleet owners to continue using already customized vehicles thus extend the value of significant capital investment.
* Proprietary scalable analytics and proven operational savings for fleet customers.
* Offers fleet financing and patented mobile charging technologies and charging as a service (CAAS) which they are expanding to commercial and government fleets via its Lightning Energy division.
* Large patent portfolio
* Lightning eMotors has the largest commercial electric production facility in the US. Moreover, they are currently doubling their work force and quadrupling their Colorado-based manufacturing facility to meet accelerating demand. “Combined, the expansion and new equipment ensures that we’re ready for continually increasing demand and the growth of the business.”  Expansion plans are fully funded with no need of debt and they’ve signed leased to allow further 5x or more expansion. (1 million square foot campus)
* Oppenheimer analyst team are bullish with a $15 PT (75% upside) using a discounted to peer 6x sales multiple and their more conservative 169% CAGR estimate: “With Lightning's diverse supply chain, demonstrated capability in delivering numerous vehicles types, and optionality on either growing through powertrain development, full vehicle sales, or being a leading integrator of fuel cell-based power systems, we believe ZEV shares offer investors meaningful upside potential.""

2021-06-27 01:59:12,stocks,This stock burned me. Suddenly.
2021-06-27 03:55:55,stocks,"I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:  
  
\*\*\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \*\*\*  
  
CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:  
  
""It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""  
  
Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:  
  
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI  
  
So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.  
  
\*\*\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \*\*\*  
  
Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  
  
A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  
  
Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability  
  
All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  
  
Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.  
  
\*\*\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \*\*\*  
  
Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.  
  
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021  
  
An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  
  
\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS  
  
\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category  
  
\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.  
  
So, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!"

Personally surprised it’s not out of business.  Their most profitable area is their pharmacy.  I remember way back, at least in my state, some of the other grocery stores stopped accepting Amerigroup insurance and so the number of new customers surged.  But then I also recalled how they started shortening their business hours and selling some of their stores to Walgreens.

Regardless I would never invest in that company, knowing how it was run and I worked in 5 different stores.

If anything, I’d short the company."

Especially if they struggle to get feet back in the door as areas re-open, I could see a CVS or Walgreens buying them out for the space if we see any of the competition growing rapidly .... definetly something to watch for that I really wasn't thinking about. 

Being in the stock for so long, do you think it was overvalued and headed towards a more realistic price, say, 12.50 ? Or do you think the quarterly reactions got a little carried away and the stock is going to pull back up? I see it sold off from 40 to like 6 bucks a few years ago. OUCH. Don't wanna get caught in something like that. 

When I first saw the sell off i was like, ""Rite Aid? Dude thats goin back up forsure and then I looked at the 4Y chart and listened to an interview w the CEO and now I'm like uuuh idk this might tank from where it was and stay down for awhile.  To be frank I sold an $18 and $17 weekly put on the way down and now im trying to figure out if I should dump the shares on Monday or hold to ride it back up... decisions decisions."

2021-06-27 09:41:11,stocks,"All this assumes that the Whole Foods acquisition has been a success which it really hasn’t been. Amazon barely mentions WF in their quarterly reports despite it being a $16B business. It was a $16B business in 2016 the year before they bought it, so it hasn’t grown at all. They’ve had revenue decline in physical stores 5 out of the last 6 quarters while Target, Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons are putting up double-digit growth. 

It also ignores that Amazon is currently under antitrust scrutiny and pressure to get smaller, not bigger. Rite Aid is close to a penny stock but they are a huge company by revenue. It won’t be allowed."

2021-06-27 09:36:10,stocks,"2 failed mergers with Walgreens years ago. The FTC claimed it would be a monopoly eliminating the 3rd drug store option and giving WAG too much power in the industry.

The possible buyouts were rumored to come from AMAZON but that is not happening. 

I work for the company and they are lost. 2nd quarter sales are promising, but will be with most retailers as things begin to open , so proceed with caution. I would love to see the company turn itself around but they do not focus on the real issues the company has and instead places a bunch of 'innovative' concepts at the top of the list every few weeks/months just to satisfy shareholders.

They have supply chain issues and distribution centers (at least where I'm at) are unreliable and inefficient. Their PBM is not strong enough to compete with the pricing of WAG CVS and they don't the foothold as a household name in the drug business. People more associate rite aid with thrifty ice cream which is just a cute gimmick to get front end customers to come spend a few bucks.

I will say that it does seem to be another relatively over shorted stock, and these drops are not new. It appears there are massive sell offs at every bit of negative news as it RAD is some company on verge of bankruptcy. They are not, and the price typically rebounds fairly quickly on the announcement of another gimmicky launch. I would hold."
2021-06-26 23:03:12,stocks,"It was a bad earnings report with analyst downgrades. Yes, the selloff was hedge funds closing out their positions."
2021-06-27 12:51:14,stocks,"First, Whole Foods is in a completely different segment.  You can't compare groceries to pharmacy / convenience goods.  So the Whole Foods experience has no relevance whatsoever to Amazon's intentions in the pharmacy sector.  If Amazon does not go big into pharmacy with an acquisition of Rite Aid or similar, then the Amazon pharmacy business will be destined to fail.  Amazon does not win in a category just by being Amazon.  In pharmacy, you need to be large enough in prescription drugs to be able to negotiate the lowest prices to compete with the likes of CVS , Walgreens , Walmart , etc.  Amazon is not even in the top 15 in the USA in prescription drug sales.   So AMZN either goes big, or they drop out and go home in this category.

Second, your entire depiction of antitrust concerns is incorrect.  The US government's use of antitrust laws is to ensure that monopolies are not created and that there is healthy competition to provide consumers with multiple options at fair prices.  Once again, Amazon has not been able to crack into the top 15 in the USA in pharmacy.  By acquiring Rite Aid with the goal of building that business out, Amazon would essentially create the 3rd pure national retail pharmacy in the USA, along with CVS and Rite Aid.  This would increase competition in the space, not decrease it.  So, Amazon could easily make an argument that taking a small regional business and growing it into a national pharmacy would be very good for the market, giving consumers more choices and increased price competition.   And we all know that lower prices for prescription drugs is a national goal of the US government."

2021-06-26 23:31:21,stocks,The amount of people who don’t understand breakeven point for a option is scary lol
2021-06-26 22:23:02,stocks,"If you buy a call option and if the underlying stock goes up and if there is still time for it to go up more before it expires and if someone believes it will get above the strike price plus what you are asking to sell it, they may buy it from you. If all those ifs work out you could make a profit."
2021-06-27 00:46:08,stocks,"Think of options as a coupon. let's say your buying a company named PAIR and you buy calls with 2 weeks of time and the current price of PAIR bf buying was $120 a share and you think it will go to $130 a share by the end of the 2 weeks bc of some up coming catalyst.  So you buy 1 options call contract ( coupon) for $2 ($200). Your basically saying hey I think the stock will go above $122 a share or higher by the end of the 2 week period. So naturally this to you is a deal.. So you buy the contract aka coupon. You have no problem paying $12200 ( $122 a share x 100 ) ( all options contacts are in 100 share qts ) by the end of the 2 weeks bc you belive it will be worth $13000 by that time, banking you a gain of $800 total. 

Well let's say the day after you bought your coupon the stock shoots up to $125. Well you know have a coupon that's worth more then when you first bought it. Now ask yourself, would you sell your coupon to me for the same price you bought it for the day bf? No, why? Bc PAIR stock is now currently worth $125 making your coupon more valubale bc PAIR is now worth  $125 or $300 more then what you bought the coupon for. 

So the reason the contract ( the option aka coupon) goes up in value in the short term is bc it's worth more then what it was the day bf. So let's say all of a sudden you don't think Apple will keep going up or you just want to collect the premium. You could sell the option ( aka coupon ) for a $300 gain and be on your way.

Know this can go in reverse just as fast as it went forward. If instead the next day PAIR was at $118 well now your coupon is worthless or worth -$200.. why you ask? Bc who would pay a extra $200 for your coupon when they could go and buy PAIR for $200 cheaper at $118.

Basically you get to collect the premium if you so choose. If you do so you can sell your coupon and ONLY collect the premium that the coupon is worth, not the shares. So you make money bc your coupon is now worth more then what is was when you bought it. 


It's confusing for sure. And this is a VERY VERY basic explanation. There's alot more that goes into it. That's why you should paper trade or read and learn options bf you invest or start playing with them. This feed is full of ppl who lost more then what they could afford bc they dident fully understand how options work. They are complicated. Please, Un.der.stand. bf you dive into them. 

Hope this helps and it's NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE."
2021-06-27 06:43:39,stocks,"Bought options eventually expire as worthless.  The price you see is what you could sell it for before the expiration date.  If the price of the underlying stock is near or more than the strike price, then it could be worth more than you paid for it.  We have no details to fully understand your question.

Now, let's assume you bought a call for $2 with a strike price of $25, then your ""break even"" is $27; $25 + $2.  That means you can't actually turn a profit unless the underlying stock is more than $27. If not, then you will lose the $2 you spent to buy the option. Absolutely do not exercise the option if you are not above break even.

I suggest doing some reading outside WSB to fully understand options.  The ones who were really pushing that trend, i.e. RoaringKitty, are actual professionals who are manipulating the markets by posting on Reddit.  There will be many shoes to drop from that nonsense. Reader beware."
2021-06-27 09:21:44,stocks,"Here’s how I organize this in my brain, in plain non-financial jargon:

Buying options: breakeven point is the goalpost for if you make money or don’t make money on the option, at any point whatsoever between buy and expiration.

Selling options: breakeven point means when I’m likely to lose my shares or money up as collateral.

As a person who typically sells calls lately, the break even point is important to me also because it tells me exactly what price I will receive in total for the shares I am holding.

So basically, it’s just the specific price that has to happen in order to have made a good choice or not.

Now, there is another moving part here and that is the price at which people are buying/selling the contract you possess. If you keep an eye on that, you might find getting rid of that contract is likely to make you more money than keeping it. This is where you should consider your own buy/sell price (which of course is part of the breakeven point, but will also show by itself under “avg cost” or “avg credit”.

So if you feel like the contract is worth more getting rid of it than keeping it, you’d need to factor in what the current share price is vs your breakeven point as well.

Hopefully that all made sense.

And, hopefully you won’t take that as financial advice because it’s coming from a person who is way too new at this to be giving advice."

2021-06-26 23:52:09,stocks,"At expiration, there will be no time left on the contract and so there will be no uncertainty left.  The loss of uncertainty translates to a loss in value of the contract.  You also have change on value because of stock movement heading to and from to your strike.

If your break even at expiration is 10% over the initial underlying price, your contract will gain value (especially early on) just for moving up.  As the underlying gets closer to the strike, the contract will be more likely to expire in the money and have some intrinsic value (above your break even).  If that happens when there's time left, then the extrinsic value (the value because of future possibilities) will increase, and you'll profit off of that.  This value will decrease over time if the underlying doesn't move any further, and you'll actually move from profit into loss.  You won't have met your break even at expiration."

2021-06-27 15:15:17,stocks,"Options have intrinsic value and time value. If a call it out of the money (for example a 350 call when the share price is 346), there is no intrinsic value, and all of its value resides in the time left before expiry and the potential for it to cross into the money in that time.

As an option goes into the money, it gains intrinsic value. If the share price was suddenly 352, that call option has intrinsic value of $2.00 (x100). Even if it expired right now, you could exercise it and immediately sell for a $200 profit. Add on time value, figured by time to expiry, and those combined values will be the price of the contract.

As expiry approaches, time value decreases (at a rate per day called *theta*) until it is zero. Out of the money calls are worthless at that point and in the money calls are worth their pure intrinsic value. 

Break even is the price a stock will need to be when the contract expires for your contract’s intrinsic value to be equal to what you paid for it."

The big thing is, just making profits on the option. Realize that the extrinsic value decays very fast within 30 days of expiring, so in essence you're kind of losing money every day. If you're in the profit, and don't plan on exercising, you should entertain the thought of selling to close."

2021-06-27 18:34:44,stocks,Strike must be met for the option to work at expiry
2021-06-26 22:41:26,stocks,"See if this helps. 

When you buy an option contract you are really buying 2 things. 1) the option contract 2) the option (but not obligation) to buy shares at a strike price at a future date. 

You can make (or lose) on either or both. 

Example.  You pay .10 per option contract for a $10 call with strike in October.   The stock is currently trading at $8.

a) the stock starts to rise up to $9.50 in June.  Your option contract will now be trading at a higher price than when you bought it, as the value of the stock has gone up.  you can sell the option contract before exercising it.  - your stock has gone up but is still below the strike price so the value is in the contract only.  You are done, no shares in your account but you made money on the contract portion. 

If you wait for the exercise date, your option contract can lose extrinsic value (time value)as it will only be worth the intrinsic value (difference between stock price and strike price).   

If the stock goes down, your contract price will also drop. 

I think what you were referring to was the intrinsic + extrinsic price of the option is higher than what you bought and so you are up.  

The break even only comes into play if you are waiting until the exercise date to exercise.  Then the break even is the cost of the stock +the price you paid for the contract.  

So in this example : 
break even = (value of shares + option cost)/number of shares. 
= ($10 x 100 shares ( 1 contract) + (.10 x 100))/100
=($1,000 + $10) / 100
= $10.10 break even. 

Obviously if the price is below strike price at exercise date you lose the cost of the option contract and don’t get the shares. 

Please feel free to comment if I missed something. 

Hope this helps.

2021-06-27 00:05:06,stocks,"It really depends though on what your investing goals are. In terms of absolute dollar amount, it makes sense to buy calls on a stock for short term gain. You need way less money (the premium) and the leverage can give you a nice reward. Granted it can expire worthless, but given you can use smaller amounts of starting money, you could have put the rest into a regular ETF to de-risk. This is not well advertised by people on Reddit, but you can also get out of an option before expiry and eat the loss.

I would not buy any retail stock at the moment, but there are a few names I like better. M at least holds some property, and has the scope to address a broader customer base, in vastly more locations. They'll likely need to consolidate and close up some weak performers, but at least there's a little value there. DDS gets an F for innovation and future growth, but has an A+ balance sheet. At least when they go under, they'll have assets to sell. LVMHF is obscenely overpriced, and isn't apples to apples against JWN, but it's one of the few I'm comfortable saying will make it through any retail apocalypse.

This was on a middle class salary, I wasn't even making enough to *come close* to maxing my retirement contributions until two years ago. Most of the legwork getting to six figures came from market returns over those six years.

The point your salty ass is failing to grasp is that it is possible to build ""a substantial amount of capital"" just by having a decent middle class job and practicing good saving/investing habits for a few years. The analogy you're going for is garbage because nobody is saying to just dump your 2K in SPY and forget about it-- you continue to add to your position with whatever you can afford to save, that's how you build wealth with ETFs.

ETFs are for more mature sophisticated investors who probably aren’t checking their portfolio everyday.

2021-06-27 15:28:13,stocks,"I think it's worth considering that these two investing practices aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. My first priority is always going to be boomer-investing into retirement accounts, because that is statistically the most effective way to build wealth over a long time horizon. As long as you're within a few standard deviations of the average income and civilization doesn't collapse, it works for anyone eventually.

But it doesn't have to be a zero sum game between passive indexing and crunching the numbers on bigger risk/rewards. I've always devoted a chunk of my portfolio for fun stuff and pipe dreams, and as I've progressed in my career and begun to feel more secure with what I have in my retirement accounts, the amount of risk I'm comfortable taking on in my taxable account has grown exponentially. 

We're all here in /r/stocks hoping to beat the market sometimes, so I totally get what you're saying. But boring, long-term strategies with at least a portion of your capital will *at worst* protect you if you fail at that, and *at best* give you the security to chase bigger prizes.

The bigger point that I was trying to make is that as a stock Reddit. The US companies end up owning these. Thus if you invest more in the US any innovation is part of your investment.

My main point was that if you look at world markets you would be very happy if you concentrated your portfolio in the US markets. You get a lot of international exposure in the S&P from international companies. Again, I pivoted a bit from the person you replied to saying that on the whole you benefit from worldwide innovations because they seem to make their way to US companies hands. 

I can see now how you were just trying to say innovation occurs outside the US and it looked like I was debating that point. I  am not.

As for the basics, I have a few books: Benjamin Graham Security Analysis, Options as a strategic investment by Lawrence McMillan. They are both available at your local libraries. Mad Money by Jim Cramer is a fun read. Jim's show is mostly for entertainment nowadays but he made some good points from time to time.

The Graham book is about fundamentals of a stock. The ""technical"" research is about reading the stock chart and making a guess of which direction it would go next. I found the cup-w-handle technique by Investor Business Daily website had some merit.

Nah, I'll stop you real quick mate. First of all, I've personally read Black Swan, Antifragile, and the Technical Incerto. I like and share the ideas he expresses, but I could never read other Incerto volumes because I know that it will still be the exact same shit and it gets boring really quick.

By the way, as part of my degree I studied on his hedging textbook and his statistical textbook. I'm not sure how ""he proves that my degree+career is worthless pseudoscience"" considering that: 

1. My degree is exactly the kind of degree that he's a professor in (at NYU Tandon)
2. My (ideal) career is basically the same thing he currently does for Universa Investments.

According to you he's a professor (and academic reviewer) in a worthless pseudoscientific degree and he considers his own profession worthless pseudoscience. Not sure if you can see the absurdity in your claims.

My criticism has never been of the ideas, but of him as a person and of his writing style (since in his case the two things are basically one and the same).

He is a ridiculously arrogant and (ironically) fragile individual with a **huge** ego. His writing style perfectly reflects that and makes for an extremely unpleasant reading experience. He's a good ""probabilistic philosopher"", but a shit human and an even more shit writer."

Actually most services that uses maps are actually using the map services provided by Google or Apple, and a lot of the servers used are just leased from cloud services that are dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Most big apps usually have capacity leased from at least two providers to avoid down time if one provider goes down. 

So in a sense these tech companies already get paid for the part they do best, which is provide server and infrastructure software, and leave the management of the service and user interface to the other company. 

Here is an article that details the infrastructure of Uber and Lyft

2021-06-27 13:42:53,stocks,"Enterprise in this case would be the current drivers. Those guys are running a cab business thus, enterprise.

Costs will depend on how much it costs to acquire drivers and clients. Brand recognition doesnt matter in this case. Its a chicken and egg problem. You wont get a single driver if there are no clients and there are no clients without drivers. This is what you are missing in your equation.

My guess is that it will cost around $10k per driver to start gaining a foothold. You basically need to give away rides or greatly discount them for a year or two for drivers and clients to feel this is reliable enough for their time. How much will that cost? In the meantime, there isnt anywhere near enough viewership to make up the money with ads. They will need to have millions of riders before ads can even start making a dent. So all in all, this endeavor will cost billions easily and there is no guarantee that it will even work. This would be the argument for buying an established business.

Not that I am advocating any of the above. In my mind, Google would be absolutely insane to get into the cab business without self driving perfected. Its not worth it at all."
2021-06-26 20:51:15,stocks,"Most likely not going to happen. 

Uber’s valuation is more than $100B - way more than Ford. Ford’s valuation is around 67B. Uber is even more valuable than GM. No other traditional auto manufacturing company is going to buy or even afford Uber. 

And Tesla is about $145B and they don’t have enough cash on hand to make such an acquisition. It also goes against Tesla’s business model of selling electric cars whereas Uber supports both gas, hybrid and electric. Musk doesn’t care much about ride share but he’s probably interested in using Tesla for AV in the future. 

Google will not be interested. They have approx $150B cash on hand but why buy Uber when they can use a fraction of that investment build out Waymo? They are already testing prototypes. 

Uber’s model is to disrupt cab/taxi industry. Neither Google or Tesla are that interested in cab industry as much as they are interested in their cars being driverless for consumers.

And frankly, Uber is in so much regulatory headaches around the globe for disrupting local taxi laws, no company wants to acquire them and then deal with these issues. Uber also has some serious safety and privacy issues. Besides, there’s the whole issue of drivers being seen as contract workers vs Uber employees. No company wants to deal with that headache. Probably the biggest reason why Google wants Waymo to be fully autonomous so they don’t have to deal with the drivers being employees issue."

2021-06-26 21:58:11,stocks,Google already owns 6% of Uber and 10% of Lyft so they’re definitely interested in that market
2021-06-26 21:33:39,stocks,">Tesla is about $145B

Not sure where you got that number. As of today Tesla's market cap is around $650B. Notwithstanding being almost $1T in January.

>It also goes against Tesla’s business model of selling electric cars whereas Uber supports both gas, hybrid and electric.

If Tesla were to acquire Uber they can simply mandate that every vehicle in the fleet be a Tesla, whether owned or rented by the driver. Gas/hybrid vehicles are not necessary to sustain a taxi service.

>Neither Google or Tesla are that interested in cab industry as much as they are interested in their cars being driverless for consumers.

Google owns Waymo which has been offering a limited autonomous taxi service in Arizona. That sounds like they're interested to me.

Taxis would also be an obvious revenue stream for Tesla. If they do in fact solve autonomous driving then Tesla could pay owners to use their cars in a robotaxi network while they are not using them. Passive income for both Tesla and their customers. [ARK did an article on this not long ago.](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-ride-hail-update/)"

This data was also published in the premiere medical journal, NEJM

https://ir.intelliatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intellia-and-regeneron-announce-landmark-clinical-data-showing

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454?query=featured_home

For those unaware, CRISPR is a programmable gene editing system discovered in 2012 which allows precise gene editing at a target locus. Jennifer Doudna, the founder of NTLA, and Emannuelle Charpentier, the founder of CRSP, were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

This really demonstrates the promise of CRISPR to treat all genetic diseases. 

I believe this will cause the entire sector of gene editing and maybe genomics stocks to move higher. Other stocks in this field include BEAM, EDIT, VERV, VRTX, and CRSP.

2021-06-26 22:01:07,stocks,"You ok bud? You seems pretty fixated on that one part and have ignored what is really the most important points in the rest of my comment.

Look, [here is a study](https://www.afcpe.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/v24_1_61-79.pdf) on different types of financial socialization and how it affected them as they entered adulthood. Giving allowance alone is not an effective way of teaching your child good financial skills, which is why the rest of my comment - and what was really my one and only thesis - is proper financial education. Furthermore, the study shows that those who ***did not*** receive an allowance were more likely to worry about money, even after correcting for parental and individual factors (i.e., the parent's net worth, etc.). So childhood exposure to allowances are objectively not a bad thing.

Interestingly, out of all the childhood socialization techniques studied (allowance, opening a savings account, parental monitoring of spending, working for pay, and teaching donations), working for pay is the only one that ***increased*** anxiety about money.

So perhaps you should rethink your view about how to teach a child about money."

The best source for diamonds for industrial use cases is already synthesis, and diamonds require much more extreme pressures to create than graphite (both diamonds and graphite are made from the same element carbon). It's possible no one had bothered to come up with an industrial process to make graphite from cheap feedstock because there was no market, but if EVs really will need tons of the stuff that can change quickly."

While mined graphite is still among the best anode materials nowadays, this can quickly change (within years), as biogenic carbons get better and better.

2021-06-27 00:03:39,stocks,"Most people who care obsessively with investments or dividends should really be focusing in increasing their productive value.

Sorry dude, but the truth is, the average person is going to take like 90 years to amass good wealth and reasonable passive income with a modest income, and even “modester” saving habits.

It’s easier for one to raise their hourly wage by $10, and make additional $1600 a month, than earn the same $1600 in dividends per month. You’d need at least $500,000 for the latter. 

So, right now if you make $3k a month, you should be aiming towards $6, or $8, or $10k. The way I managed
to pass the $10k mark is with professional qualification. I’m a self-taught programmer.

Now, I’m at $15 - $18k/mo, and if I want to go up to $25, $30, I know exactly what I need to do: refine process and start outsourcing, hiring people in one end, and acquiring more clients in the other.

If I take a $3k profit per programmer hired a month, I can, with around 6 to 10, to reach that $30k level. If I do a great job at that and hire 100, that means $300k. And so on.

Only now, that I make $15k/month, is that I actually think a little more about investment. I live with around $4-5 and save all the rest. Investing 10k a month is much significant when it comes to building passive
Income.

Let's take for example the company GAW you mention and calculate it last 5 years:

Total Dividend received about 20%

Share price 5 year ago 4.85 now 113 total profit = 2330%

Gross total profit: 2330+20= 2350% (amazing!!)

This company the last years is growing good !!! (i wish i was in) and as you can see almost all the profit is made by the difference between the buy and the sell of the share price.

I turn 40 this year... If I live to 60, I outlive my parents and most of my grandparents... 

So essentially, if my plan is to hold for return, I have to either buy something young enough to grow to higher dividend payouts, or high yield enough to pay for itself in under 10 years. 

Another factor is how div stocks perform against growth in a downturn... Maybe we never have another market crash. But if we did, div stocks can insulate against panic.

2021-06-27 09:26:47,stocks,"I respectfully disagree!

If it’s in a taxable account, then you’re paying ordinary income tax on it, which is worse than a commission.

If you’re in a retirement account, there are three situations:

1. You’re reinvesting the dividend in the security that generated them. Mathematically this is precisely identical to holding a stock that doesn’t generate dividends - no gain or loss.
2. You’re letting the dividends sit in your retirement account as cash. Assuming you don’t want your money sitting fallow and losing value to inflation,this is worse than any other alternative (except withdrawing the funds from your retirement funds early, which is so bad of an option I’m not even counting it.)
3. You’re reinvesting the funds in some other security inside your retirement account. Again, this is mathematically the same as going to your IRA or 401(k) website and telling them to reallocate existing funds into a different security.

None of those options is “worth it.”

There’s exactly one situation where dividends make sense over and above just selling shares: you need a *somewhat but not precisely* regular income stream, are willing to draw down your investments to do  it, and value the convenience of having the money show up automatically rather than have to deal with selling shares. That’s it. That’s the only actual benefit. But whenever we have these discussions the thread is full of people who *clearly* think dividends are somehow “free money” rather than them just a forced way of them paying themselves their own money, which is a category error. (I’m not saying this is you…but it’s a lot of people on this thread.)"

The amount you contribute goes up slightly if your starting salary is below 50k.  

You go to college to better yourself, study something you hopefully enjoy and make yourself more valuable than otherwise.  

Life choices matter too.  If you choose to go to an expensive out of state school, and choose to study something (because you enjoy it hopefully) that may not be the highest paying job out of school, hopefully you thought about the risk in advance and are ready for the pile of student loan debt.

1. They likely collect social security too. Which differs person to person, but the average check is 18k a year. So they actually have 78k coming in.

2. This individual probably made use of tax advantaged accounts. So there's a good chance that a decent chunk of that 78k isn't taxed. 

3. One of the biggest expenses a working individual will have is saving for retirement. When your actually retired that expense dispears and the money is freed up for other stuff.

2021-06-26 20:01:49,stocks,the way div works its a cash payout that gets taxed at approximately 20% (i think it changes with tax bracket.) then you can reinvest your div which then goes into your cost basis. so if you get the 100 dollars taxed to 80$ and reinvest bringing your total cost basis to 1080$.  then if you sell your position you are only paying taxes on gains above that 1080$. you only get taxed once on the div as well as the capital gains but capital gains tends to be higher. there are advantages to both types. with div i dont have to reinvest directly to the security that payed out the div meaning i have free cash flow but with a buyback stock i have better equity (if i dont sell) when it comes to margin consideration. meaning ill be able to leverage more.

In a normal market, your ownership of stock would be only as valuable as the dividend it returns and your interest in controlling the future decisions of the company. However, most stocks are not returning dividends anywhere close to a reasonable price for the equity itself. The same can be said for the housing market when compared to median income. Simply put, a highly bipartisan government, A nation with no culture or heritage, a seemingly infinite list of unpaid liabilities promised to government workers, a complete lack of accountability for large corporations, and an overstretched Global influence Is destined to lead to massive inflation and a complete detachment from reasonable price valuations.

Multiple companies proposed this and you could buy the share ticket at the harbour office.
Soon it showed that the price of boats and crews were only 1% compared to the large amount of money made from the trade. Nobody would want to sell their share for at least what they could yield in a couple of years. Then smart people though it could be interesting to make money not on what a share could bring each year but on the difference between its value between their buying point and selling point. So they bought and began to bullshit about how this particular ship trading company was going to another part of India with unprecedented goods of formidable value so they could sell their share at a higher price."

2021-06-26 20:19:08,stocks,"If a company never pays dividends, then two things can happen. They can stay in business or they can go out of business.

 If they go out of business, they will liquidate. This means they will sell all of their assets and pay off their debts, any remaining money will be distributed to shareholders. This means that at the time of liquidation, shareholders will receive at least the amount of shareholder equity that exists. 

If the company never goes out of business and never pays a dividend, then other investors will buy the company from you at a certain price based shareholder equity with the idea that if the company every does go out of business, they will receive at least that much. Usually they will pay more because of potential future growth. 

In either case, shareholders legally are entitled to shareholders equity and will always receive it in one form or another. Therefore, a stock is not similar to a collectible baseball card. 

For example, if a company had a hundred billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet worth no debt and you bought it for a hundred million dollars, chances are you will almost certainly receive your hundred billion eventually even if you find nobody to buy the business from you."

>The only way for your shares to have value at that point is for you to sell them to so.eone else who believes they have value.


That's technically true of every stock.  Fortunately, investors realize that stocks have value and will buy them if they are fire sold below market value. 


>If the company doesn't pay a dividend then as soon as people decide they don't want to hold their shares, there is absolutely nothing to prop up the price of the underlying.


Technically also true of companies with dividends.   If everyone decided a company is worthless and sells, the subsequent devaluation of the company may result in them cutting the dividend anyway.

In some cases the buyback would have reduced the perceived value of the company(the same with dividends) and then no growth would occur. When dividends are payed out the assets also fall which may often result in a drop in stock.

But if you assume that there is a given value to a company both methods will result in the same result but with taxation being deferred on asset sales as buybacks result in growth rather than cash.

They are essentially the same but there are perceptive differences and taxation differences.

When companies do a cash buy back of the stock it is because there was no better place to put that capital and so it is returned to shareholders increasing the amount of the company each share represents. it is a return of capital to shareholders for those shares.

In a reverse split the company just waves a pen and devalues the shares by the reverse amount. Often this is done to prepare for later capital raises, to reduce share count, raise the price to meet listing requirements. 

Reverse split= BAD     Buyback=surplus Capital  Good

A stock is a part ownership of the company. If said company were to reinvest the profits, it simply means they buy more stuff that will result to more profits. An example is Amazon Game Studios.

My entire point, yet again, is that dividend stocks offer absolutely no financial advantage over non-div stocks.

You can't really generalize about do dividends add or destroy value. It totally depends on what's going on wiht the company.. what kind of growth they expect and if they have better investment opportunities with which to invest those funds (creating future dividends).

&#x200B;

>I don't understand this bit about carving out a portion of the stock.  How do you do that exactly? That makes no sense?  Where are you allowed to sell your proportionate amount of the stock?

Ok.  Lets run a controlled example.  Assume you have 10,000 invested in 2 companies X and Y.  X pays a 10% div, and Y does not.  Now lets assume there is no trading going on, no financial news, nothing to effect share price and the companies are wholly equals.

Company X pays a 10% div.  You have $1k in your pocket and now have $9k invested due to the dividend readjustment.

Company Y doesn't pay a dividend, so you instead choose to sell off 10% of your holdings.  You now have $1k in your pocket and $9k invested.

You now have the exact same amount invested in both stocks, even though X paid you a dividend and you chose to replicate that scenario in non-div Y.

&#x200B;

>So you've done the exact same thing.  What's your point.

That is my point.  That dividends do not offer an advantage over traditional stocks.  Im not saying that **I want** to do this.  Id rather hold my stock and see the financials increase valuation until I'm ready to sell on my own terms.  Not received forced payouts throughout the year.

>It totally depends on what's going on with the company.

Couldn't agree more with that statement.  Theres a lot that influences a stock price beyond whether or not they offer a dividend and we all certainly have different reasons for our investment strategy.

Not really. It's no different than owning your own company. Say you start a real estate investing company. You buy a rental home and gets some tenants. The home goes up in value or you are able to raise rent. The intrinsic value/expected returns of the company has increased and you can sell it for more. I.e. the stock price goes up.

You can take the profit from this company and pay yourself ""dividends"" or you can reinvest it into other properties to make more money. The latter is what BH does and the company's expected returns continues to rise if they do well.

> Right but why do the stockholders think the price will rise? 

Because BH continues grows its business to become more and more profitable (expected returns). Buying stock gives you a right to that profit either in the form of dividends, buybacks, or sale of the company. If the company keeps growing, that right to profit (aka stock) similarly grows."

""When a corporation declares a dividend, it debits its retained earnings and credits a liability called dividend payable. On the date of payment, the company reverses the dividend payable with a debit entry and credits its cash account for the respective cash outflow.

Cash dividends do not affect a company's income statement. However, they shrink a company's shareholder's equity and cash balance by the same amount.""

Sure.  Sometimes stock prices do rise on the dividend date.  That could be due to a multitude of reasons... but its not due to the dividend payout itself.

What part about the valuation of a company are you confused by? I don’t understand how this chain of comments supports that buying companies are akin to buying baseball cards or like the supply and demand of the public’s favourite colour of carpet driving up the price for specific colours over the other.

If you buy shares of a company, you technically have your right to tell the company what to do within your voting rights (if you buy as a retail investor, your say in a company like Amazon is like a drop of water in the ocean). As you mentioned, if investors perceive that money can be better reinvested, then they will not pay out to shareholders. If they alternatively want to give back to shareholders, maybe they will use buybacks which gives back to investors akin to a dividend.

If investors wanted to, they could sell everything within the company and pay it out to the owners of the company as a dividend. This is known as an adjusted asset valuation of a company and is seen as the floor value for the valuation of the company. To really simplify this, if the only assets and liabilities Apple had were cash of $200 Billion and debt of $135 billion, then you could value Apple at $65 billion as a floor value, because if you liquidated everything today and paid off all debt, owners would receive a $65 billion dollar dividend.

If apples earnings increases the amount of assets that “can be liquidated” by $10 billion every year, then why wouldn’t you increase the value of your company by this amount regardless of whether you pay it out as a dividend or not?

Aside from this, overvaluation over short periods of time eg 1 year do not trump company valuations, and this can take into several other macroeconomic factors"

2021-06-26 21:14:03,stocks,"What makes stocks intrinsically valuable? 

How does my answer not answer this question?

Ultimately, if you want to believe a stock has no intrinsic value, you can believe that, but it’s not correct. A stock has value because it is ownership of a company that has value. If you own one stock of Amazon, no, you’re not Jeff Bezos, but you own 1/504,320,000 of his company. And if you divide the value of Amazon by that, you get the value."

2021-06-26 21:25:11,stocks,"As I read OPs post I see them pointing out that dividends are not a guarantee and that there's no way for them to redeem stock for the company worth that the share represents.  I assume OP knows that stocks theoretically represent a literal partial ownership of the company.  I interpret their question to be about how that ownership manifests in gain under the hood when looked at independent of the market.

If you have $500 in a locked safe and you don't know how to open it, how much is it worth?  OP is asking about how much that safe is worth when nobody is paying them to hold it, and when the person with the key won't let them turn it in for the cash.

What does it mean to be entitled to something that cannot be redeemed except on an open market?  What is the logical end to that?"

2021-06-26 22:06:22,stocks,"> there's no way for them to redeem stock for the company worth that the share represents

There is. Selling the stock."
2021-06-26 22:11:49,stocks,"No, you get the market worth when you sell the stock.  The market worth cannot decouple the extrinsic and intrinsic value.  You can run any number of intrinsic value calculations, and market speculation can be such that the price you get still falls below that.  There is no speculation independent way of recovering your slice of the company, you can only get the market value and not necessarily the ""intrinsic"" value (unless you start muddying the waters and mixing the two such that you define intrinsic value partially by market expectations and other extrinsics).

I don't know what else to say.  No sense belaboring it any longer, though.  I know what you're saying, thanks for the discussion."
2021-06-27 01:46:20,stocks,"> There is no speculation independent way of recovering your slice of the company

So let me get this straight. Instead of selling your stock (the slice of the company that you own) for the market price, you want some mechanism to exist where you can “redeem” it for what you believe is the true value of the company—which according to you, is less than market price?

I mean, you could do this and set a limit sell for far under the market price and it would be immediately filled. But why would anyone do that?

I’m not sure it’s worth having this conversation anymore."
2021-06-27 08:02:16,stocks,"I don't ""want"" the mechanism to exist, this whole time has been about answering OP's question about intrinsic value.  We have ways to calculate intrinsic value based on what we think it should be, but that's purely ephemeral, while I understood OP to be questioning how the underpinnings of the simplified theories that you mentioned are justified.  We can say we're literally entitled to part of the company, bit unless there's literally a way to get it, the shares actually only have speculative value only, which is a bit circular and reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme.

My answer is just that all of the value in a share is derived from an expectation and anticipation of an event or aforementioned mechanism being in place which eventually liquidates the value of the company, or provides some element of control.  That's the driver behind calculations of intrinsic value, but the share holds none without them.  Maybe my answer is pedantic, but I believe it addresses what OP is asking, just like the other folks in this thread who are going below skin deep DCF and other Econ 101 definitions.

It's not a text book, but the top answer articulates what I'm trying to say better than I can: https://money.stackexchange.com/questions/1385/why-does-demand-for-stock-rise-when-a-company-appears-to-have-high-future-value

Basically, given our need for continuous production at certain times, we are no where near practical capacity on solar so there is absolutely no need for nuclear at this point. What does practical solar capacity mean? Basically I define it as the amount of energy that we can practically use during sun hours. Until we have enough solar just to cover that, it makes no sense to build anything else. Once this practical limit has been reached, then its time to look at options but this wont happen for a while. Possible not in a decade.

And to make matters worse for nuclear, the price of solar and batteries is still in free fall. Battery prices have declined more than 50% in the last 5 alone, with no end in site. Odds are, we will see another 50% haircut, if not more, in 10 years just from scale alone. And its highly likely we will have a few breakthroughs before then as well.

Which basically means its game over for uranium. It served its purpose but the end is coming. The articles you are reading are probably by doofuses trying to unload their crap. Kind of like how the Saudis sold a huge % of Aramco recently knowing full well that the end is coming.

If you want to play tangent, there will be tons of surplus energy in 20 years, worldwide. Tons will get grounded. A smart person might reroute that waste to produce an easy to make long term fuel. The one that makes sense is hydrogen since you can make it fairly easily without very fancy equipment. In fact, it can probably be made at home and stored in tanks for a pretty low cost.

So in other words, the only thing that makes sense moving forward is renewables and maybe/probably hydrogen as a backup. In 20 years, most homes will simply have solar + batteries. Hydrogen will be cheap so folks will buy hydrogen burning generators as a backup. Businesses will adopt all of that even sooner and they may add wind since its also getting cheaper."

>Did you read any of those links? None of it was bad.

>Leveraged debt in a growing, positive cash flow company doesn't hurt the company 

But if a company stops growing or cash flow decreases, it can turn into a noose.  

>but can actually save it and help it prosper 

The money from leveraged purchases isn't typically reinvested into the company.  It's used to buy the company.  You might as well ""buy"" a house by putting no money down, taking a loan out against the value of the house, and then renting it out to pay back the loan.  

Yes, that's a smart way of doing things, but it also means that you've put nothing into actually buying the house, and if it's not profitable, you have no vested interest in keeping it afloat.  Or in keeping it in general.  

>such as in ASO's situation (using this money to open new stores, buy product in bulk, pay off other higher interest debt, etc). Debt may look scary on a balance sheet but if it puts the company in a better position to succeed long term then it was worth it.

Debt isn't scary.  Of course it can be good.  But the leveraged purchase of ASO wasn't done to give the company capital.  The purchase was leveraged so that KKR could keep their balance sheets clean by forcing the company to take on the cost of the purchase as debt.   They then used the company's assets to subsidize the purchase.  That hurts the company in the long run.  The literal billions of dollars of debt that ASO had to pay off went straight to KKR's balance sheets as profit, instead of being reinvested in ASO."

The good news is that your income is low so you likely won't need to worry about taxes right now but that also means that you won't be getting the real advantage of an IRA right now which is tax write offs. I think you might want to also consider a personal investment account until you start taking in the big bucks at work.

2021-06-27 18:05:11,stocks,"There isn’t a graph. It’s a much more complicated formula, loosely based on the Black-Scholes pricing model but it also is affected by things like trading volume. (Some options will be very rarely traded and when volume is super low, price discovery gets difficult and bid/ask spreads widen. Almost always this results in the retail investor getting less than they should since the other side of that trade is a market maker who doesn’t give a shit about someone’s new hobby to trade in obscure and thinly traded options.)

If you stick to high volume options, then bid/ask is pretty narrow and your execution and price discovery is almost entirely dictated by the market at large. 

And options have many aspects that factor into pricing: how far away you are from the strike price, time to maturity, implied volatility of the underlying company, how sensitive that particular option is to underlying price moves, etc…

So you can have a situation where the underlying stock goes up, but your call option goes down in price and a put option goes up. It isn’t just whether the stock price moves up or down but whether it is doing so in a way that contextually is going to move the option you bought the way you want it to go. 

It’s a complex subject but a very interesting way to trade. Best of luck to you!"

Their battery tech is part of it absolutely. What many don't appreciate is it's one part of an overall flow of information and integration to maximize efficiency with said battery. For example you think they are lacking necessary hardware, when in reality they're not adding more than is necessary to ensure full FSD capability while preserving battery life / range. 

As far as servicing is concerned, yes, they can improve there. What you need to realize though is with a hyper growth company you're going to have many growing pains. How they respond over time to provide solutions such as including OTA updates while you're sleeping or preventing problems before you even know that they exist is what matters. And let's not pretend that traditional dealership repair models aren't a horrendous experience half the time between high costs and waisting half your day to get basic servicing done.
