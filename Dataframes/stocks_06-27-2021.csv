6/27/2021 19:36,stocks,Real question is you think you can consistently gain 3-4% of a 5% day?? Man you must have a crystal ball!! Good luck
6/27/2021 19:49,stocks,"The only reason why you would put a large %, of your account into a trade is if you literally don't have the cash to allocate an appropriate % and still have a sizable position. When you have a large account, the risk to reward of yoloing all into one stock is honestly very unattractive, when you can hedge your bets, and diversify - offering a far higher probability of success, and get the same return than someone who yolos a smaller account into one trade. 

The difference is dude 1 doesn't sweat it when he's wrong, and he consistently makes money. His money keeps growing so his returns get bigger and bigger. 

Dude 2 is having a heart attack every day and more likely than not will leave the casino with nothing by the end of it all.  

Is it possible? Sure. It's also possible to flip a coin 50 times and it land on heads every time.  Risk management is real and in my experience, is equally if not more important than being able to pick winning stocks."
6/27/2021 19:28,stocks,"I did this for quite some time and there are a few things to consider. One is your funds usually have a settlement period so you have to be aware to avoid paying internet on borrowing. Then I would try to follow a trend and even at a 1% gain, it piles up if done routinely. I don’t necessarily believe it’s the key to long term wealth but I find it fun and it’s not my only portfolio"
6/27/2021 19:58,stocks,"I have retirement accounts that I dump money in. 

I have a day trading acct that I buy/hold certain companies….

And then have portions of cash in that acct that I use for flips or speculative “playing” because it amuses me….including a certain stock that I bought at $9 and sold at $330….


Certain companies, exactly as people have said, you do better in long run just holding, and/or adding on dips. 

Others have high enough volatility/movements (like LABU and other triple-leveraged ETFs) that you can swing play pretty well. 

But, no, I don’t do this on margin. And I don’t have the time to rely on swing/day trades. 


So. Both?

I would say the answer lies in your goals and risk/stress tolerances."
6/27/2021 19:56,stocks,Totally agree. Timing is hard when it’s happening in real time. Looking at a chart later and pointing is easy. GL out there hope you hit some good plays
6/27/2021 19:39,stocks,Consistency is definitely a challenge. Really looking to hear how people have tackled that aspect.
6/27/2021 19:55,stocks,Makes sense. Diversifying is the best thing to do. You could even do multi-day plays with it and not sweat it.
6/27/2021 19:31,stocks,Thanks for sharing. Would you say it's generally possible to manage to keep the borrowing interest lower than what you would make?
6/27/2021 19:47,stocks,"I’ve done it all; day trading, swing trading and long term investing. Honestly if you are investing in large caps the old adage of time in the market vs timing the market holds true. I have made money but could have made more just leaving it alone and trying not to time the dips. Plus all the time you spend watching and analyzing and researching. I’ve stopped swing and day trading. One thing I learnt is they always fall harder than they rise. When you balance out all your wins vs your losses it’s too much effort. Of course I have a high paying career so the opportunity cost is much greater. If you aren’t working then it’s definitely better than getting a low paying job."
6/27/2021 19:58,stocks,"Only thing I can say is I have consistently lowered my % return expectations / risk tolerance for short plays.  Make a target, have your thesis, have a stop loss, and GL"
6/27/2021 19:59,stocks,"Exactly. If you have the ability to pick a stock everyday that can yield 1 - 5 % ... you can pick 5 of those stocks every day. So put 20% in each one if u rlly wanna go balls out, instead of 100% into 1 single thesis.  And then if one of them does some crazy ish intraday you don't have to go give slob jobs behind your local Wendy's.  And if you're as good as you think you are, you'll get very similar results as to if you were to successfully pull off that yolo. 

If you've only got 500 bucks tho and you're trying to pay rent with it ... ya you're gonna have to throw that into every play most likely."
6/27/2021 19:43,stocks,Yes. Use your own money.
6/27/2021 19:59,stocks,Best point on board. Use your own capital. I also wouldn’t advise using borrowed money for any kind of short term or speculative play

6/27/2021 19:49,stocks,"I think Walmart is far more guilty of causing small businesses to close, but Amazon is certainly guilty of killing lots of book stores.

The thing about Amazon is that even if a business has their own website, they almost have to sell on Amazon as well, because that's the first place so many people go to to shop online. So Amazon always gets their cut."
6/27/2021 19:30,stocks,And? This is a bad thing?
6/27/2021 19:39,stocks,Yes.
6/27/2021 19:49,stocks,"Yes, particularly for innovation and overall economic productivity. Many have been conditioned to believe that the Amazons and Teslas and Government Labs of the world create all of the IP, but that's far from true. Innovation largely springs from regular folks solving problems in their businesses. Amazon, after all, started in a garage, so did Microsoft and Apple. If we allow anticompetitive behavior, we won't even know what we're missing.

Also, SMBs hire people and spend money in small towns. This money is way more important to the small towns than billions more in Silicon Valley or Seattle. 

I'm supportive of Amazon disrupting retail as they had a good idea and traditional retail had been sitting on their collective ass for years. However, Amazon's position as a market leader in cloud computing and plans for shipping, healthcare, and other ventures is an issue. If our elected representatives care about the economy long term, they'll need to split Amazon up."
6/27/2021 18:40,stocks,"I have no idea, but I bought a bunch of preferred shares after the crash. 60% down because of a severe overreaction? Yes, I'm buying the dip. Total leap of faith."
6/27/2021 19:03,stocks,Tough one. I follow this quite a bit. It may pay off but it’s probably dead money for at least two more years.
6/27/2021 18:54,stocks,"> What's the recommended investment for someone with my beliefs above?

Wait for the the GSE to be refloated and invest in the refloat.

There's no guarantee that it will be refloated and it is almost certain that it will spend an extended period of time in conservatorship (think at least a decade until the post covid default risk has subsided due to sunken cost fallacy/inflation)."
6/27/2021 18:42,stocks,"Ok, but my worry is that if it stays under government conservatorship, and shareholders don't ever get any right to the profits, where's the reward?  
Also, if you don't mind me asking, which preferred and why not the common?"
6/27/2021 19:16,stocks,">probably dead money for at least two more years

Yeah that was my initial worry with it."
6/27/2021 18:56,stocks,"Oh wow.   
I'm just wondering if a large percent of the upside will already be captured by the time the refloat and all is announced?  
Because wouldn't at that point, it just trade similar to a regular financials stock?"
6/27/2021 18:51,stocks,"No, you're thesis is right, conservatorship is pretty bad. Probably not going to change under Democrats.

Preferred shares get first dibs for assets payout if this deal goes bad ie: bankruptcy. Also they dropped more in value so I'm betting on a better bounce."
6/27/2021 19:05,stocks,The common will probably get canceled. It’s way harder to cancel preferred.
6/27/2021 18:58,stocks,"There's no guarantee what-so-ever that previously issued securities, that have effectively been retired to the OTC markets, will be ""made whole"" during the refloat.  If you know *anything* about the OTC market(s), you will know that it is home to some of the most vile and blatantly illegal manipulation of ""stock"" trading known to man (outside of maybe ICOs).  I believe that this was a masterstroke of the Treasury when the bailout plan was devised (they knew well and true that nothing cast down to the third circle of equities hell would be able to make it back into the ""heaven"" of a well regulated SEC adjudicated exchange).  I would argue that one of the latent things that is happening is that all the issuance currently held on the OTC market is effectively being dispatched so that a refloat is actually possible.

Sucks, but that's just the way it is and the courts seem to have decided to let the issue die of old age.  (if you don't have a SCOTUS ruling that you disagree with, you haven't been paying attention)

Beyond all of that, I think keeping this sort of debt creation and insurance mechanism out of the market's reach might be a really, really good thing for the country.  The shuttering of FNMA as a traded security was one of the only times that I can think of that we were able to ""get money out of politics"" (prior to the conservatorship, FNMA was one of the biggest lobbying interest on Capital Hill).  Even further, one of the very real things people neglect about the run-up to the subprime crisis and then GFC is that housing was being used as a money creation mechanism to pay for GWOT.  Go listen to/read some of the things Thomas P.M. Barnett (author of The Pentagon's New Map) has to say about GWOT and how the trillions and trillions of dollars it cost is being paid for (now and by future generations)."
6/27/2021 18:54,stocks,"Ok ok, but for preferred, what's the trade off?   
Does it just have a lower hypothetical return in a success scenario?  


Like, that's why all of the preferred shares are much more expensive than common for FNMA?"
6/27/2021 19:06,stocks,"You are only half right. No one can buy the preferreds that act the way preferreds are thought to act.

The US Treasury added new senior notes above all other preferreds you can actually buy."
6/27/2021 19:18,stocks,Hmm that makes sense. An extra layer of protection
6/27/2021 19:17,stocks,"Hah yeah I get what you mean about SCOTUS rulings.   


But ok, so the preferred just have a lower chance of total capital loss?"
6/27/2021 19:07,stocks,"Preferreds have a higher theoretical return than common. They might go back to par. 

In 100 years."
6/27/2021 19:18,stocks,"So does only the US Treasury have access to those ""Super Senior Notes"" which if it were to be recapitalized, would end up owning it?"
6/27/2021 19:21,stocks,"The junior perferreds (traded on the OTCMKTS) are going to zero.

The senior preferreds (held by the Treasury) will go into the refloat (if it happens at all)."

6/27/2021 17:58,stocks,"It’s funny that you posted this as I was contemplating this very idea this morning.  Friends of mine just purchased a second house for rental income.  They seem happy and excited with their purchase, but I’m not interested in the hassle of having to manage a second property.  The only way this works for them is the fact that they are highly leveraged.  Assuming they don’t have bad tenants that wreck the place or miss payments and that property values continue on an upward trend, they should have a pretty good return on investment over the next 20 years.

The one thing holding me back is the volatility of the equity market and the risk of a margin call.  But I have ventured into a small leverage position by selling some CSP’s that slightly extend me beyond my available cash position.  The positions have different dates and cover different sectors, so it is very atypical that everything moves against me all at once.  If the market tanks and I am in this unfortunate position, I have a plan in place to manage it.  Also, the amount by which I am ‘leveraged’ is a small percentage of my overall portfolio."
6/27/2021 18:06,stocks,"With property you don't generally get margin called if the perceived value drops significantly, but with equities you can. So a 25%+ drop in the stock/market will cause you to lose all your money.

And 25%+ drops happen very frequently in the markets."
6/27/2021 17:51,stocks,"The difference between real estate and stocks is that stock are much more risky and much more volatile, leveraging anything will amplify the risk and volatility, property is inherently rather stable and normally gains value rather slowly, stocks on the other hand can move 10% in a day and can go bankrupt, can miss earnings and can crash far more regularly than the real estate market. there's just so much more risk with stocks and so leveraging that just amplifies the risk. The thing your forgets is that leverage dosnt just amplify volatility it amplifies risk, in the housing market the risk is low so its generally okay but in the equities market the risk is quite high and amplifying that can be very dangerous."
6/27/2021 18:05,stocks,"I suppose you can if you can find value dividend paying equities with volatility as low as real property.   That is the kicker however.   Even something like XOM or CVX went down 50% last year.  The last time that happened to property was in Nv and Az in 08 and just like margin accounts a lot of people lost their asses in those areas with leveraged real property.   I bought a small rental in LV for $159k in Aug of 07 that had been bought for $196k in 06, that was worth as little as $62k in 2010-2012 that I finally sold for $115k in 2019.  I had bought with 40% down so even with that I got underwater for quite a time.  In fact the $115k sale netted me nothing after paying expenses of sale and realtor fees.  The beauty of a real estate mortgage is that you don't get a mark to market margin call when you go underwater so all you have to do is continue to pay your mortgage to get through the downturn."
6/27/2021 18:30,stocks,"I'm using heavy leverage.  I don't prescribe to the notion that using margin is bad.  It is a tool that can be very beneficial in the right hands.  I'm not using margin to dabble in options or speculative bets.  I use it in blue chip growth stocks and dividend stocks for the most part.


However, it is a short term thing.  I'll start deleveraging next year and reassess my risk."
6/27/2021 19:23,stocks,"Leveraging yourself via a specific leveraged fund removes the risk of margin calls. The only thing to watch out for is the obvious compounding negative returns, and the fact that an industry leveraged ETF can go to 0 if the industry falls 33% (3x) or 50% (2x), while the S&P stays above circuit breakers. If you do decide to follow along with such a strategy, it's best that you do so with an additional strategy (i.e changed to non-leveraged fund if it falls below 200 MA, and switch back when above)."

TSM: The company will have to pick up the pace with earnings to justify it's current price. It's not really overvalued, just fairly valued, and I think there are better deals in the semiconductor industry, but the Taiwan diversification factor along merits some consideration.

6/27/2021 18:35,stocks,love NVDA. I caved and bought some in the $700s.
6/27/2021 16:32,stocks,Agreed. It’ll be awhile before I add to my position. They fell to like 460 a few months ago. If you’ve been watching them you could’ve bought in around that time.

6/27/2021 16:39,stocks,I listened to a podcast who interviewed a very knowledgeable industry journalist.  He talked about Ford's new CEO and how he's a very focused person and is leading Ford in a  very focused direction.  I expect them to be a long term buy and this not a short term spike.  I don't like the auto industry myself but I like the company.

6/27/2021 17:58,stocks,"It's been no higher than 17 or so in the last 10 years....its cheap. But will be even cheaper at the end of the year. 
Edit: Tesla will lead the way in the next 10 years, not Ford, and if Ford is higher than 25 bucks in 2 years I will def come back here and eat my hat. And who said anything about timing the market...just looking at Ford's past, present, and competition."

6/27/2021 16:13,stocks,"I'm not a US citizen so I'm curious why you consider Intuit a good company. From what I've heard they are responsible for why the tax reporting is so complicated in US as they prevent any attempts to change the system for better. I live in Poland, here the government just sends you the report once a year and you simply accept it or amend a bit. So companies like Intuit are simply not needed here."

6/27/2021 19:10,stocks,Stock splits typically mean slower growth. Look at Apple for example. Ignore Tesla because i believe it’s mostly hype.
6/27/2021 18:03,stocks,"Maybe in the long terms they’re not. But, I can’t justify to myself buying anything that’s tripled in the last 12 months. Because I have to ask myself, what do I like about them more now than I did 12 months ago, because I didn’t buy them then. The answer can’t just be it’s a higher price. No Fomo allowed."

6/27/2021 15:51,stocks,"Well, its fairly simple. I love what they're doing but i just think that the share price is little bit ahead of the company itself. I do not have a position in ROK since i found out about it only recently but i plan to buy in at 250 or lower. To be honest, even the current price is not outrageous but i have recently been buying other companies so in the spirit of DCA i am not in a hurry to invest more at the moment and am happy to give it some time. But at 250 I'd buy immediately."
6/27/2021 18:35,stocks,"No, to be honest, i don't care too much about anything except the business being solid, having good future prospects and the stock not being ridiculously overpriced. I'm not planning to sell anything for at least next 20 years."
6/27/2021 18:38,stocks,I do have a position in PLTR already and I'm so far +25%. But i want to continue to DCA more when/if the price drops.

6/27/2021 18:29,stocks,"I think you need to ask yourself whether you might be missing something about these companies (I am long both, but not expressing an opinion right now) or the market they operate in. It sounds like you are price anchoring without a reason."
6/27/2021 19:30,stocks,Yea 160 was good entry but maybe they’ll dip for their next earnings because it should come down after COVID… but that’s probably priced in by now. They did make a huge acquisition recently so I feel like there’s a lot more upside potential here
6/27/2021 19:58,stocks,Trying to make it easier for rich people to avoid taxes. I imagine it is mostly loopholes and tax breaks for corporations and other rich folk. Then there's all the tax credits and tax breaks that were created as a bandage for some other problem instead of fixing the actual problem. Like our shitty healthcare system.
6/27/2021 19:33,stocks,US taxes literally make it where thousands of people renounce their citizenship every year. I can't think of any other country that has a tax system causing that.
6/27/2021 17:41,stocks,"Oh interesting, I see now.  Why so low?"
6/27/2021 16:03,stocks,"Appreciate the reply. I wanted to make a point to invest early in the automation industry, given who knows when automation hype catches up to the industry and creates a bubble (if it even happens), but I plan on buying 5 shares on Monday and holding for awhile."
6/27/2021 19:22,stocks,"Not sure about that. ABB is especially cyclical so good example here. Zoom out the chart and you can see where the cycle has peaked and where it has bottomed very easily. If you bought at the bottom you did good but if you bought at the top you went nowhere for 10 years. This is not to say that ABB is bad company. Far from it, it's leader in industrial automation and electrification. However, some sectors are cyclical and you cannot burry your head in the sand and ignore it..."
6/27/2021 17:48,stocks,Might be tricky if TSLA heads over 900 again. They’ve been lagging the SPY. Same with AAPL.
6/27/2021 19:48,stocks,Yea. Not totes sure on acquisition being positive in the short-term but I’m keeping my eyes on it
6/27/2021 17:47,stocks,I’m not sure exactly why but that’s the reason it’s so high.  Looks like they never had a stock split
6/27/2021 17:53,stocks,Yeah I‘ll look out what happens. It really seems to be tricky. Also usually trading212 quickly restricts you from leveraging if markets get too volatile. A
6/27/2021 17:56,stocks,"For example; I see so many people claiming the Dow is overvalued. At the same time when you look at the components, it tells a different story. CRM has been lagging, BA could easily test 300, AAPL has been beating earnings and still struggling to hold the post split value."
6/27/2021 18:08,stocks,"Yeah but I can get behind Apple not growing further. They didn‘t develop something truly breakthrough since maybe iPhone or iPad (okay new M1 is nice but it‘s „just“ another development). 

They‘re doing great and are still expanding, but at 200B a valuation of 2 Trillion is fair imo. They‘re not gonna be able to suddenly increase revenue to 500B, esp now that after the covid crisis i bet many people have bought their stuff and are happy with it. It‘s gonna reach 3T $ soon-ish, but excluding inflation I‘d say they needed about 2-5 years for that. Now because america printed 1/5th of all dollars in the pas year tho, it could be that apple is suddenly worth way more. Who know, anyways? 

I‘m gonna keep scalping rolly royce with leverage 😂"
6/27/2021 18:10,stocks,Pretty sure AAPL is gearing up for a breakthrough new technology. We’ll see. I have my 150 shares
6/27/2021 15:58,stocks,"That's a good way but also check out the companys performance last 4 quarters and financials

But that's not a bad way"
6/27/2021 16:25,stocks,"Looking at PE ratios over the last twelve months has been a bad measure of valuation (at least in my opinion). Q1 and Q2 2020 earnings numbers were so terrible due to COVID that many great companies had their PE ratio either skyrocket or go negative.

Eventually those ratios will revert to a mean (and most of their PE ratios are reverting). However, their stock prices have still gone up despite the multiple compression, as the earnings growth has been spectacular, even when compared to 2019 levels.

Because of this, I’ve tried to focus on what a company will be earning 3-5 years from now, and determining if current prices are a good value compared to those earnings. And while simple in concept, this gets difficult fairly quickly."
6/27/2021 15:28,stocks,"I like to look at the cash position as well as the debt to equity. I also compare the average High and Low price as well as the  high and lows of Price PE and BV YOY 

I check to see what the projected growth rate is and run the growth rate forward 10 years based on Current EPS to see what it's future value works out at current price I use the book value per share as the margin of safety. 

I've got a watchlist of 30 stocks I want to own and I wait till the balance out before entering or I Buy Leap options and aquire positions with profits. 

I probably keep myself out more than I should but it keeps me learning and cautious."
6/27/2021 16:37,stocks,Forward pe. Price to sales.
6/27/2021 15:53,stocks,"Enterprise Value / forward EBITDA. The forward part is the trick. That's where you have to understand the nuances of not only the company, but the entire market and the macro conditions. 

The more time you spend trying to figure this out, the more you'll trust yourself when you find a company the market is truly undervaluing."
6/27/2021 17:20,stocks,"Someone mentioned this but price to sales is a good ratio. Tech companies that don’t make money are valued this way, cuz you know, they have no earnings for a PE ratio…haha. You can make magic happen with earnings, but hard to finagle revenue/sales growth."
6/27/2021 16:03,stocks,"That's usually what I do, lol."
6/27/2021 16:39,stocks,"My hypothesis was that companies who delivered in Q1-Q2 this past year many of which did so because of great leadership, which is difficult to quantify in numbers, but usually manifests in defying expectation."
6/27/2021 16:04,stocks,"The latter half is what I'm learning, just have to be careful not to outsmart myself and being overly cautious."
6/27/2021 16:46,stocks,Wouldn’t it be forward ebit/ev for an earnings yield to use as opposed to p/e ration?
6/27/2021 16:06,stocks,Man then you are 1 step to being an ultimate trader
6/27/2021 16:47,stocks,"Leadership definitely applies to most of the biggest winners. I think you’re right on that.

On the other hand, consider a company like GM. Their management, in my opinion, is terrible when compared to their competitors (they did the Nikola deal, a Lordstown deal, are way behind Ford on EVs, etc). However, you could still have bought them at a negative PE last year and made a killing due to the excessively cyclical nature of its earnings. They were stock price was cheaper at a negative PE than they are now at (last time I checked) ~10x earnings."
6/27/2021 19:59,stocks,"Breadth of experience and time, as well as clear-eyed self-awareness (that’s the hard part for most people - knowing when you’re right or wrong and by how much), is important. And it only comes with doing and watching and tracking and doing some more. 

When you do the leg work and have the patience, every so often you stumble onto the right company at the right time, you key in on the right detail, and the confidence just keeps hitting you."
6/27/2021 19:56,stocks,"Per my finance classes and Raymond James analysts’ current MO, it’s EV/EBITDA."
6/27/2021 16:17,stocks,"I consider myself an investor that swing trades fundamentals. Don't know much about technical analysis yet, that will be my next chapter of studying the market."
6/27/2021 17:43,stocks,"A lot of GM's valuation was driven by earnings and EV hype, the former is temporary and the later is not a good reason to buy the stock when TSLA is miles ahead of its EV competitors as far as Research & Development goes. 

GM is a good example of a value trap imo, I made some money swing trading it though"
6/27/2021 17:52,stocks,"Fair enough.

And although I made a cyclical trade in GM last year, I do think that their company and management is garbage. Definitely a value trap long-term."
6/27/2021 15:17,stocks,Don’t buy the news
6/27/2021 15:46,stocks,"CARR has already been running up for months.

6/27/2021 17:10,stocks,That's what I'm going for. You have any suggestions or just critique?
6/27/2021 17:22,stocks,"I’m just saying it’s a bad idea. Buy a consumer discretionary index fund if you want to get exposure to retail trends. Alternately buying stock in major retailers/stores is a fairly safe bet as long as none of them get Amazonned. I also think the percentage of people who already own air conditioners in these heatwave areas is higher than you think it is.

If you want a specific ticker, buy honeywell"
6/27/2021 17:19,stocks,"It is possible that some of these industrial plays still have some run in them. There were a couple of smaller engineering/contractor firms that looked interesting but haven't looked at them in a month or more so not sure if they are on discount after the hiccup in the reflation trade a couple of weeks ago.

I interpret it as him saying the value of the underlying business hasn't changed that much. Instead, ppl's perceptions of their business and business model have changed, which is reflected in the stock price."

It’s a good move he’s learning from Elon"
6/27/2021 12:19,stocks,"It kind of is. Housing prices are through the roof, Zillow searches are the first place people start when house hunting, and with inflation and increased corporate ownership of homes (Blackrock) it doesn't look likely to reverse (or even slow).

Sounds like he wants to buy more (or get his vests before the price increases more).

The question is do you believe the future of home sales is individual agents or a place like zillow/redfin. I chose Zillow/redfin and bought both because I'm dumb."
6/27/2021 14:48,stocks,It is too high but that's also something dumb for a ceo to be saying.
6/27/2021 13:07,stocks,He's calling in the short sellers to really squeeze the stock price.
6/27/2021 17:51,stocks,It’s trending with the real estate market and REITs. To put it simply.
6/27/2021 16:26,stocks,"The host had noted that the Zillow's stock price really boomed during the pandemic (heading over 100 after being stuck under 50 for several preceding years) and then asked if this indicated how much the pandemic had transformed the real estate industry.

The CEO responded with the quote above -- ""Obviously the company isn't in reality that much more valuable in the space of one year..."" -- and followed that up with the Warren Buffett/Ben Graham idea that the market is driven by value in the long term but popularity in the short term.

So he was saying that the last year's share-price run-up is in excess of the last year's increase in value of the company. Though he did also say that the pandemic accelerated the transition by from analog to digital by ""five years"" in basically all industries."
6/27/2021 13:24,stocks,Actually when Elon said it he was referring to the upcoming stock split. I think this guy is actually talking about market cap not just share price.
6/27/2021 13:06,stocks,Honestly? Amazon.
6/27/2021 17:51,stocks,Hyliion
6/27/2021 15:49,stocks,"I like all the search features on Zillow but I stopped using it because it didn’t update fast enough. When a house goes pending on the MLS, Redfin is updated practically instantly or at least the same day. Zillow sometime takes a whole week for some reason. I would find shit on Zillow and double check on Redfin and good listings were already showing pending on Redfin for 2-3 days. So I just started using Redfin by itself."

6/27/2021 15:23,stocks,"Not if his intention is to drive the price down, so that he can buy more. He clearly has some ulterior motive that is hidden to us."

6/27/2021 11:16,stocks,"The stock price typically drops by the dividend amount, so there's no net gain short-term.

Simplified...if the company pays out 1M in dividends, it's immediately worth 1M less, because it no longer has that cash on hand. The stock value tends to reflect this.

That being said, stocks in strong up-trends can go up on div days if the daily trend is stronger than the dividend payment."
6/27/2021 11:42,stocks,"It's called dividend scalping. How effective it is, I have no idea."
6/27/2021 11:17,stocks,This probably happens if the stock is trending upwards as you don't want to take a bigger loss selling the stock a few weeks later than what the dividend is worth. But the scenario explained above is very possible and most likely happens regularily
6/27/2021 16:46,stocks,"To really understand it, you gotta know how stocks work. When you buy a stock in anticipitation of receieiving the dividend yield, there are also others who plan on doing so as well. This means there are fewer shares being offered at the market = higher bids for the stock. So your dividend payout may, more or less, might not even cover the depreciated price of the stock if you were to sell it after the dividend payment. Same thing vice-versa when you're trying to sell it since others would liquidate their dividend stock after receiving the dividends. More shares available for sale = lower bids. You can get really specific with it in terms of dividends being taxed at a qualified or ordinary rate as well and other tax complications. In the end, it's likely not worth the trouble and would be a gamble in-itself."
6/27/2021 18:28,stocks,"Some people my also looks at the tax burden associated with that strategy. Holding shares less than one year and selling is treated like ordinary income for tax purposes, so if you are in a high tax bracket, you could be paying more in the long run. Shares held for 1+ years are taxed at the capital gains rate, which is either 0, 10, or 15% based on your tax bracket. Just some food for thought."

6/27/2021 11:48,stocks,"It worked at some point, since then all the gains have been swallowed up by people who do this for a living.

Activision is into e-sports and mobile games, I don't think these will be gone in the near future.

EA- Kinda wish to add them, they pump good shooters, recycle trash FIFA's, NFL's etc. that a lot of people buy every year along with microtransactions in them

Tencent- Probably the most solid here- League of Legends, Fortnite...

Nintendo- No opinion.

So what do you think?"

I also had ea and square enix on otc these are all great buys from my experience not financial advice but what I saw was the gaming market is following a generation of players of the 30-40s so as long as this generation is alive and well these stocks won't do you wrong

I jsut add to my Microsoft position and consider thst my slice of “gaming”"
6/27/2021 14:42,stocks,"Most of them are overpriced right now imho. Ubisoft, ATVI, EA, TTWO obviously were all fantastic investments 5-10 years ago, but you're not getting a good deal if you buy them right now.

That said, I'm not saying they're bad investements either. I'd pick EA or TTWO over ATVI, because they've got more room to expand their overall business imho. I personally also have a bit more faith in both EA and TTWO's, game development pipeline, overall business strategy & diversity and management vs. ATVI.

Something to take into account is that some forms of microtransactions like lootboxes might face some regulatory headwinds in some countries, which could impact revenue and profit. (I don't object the opposition to lootboxes at all, it's a very questionable business model, but it's something to take into account if you invest in a company like EA, because a lot of their revenue comes from FIFA Ultimate Team)

Nintendo seems like the most attractive one based on the valuation, but their management is a bit too conservative for my likings (not necessarily a bad thing, but just something I take into account when looking at the valuation). Nintendo is a great company though: they're highly profitable, have very little overhead (they generate incredible amounts of revenue of profit relative to the capital that their business requires), their games have an enormous reach and they also have an incredibly die-hard fanbase that's also very monetizable. I consider Nintendo a very low-risk investment, but with limited upside potential for the mid-term. So overall, Nintendo stock is pretty solid, just don't expect too much from it on the short-term and mid-term.

Ubisoft looks pretty interesting in terms of valuation when you look at the P/S ratio, but their profitability leaves a lot too be desired. They lack the reliable/recurring cash-cows that EA (FIFA/FUT, Battlefield), ATVI (COD, COD Mobile, Candy Crush, WoW), TTWO (GTA V, NBA2K) have so you're more dependent on Ubisoft's ability to bring out hits in the future. If you believe in Ubisoft's ability to bring out big hits going forward, then they're the gaming stock to own imho.

Ubisoft also has an enormous amount of employees on payroll: 19 000 employees which is by far the largest of any gaming company. Despite this, they kind of struggle to bring out the reliable and highly profitable big hitters that their competitors are able to pump out with a much lower employee count.

If I had to pick one gaming-related stock it would be Sony by far and away because of the strength of their gaming brand (PlayStation obviously), profitability, outlook and extremely attractive valuation (Sony Group EV/EBITDA = 8, based on their mid-term target), though it's obviously not a a pure gaming stock. Their aim to expand the reach of their IP's with mobile games, and also porting first-party games to PC and expand their PlayStation Network (partnership with Discord) beyond just console also seems very interesting. They also have a lot of great developers and their business has little overhead.

Only thing I don't really like about Sony's PlayStation business right now is the loss-leading console model especially: scalpers are making huge amounts of profits by reselling PS5's, but Sony is taking a sizeable loss on each PS5 they sell. It's a pretty weird situation to be in for them and goes to show that the market would easily have supported a slightly higher PS5 price. But hindsight is 20/20 and overall it's a good thing that PS5 turned out to be a phenomenom.

I think they also could PlayStation could been a bit more agressive with content acquisitions. Capcom was struggling financially 5-10 years ago and would have been a great (and inexpensive) acquisition for their IP alone. But hindsight is 20/20."
6/27/2021 11:27,stocks,Your wasting your time if your trying to play these stocks based on new release dates. I challenge you  to look at their charts and then overlay that with release dates and looks for correlation I really doubt it’s there as these corporations care about quarterly earnings more than anything. Also with the current state of video games and the way they churn out unfinished people products I would not be surprised if the stock went down based on bad reviews more than anything.
6/27/2021 11:24,stocks,"Gaming stocks are too volatile for me. Drama and problems are common and some of these can trade sideways for months. The GTA expectations are extremely high and this can drag down the price if it will be below. See CD Projekt Red and Cyberpunk. 

Tencent is China so I'm not touching that. 

Gaming is prone to mediocre returns and high risk all things considered even though the market will increase every year. Lootbox regulation is bound to hit which would affect EA as well most likely.

If you really want to invest in gaming go for an ETF. 

An industry that did catch my eye is gaming gear and PC parts. Either way, I would not concentrate much of my wealth in this area. There are much better markets out there."

Lay off 200 employees nyahh but for upcoming releases in my eyes for a quick day trade in those stocks are the BOTW2 release, BF 2042, and call of duty(duh). Tencent is very ehhh because China. I don’t touch China for moral reasons and there always seems to be shady stuff with every one of their company’s tradable on U.S. exchanges especially those “medical” ones or “growth tech”ones that are clearly just false shells to raise money to fund a massive crip toe farm

My gaming related investing plan is I just invest in the supply chain of the devices/consoles  people use for gaming since that’s less volatile from e-drama from woke r tards and they do more than gaming anyway leading to a larger increase in returns over time . Chip designers, chip manufacturers(China is making this one iffy due to war threats to reclaim “a lost people”)and distributors of the completed gaming comsole/computer parts to pump the final product out to the customer."

Designers:

INTC(  guys got rekt by team red hard for delaying 7nm and releasing 14++++++)

AMD( their architecture made intels butthole larger and the designs are in both PS5 and Xbox X)

NVDA( they’re top dogs with graphics cards but AMD is catching up slowly in the GPU market for powerful actual affordable GPUs)


Manufacturers:

Intel( worlds largest chip producer except it’s only their stuff refer to designer list)

TSMC( produces AMDs chips possible war with China will kill the worlds supply of semi conductors and make everything more expensive than it already is)


Distributors(this one is probably going to get me banned for mentioning exodia):

EBAY( enjoy scalper wee wee)

AMZN (extremely large company that has 
everything. Basically e-Walmart. Sells consoles and computer parts)

WMT ( extremely large company that has everything. Brick and mortar amazon. Good dividend sells consoles GPUs online)

TGT (large company. Good dividend. Sells consoles idk about online sells for computer parts)

GME the forbidden one (the one stop shop for gaming. GameStop. they have a slightly costly way to get around scalpers just cancel your pro rewards membership once you get your hands on a console actually closer to MSRP price. Actually has computer parts in stock the last time I checked)

NEGG(I’ve never researched these guys investing wise but good luck buying new hardware at a reasonable price I use these guys for old computer hardware to do experiments with)

Anchored by three global powerhouses in entertainment, agriculture, and tech (SoCal, Central Valley, Bay Area) here are my top 10 stock picks in no particular order for long-term growth from the best state in the Union:

1. Marrone Bio Innovations (MBII, agriculture)
2. Arcadia Biosciences (RKDA, agriculture)
3. KB Home (KBH, construction)
4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, semiconductor)
5. Bloom Energy (BE, alternative energy)

Also, please note that while my choices are based on DD that draws upon my education background in Materials Science Engineering and current employment as a software engineer in Silicon Beach, this is not financial advice lol

Edit:

Some things people don't consider when bashing California:

1. Diversity - people from all over the world want to live here, that's a big part of why it's crowded.
2. Wild West heritage - relative history of being less divisive and more progressive over things like race, class, and gender. Compared to many cities out East and large swaths of the South, less time to hate your neighbor when you had no choice about relying on one another to make it Californee way.
3. People capital - Beyond having the best public university system arguably in the world, California has proven time and time again that it invests in its citizens more generously and less restrictively than other states. While 'essential' workers in Florida were told to pound sand at the height of the pandemic, California moved them up in priority for testing and vaccinations.
4. Innovation - While it pains many to see companies like Tesla and Toyota USA leave California for greener corporate pastures elsewhere, it is often forgotten that California can afford to do so because it is still the best place for many all over the world to realize their ideas and find the right combination of talent and capital. California has and continues to mint many 'unicorns' that go on to become large corporations, often leaders in their industry.
5. Weather - let's be honest here, many of us would rather be ""dead in California than alive in Arizona!"" lol"

Your best indicator: when the medias are bearish and calling for the end of the markets, take a deep breath, turn off your TV and looks at the stocks.

The other half I would manage myself, but this is because I enjoy investing and looking for opportunities in the market. You need to enjoy it and be willing to spend time. A few rules:

* I only invest in sectors I understand. For me, that's tech (especially video games) and retail. NVidia, Target, Unity, Micron, Apple, etc.
* When the market dips, that's when you buy. When you see that you lost $1k that day it's hard to respond by putting more money in, but that's what you need to do. Especially when the market is overreacting to some insignificant news.
* When the market jumps you have to sell. This is even harder than buying when it's down. Trying to sell a stock that has been making you money day after day takes discipline.
* Don't be afraid to sell a stock for a loss. Money lost is money lost. The only thing you should care about is where are you most likely to see an increase in the near future. If it's not the stock you are in, sell it and move on.
* Treat any advice on Reddit with a huge amount of skepticism (including this advice). Do your own research. Any company is a good buy at the right price, any company is a bad buy at the wrong price. It's not about if Apple is good or bad, it's about if they are worth $133 a share."

Companies with the highest cash reserves will most likely have good growth and be around in 5-10 years."
6/27/2021 14:07,stocks,"Lots of comments from everyone that has the best idea. Myself included.

First, only invest what you can afford to lose. There's a great chance 150k in 8 years could be worth 300k. But there's also a significant chance it could be worth 75k. 
If you log in one day and see you only have 75k, are you going to sell to save that 75k? Or add more? 

That way you can guage your risk tolerance.  Once you know your risk tolerance, you can filter out a lot of the comments. Index funds are great and hands off, but also you should probably understand what you are investing in. VFIAX or VOO (etf) are well run vanguard funds (mutual and exchange traded) but if the market is overvakued they may not return what you were expecting based in the risk.

If you don't have time to manage it, you may look into RIA's to manage your money. 
If you don't ever want to adjust, maybe an L fund that changes your allocation as you age to reduce risk over time.

If you are looking for real estate, REITs provide easy access with volatility which can be bad if you sell the dip. Good if you buy the dip or indifferent if you buy and hold. 
There's also private real estate investing but those come with more restrictions, less liquidity and different risks.
TL;DR 
diverisfy in several different asset classes and allocate based on your risk profile. 

If your risk tolerance is low, there's always ,cds, mygas and other products offering lower rates.
If you don't wanna lose any purchasing power, inflation protected assets could be beneficial to hold. Your 150k would be worth what 150k is worth less fees. But that could be worth 180k or 140k if we have inflation/deflation.

I saw ARK funds recommended and trashed. I saw growth vs value. I saw covered calls listed in the posts. 

All those are strategies that could be very profitable or could lose money. So really there are tons of great answers, bit without knowing your risk tolerance it's hard to say which one may be best for you. Also even if we find which one is best for you, there's no guarantee it will be a great answer if we look back 8 years from now. Ark crushed it the last 2 years but has lagged the market this year.
Value is historically the better choice long term vs growth, but value sucked the last decade. Growth is potentially highly overvakued but could excel in a deflationary environment.

Nobody has the right answer. So my suggestion... Diversify and manage risk..5% growth, 5% value, 5% small cap, 5% REITS... U get the idea. I made up percentages. Don't blindly follow those.

I'm not an advisor and just making stuff up. I have no incentive to tell u anything right (except upvotes) or anything wrong. So please do your own research, consult with professionals if needed and good luck!"

6/27/2021 15:18,stocks,"Lots of factors here. Are you self employed?
What is your age? How much do you have invested besides the 150k? What is your level of risk?

Personally I think putting it in an index is the lazy thing to do. Good yes, safe yes are there better investments, yes. But the above all play a part in how to direct it. Imo. 

If you have a business you can create a self directed ira and put almost anything in that and ot will grow tax free. Real-estate, live stock, crypto etc. You don't need a business but can be good because it can help with the contributions.  There are a number of rules on this so it may not be for you. But something everyone should be aware of.

If you have a high conviction stock that is what I would do. (Mine are tsla and pltr) But thats me I don't diversify with 20-100 of stocks. That is not for everyone. For me investing is doing very little. Meaning research and gain conviction and when I am confident I allocate more capital. Could be over a period of time. This helps when you get punched in the face when the market turns against you. If you did it right and you are confident and the thesis of your investments have not changed you will do well. Most don't make up thier choices on their own and sell in a panic. 

Just keep in mind, Mike Tyson said, ""everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face."" If you can not stick to your plan when you get punched in the face by the market, stick to indexes."

6/27/2021 15:55,stocks,"That depends on what portion of the $150k is in your whole investment fund. If $150k is the whole fund, then, I would be divided it into 4 sections.

1.) VTI, as a lot of other said, since it is the whole American market, it is less likely to crumble, and given a very long time frame, it is most likely profitable. $50k to $70k, depends on your risk tolerance, and expected return of the time span. If a 15% annual return expectation in 5 year, or 20% annual return in 10 years are feasible, I would definitely go to $70k.

2.) USA, any high dividend ones do, I said high, means at least 6%, $30k to $50k. Again depends on your risk tolerance, expected return is about 8 to 15% annually in 5 to 10 years. Given the dividend reinvested, is quite steady, backtested to 1995 comparison to SPY, it is just about 21% off of SPY gain, that's about 0.80% off per year (I know my math sucks, so just Google, YouTube, research about it yourself).

3.) Individual small-mid cap stocks mostly that have prospective, and a little bit of sure win large cap (example, ZTS). $30k to $50k, you want to risk a bit more to gain more, that's what investment is for, you wanna brag about how your investments grow after years.

4.) Individual stocks or ETFs for short term gamble, $10k to $20k. Here's where the fun seconds to 3) or more, you can play however you want, risk it all, or play several at a time. There's nothing wrong to lose or win less in comparison to others, just the amount and ones you feel comfortable with.

Pretty much sums up all what I am doing right now. Not that I have $150k to invest. I don't know nothing about real estate, and consider it very time consuming and less profitable if done wrongly, so I stay out of it.

If on the other hand, $150k is not your whole investment fund, you have other risky investments, and you want steady income, you may just pour it into USA like I said, grants you about 7.5% annual income, that's about $900 to $1000 per month of income, consider if NAV don't drop much over time.

Not financial advice, it's just my opinion."

6/27/2021 16:01,stocks,"Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon, or simply just broad market index funds and ETF’s. I feel like the massive companies everybody knows and uses their products are the ones that will continue to grow, innovate, and be around years from now, especially tech stocks, and especially just 5-8 years from now. Apple and Microsoft both have over $2 TRILLION market cap. If you wanted the highest possible % return then I wouldn’t just dump it all into a blue chip or an ETF though, that’s where you take on a little more risk, but if you wanted a somewhat comfortably safe place to put it where you aren’t worried about not seeing any return at all, the blue chips are where I’d store it. I put $100 into GOOGL at the end of last year and it’s currently worth $138+. With $150K, and a 5-8 year timeline, theres a lot of potential there. Also, this is a stocks subreddit so I only mentioned stocks but otherwise, with that kind of capital, you’d likely be able to put money down on a rental property and receive monthly income from the unit(s), also gain equity in the property in the meantime and make a return upon selling the property down the line as well. Real estate is the best passive investment besides the stock market for sure. For multi-family real estate investing I’d suggest looking up a guy named Grant Cardone. The guy leverages his money against the bank’s to acquire huge assets (like 400-unit apartment complexes) and simply manages them and pays off the loans on them at the same time as keeping the rest of the profits for himself and his investors at Cardone Capital. Either way, remember that some return is still better than no return. Chasing that 7-9% RoR in the S&P or Nasdaq is tried and true."

Real estate is also a (relatively) safer bet. Personally I think the market is in somewhat of a bubble and things may start to dip soon (as in 1-3 years). Perhaps keep some cash aside for this.

You will pay $15 everytime you withdrawl from Voyager or you could use Nexo and get 1 free withdrawl a month but they pay 8% on USDC unless you lock it up for 30 days and then you can get 9%.

I literally have about 150k I am looking to do this to as well. My first step into crypto dollars until I decide what stocks I want. Once I go in on stocks I am going to be doing a monthly DCA of $5k or more per month and taking margin loans against it right away and then back into crypto dollars.

Without that info I would say: This is a time of stock picking rather than buying QQQ, SPY, etc. The market has had enormous growth in the last two years. I doubt it will grow as swiftly in the coming 5-8 years - so avoid SPY and QQQ.

EASY ANSWER: If you need dividend income for your retirement then buy WFC or C. If you want some low risk growth - then buy Alphabet and GM.

BETTER ANSWER:

US Real Estate is expensive now, but foreclosed Italian real estate can still be bought at low prices at state issued Italian property auctions. If you are dreaming of retiring to Italy and are getting close to retirement - then you may be able to buy a tiny fixer upper B&B within your budget.

If you needed a very high return and you are willing to take significant risk - then (certain countries in) Latin America is the place to be now. But you need to speak Spanish/Portuguese and you need monitor the geopolitical situation and the commodity prices every day. Things can go sour very quickly in Latam now.

However, be careful in the present market... with all the talk about inflation and higher interest rates on the medium term this may not be as great as it sounds. To put it briefly, tech companies do better when the interest rates are stable or trending lower. If you expect the interest rates to go higher (and they are quite low), then tech tends to suffer a bit. This is part of the reason SPY has gone up 14.7% this year, while QQQ has gone up 11.6%. Mind you, it's still an awesome return. But since the interest rate is likely to go up, better to play it safe and keep some on stuff less sensitive to IR."

1. There's no way to seriously value any Coins, so I personally wouldn't touch Crypto at all, but if you seriously want to get into Crypto I'd advise you to NOT put 40% of your money into Crypto lol.  

2. PLTR and TSLA are great companies but not great investments in my opinion. Especially Teslas valuation, even after falling about 30% YTD, is way too high. I seriously wouldn't even buy Tesla at $50. They're not only diluting the hell out of you but the ""projections"" (read: phantasies) are in no way shape or form realistic to justify their current price. If you seriously want to buy Tesla at a Market Cap of 650 Billion Dollars you should go to a psychiatrist first because this thing won't end well. People always laugh at you for not owning X stock. It was Cisco in the year 2000 when the Dotcom bubble burst. They'll laugh at you for not owning it, but they'll get very quiet the second all their phantasies turn out to be unrealistic which makes the stock crash. You might miss the hype but you'll also miss the crash. Generally I would advise you to not touch any EV or Renewable Energy stocks at the moment because almost all of them are horrifically overvalued, for obvious reasons (just like in the dotcom bubble).  

3. It's great how you think Real Estate is overvalued but don't think that most stocks are in the same situation. I disagree.  

4. ETF's are the way to go if you don't know anything about investing plus aren't interested in learning more about it. Quite cheap, almost always perform well depending on which one you buy, very low maintenance."

BTW, I work for a Casino in Las Vegas, so though I don’t play Roulette, I know quite a bit about the game.

Edit: Wow, not much humor in the investment world. I put in the joke that 22 is red, not black to see if u/Harrigan_Raen would chase that false rabbit.

But no, I don’t think they will go up that high. The bond market is completely fucked/trapped.

Nearly happened in 2008 (and again in 2020) but the Fed slammed the federal reserve rate back to zero and buys shitty corporate debt every month to force interest rates to remain low.

Even though we both make pretty good money we can’t upgrade because of the costs of kids and child care, etc. 

For what it is worth, I think a lot of the people buying expensive homes are families with two upper class incomes. We know one that is a doctor and a lawyer, another that is two doctors, another that’s an accountant and a lawyer, etc. We were trying to figure out who the hell is making the $500k in annual income you probably need to buy these 1.5 million homes that are springing up everywhere.

The vast majority of homeowners say the best investment they’ve ever made was into buying their home. The only exception is if you plan to move in the next 5 years. You can also house hack to make things more affordable. Buy a 3 bedroom house, rent two rooms, live in the 3rd."

Most people want a house straight out of school. This is a very American thing. People do not need a house immediately ! They need to focus on building equity first.

Also, this mentality of ""you can be what you want to be in life !!!"" needs to stop. Some industries are hiring with some decent salaries, while some fields will condemn people choosing that track to a life in poverty. Is it fair, is it cool, I don't know but it's the reality.

When you have too much supply of a good it sits in a warehouse and costs the owner money, so they have to lower prices to move it. Houses are different - it's shelter, a basic necessity.

The fact is there is still a shortage - people are buying houses at these prices. It just sucks for people who don't own a house now."

Did you seriously just say that you would buy Tesla at 50 because it's currently at 650...? You really didn't understand what I was telling you, right? So let's talk about some of the stocks of the Dotcom Bubble. Microsoft fell by 80% and it took them 17 YEARS to break even. 17 Years! Amazon lost 90% of share price and it took them 11 YEARS just to break even. Cisco lost 85% and it still didn't break even. If you bought Cisco 21 years ago you would still be down by about 44%.  


You're the type of guy who would've lost a ton of money in 2000. You will eventually lose a ton of money if you don't educate yourself on how to at least try to come up with the actual value of a stock. Tesla is NOT worth 650 billion Dollars today. Its valuation is crazy and unjustifiable. I would actually argue that Tesla went up as much as it did last year largely because of technical reasons and people somehow attempted to justify the price action. It will crash. Eventually. They all do."

TSLA is also trading at insane valuations all while every other car company on Earth is now moving into the EV space in mass.

I assume by “stock of supplies” you mean building material prices? Or perhaps you mean stock of housing inventory? Either way, both are in low supply = higher, not lower, prices for housing. At any rate, I never implied that housing isn’t overvalued. I’m just saying it’s absolutely nuts of you to see housing as overvalued while believing that pltr and tsla are not.

Cheap stocks will come soon. Prepare your cash."
6/27/2021 0:00,stocks,"How Stocks Are Valued Part 1: Discounted Cash Flow I saw a question on this sub yesterday about why stocks are valuable, so I thought I would do a write-up of what I learned about stocks in business school. But first, an important concept:

# The Time Value of Money, Present Value, and Discount Rate

**A loan to a friend**

Imagine if you loaned someone $1000 for a year. You probably want to be paid back with interest. This interest compensates you for losing access to that money for a year, during which you could have deposited it at a bank, invested it, or even spent it.

The long story short is that $1000 today is worth more than $1000 tomorrow because of the flexibility and options that you have with today's money. We can say that the ***Present Value*** of $1000 next year is less than $1000 today. This concept is also known as ***The Time Value of Money.***

**An Example With T-Bills**

Treasury bills (T-Bills) are essentially loans to the US Government, but the amount to be repaid is fixed. T-Bills are typically denominated in $1000s, which is the amount the government will repay when the bond matures. 

An investor can typically buy a T-Bill for less than the full $1000 on the open market. The investor makes money because she purchased the future $1000 payment at a ***discount.*** This discount exists because money today is worth more than money tomorrow. How do you convert between the two? Using the appropriately named ***Discount Rate***, or the required rate of return. 

The average investor wants to make money from lending money, even to the US Government. If investors want a 1% return, then $100 today is the same as $101 next year.

We can similarly price T-Bills: If the required rate of return is 1%, and the bond will pay $1000 in a year, then the ***Present Value*** of the T-Bill is about $990. This is because the $990 investment will grow by 1% into $1000.

***--------------------------------------------------------***

Are you still awake? Good. This is the fun part.

# So What Are Stocks Anyway?

Stocks represent partial ownership of a company. A company is divided into units of stock called shares, and as a shareholder, you are entitled to a fraction of the company's assets (after all debts are repaid) and any future profits.

**So Why Does a Stock Have Value?**

Part of a stock's value comes from its book value (the value of all company assets minus all company debt) but this clearly only a small fraction of that price ( the average price-to-book ratio for the companies in the S&P500 is about 4.5). ***The remainder of the stock value comes from the future earnings of a company.***

Similar to how the price of a T-Bill is the present value of a future payment, a large part of a stock's value comes from the present value of future earnings. Analysts will project (and discount) a company's future earnings, add the book value, and arrive at an estimate of the stock's value.

# Oversimplified DCF Example:

The Pear Company makes $100 a year risk-free. For simplicity's sake, it has $200 in assets and no debt. For some reason, you figure 100% is a good discount rate to use.

The Pear Company will make $100 next year (Year 1), which is worth $50 today ($50 doubles into $100 in a year). In Year 2, The Pear Company's earnings are only worth $25 to you today, and so on. If you add the present value of all future cash flows together, you'll arrive at $100. 

You can find the company value by adding the value of its assets ($200) with the present value of its future earnings ($100).  If Pear issues 100 shares, each will be worth $3.

[Of course, even simple DCF Models IRL look a little scarier than the above example.](https://imgur.com/a/DzMQHHT)

# But What Makes The Stock Valuable To Me?

You might have noticed that dividends aren't really taken into account at all. How are you supposed to get any real money from a company whose stock pays no dividends?

Unpaid dividends don't just disappear. Management can decide to reinvest these profits to grow their income. This results in a larger stock price over time. The company might also just decide to keep the cash on its balance sheet. This results in a larger book value, and the stock price will increase to reflect that.

You can sell some stock to create your own ""dividend"" if you'd like; you will own a smaller percentage of the company, but because profits were not distributed to shareholders, the company has gotten bigger.

**But What Makes The Stock Valuable To The Next Guy?**

Eventually, the company's value will be returned to shareholders. This could happen in several ways:

1. Dividends are paid out in the future, returning capital to investors
2. The company is acquired or goes private, and shareholders either receive cash or stock in the acquiring company. Typically, the acquisition price is determined by, among other things, the present value of all future earnings of the company,
3. The company might also just decide to stop operating and liquidate its assets. Shareholders will receive all assets the company owns (after paying its debt)."

6/27/2021 10:20,stocks,"A bit of context: 

Each transaction you make to add new shares to your existing position becomes a “tax lot”. As you keep buying shares into your existing position at different dates, you end up having multiple tax lots in your position. If you hold them for a long time, some tax lots will become long term and some will remain short term depending on when you bought each tax lot and if it’s been a year since you bought those tax lots.

Having said that… 

When you sell your entire position, different tax rules apply to each tax lot as some may be short term and some may be long term, depending on how long you’ve held them. 

If you only sell part of your position, e.g. one tax lot of 10 shares, different brokers handle it differently. As pointed here by others, almost all brokers use “First In First Out” as default. So if you have two lots with 10 shares each bought on different dates and when you hit the sell button for 10 shares, the first lot you bought will be sold first. 

Many brokers also provide capability to go back and and reassign which lot you “actually wanted” to sell. At the end of the tax year, your calculations might tell you that using the most recent tax lot would get your a better tax rate instead of the first tax lot that the broker used, you might be able to re-assign which lot to “mark” as the one you sold. 

I use E*TRADE and Interactive Brokers. E*TRADE gives you the option to either FIFO or select a particular tax lot that you want to sell. Interactive Brokers on the other hand does not allow you to select which lot you want to sell but has a tax optimizer feature which, after you sell, would allow you to choose the best tax lot for the best tax implications. Check the web version of your broker to see if this option for tax optimizer exists as the mobile apps dont usually support this capability. Check with your broker.

WISH controls the most popular shopping mobile application in the world. In short, the company is a direct-to-consumer online retailer. However, a few key features differentiate it from its competition:

* WISH does not operate any brick-and-mortar locations
* WISH does not target popular branded items in its offerings
* WISH oftentimes works directly with the manufacturers or independent sellers instead of the wholesaler

Let’s go through this list to understand why this is a significant differentiation. 

* WISH not operating any brick-and-mortar locations allows it to maintain low capital expenditures (CAPEX) and frees up its cash flows.
* WISH’s focus on unbranded items allows it to compete in a more niche market that has not been taken over by other e-commerce giants. This is a space that WISH dominates. 
* WISH’s decision to work directly with manufacturers rather than wholesalers allows it to procure its product catalog at a much cheaper price point than any competitor which it then passes on to its customers. With independent sellers, WISH offers a more unique product catalog than its competitors.

These three features combined defines how it interacts with its customer base. WISH targets mostly younger, low to middle income households. It offers cheap and unbranded products, an area that was historically ignored by larger e-commerce companies. Even their strategy to be a mobile app reflects this. According to Pew Research, lower-income shoppers accessed the internet solely through their smartphone at a rate double the other income brackets.

**The Future of E-commerce is Mobile**

E-commerce is not a new term. Years ago, a CEO at Sears might have argued that people prefer an in-store experience. Today, that same CEO would finally admit that he was incorrect in underestimating the prominence of e-commerce. However, what most people do not know is that e-commerce is still in its growth phase. Although due to COVID, 2021 represented one of the highest growth years ever for e-commerce. Its growth in Q1 2020 over tripled the growth in Q3 and Q4 of 2019. In 2020, online spending represented 21% of the total retail sales while in 2019, online spending represented only 16%.

Furthermore, the growth is mostly being captured by the American and European markets. This is especially useful for WISH as over 80% of its global sales is coming from these two regions.

A few macro trends are expected to drive e-commerce for the next decade:

* Mobile shopping: COVID-19 accelerated the shift to online shopping by over 5 years! Mobile commerce or m-commerce is expected to continue breaking out over the next few years, rising at a rate of 25.5% compounded annual growth rate. Its expected that by 2024, m-commerce will represent 44% of all e-commerce transactions accounting for \~$500B in sales.
* Big data and AI: A key advantage in e-commerce is going to be in data whether that is to power a recommendation feature or to power targeted advertisements, data is the new gold for e-commerce companies. Increasingly, the ability to personalize the shopping experience per user is becoming a crucial differentiator. BCG reports that proper personalization can increase sales by over 25%.

**WISH, More than Just a Retailer**

WISH has a few main product lines:

* Online retail store, the Wish mobile application
* ProductBoost, a marketing service on the Wish mobile application
* WishLocal, a digital presence service for smaller brick-and-mortar retailers
* Wish Express, a logistics service for customer delivery

**1. WISH as an online retail store**

As an online retail store, WISH is growing quickly in all areas. As of 2021, its revenue per active user increased 76% YOY, led by an increase in orders over $20 which increased over 50% in Q1 2021. However, total monthly active users declined 7% YOY which may indicate some saturation in their market.

As stated before, the key differentiator in the future of online retail is going to be personalization through big data and AI. WISH is uniquely positioned to capture this core advantage. At its very inception, WISH has always recognized the value of data. As of 2020, WISH catalogued the following data points:

* 100M+ monthly active users: their age, gender, location, etc.
* 150M+ activities on Wish: clicks, scrolls, items sold, etc.
* 500K+ merchant data: refund rates, ship times, etc.
* 640M+ items shipped: ratings, pictures, etc.

Through this enormous warehouse of data, WISH was able to build one of the most effective recommendation engines in the world. WISH sees **70%** of their sales coming from purchases not involved with a search query. This speaks volume on the effectiveness of their data science platform and their ability to understand their customer, which in turn enables…

**2. ProductBoost, the AdWords for Shopping**

By proving out a deep knowledge of their customer base, WISH can show relevant targeted ads to its user-base. In 2020, 30% of all merchants on WISH used this service to increase their sales which represented $140M of revenue for WISH. The company is very focused in growing this area as it represents a scalable, high-margin service offering for them. As of Q1 of 2021, they are already seeing a 14% increase in sales in this area compared to Q4 of 2019. 

**3. WishLocal, Helping those Behind the Curve**

WishLocal is a service that brick-and-mortar retailers sign up for. Through WishLocal, they agree to become a drop point for WISH products in return for a fee. They will both earn the fee as well as can cross-sell to the customer. This also serves as an incentive point for them to sign onto Wish as a merchant. While WishLocal is not a revenue generating feature, it is a point of differentiation that allows Wish to have a physical presence without the need for heavy investment in brick-and-mortar stores.

**4. Wish Express, Driving Business Forward**

Wish Express is the global logistics service at WISH. They contract out other delivery services from local vendors and stitch it all together into a single product. Like this, they can both improve their own delivery services (shipping-related refunds were down 40+% in 2021) as well as to offer another revenue generating service to their merchants and partners. In 2021, their logistics revenue was \~$250M which represented a 338% increase from the previous year.

**Strong Balance Sheet, Weak Income Statement**

WISH is a risky company, and this is reflected in their finances. They have a cash reserve of $2B which is balanced out with nearly $900M in current liabilities. In 2020, they issued $1B in new stock whose funds were used to absorb a $750M net operating loss. This represents a major risk for the company as an operating loss of this magnitude will not be sustainable for more than 2 years.

The $750M operating loss was mostly made up of an extremely high marketing expense and a reduction in their gross margins. The SG&A (primarily driven by marketing) expense went up by 40% which corresponds to a 33% increase in sales indicating an inefficient usage of resources.

While the marketing expense can be easily controlled, it’s a little worrisome to see their gross margins reduced from 80% in 2019 to 64% in 2020 especially as they have a long-term goal of 75% margins. If WISH cannot get their margins back and maintains current levels of spending, another share dilution will be necessary next year as well to sustain its balance sheet health.

In 2020 WISH did 2.54 billion in revenue, a 33.7% increase from 2019 revenues. Their trailing twelve month (TTM) gross margin is roughly 60%, which is very good for the e-commerce industry where it is usually closer to the 40% range. Like mentioned above, WISH's SG&A expense is absolutely huge and one of the main factors of why they are burning through cash. 

In their most recent earnings report, WISH management guided revenues of 715-730 million revenue for Q2 2021. What’s concerning is that it’s only 2-4% growth when looking YoY, however, management noted that this is mainly due to the incredible growth they experience the year prior as lockdowns became normalized around the world. This ties back to the debate of whether or not their target market is seeing saturation.

**The Bottom Line**

In many ways, WISH reminds me of an early Amazon. Perhaps their story will end similarly to Amazon as well where they become a global tech giant valued well past where they were as an online retail store. After all, they have many things going for them:

* The most downloaded shopping app in the world
* High market share in the niche unbranded sales space
* Expansion into high margin services

However, there are some warning signs to recognize as to how WISH may not be the next Amazon.

* Amazon already exists and it competes against WISH
* It lost monthly active users in the year it spent the most in marketing
* Its gross margins declined in 2020 (though its been steadily rising beforehand)

For me, I see a company with $1B of extra cash above its current liabilities and revenues of $2B being valued at $8.5B. I believe the $8.5B valuation reflects the risk that WISH incurs burning through $750M of cash in a year (it only happened once, 2019 was much better). If WISH can figure out a way to stem the bleeding of cash or to raise funds without a share dilution, their stock price should rise as a result.

With their focus on data, their considerable market share, and some core high margin products already underway, I believe that WISH is poised for growth in 2021.

**TLDR;**

1. WISH is in the e-commerce space and they are what I would call a ""flea market in your pocket"" that gives you access to thousands of products directly from their mobile app. They do not operate brick and mortar locations, and they do not target branded items which allows them to work directly with manufacturers instead of wholesalers (cutting out the middle man and saving on expenses).
2. WISH is able to dominate this very niche space because the big e-commerce players simply do not care about selling discount items of this type. WISH's customer-base is targeted toward the low-to-middle class which is evident if you go to their site. Many products are under $5 and in unusual categories to say the least.
3. One advantage in WISH's business model is the fact that they create a bridge between the customer and the manufacturer, cutting out the middle-man while maintaining low capital expenditures (CapEx), which free's up their cash flow to spend on things like customer acquisition.
4. When it comes to their fundamentals WISH is a ""risky"" company. They aren't overly indebted, but still hold roughly 900m liabilities compared to their 2B cash reserve. Most of their expenses are marketing expenses and they burn through a significant amount of money on customer acquisition. This might present the risk of new share issuance and dilution should the stock price out-perform in a short period of time.
5. Having said all that, their gross margin (\~60%) is quite healthy. For a company that trades at only 3x sales they have the potential to out-perform the market should they figure out a way to retain customers without spending billions on SG&A expenses. In short, they are doing just under 3 billion in sales and have a market cap of 8.7 billion dollars.

The majority of people commenting ""wish is trash scam company"" have almost certainly not done any proper research on it. I've been in WISH since recently after the IPO. The /r/wallstreetbets hype is fun, but it's always been a poorly understood company.

From the WISH CEO:

>We never hypothesized going after value conscious consumers with unbranded goods, but the early data was indisputable. There was a large underserved market of consumers that prioritized price over pretty packaging, fast shipping, and brands. Despite our metrics, we were told repeatedly and at every stage by Menlo Park investors that they didn’t know anyone that would shop on Wish. That we were unlikely to surpass whatever sales volume we had at the time. Pointing out that the biggest retailer in America focused strictly on value conscious consumers fell on deaf ears, these investors didn’t shop at Walmart either.

People with $100K accounts can't fathom shopping at WISH. But why should they? It's not meant for them.

Tl;dr: a lot of people don't understand Wish's business model. But that's okay, because that's exactly why it offers asymmetric upside."

6/27/2021 0:00,stocks,"How does shorting affect a stock? I don't mean the stock's price, I mean the company itself. I keep seeing people saying that short sellers bankrupt companies, but, to my understanding, the only way that they affect the company is through lowering the share price. A lower share price means that the company can raise less money through additional share offerings, but... That's about it, right? 

I also guess it affects more of the intangible aspects like investor confidence and so on, but I still fail to see exactly how short sellers affect the company.

If the company is good enough, eventually it will bounce back up, right? There's a reason why the most shorted companies are some of the most controversial ones. Most of the them have slim chances of performing well or are overvalued.

And, also, if we apply the reverse logic, if a company's share price gets pumped up and kept up, the only thing they can do is raise more money through the shares. However, if their management and business is shit, they're just buying themselves more time before bankruptcy, right?

I've seen the theories about companies that are trading above the fair value actually creating value through share offerings, but at the end of the day it comes down to the underlying business and it's performance. If a company was that good that it only needs money to become an amazing performer, there surely would be some merry bunch of individuals who would give them some. I mean, investors and institutions are spending a fuckton of money supporting companies with a 10% chance of surviving over the next few years and dodgy startups, if they saw a company that only needs cash to perform well, they'd surely recognise the opportunity, right?

I have not actually done any substantial factual research on this although admittedly it's a bit hard to find good resources right now which are not biased. This is purely my own personal understanding. There's plenty of people here who are smarter than me so I was hoping that somebody would have a good answer 😁

Shorting creates sell flow. Drops price of stock.

6/27/2021 8:54,stocks,"Short answer, financing. 


A publicly traded company with a good valuation can easily get cash by diluting their stock. This does not only make financing through dilution less costly, it also makes financing through debt easier, as the bank knows the company can always dilute to pay that debt. 


A stock with poor valuations can't do that as easily."

The only real thing it impacts is equity raises, which are dilutive to existing shareholders and contrary to what a lot of armchair experts in this thread are saying, are NOT the most common way to raise money unless you are very new or in say the biotech industry. Companies being shorted are often really just highly overvalued or shit companies that are on a downtrend. Who cares if they aren’t able to raise money. There is a ton, a TON of shitty, unprofitable zombie corporations kept alive solely by diluting shareholders and exhausting credit facilities. 

Screw that. Put capital where it will be employed most effectively. Shorts are an incredibly important part of price discovery especially in frothy markets like this. This isn’t to say some big funds that short don’t put out BS hit pieces or get their friends at different banks to issue awful ratings to help their position. But those same funds also manipulate the market to get certain stocks bullish so they can unload their shares on retail. But people only focus on shorts."

6/27/2021 10:10,stocks,"Shorts do not drag down a price. At most, it's a short term effect. Just think about it: what part in short selling would make it go down in the long term to actually cause bankruptcy? All a short seller does is opening a position that he plans to buy in the future, in other words the broker buys the share in that very moment at that very price that it has on the market. This does nothing to the price.

What it can do though is scare off new investors that see a high short ratio. Large institutions have their hands in almost everything and have a far superior way of evaluating things, meaning betting against that is usually a bad idea as the shorting has it's reason.

You can read it up here, but from a pure logical point this should already be answered before you even open the link.

But let's talk about the next part of your question: Bankruptcy. A company that does well and is well established will never need to issue shares to raise capital, and that's the only real part for a company where the stock price matters. Sure, if they hand out shares to their employees then it matters to the employees as well, but that's a personal matter, not one for the company.

What does absolutely cause a company to file bankruptcy is a failing business and a failure to adapt to new circumstances, leading to you losing more and more money and the only way to get money back is either a loan - which might just add debt pressure on you and makes you look even worse on paper - or by offering shares. A company that has a very high short ratio will have a hard time selling it's stock, but again, that's not the fault of shorts but the fault of the company for having a failing business."

6/27/2021 10:08,stocks,"It’s a self fulfilling prophecy.  If enough people bet on the stock price to go down, especially if they are naked shorting (which can mean more shares are shorted than actually EXIST), then yeah the share price is going to fall. It’s a shit ton of extra shares that don’t even exist being sold.  Too much supply lowers the share price and then more and more people stat shorting it.  It effects the company in a number of ways…many were already mentioned in other comments…. perception of company to prospective investors, ability to maximize leverage, etc."
6/27/2021 12:19,stocks,"Thought I would share my view on this one. Shorting in itself don't bankrupt a company, it in itself helps in price discovery to make it ""efficient"" better, as if there is no shorting, if one thing a stock is overvalued, they would just avoid it, but shorting helps creating value in finding the company's ""fair price"". With that being said, shorting, often times is used with smear campaign not just to the public, but to the strategic investors and just creating fears in general, these strategies requires one to be in the industry to tell. There is this one strategy that is ""long the strong and short the weak"", when one is weak, you keep beatin it down, and many times when short succeeds, it doesn't mean the company itself is a scam or whatnot, but if the price is keep low enough for long enough time, there will be times where the company is actually in a tough spot and need to use the capital to hold and when they can't, itll just be bankruptcy declared for the company to salvage capital for shareholders. The general idea of such strategy is not IF it will need the capital, it's about when it needs the capital, and if you ask me, i agree, no company ever stay profitable and be on top all the time. Using this line of thought, same way as you would be finding a ""value"" stock, you find these stocks that are vulnerable to conditions of the market then start targetjng it in hopes of a payday. Finance market in large is , was and will be about the quantitative aspect, most of the time there won't be a personal reason to do such things to a company, it's always about the profit and there will be strategy to do so in a quantitative way."

I have a degree in finance and work in finance.

All these other things people are talking about are strategies that can be used to make a short profitable, but not a result of the actual short."
6/27/2021 17:11,stocks,"Failing ≠ Failed 

Shorting affects the company, by effectively removing one way of financing a pivoting strategy. Let's say, for example, that AMC realizes it's current business model isn't working, so it comes up with a new one to bring it into the modern world.  But to adopt new technologies, it needs to raise $100 Million which is not available from lenders, so it needs to issue stock. Let's say that the stock was holding pretty steady at $50/share, so the offering is set for 20 million shares to be issued.

Now hedge funds come in and significantly short the stock... shaking confidence and dropping the price to $25. That drop would likely result in much less capital being raised, maybe not enough to make the pivot that would have saved the company. 

It's like draining a lake of water and blaming the fish for not being able to breathe air, or not choosing a different lake."
6/27/2021 17:46,stocks,"Shorting in itself doesn't affect the stock.  But if there's more selling than buying, the price will go down.  But a large institution consolidating shares to short and unleashing all of them at once could* drive the price down, provided the shares aren't bought at the same rate.  But that being said, shorting usually occurs when it's expected that the price will go down and not to drive the price down."

I get that they’re trying to make money but somehow it seems very behind the scenes type of sneaky.  And on top of it all they’re not even using their money.

6/27/2021 11:14,stocks,"This doesn’t have to do with capital financing like everyone else is talking about but this is a relevant point to consider.

Very often large hedge funds with significant power/influence short a company, before engineering the outcome so that the company does go bankrupt and they profit. For example, they may come public with their short position, driving down investor confidence, run “slander” stories on the company across the news, etc.

Among other reasons, this is why shorting stock can be seen as controversial. Institutions who are net short profit from the company’s demise, and so there’s an incentive to destroy or devalue these companies."

Another thing is that short sellers often aggressively promote the flaws the company has, which has a negative impact on the company's image.

All of this doesn't destroy the company, but there are negative effects that add up."

Good accounting practices plus profitable business equals no need to raise money through floating more shares IMO. Plus, if you float more shares, you dilute your existing shareholders and I've seen that most companies tend to resort to bank loans anyway before floating more shares. After all, diluting the shares leads to a lower EPS, lower dividend yield, lower book price per share, etc. No well-performing company would do that  IMO unless they're seriously overvalued (Tesla).

It is not stock price that brings them to insolvency. It is their business comes to a natural sunset: see Yahoo or Blockbuster.

Shorting as a result of falling stock prices comes from followers, those trying to make a quick buck on the current sentiment. They have already been triggered to follow suit.

Yahoo and Blockbuster could of pivoted and changed but stuck in their ways and died or were bought out. As the saying goes in business “innovate or die”.

Big companies couldn´t make payroll - even though they had enough assets and were profitable for quite some time. And that had nothing to do with them being a bad business suddenly.

Pay media and analysts to negatively assess the target company. Borrow every stock available to short it. Price drops (esp microcap). Analysts and media claim how right they were. Actual selling happens. More shorts happen. Media gets on a bandwagon and digs up any negative story they can find - poor working conditions, lack of woke-ness, buying from sweatshops, poor customer reviews... it all feeds in to itself. 

The minute the company itself has an issue with its fundamentals - stagnating growth for example - that they'd normally get a loan or issue more stock to get through, then the death spiral begins. Without growth, expenses rise and revenue falls. It makes it harder to pay staff, pay leases on buildings with good exposure, buy materials to sell. No chance of expansion or breaking into a new market. 

Sure they'll go through ""restructuring"" which will give the media and analysts more ammo and create a bad image for laying off staff. It'll keep the doors open while they beg and borrow for contracts on product or close down shopfronts. But its like treading water - you can only go so long before you start to dip below the water.

The minute you bring an external factor into play - say COVID. Game over.

Short sellers pay the interest on the stock loan, riding out the tumble in share price and they either cover if somehow the company sorts their shit out or they ride their open short position to the ground and pocket the original sell price - interest cost as profits.

3: if I own a 250$ NVDA share and sell it for 300$, then it didn't decrease the stock value. In fact, it increased it if the last stock sale was below 300$.

4: shorts can't magically make up a price. A short position first requires the broker to buy a share at the current price and then you straight up just sit there, hoping it goes down. It's the same as buying. Your act doesn't influence what other people sell or buy at in the slightest.

Addressing your first point:

Selling a stock CERTAINLY decreases a stock’s price. The stock market is based on supply and demand. By selling, you increase the supply. No, I am not saying your one share of AAPL will decrease the stock’s price by any measurable amount but if 50% of AAPL shareholders decided to sell one day, the price would crater. 

“If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.”

Addressing your second point:

An imaginary number that doesn’t exist? 

The current price is the most recent selling price of the stock, with adequate liquidity this number certainly isn’t “imaginary” but instead a very good indicator of what you could buy or sell the stock for. If you want to “market buy” you pay the ask, “market sell” and you get the bid. Again, with enough liquidity these numbers, or the “spread” should be very close to the “current price” or what you called “imaginary” 

Source: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currentprice.asp

Your third point:

Yes, buyers meet sellers and a exchange of shares goes through.

Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled. You don’t get to choose. If the last sale was at 299, your share is available at $300 but the market has people willing to sell at 298, 297, 296, 295 etc. do you ever think your $300 limit sell will get filled? Probably not, and thus why selling pressure increases supply and reduces the price (see point 1).

Your fourth point:

Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price. 

To quote the article you provided as evidence 

“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent. However, it is completely untrue to suggest the mechanics of a short sell do not temporarily decrease the stock’s price (and your article agrees)."

How can you even write that, thinking this is true? Who do they sell to? The air? No, someone else has to buy it. Every single day someone buys or sells someone else sells or buys. Do you think there is an invisible force that this goes into?

""Source, because you likely won’t believe me:""

This source is flawed majorly - the statements in it are true, but what you fail to understand is that it doesn't matter if stock ABC currently sitting at 100$ has 500 million asks and 500 million bids at 90$ and 110$ - it doesn't do jackshit if there is enough liquidity sitting between 100$ to 110$ and 100 to 90$. What your ""source"" references to is that whenever you have either more demand or more supply, it will move into the opposite direction because it's all about who breaks first, and more people mean it's more likely that this happens. **But that has literally nothing to do with shorting because what this talks about is owning shares and then selling them vs not owning shares and wanting to buy them, thus bid and ask.**

>Your NVDA is example is not necessarily realistic though, you’re essentially saying you have a limit sell at $300 that you’re sure will get filled.

False. My example was that my NVDA share got filled. You can't take my example while referencing me and then apply different rules. You can make that and make your own example, but not put words into my mouth. I spoke against you saying that selling has to decrease the price which is simply wrong. **EVERY BUY NEEDS A SELL. THEY WORK TOGETHER.**

>Again referencing point 1. Borrowing a share and selling short increases the supply of the shares available, when you sell the on the market it creates extra supply, this decreases the price.

Short selling means your broker will buy (or borrow) a share until you buy it back. Meaning your made up scenario of having more shares available is simply wrong. Only when you buy back, the share goes back to the market, BUT it also requires someone to buy it. So no, you do not have more shares.

>“Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock.”

No no no. Quote the entire thing:

""Short sellers, by their nature, drive down the price of a company’s stock. Executives, on the other hand, are incentivized to drive up the price of their company’s stock.""

What you fail to understand or attempt to represent accurately is that they mean short sellers, the person behind shorting, not the actual short, want to drive the price down. While the CEO, and for that concern anyone on a long position, want to drive the price up. You will never read negative sides on a bull DD and you will never read positive sides on a bear DD. That is natural and stupid to reference out of context.

>“Short-sellers alone do not have the power to hold down the price of a stock for any significant amount of time. They can succeed in doing so in the short term. But the effects won’t last for long.”

Thank you for confirming my point. We are talking about a company filing **bankruptcy**. Having to file for bankruptcy is not something that happens in weeks or a month, this builds up over years. You have the relation wrong. Shorts don't create a failing business, but a failing business creates shorts.

>I am not saying at all that shorts and shorts alone could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved or the company was truly fraudulent.

What the hell is this even meant to mean? Okay let's digest.

""I am not saying shorts could bring a company down, unless the company was truly fraudulent.""

What? What the hell do shorts have to do with whether the company is fraudulent or not? What hell of a point is that supposed to be?

And second part:

""I am not saying at all that shorts  could bring a company to the ground, unless there was naked shorting involved""

You what? Listen. A company doesn't give a single frick about what traders do - for their business. They care about what happens to their stock when they **NEED** or **WANT** to raise money. All the other times it literally doesn't matter for the company itself, the entire time. This also belongs to taking a loan and having your stocks, that the company holds, evaluated. But again, what you fail to imply is that a failing business causes shorts to come in, not shorts coming in cause a failing business. The topic of the post is still bankruptcy and no, shorts do not have an effect on the share price. Again, by your logic every long position that sells has the same negative effect because the share magically goes back to the market, meaning less supply. Which is simply wrong, someone else is buying it.

**As a final word:**

Supply and demand in shorts matters in 3 cases only:

1. for algorithms. They use the spread to of bid and ask for high frequency trading. This actually does have a major impact on the trading volume, as well as the way it's going
2. who of the bid ask sides breaks first. But bid and ask mostly long positions selling and non-positions buying. So that entire theory doesn't work out for reality.
3. if the float of a stock is either close to or at 100% or the trading volume is insanely low. I've been in stocks that I put up a MARKET ORDER and it wasn't closed for 3 months, so the end where no one is buying or at least enough to cover enough positions that mine is included. And the other end is of course that no one wants to sell.

None of these apply to short selling."

So we need cash to pay back a debt right? We can obtain cash via equity financing right? If our stock price is low we can obtain less per share via equity financing right? If we can obtain less cash via equity financing, then our chances of paying back the debt are less right? If our chances of paying back the debt are less, then that negatively impacts our credit worthiness right? If our credit worthiness is deemed to be less by a rating agency we get downgraded right?

As  far as i understand companies need money at the beginning of their life  to cover the expenses and then in exchange they return the profit to  the investors in dividends or buybacks which makes the stock/company  valuable which drives the stock price up so they can issue more shares  if they need money for further investment.

So  this is completely ok but a company like coca-cola, altria, 3m etc.  doesnt really issue any new shares or do something innovative to reform  the company/build factories etc. So does it even matter what their stock  price is? Their net profit would cover all expenses isnt it?

And so, If a company announced that it was halting all future dividend payments and using that money to pay to the rank and file (if somehow against all odds the board agrees to this) shareholders would run for the doors, cratering the stock price (which executives own, so they’d get hurt) and there would likely be a class action launched by those shareholders against everyone that voted for it.

6/27/2021 15:41,stocks,"As a dividend heavy investor personally, the reason and logic behind why I like dividend stocks is simple:

When you own stock in a company, you’re essentially owning a piece of their business. The entire point of owning/operating a business is to be profitable and make money. It’s not very sensible to me to own a piece of a company that doesn’t even pay me. I am a part owner after all. Simply relying on the stock price to hopefully go up isn’t very comforting. 

In order to realize any profit from a non-paying company you’ll have to sell your shares. Dividend stocks provide cash flow without the need to sell at all. And on top of it, each year the distribution will most likely grow. After a handful of years, your yield in the past will be much lower than what it would become in the future. (Assuming no cuts and reasonable payout hikes.)

Companies themselves do this for various reasons. Mainly mature and predictable companies offer dividends. (But not all exactly.) it gives more allure to their stock. It basically says to investors “hey look at us, we can payout money to you consistently because we have confidence in our business, and we appreciate your investment.” 

It just gives more investor respect considering they’re pledging money to you periodically."
6/27/2021 9:33,stocks,"The comments here don’t answer the OP’s question, so let me take a shot at what they are actually trying to ask. I think they are asking not why all companies must pay dividends (clearly they don’t!) but why once companies start paying dividends there’s an expectation that they will continue.

The answer is “convention”. The market is aways looking for signals about the health of a company. For companies that pay dividends, convention has decided that increasing dividends are good, and decreasing dividends are bad.

This, by the way, is *yet another* reason that dividends are generally a bad way to return capital to the shareholders. Nobody says “Aha, BIGCO, you bought back 10 million shares last year, but this year you didn’t buy back any! You must be in financial distress! SELL SELL SELL.”  Dividends however do create this expectation, which reduces management’s flexibility to deal with unexpected changes in the company’s fortunes."

When a company moves out of the growth phase it's stock price will level out and it's investors will flee looking for a better ROI (return on investment). Since it doesn't have to spend as much on the first 2 they pay dividends to keep there investors.  Think of it like this. vz pretty much trades sideways. Why would anyone invest in a company that isn't making any ROI.

Incorrect. If the point of buybacks and dividends was to increase the value of the stock in order to then offer shares again, the company would at best only get back as much as it paid in dividends or buybacks, or more likely get worse returns than if they didn't do any buybacks (the exception being in situations where there's heavy short interest and the buybacks might scare shorts away)."

I think the most direct answer is that corporate officers took on the duty as part of the deal when they decided to do a stock offering.  Taking money from investors is basically predicated on that value being grown.  There are mechanisms to replace leadership that are not living up to expectations.

It is more complicated though.  I believe there is case law for PRIVATELY HELD companies that went to the supreme court with regards to Hobby Lobby and their handling of providing certain insurance to employees.  The arguments were fundamentally that actions taken around religious belief were interfering with shareholder value.  Obviously this is limited and not case law for public companies, but it points to the complexity.

Regardless, many people think that an economy predicated on infinite growth or monotonically increasing profit is impractical and that corporate officers have duty that is more nuanced than just providing shareholder value.  For now though, the best general answer seems to be that it's a core commitment of the corporate officers when stock is offered.

What they fail to realize is that, while their stock DOES now represent a smaller portion (they’re right about that part), it represents a smaller portion of a company that now has more value (they literally raise a ton of cash with the secondary offering).

This has a side effect of creating some extra sell-side pressure and creating an upper bound on the stock price, temporarily, so in the short term it does often cause a dip.

Beyond that cash meaning the company has more liquid assets, the cash is generally raised via a secondary offering specifically because it is needed to do something that the company believes will make a lot of money in the long run. 

TLDR If a company’s decision to provide a secondary offering is based on accurate predictions of the value of the activities or infrastructure that the resulting cash will fund, then the offering is actually good for current investors in the long run."

theres insane increase in revenue, net revenue, and FCF. Even going positive in net income. this also is after the fact that (unless im misunderstanding this concept on balance sheet) corsair has (relatively speaking to its previous years) insane inventory cash flow.

however, projecting Y/Y growth is hard on this company. 

the cut and dry explanation of its 2020 growth is 2020 pandemic. everyone buying PC parts at inflated supply & Demand prices.

They haven't settled so you're marked with a debit. When the trade settles you'll either have cash or a debt.

If you had 1k left over and made another 20k purchase on margin, I believe it would be interest free on margin, and they would not touch your 1k. 

If you then added 99k, I believe they would fill your margin, leaving you with 80k in cash reserves, 60k in holdings, and 140k buying power, so total 180k with margin.

The first probably 100K/140k of your purchases would end up being interest free- or 30k of interest free margin, with the final 50k margin at an annual interest rate of 6.575% due to having more than 100k in the account

6/27/2021 10:33,stocks,"How is Uber ever going to scale up?

Most people own cars. The only thing I ever use an Uber for is to go out drinking and have a safe ride to and from the bars. 

So where is the 24 hour a day demand outside of major metro areas?"

6/27/2021 4:49,stocks,"Some Uber’s are a premium over taxis. I’d say 30% are not and are bad service at least pre covid. Refuse to turn off music, no AC, not very nice.. it really depends and it’s a crapshoot."
6/27/2021 6:52,stocks,"Except that you get that with cabs,  it's far more frequent, you have to physically call them, you can't track them and see if they are actually coming or not, you can't down rate a taxi to the point that the company will turf them.  Any of the negative sides of Uber, also exist in Cabs, but you lose out on all the positive sides that Uber offers.  

&#x200B;

The simplest thing to look at is that if prices were identical, which service will customers choose?  The majority are choosing Uber for the convenience aspect alone.  

&#x200B;

So there appears to be zero reason for Uber to be undercutting Taxis."

No idea what Star Trek Discovery is. Main one I remember watching was the one with Sir Patrick Steward.

I ask because of the fact that Mycellium based things are emerging and could replace other things.

Instead of Styrofoam they are making packaging out of mycelium material which is the roots under the fruiting body.

They are also making bricks for construction as well."

But if you want a niche like mycelium or seaweed or hydroponics you'll end up looking through pennystocks scams or very risky startups that could be wiped out by a big company blinking with an eye.

If you get convienced by such a startup and find a high-conviction investment (that you might even get involved / be a passion) then good for you. But don't force it if you don't - too many people have been burned by looking for a holy grail."
6/27/2021 13:47,stocks,"Well there’s a point to what he’s saying. Investing in a company solely because they deal with an emerging, promising technology is a bad idea. You’re not investing in a technology, you’re investing in a company. Can the company make mycelium profitable? Will this company be a leader in selling mycelium products? Does it have good leadership/good financials?

Look at the aviation industry in the 60s and 70s. Everyone knew flying was the future of transportation, but few companies could turn a profit with it. A lot of people got burnt because they thought investing in an airline was the same as investing in the technology of air transport."

6/27/2021 12:58,stocks,"Since OP wasn’t clear with which way they want to go, then there’s just the two ways to go about it.

Buy stop limit: trigger at $270 but wants to fill only at $270 or better with the risk of not filling at all.

Buy stop: trigger at $270 but will fill at market, which could be more or less than $270."

I feel like we are starting to get to a point where electric vehicles are starting to be affordable, attractive, and more widespread.  Rather than investing in the EV market I would like to find some shovel stocks in the supply chain (battery manufacturing and recycling for example).  What are your favorite picks for both the EV industry as well as some of your favorite shovel stocks in general?"
6/27/2021 1:23,stocks,"Proterra is an excellent shovel play and is my biggest position. They're primarily an electric bus manufacturer right now but they're also in the business of electrifying all types of vehicles as well as being in the charging space. Basically the shovel portion is them providing battery packs, powertrain, and charging solutions to other vehicle manufactures who are looking to electrify their vehicles. Right now they derive most of their revenue from their ebuses but by 2023, their vehicle electrification business is expected to overtake their ebus segment.

They have 3 main businesses:

Proterra Powered designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and integrates proprietary battery systems and electrification solutions into vehicles for global commercial vehicle OEM customers serving the Class 3 to Class 8 vehicle segments, including delivery trucks, school buses, coach buses, construction and mining equipment, and other applications.

Proterra Transit designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric transit buses as an OEM for North American public transit agencies, airports, universities, and other commercial transit fleets. Proterra Transit offers an ideal venue to showcase and validate our electric vehicle technology platform through rigorous daily use by a large group of sophisticated customers focused on meeting the wide-ranging needs of the diverse communities they serve.

Proterra Energy provides turnkey fleet-scale, high-power charging solutions and software services, ranging from fleet and energy management software-as-a-service, to fleet planning, hardware, infrastructure, installation, utility engagement, and charging optimization. These solutions are designed to optimize energy use and costs, and to provide vehicle-to-grid functionality.

Through partnerships that include Daimler’s Thomas Built Buses and Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation, Komatsu Ltd., Volta Trucks, Lightning eMotors, Van Hool NV, Optimal Electric Vehicles LLC, and BusTech Pty Ltd., Proterra Powered batteries are helping electrify the school bus, step-van, construction and mining equipment, medium-duty trucks and vans, motor coach, shuttle bus, and international transit bus markets, respectively."

It has intense upward demand, and has a phenomenal outlook for the next decade. Find some miners. FCX if you want a safe play, but there are some wonderful opportunities in the speculative market if you want more risk.

Lithium is critical, but I'm underwhelmed by the investment opportunities. It will be controversial, but I remain convinced that at least one of the major oil corporations is going to do something as simple as add charge points to all their gas stations and overnight build out the largest charging network in the market. XOM, BP, or RDS could capture that market immediately if they wanted.

But if you're in doubt, copper."

IMO they have the potential to be another Piedmont before going parabolic (say if Tesla announces a partnership) but infrastructure wise ahead of Piedmont comparatively when that too was a single digit dollar stock. 

Take a deeper dive if you wish"
6/27/2021 14:20,stocks,"Micro-vast.  They make fairly ordinary EV batteries.  Now.  Overseas.   And actively building a major EV battery factory here stateside.  Can't recall where, maybe Tulsa or something?

They're not like some of the hyper-speculative plays that's got an experimental battery in a lab that they hope to commercialize in 5-10 years.  They make and sell the batteries now.  Batteries that every automaker needs for all the EV's they're promising to put out this year.  

And as for those futuristic new tech batteries, Micro-vast does R&D just like everyone else.  So their real world experience plus time and development funded by ongoing revenues means that conceivably they'll keep pace with the futuristic battery plays.

They're in the tail end of merging which has meant share price volatility.  I think it peaked somewhere $23-26 when the merger was announced, now down around $11-12, so arguably it may be on sale.  The bear case is said to be that they haven't been well run prior to the merger, and that big auto may find other suppliers for batteries.  I consider it likely that many automakers will do just that, however I can't believe that *all* the automakers will find other suppliers.  As long as one or two use Micro-vast, that gets the flywheel spinning.  

And it's a little known fact of automotive supply chain that most parts have one or two or three suppliers.  So when there's a brake drum on a vehicle, it could have been made for GM by company A or company B.  The automaker does this to grind the suppliers against each other and to have diversity in their production supply chain.  The parts get the same part number and built to look identical.  So other than some little punch mark or something, you never really know which sub-supplier made the component.  Thus I could see Micro-vast being one of multiple suppliers of commodity battery packs for some automaker.  If EV's take off, automakers will be scrambling to find suppliers, and Micro-vast is (presumably) ready."

Look into Lucid, they are the best EV engine designers so could easily sell their engines to other companies, and they also have full plans for making money off their battery set ups after the car batteries are only 80% as efficient and taken out of the car. Unlike most EV companies (cough cough Tesla) who either recycle(throw away) their batteries or worst off do nothing and leave the customer with a vehicle that’s massively loosing range. Btw this not to say Tesla is a bad invest, it’s great.

CATL also has one of their engineers on the board of directors who is helping along in the process to reach the lithium standards CATL needs to make batteries (they just hit it this month)

6/27/2021 1:20,stocks,"Not much really, I mean I invest more now, but that might be because im 18 now which means I can do it easily.

And even if it didn’t change anything it reinforced a feeling of not trusting anyone on the internet, if you don’t see it you should never do it and should be even more discouraged if there is a shit ton of people behaving speculating constantly about it"
6/27/2021 8:10,stocks,"Beyond r/options there’s a lot of noise on here. Literally anytime I’ve jumped on someone’s dd it’s been bad. Although, I’ve made a lot of profit with AMC GME, nothing else has worked out. Now I either short someone’s bright idea or I just avoid it and that has actually worked out really good"
6/27/2021 4:52,stocks,I threw everything out of the window and fomoed into memestocks
6/27/2021 5:30,stocks,"Before reddit I was ""buy low sell high"". Now it's ""buy high sell low""."
6/27/2021 1:31,stocks,"I've noticed I hold less now, gonna try working on that. Then again the stock I held was Tesla from 250 to 900 pre split. (I'm still a bit salty on that one) and AMD from 18 to 36."
6/27/2021 0:43,stocks,It made me trade options which I would probably never have considered otherwise
6/27/2021 8:38,stocks,Found r/bogleheads.  It’s easy to get caught up in a lot of stuff.  Boglehead has kept me sane and level through the chaos of the last 6 months.  With an emergency fund and boglehead strategy I can unemotionally invest snd not worry up or down.  The market “is what it is”. Can’t control it so why try?
6/27/2021 3:20,stocks,Helped me grow from $35k to $2.5M in 1.5 years so I have a lot to be thankful to Reddit for
6/27/2021 2:59,stocks,Is this the Reddit IPO? I'm looking for a Reddit IPO.
6/27/2021 11:08,stocks,"I‘m only at the stockmarket because of reddit.

Made 300% in 4 Month."
6/27/2021 1:16,stocks,I've made a few pennies off the memes
6/27/2021 2:08,stocks,"I read it all the time and get new ideas, but then I come back to my senses and invest in VTI and VXUS."
6/27/2021 0:12,stocks,Zero
6/27/2021 7:30,stocks,"Not at all. I started my investment journey before reddit by reading the classic books on the subject. After that If ormed my plan, backed by research, and acted on it. The end result was very much a ""Boglehead"" style but I did it all long before I ever saw their sub.



I've seen bull and beat market, all kinds of pumps and dumps. I've stayed true to my plan and so far it's worked fine. It's not the best, I'll not retire tomorrow, but the worst I ever saw during the Corona crash was - 18%."
6/27/2021 7:41,stocks,"I was doing my own research and stocks that i liked i was aiming for low volatility high yield dividend I was up decent amount... around 10% 

My first call with Pfizer because they were working on a vaccine and didn't sell when the news came out and got slatted. Turns out after big news the stock falls because everyone sells the news. 

Still up like 15% up to the year from March to December

Then I actually paid attention to reddit, now I'm up 600% since January"
6/27/2021 8:01,stocks,"Over the course of about a year, I went from holding a low-cost index fund in Vanguard to day trading on thinkorswim. It’s been quite a ride.

Edit: day trading may be inaccurate. Some are short term trades and options bets and others are medium to long-term holds"
6/27/2021 8:29,stocks,I use Reddit as a tool. Someone says something interesting about a stock with good evidence. I then look more into it then decide if its a buy or not.
6/27/2021 10:47,stocks,As others have stated it’s definitely not something to take as gospel. But it’s definitely opened my eyes to other viewpoints and stocks for me to do my DD on.
6/27/2021 11:36,stocks,"I had etfs almost 4 years.  Started reading  all the reddit info Communities and the dd on corruption to small businesses was so sickening I changed over everything I had.  So yep, reddit influenced me in a good way, a great way!  I'm doing very well now!  And I love Millenials too!  (From Old hippee boomer!)"
6/27/2021 11:57,stocks,"It got better over time, Buy high and sell low."
6/27/2021 12:43,stocks,"Reddit introduced me to the concept of FIRE four years ago.

I was always a good saver and saved nearly half of my income even when my husband and I only brought in 40k per year total. In 2017, I got a job paying twice that and had no idea how to appropriately “use” my new salary and cash so I spent a lot of time searching Reddit to see what others did in this scenario and came across fire, later followed by this sub and others.

Now, we make double that again with a similar lifestyle, are on track to retire in our late forties, and I read Reddit every day for financial discussions and fun. I like reading other’s financial stories but r/stocks does give me some ideas for stocks to research and DD, but also serves as a good barometer for market sentiment in certain industries like tech."
6/27/2021 4:18,stocks,"Damn Reddit managed to plant FOMO deluxe into my brain during the GME Hype. i always thought that  i will never be affected by FOMO.

A friend of mine got out of GME with huge succes (Like 500% plus on a 50k € investment) and I liquidiated a big portion of my portfolio for GME just for GME to crash. 

My Broker (Trade Republic from Germany) was not available for a whole day as i saw my money vaporizing in front of my eyes.

So Reddit teached me that i am in fact not immune to FOMO. Even better it teached me how fcking stupid i was as i watched my previously liquidiated stocks keep rising higher and higher.

FML

I now have 5 stocks that i will not touch for at least 5 years even if the world collides."
6/27/2021 6:44,stocks,"Did reddit impact my investment strategy?

Yeah, yes it did. I started doing it. I started investing because of reddit.

Why? 

I was - for the first time in my life - exposed to people who were actively investing instead of just being told to send money to a mutual fund. Sending money to a mutual fund (which I had been doing) is about as exciting as going to church. Thoughts and prayers shit. You aren't engaged by thoughts and prayers, your role is passive. It's fucking boring.

Reddit exposed me to people who were actually doing things. Instead of sitting on my ass praying, I was making the things other people were praying about happen. I, I was doing it. And I was in the middle of a bunch of crayon eating, window lickers who were doing it as well. Did we fuck up a lot? Sure. That's why we eat crayons and then lick windows to get the taste out of our mouths, but we were doing it - like a bunch of five year olds learning T ball.

So, here we are, beating the fuck out of hedge funds like a bunch of five year old T ball players swarming the Ump, all of us swinging our tiny little bats, biting the shit out of ankles. It's amazing.  And, on top of it, I'm making a decent return. Me. Making informed bets and winning every so often.

What's not to love?"
6/27/2021 6:30,stocks,"It made me start investing in stocks (until then I was only in ETFs and looking into stocks). It also made me realize I don’t really want to be trading stocks, so now I’m looking for the best time to cashout and reinvest it back into ETFs. 

I’m really not the “look into your portfolio everyday” kind of guy, so while I catch the bullish momentum of some stocks, I rarely detect the downfall, so I’m much better with the “dump and forget” logic of ETFs. I’m in for the long term, so is the best strategy for me.

I’ll miss some big gains for sure, but also some big losses.

In any case it was a big learning opportunity so I’m thankful for this community."
6/27/2021 2:32,stocks,It hasn’t
6/27/2021 4:53,stocks,I have  x10 BB i probably wouldn't have bought if I hadn't been influenced. But you live and learn... I am now in for the long
6/27/2021 5:00,stocks,"Everyone will try to push their narratives down your throat, trust the data, not the people."
6/27/2021 6:09,stocks,"If anything, I think they've told me that ""risk is ok"" and to take it. I've been mostly in blue chips my entire trading career.  Maybe buying NKLA at $93 was a bad move...ok got it. But others have been doing well and making money, returns that I wouldn't realize on blue chips.  Now, that said, I still have my blue chips, but I've opened up to more risk and found it's not so scary due to various Reddit threads."
6/27/2021 7:58,stocks,"Almost entirely changed. Like some of the others commenters, I’m not going to entirely change my investment strategy on a whim. That being said, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed reading so many different investment strategies other Redditors have, which has allowed me to pick and choose the parts I thought applied best for my situation.  I’m still developing my strategy and I’m not quite at the position where I’ve fully implemented my plan, but I should be there in another year. Then I just have to worry about maintaining the strategy."
6/27/2021 8:09,stocks,Got lucky and 20x my money. I now I have a major gambling addiction.
6/27/2021 8:41,stocks,Reddit was the big catalyst for my investment and helped my account triple since last year. Very thankful for this community.
6/27/2021 8:51,stocks,Reddit gave me a choice of a red blue or blue pill. I made my choice free will.
6/27/2021 9:03,stocks,"I made a few grand off of meme stocks. I wouldn't have bought them without that push because they just don't have the fundamentals in place to support their stock price being that high. 

I don't have that much invested, but I went from $1800 to $20,000 last year without doing ""risky"" calls or puts. Just straight buying and selling."
6/27/2021 10:17,stocks,"Prior to Reddit, I’ve always wanted to invest but was too chicken to hit the send button because I always thought investing was too risky and I’ll lose everything. I learned a lot about the different index fund/ETFs I can safely invest in. I still yolo a lot but thanks to Reddit it opened a whole new world for passive income."
6/27/2021 10:24,stocks,It actually created my investing strategy. The only contact I ever had w/ the market was IBM stock my aunt gifted me when I was a kid. I thought the market was WAY too complex for a non-math kid (I’m a lawyer) to get involved in. Pleasantly a lot of the subs here have had amazing advice on everything from dividends to growth stocks and I definitely have more of an understand of the market and am actually excited to be invested and building my future. Also it’s Reddit so don’t take everything on it for a gospel truth lol
6/27/2021 11:09,stocks,My entire strategy is based on Reddit. So far i'm up 1000%
6/27/2021 11:32,stocks,The only thing I use Reddit for is when I see a ticker that wasn't on my radar.
6/27/2021 16:35,stocks,Made a ton of money riding meme stocks and selling to Reddit investors at ATH who were thinking these stocks were going to be worth 10k a share.
6/27/2021 1:59,stocks,It made me short GME calls on Thursdays and Fridays based on all the crazy hype.
6/27/2021 2:07,stocks,This seems to be going towards a collusion play. I liked this stock on my own and I will continue to hold it until my sell point is met.
6/27/2021 6:38,stocks,Yep. From 0 to XXk on stock market.
6/27/2021 9:08,stocks,I used to invest in companies to secure a 10-20% return in swing trades. Now I just yolo my money into AMC and GME.
6/27/2021 7:06,stocks,"I'm 100% invested on game stop, so it changed....nothing?"
6/27/2021 6:50,stocks,Reddit is such an awful place. It should only be used for entertainment.
6/27/2021 9:30,stocks,"yeah i used to be long mutuals

Then I went 100% into the gee emm eeeeee"
6/27/2021 1:37,stocks,"It tipped me off on Lumen and Viacom which are green, but probably my two worst performers, so there's that. 

More generally it has made me more skeptical of claims about companies and exacerbated my contrarian streak."
6/27/2021 3:52,stocks,Reddit was the app that actually got me into investing and I do use to check people’s opinion on other stocks but I don’t use it too much.
6/27/2021 4:27,stocks,Not at all - I'm still a dumb fuck.
6/27/2021 5:13,stocks,Made me aware of options. Still doing my research and haven’t done anything yet
6/27/2021 5:19,stocks,I leaned so much in a short time period. I am grateful
6/27/2021 5:57,stocks,We are the future
6/27/2021 6:25,stocks,"Not much, I mainly come for confirmation bias. They did show me PLTR and wheel trading which worked out"
6/27/2021 6:28,stocks,You use something other than reddit?
6/27/2021 7:06,stocks,"It changed me from investing semi-blindly into a partial technical trader, and it’s primarily because I don’t want to do what some on WSB do and yolo my money into risky plays."
6/27/2021 7:17,stocks,"Reddit has influenced my strategy a lot. Before I didn’t yolo into a stock after reading DD, now I buy meme stocks after reading DD."
6/27/2021 7:58,stocks,My investment strategy was time deposit and forget. Reddit helped me discover other sources of investing and the stock market.
6/27/2021 8:35,stocks,"I started investing in stocks last year and it's fair to say I was initially drawn into a lot of the Reddit hype. I made some good money on some of it, and lost a shit load on other over hyped stocks. 6 months on I learned my lesson and decided to pick up a few books and looked at alternative sources for investing and I believe I'm on a better path now of looking at the funamentals of a company rather than getting sucked into the hype. These days I ignore 90+% of what is being hyped on Reddit, but you can still find some good stuff here and there."
6/27/2021 8:36,stocks,"Well I use it for a combination, I’m not American, so using Reddit led me to good stock picks such as O. However I must admit I also use Reddit to see what stocks I should avoid. Usually when Reddit hypes up a stock it’s about to crash or slowly bleed out."
6/27/2021 8:39,stocks,YOLO $DKNG. Might have done it anyways but seeing so many high risk derivatives moves my YOLO felt mild.
6/27/2021 8:40,stocks,I started by investing in several companies using one brokerage account. Now I own shares of just one company spread between several brokers.
6/27/2021 8:43,stocks,"Sometimes, I jump on the bandwagon to attempt to make a few quick bucks.

If I'm trading a stock and it becomes a fave here, I watch it closely and will consider getting rid of it."
6/27/2021 8:48,stocks,"It used to be a good place. Now it’s just meme stock this, and to the moon that. It really started with ARKK and TSLA, every other post would be about someone asking if going 70% into Ark Funds and 30% in TSLA was a good idea."
6/27/2021 8:52,stocks,"Reddit and to a lesser extent YouTube is what turned me on to investing in general, I went down the FIRE rabbit hole and starting putting money into index funds in tax advantage accounts. 

It's also influenced the choices of stocks I've bought with my $400 Robinhood account which is currently 95% in SPCE."
6/27/2021 9:00,stocks,"The cesspool of degenerates that is Reddit, made me change my strategy to listening to BRKA annual meetings…"
6/27/2021 9:04,stocks,None. Increased my conviction though.
6/27/2021 9:13,stocks,"I only started investing back in March. My original plan was to find businesses that were hurt by the pandemic but I felt had a chance of recovering now that things are opening back up. 
After joining Reddit I learned about ETFs and dividends. I began expanding my portfolio into other sectors. So yeah Reddit definitely helped me learn better ways to invest."
6/27/2021 9:14,stocks,"I would say it has made me a touch more conservative and diligent. I've always been big on the research aspect of investing even before reddit, its a hobby to me, but reading some of the horror stories on here definitely has made me a bit more gunshy and thorough before I even think of placing an order. 

Of course, my most successful individual holding, Digital Turbine, I was blacked out at a beach bar, and invested on a whim on the advise of some 21 year old frat bro...so...yeah"
6/27/2021 9:16,stocks,"I started because of Reddit. I bought close to top of gme and sold very shortly after. Panicked. Realised I could turn this into a money making hobby. 

I realised thanks to daytrading Reddit a lot of common mistakes. 

""Average down"" doesn't really work at a day trading level, it's for long term holds. 

Stop losses are your friend. Use them. 

Record your trades. You'll stop your mistakes so fast. 

Number a trades a day doesn't make you better. 1 safe trade can earn far more than 50 high risk plays.

Stop when your up. I've had 100%+ trades with BBBY, wendies and woof interweek, but the first 2 I stupidly went back in at the top and lost gains plus some with BBBY. Emotions are dumb."
6/27/2021 9:17,stocks,"I started following a lot of meme stocks, but I haven’t taken any positions based on Reddit."
6/27/2021 9:24,stocks,It made me realize how easy money dumb money is. Reddit kids never factcheck anything. Ever.
6/27/2021 9:25,stocks,I only day trade high volume meme stocks now.
6/27/2021 9:28,stocks,Good god please don’t let a social media strategy site change your investing strategy. It’s a good place to get info but don’t base your finances (or your relationships. Or your health ) solely on the comments of random unqualified strangers.
6/27/2021 9:30,stocks,"I started investing a couple years before I joined reddit, so I already had a general idea in mind about a strategy when I started.  Over time goals have changed, and that has caused changes in my investment strategies.

Reddit has been a great resource in expanding my view of markets and investing in general and in specific ways.  Crowd-sourcing ideas and strategies helps close the gap between individuals and institutes."
6/27/2021 9:33,stocks,Well I went from not investing to just yoloing meme stocks for weed money
6/27/2021 9:46,stocks,"i use reddit to inform myself. i seldom invest in any dds, but there are rare cases where i see a post and 15 minutes later i invest in it. 
but only if i understand the concept. if i have no clue about an topic or an company i dont.

my investments are always high risk high reward. and so far it went good.

i could spend time looking for companies myself but when i do i always land in asia / taiwan and cant invest in these companies from here"
6/27/2021 9:47,stocks,"“Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful.”

I like to browse Reddit to see what everyone’s buying and I’ll know by then it’s at or near the peak. This helped me sell out of ARK funds and solar companies at the start of the year.

Then there’s things people call falling knives or moan about being down 50% or more, it’s mostly because they bought meme stocks but sometimes there’s value — I’ve been buying a lot of Chinese companies this year based on the negative social media sentiment."
6/27/2021 9:51,stocks,I didn't trade options before Reddit.  Very mixed blessing there.
6/27/2021 10:01,stocks,"Not much. Most of my investments that have done well really havent been talked about much online or in the news. Which is a bit supricing to me since some stocks are so damn obvious buys .. and very predictable for a while. 

But some stocks are nice to see on reddit but I think most know that reddit doesnt push any stock.. its other big money that do that job. So when ever I can see which bank is buying a stock (which broker), then I can tell if they know something that I dont.. they tend to buy in heavy before a pop. Or before they release what ever they know. Its quite interesting and not all stocks show this.."
6/27/2021 10:03,stocks,"I don't know about changing my strategy, but I got into a lot of stocks early because of the great insight from the people of Reddit. One example being $SE, which I first bought at $42 because of a Reddit post. Appreciate everyone here!"
6/27/2021 10:06,stocks,Reddit IS my investment strategy
6/27/2021 10:07,stocks,"Before Reddit I would strategize, now I trust in memes"
6/27/2021 10:09,stocks,Moved me from only US diversification to 40% global allocation - pretty signifiant asset allocation change.
6/27/2021 10:10,stocks,Absolutely not. It's Reddit.
6/27/2021 10:13,stocks,Zero
6/27/2021 10:14,stocks,Reddit IS my investment strategy
6/27/2021 10:16,stocks,Reddit taught me not to listen to people on the Internet
6/27/2021 10:17,stocks,Didn’t change me 1 bit. I was “Bogle head” and always will be. In fact I found whole community of Bogle heads!
6/27/2021 10:19,stocks,I learned that your not only investing in a company but also gambling on the outcome of the price... The fact that price can be manipulated more by the gamblers rather than investors is a fundamental disparity that will forever destroy the economic structure of the market.
6/27/2021 10:24,stocks,It is good help while making second opinion
6/27/2021 10:32,stocks,"I realized that my DD has actual substance. I used to assume everyone did the same DD I did, but everyone Has a much simpler DD, for example technical analysis. Me personally, I consider P/E, profit margin, ROE, and the dividend yield of a business, and my current favorite S&P 500 pick is VZ, based on my analysis, and is about 9% of my portfolio."
6/27/2021 10:32,stocks,"Reddit inspired me to look more into alternative data such as mentions, sentiment, Twitter reactions, employee reviews etc. I took all that data for hundreds of public companies and put it on a dashboard that’s updated daily, [DilliBits.com](https://DilliBits.com). So far, it’s been very interesting."
6/27/2021 10:35,stocks,No effect
6/27/2021 10:36,stocks,"I have always invested based on fundamentals. Now I pay more atention to technicals and sentiment. I wouldnt say I time the market, but i do have better timing now."
6/27/2021 10:38,stocks,"yea I came here with the idea of putting 90% in Spy and 10% in riskier stocks (like AMD omg) and now I have 20% spy, 40% growth, 20% options, 20% penny stocks lol."
6/27/2021 10:42,stocks,"Reddit is the progenitor to my investment strategy, lol."
6/27/2021 10:43,stocks,"I'm not bankrupt yet, so thankfully not TOO much."
6/27/2021 10:49,stocks,100%. Went from straight ETFs to full r/weedstocks
6/27/2021 10:51,stocks,The problem here that whatever making a lot of profit becomes a trend but too late
6/27/2021 10:52,stocks,"100% in some areas. 0% in others. I have a account that is strictly throw away money that used on “social media investing”. Goal is swing trades between 10-30%. So far up 100% ish. 

Otherwise, my true retirement growth is 0% affected by Reddit."
6/27/2021 10:55,stocks,"I used to be a complete index junkie, now I have a good chunk of individual stocks. Plus I get all my news from reddit.

I've also decided to buy one stock of the worst 5 s&p 500 stocks each year. Just an experiment."
6/27/2021 10:57,stocks,I stopped buying etfs and i started buying individual stocks
6/27/2021 11:01,stocks,"Went from value plays to meme plays, and now back to value plays."
6/27/2021 11:06,stocks,It did change my way of analyzing stocks; I now dig deeper. It opened my eyes to what MSM is pushing but more so the why's MSM is pushing something.
6/27/2021 11:22,stocks,"I've started investing in the things that people recommended who were downvoted to shit . Most people in this sub and other investing/trading subs are legitimate idiots who have only gotten into the stock market in the past year, check their account history. So when I see someone downvoted for recommending people invest in something like VOO/VTI/QQQ or ""companies you KNOW"" instead of the Reddit hype stocks it meant something to me.

Since then, I've essentially dumped all my holdings and now only have 3 holdings in my portfolio. VTI, QQQ, and NVDA and couldn't be happier. I haven't looked at my portfolio in 4 months and I'm up 45% on NVDA and ~7% on VTI/QQQ. They aren't insane gains but I would guarantee they're better than the majority of people dishing out investing advice here on Reddit."
6/27/2021 11:22,stocks,"I started looking at tsla by a youtube channel
and gme by a subreddit. Now I am long on both. I studied both a little and try to read up anytime they do anything new. All by investment strategies are based on expecting a return by 2026."
6/27/2021 11:31,stocks,"I was very new in the stock market and would trade small things daily, constantly falling for p&d scams or emotionally investing.

I don’t invest based on what people on Reddit say, but it’s taught me to research my investments in depth and ignore emotions when investing. Being able to hold through red when I need and hold on gains when needed.

I’m still actively learning, but just those few things learned from Reddit has probably kept me from losing a lot of money."
6/27/2021 11:32,stocks,"Have a retirement account that is unaffected by Reddit and is up close to 200% last couple years.

Have a short term account with about 40k in it that is up 15k from beginning of this year"
6/27/2021 11:33,stocks,"It didn’t. I read about stuff here but for the most part I just keep on doing what I’ve been doing already.

Maybe it’s because I don’t have THAT many funds."
6/27/2021 11:38,stocks,Just gives me ideas of places to look into
6/27/2021 11:44,stocks,0
6/27/2021 11:44,stocks,Reddit gave me an investment strategy.  I never really understood investing up until 2 years ago.  The amount of reading has been tremendous but with people willing to simplify things I've been understanding a lot faster
6/27/2021 11:46,stocks,Contrarian here. I typically go the opposite way of Reddit on financial matters.
6/27/2021 11:50,stocks,100% spielstopp
6/27/2021 11:55,stocks,Reddit taught me to go all-in
6/27/2021 12:04,stocks,None. I’m a buy and hold beta virgin. But I’ll cry my self to sleep with my profits.
6/27/2021 12:05,stocks,Counter trade Reddit stocks
6/27/2021 12:08,stocks,Honestly Reddit gives some of the worst investment advice... I used to try to talk about tesla before it's 100x run and I would get downvoted instantly and no good discussion.... everyone on Reddit just saying index funds which is a great thing if you don't know how to pick stocks but this is a stock sub so I'd expect more people talking stocks here
6/27/2021 12:10,stocks,I now know to check WSB if something I own is randomly  jumping (i.e. BB or Corsair). Helps to know to take profit and buy back lol
6/27/2021 12:16,stocks,"I always thought investment wasn't for me until the GME/AMC saga. Coincidentally I also got Revolut at the same time while allowed me to dip my toes into Crytpo and Stocks. My first investment was AMC at $17. 

Anyway it's not worth it for me to do hours and hours of research just for a 10% annual return. Perhaps if I have 5 figures to invest I would, but I've only invested 1 weeks worth of wages across my entire portfolio so far, so I use reddit to discover new stocks or keep an eye on my current ones. For me it's fun and gambling. For serous amounts I plan on putting my money into ETFs and Treasury bonds. Mostly the latter."
6/27/2021 12:20,stocks,What’s an investment strategy?
6/27/2021 12:21,stocks,never
6/27/2021 12:26,stocks,"Moved me from normal stock investing to a much “safer” etf strategy. Also core satellite strategy seems very promising…not using it at the moment, but I like it."
6/27/2021 12:30,stocks,"It really hasn’t.  Honestly not overly impressed with most of what I see here.

Mostly just “hodl!” and videos worshipping DFV and people pushing meme stocks like they’re buying lottery tickets."
6/27/2021 12:36,stocks,Ive been investing going on my third year and my long portfolio is up 90+% do to how the market reacted to the Covid ordeal.. while it seemed everyone was getting out I decided to go Warren Buffet mode and dive into it hard. I hold a solid green Portfolio with nice growth and dividend payouts... Then a few months ago i find Riddit....I started a WEBull account and although ive had what seems to be alot of red I have made some really good gains that outweigh the red..Riddit has put me in a mindset that i can make my weekly paycheck and I can also now double or triple my income weekly...Riddit has helped me let go of the emotional part of investing and now win or loos im having me a damn good time....
6/27/2021 12:39,stocks,Strategy? I can hardly claim to have any real stragety.
6/27/2021 12:42,stocks,Saw a bunch of smooth brains do dumb shit which made me have more stable ETFs. Done well since.
6/27/2021 12:43,stocks,"I've dabbled in some things people have recommended, but most of them turned out quite poorly.

Sometimes people have real gems of comments which I do find incredibly useful, but normally these are people that work in that industry and have real insights to provide. 

I agree redditor knows a lot more about tech than other industries (I work in tech myself). Reddit also loves talking about Biotech, but that industry is generally way to volatile for me and I think most of the time Reddit talks about it's a pure pump and dump.

For the most part I've shifted back to fully my own investment style & DD, although I still do a lot of browsing and if a nugget shows up (that isn't a meme stock), I'll look into it more myself."
6/27/2021 12:55,stocks,It is the same. I was not so smart before… and I continue to make not so smart decisions.

But I started trading at age 55 because of Reddit and GME. Think about it. Now there’s a platform where people share ideas and trading strategies. So from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all for sharing your wisdom and experience. I wish I would have done this years ago. I go to thrift shops and know a good deal when I see one, why not research and do the same w/ stocks. Maybe I made it harder than it needed to be. Thank you everyone!!"

Boglehead or longterm investing wasn‘t my choice, esp. in this market, because return is minimal and the likelihood of a crash big. Candlestick trading isn‘t sth for me either, i need to read more on that it seems. I‘m just not good enough already. 

So, I basically have a few stocks now that always stay in the same area price-wise, and i use leverage on 1-2 day long trades before exiting with about 5-10% profit."

I let someone else's unfounded generalizations infect my thinking.

Demand proof and criticize illogic and assumptions, or disregard the ideas entirely."

I made a lot of money on MT and TX (steel plays) after reading some good posts on steel, then after doing my own research and seeing that the numbers (free cash flow, return on equity, EV/EBITDA, etc) we’re all insane and learning that the theory for steel to continue to grow made sense. 

ABEV is another one. Saw a good post on it, did my own research and saw it had by far the best numbers of all the other beer manufacturers and also had some potential due to Brazil currency, and make a great return on it.

Then I discovered reddit/wsb and found a lot of people in the same boat as me or was me few years ago.. reading DDs, personal stories, loss/gains actually gave me confidence..

“People can’t Tell good news from bad news.” I think mark Twain or some genius. Look for whatever headlines you think people are over reacting to or has a silver lining people aren’t talking about yet. 

A good example could be industry regulation. People think corporations in that industry may lose value. But that’s backwards, that means the industry is growing and powerful. Likely the big players lobbied and wrote the legislation to stifle new competition.

All the better if you find the headlines in regular news or social media. Because if it’s in a niche for serious investors, the.

6/27/2021 10:52,stocks,">A good example could be industry regulation.

100% agreed. 

A rather obscure, but very clear-cut example is some FUD around the Peruvian presidential election. When it became clear who would win (Castillo), there was a lot of FUD in anything with exposure to Peruvian mines, because Castillo grabbed headlines by saying he would nationalize all the biggest mining operations in the country. 

Anything that tanked as he emerged the winner over the course of May was failing to take into account that he has since walked back this position (likely because Peru's Congress will never allow it), and has instead said he only wants to raise taxes. 

However, the irrational fear of ""ZOMG socialism"" holds strong, particularly in the US, so that fear is baked into prices regardless of reality."

6/27/2021 0:00,stocks,"Lightning eMotors (ZEV) added to the Russell Microcap Index. Undervalued commercial EV play with sector dominance and strong growth What I like about Lightning eMotors (ZEV) is that they dominate a niche space that stands to grow very quickly. Rather than focusing on ""last-mile” lighter-duty vehicles, which would compete with high volume manufacturers, they use a medium-duty legacy chassis to take advantage of existing “upfit ecosystems” that  class 3-7 fleet commercial fleets actively depend on. This means easy electrification of ambulances, street cleaners, refrigerator trucks, and lifts as well as universal access to easily sourced spare parts for critical maintenance. 

While preserving fleet owners' capital investments, their legacy chassis strategy also gives them a first mover advantage by clearing them of all federal and state safety certifications, thus removing a major time and logistics obstacle.  This is why Lightning eMotors already has over 50% marketshare. 

Because the vehicles are designed for long lifespan and they are expensive to modify, fleet operators commonly change out drive trains rather than buy new vehicles. Now, because of sound economics and government mandates, instead of a new diesel drive train, they are moving to electric. This growing demand is why ZEV is dramatically expanding its Colorado-based facility and is expected to grow 195% CAGR over the next 4 years. 

Overview of some key points:

* First mover advantage — They’ve shipped more than 3x biggest competitor and currently control more than 50% market share in class 3-7 EV.
* Quarterly YoY revenue growth: 560%
* 2021 projected revenue is 100% contracted with pipeline of $800 million in sales
* Zero Debt and Low Capex assembly of vehicles 
* Projected 195% CAGR with $2 billion revenue by 2025 driven by government and corporate mandates to electrify commercial fleets.  That kind of revenue relative to their current $662 million market cap offers a sense of the value proposition, especially with a $67 billion TAM
* As the largest US-owned medium-duty commercial EV company, Lightning eMotors they will uniquely benefit from Biden's recently announced plan to replace entire government vehicle fleet with electric vehicles under the “Buy America” mandate.  The Biden White House says, ""Biden’s order directs federal agencies to purchase zero-emission power and automobiles, such as electric vehicles, as a way to “leverage the federal government’s footprint and buying power to lead by example.”  
* Medium-duty portion of Federal fleet electrification plan is 110,000 vehicles that only Lightning eMotors is currently equipped to handle. This represent a 5x of their entire 2025 projected revenue of $2 billion.  CEO Tim Reeser says they are currently working with USGSA on this new development.
* ZEV already sell to 30 fleets representing 500,000 vehicles and has strategic partnerships and contracts with DHL Express, Amazon, USPS, IKEA, Ford, Shyft, Plug Power, Proterra, BP, Romeo Power, ABC, Borg Warner, Winnebago, and the State of California.  DHL Express is expected to deploy their vehicles in California and New York later this year.
* Use of legacy chassis takes advantage of existing fed and state certifications along with entire medium-duty upfit ecosystem (ambulance, lifts, chillers and spare parts),which is critical for fleet owners. 
* ZEV can build from ground up or re-power drivetrains of existing fleets. Re-powering is most common in this medium-duty class designed for long mileage.  This enables fleet owners to continue using already customized vehicles thus extend the value of significant capital investment.
* Proprietary scalable analytics and proven operational savings for fleet customers.
* Offers fleet financing and patented mobile charging technologies and charging as a service (CAAS) which they are expanding to commercial and government fleets via its Lightning Energy division.
* Large patent portfolio
* Lightning eMotors has the largest commercial electric production facility in the US. Moreover, they are currently doubling their work force and quadrupling their Colorado-based manufacturing facility to meet accelerating demand. “Combined, the expansion and new equipment ensures that we’re ready for continually increasing demand and the growth of the business.”  Expansion plans are fully funded with no need of debt and they’ve signed leased to allow further 5x or more expansion. (1 million square foot campus)
* Oppenheimer analyst team are bullish with a $15 PT (75% upside) using a discounted to peer 6x sales multiple and their more conservative 169% CAGR estimate: “With Lightning's diverse supply chain, demonstrated capability in delivering numerous vehicles types, and optionality on either growing through powertrain development, full vehicle sales, or being a leading integrator of fuel cell-based power systems, we believe ZEV shares offer investors meaningful upside potential.""

I missed the bottom but I'm looking to build a larger position before they gain more traction. Management appears to be very serious about their expansion plans and they have good tailwinds so I like the risk/reward.

Of course, any time there is such a quick and substantial movement in price, it opens the window to a potential buying opportunity. Or a nice chance to catch a free fall into bankruptcy.... or some nice  -50%+ losses... 

I was just wondering if anyone had anything really to share on this stock, or even if they just wanted to share their opinions on where Rite-Aid is headed, short and long term, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

6/26/2021 22:51,stocks,When a stock sells off like this wait for the 3 day rule. There are many reasons but the most important is that hedge funds can’t completely close their position in 1 day. I like RAD around 15.50 on Monday.
6/27/2021 1:59,stocks,This stock burned me. Suddenly.
6/27/2021 3:55,stocks,"I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:  
  
\*\*\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \*\*\*  
  
CFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:  
  
""It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.""  
  
Also, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:  
  
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI  
  
So the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.  
  
Finally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.  
  
\*\*\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \*\*\*  
  
Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.  
  
A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:  
  
Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability  
  
All the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.  
  
Based on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.  
  
The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.  
  
If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.  
  
Whichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.  
  
\*\*\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \*\*\*  
  
Another darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.  
  
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021  
  
An acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:  
  
\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS  
  
\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category  
  
\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.  
  
So, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!"

6/27/2021 11:59,stocks,"I use to work for this company 15 or so years back.  I remember back when it was worth single digits.

Personally surprised it’s not out of business.  Their most profitable area is their pharmacy.  I remember way back, at least in my state, some of the other grocery stores stopped accepting Amerigroup insurance and so the number of new customers surged.  But then I also recalled how they started shortening their business hours and selling some of their stores to Walgreens.

Regardless I would never invest in that company, knowing how it was run and I worked in 5 different stores.

If anything, I’d short the company."

6/26/2021 22:33,stocks,"LOL ! U know what, that's not a bad thesis to go on. Especially if they struggle to get feet back in the door as areas re-open, I could see a CVS or Walgreens buying them out for the space if we see any of the competition growing rapidly .... definetly something to watch for that I really wasn't thinking about. 

Being in the stock for so long, do you think it was overvalued and headed towards a more realistic price, say, 12.50 ? Or do you think the quarterly reactions got a little carried away and the stock is going to pull back up? I see it sold off from 40 to like 6 bucks a few years ago. OUCH. Don't wanna get caught in something like that. 

When I first saw the sell off i was like, ""Rite Aid? Dude thats goin back up forsure and then I looked at the 4Y chart and listened to an interview w the CEO and now I'm like uuuh idk this might tank from where it was and stay down for awhile.  To be frank I sold an $18 and $17 weekly put on the way down and now im trying to figure out if I should dump the shares on Monday or hold to ride it back up... decisions decisions."
6/26/2021 22:52,stocks,Ooof. Thanks for the tip. Really didn't consider that. You think most of the selling off was from funds dumping shares?

6/27/2021 9:41,stocks,"All this assumes that the Whole Foods acquisition has been a success which it really hasn’t been. Amazon barely mentions WF in their quarterly reports despite it being a $16B business. It was a $16B business in 2016 the year before they bought it, so it hasn’t grown at all. They’ve had revenue decline in physical stores 5 out of the last 6 quarters while Target, Walmart, Kroger and Albertsons are putting up double-digit growth. 

It also ignores that Amazon is currently under antitrust scrutiny and pressure to get smaller, not bigger. Rite Aid is close to a penny stock but they are a huge company by revenue. It won’t be allowed."

6/26/2021 23:01,stocks,"I mean who knows...All I can say is this company hasn't changed in the time I first bought those shares.  They stay as an outlier to the big 2.  You only have so much to invest, why here?"
6/27/2021 9:36,stocks,"2 failed mergers with Walgreens years ago. The FTC claimed it would be a monopoly eliminating the 3rd drug store option and giving WAG too much power in the industry.

The possible buyouts were rumored to come from AMAZON but that is not happening. 

I work for the company and they are lost. 2nd quarter sales are promising, but will be with most retailers as things begin to open , so proceed with caution. I would love to see the company turn itself around but they do not focus on the real issues the company has and instead places a bunch of 'innovative' concepts at the top of the list every few weeks/months just to satisfy shareholders.

They have supply chain issues and distribution centers (at least where I'm at) are unreliable and inefficient. Their PBM is not strong enough to compete with the pricing of WAG CVS and they don't the foothold as a household name in the drug business. People more associate rite aid with thrifty ice cream which is just a cute gimmick to get front end customers to come spend a few bucks.

I will say that it does seem to be another relatively over shorted stock, and these drops are not new. It appears there are massive sell offs at every bit of negative news as it RAD is some company on verge of bankruptcy. They are not, and the price typically rebounds fairly quickly on the announcement of another gimmicky launch. I would hold."
6/26/2021 23:03,stocks,"It was a bad earnings report with analyst downgrades. Yes, the selloff was hedge funds closing out their positions."
6/27/2021 12:51,stocks,"First, Whole Foods is in a completely different segment.  You can't compare groceries to pharmacy / convenience goods.  So the Whole Foods experience has no relevance whatsoever to Amazon's intentions in the pharmacy sector.  If Amazon does not go big into pharmacy with an acquisition of Rite Aid or similar, then the Amazon pharmacy business will be destined to fail.  Amazon does not win in a category just by being Amazon.  In pharmacy, you need to be large enough in prescription drugs to be able to negotiate the lowest prices to compete with the likes of CVS , Walgreens , Walmart , etc.  Amazon is not even in the top 15 in the USA in prescription drug sales.   So AMZN either goes big, or they drop out and go home in this category.

Second, your entire depiction of antitrust concerns is incorrect.  The US government's use of antitrust laws is to ensure that monopolies are not created and that there is healthy competition to provide consumers with multiple options at fair prices.  Once again, Amazon has not been able to crack into the top 15 in the USA in pharmacy.  By acquiring Rite Aid with the goal of building that business out, Amazon would essentially create the 3rd pure national retail pharmacy in the USA, along with CVS and Rite Aid.  This would increase competition in the space, not decrease it.  So, Amazon could easily make an argument that taking a small regional business and growing it into a national pharmacy would be very good for the market, giving consumers more choices and increased price competition.   And we all know that lower prices for prescription drugs is a national goal of the US government."

6/27/2021 0:00,stocks,"Does breakeven point matter for options?  

i got a option that expires in two weeks, break even point was abt 10 percent more (this was a call) but i made a hefty amount of profit when it only went 5 percent up?

How would u explain this i thought u need to hit breakeven point to make money

so i could make money on a option if the break even point is like +50 percent? and it expires in two weeks? and if it goes up just a few percent"
6/26/2021 21:39,stocks,That's breakeven at expiry.  I suggest not doing options until you understand what happened.
6/26/2021 21:44,stocks,Break even = at expiration. Please do you research before getting in too deep
6/26/2021 21:46,stocks,"Maybe do some more research on options if you don’t understand this.

6/26/2021 23:19,stocks,One of my favorite sites to learn about options. If you haven’t seen this and read it entirely you do not belong in the options game. Period.[Options Education](https://www.optionseducation.org/optionsoverview/getting-started-with-options)
6/26/2021 21:42,stocks,"You are potentially in over your head, you need to understand this before playing options.

6/26/2021 22:29,stocks,Listen to these guys. I lost a shit ton of money with options when I didn't know what I was doing.
6/26/2021 21:39,stocks,isn't break even points just for if you plan to exercise the option? if you are gonna just sell it if the price goes up of course you will likely get a profit.
6/26/2021 22:14,stocks,Break even is the price the stock would need to be for you to not have gained or lost money if you were to exercise the option. What they are showing you is the premium you paid +  price of the stock that would make you break even when exercising the option.
6/26/2021 23:31,stocks,The amount of people who don’t understand breakeven point for a option is scary lol
6/26/2021 22:23,stocks,"If you buy a call option and if the underlying stock goes up and if there is still time for it to go up more before it expires and if someone believes it will get above the strike price plus what you are asking to sell it, they may buy it from you. If all those ifs work out you could make a profit."
6/27/2021 0:46,stocks,"Think of options as a coupon. let's say your buying a company named PAIR and you buy calls with 2 weeks of time and the current price of PAIR bf buying was $120 a share and you think it will go to $130 a share by the end of the 2 weeks bc of some up coming catalyst.  So you buy 1 options call contract ( coupon) for $2 ($200). Your basically saying hey I think the stock will go above $122 a share or higher by the end of the 2 week period. So naturally this to you is a deal.. So you buy the contract aka coupon. You have no problem paying $12200 ( $122 a share x 100 ) ( all options contacts are in 100 share qts ) by the end of the 2 weeks bc you belive it will be worth $13000 by that time, banking you a gain of $800 total. 

Well let's say the day after you bought your coupon the stock shoots up to $125. Well you know have a coupon that's worth more then when you first bought it. Now ask yourself, would you sell your coupon to me for the same price you bought it for the day bf? No, why? Bc PAIR stock is now currently worth $125 making your coupon more valubale bc PAIR is now worth  $125 or $300 more then what you bought the coupon for. 

So the reason the contract ( the option aka coupon) goes up in value in the short term is bc it's worth more then what it was the day bf. So let's say all of a sudden you don't think Apple will keep going up or you just want to collect the premium. You could sell the option ( aka coupon ) for a $300 gain and be on your way.

Know this can go in reverse just as fast as it went forward. If instead the next day PAIR was at $118 well now your coupon is worthless or worth -$200.. why you ask? Bc who would pay a extra $200 for your coupon when they could go and buy PAIR for $200 cheaper at $118.

Basically you get to collect the premium if you so choose. If you do so you can sell your coupon and ONLY collect the premium that the coupon is worth, not the shares. So you make money bc your coupon is now worth more then what is was when you bought it. 


It's confusing for sure. And this is a VERY VERY basic explanation. There's alot more that goes into it. That's why you should paper trade or read and learn options bf you invest or start playing with them. This feed is full of ppl who lost more then what they could afford bc they dident fully understand how options work. They are complicated. Please, Un.der.stand. bf you dive into them. 

Hope this helps and it's NOT FINANCIAL ADVISE."
6/27/2021 6:43,stocks,"Bought options eventually expire as worthless.  The price you see is what you could sell it for before the expiration date.  If the price of the underlying stock is near or more than the strike price, then it could be worth more than you paid for it.  We have no details to fully understand your question.

Now, let's assume you bought a call for $2 with a strike price of $25, then your ""break even"" is $27; $25 + $2.  That means you can't actually turn a profit unless the underlying stock is more than $27. If not, then you will lose the $2 you spent to buy the option. Absolutely do not exercise the option if you are not above break even.

I suggest doing some reading outside WSB to fully understand options.  The ones who were really pushing that trend, i.e. RoaringKitty, are actual professionals who are manipulating the markets by posting on Reddit.  There will be many shoes to drop from that nonsense. Reader beware."
6/27/2021 9:21,stocks,"Here’s how I organize this in my brain, in plain non-financial jargon:

Buying options: breakeven point is the goalpost for if you make money or don’t make money on the option, at any point whatsoever between buy and expiration.

Selling options: breakeven point means when I’m likely to lose my shares or money up as collateral.

As a person who typically sells calls lately, the break even point is important to me also because it tells me exactly what price I will receive in total for the shares I am holding.

So basically, it’s just the specific price that has to happen in order to have made a good choice or not.

Now, there is another moving part here and that is the price at which people are buying/selling the contract you possess. If you keep an eye on that, you might find getting rid of that contract is likely to make you more money than keeping it. This is where you should consider your own buy/sell price (which of course is part of the breakeven point, but will also show by itself under “avg cost” or “avg credit”.

So if you feel like the contract is worth more getting rid of it than keeping it, you’d need to factor in what the current share price is vs your breakeven point as well.

Hopefully that all made sense.

And, hopefully you won’t take that as financial advice because it’s coming from a person who is way too new at this to be giving advice."
6/27/2021 19:40,stocks,"The break even only matters if you’re exercising options, it’s the point where you’re gunna make as much if you were to sell the stock as you would spend on buying the stocks from the contracts. YouTube has some good videos of you don’t wanna bother with these nutjobs 🙄."
6/27/2021 4:18,stocks,ITT: omg can’t believe you don’t understand this if you don’t know what’s happening don’t buy options.

6/26/2021 23:52,stocks,"At expiration, there will be no time left on the contract and so there will be no uncertainty left.  The loss of uncertainty translates to a loss in value of the contract.  You also have change on value because of stock movement heading to and from to your strike.

If your break even at expiration is 10% over the initial underlying price, your contract will gain value (especially early on) just for moving up.  As the underlying gets closer to the strike, the contract will be more likely to expire in the money and have some intrinsic value (above your break even).  If that happens when there's time left, then the extrinsic value (the value because of future possibilities) will increase, and you'll profit off of that.  This value will decrease over time if the underlying doesn't move any further, and you'll actually move from profit into loss.  You won't have met your break even at expiration."

6/27/2021 11:19,stocks,I mean probably
6/27/2021 15:15,stocks,"Options have intrinsic value and time value. If a call it out of the money (for example a 350 call when the share price is 346), there is no intrinsic value, and all of its value resides in the time left before expiry and the potential for it to cross into the money in that time.

As an option goes into the money, it gains intrinsic value. If the share price was suddenly 352, that call option has intrinsic value of $2.00 (x100). Even if it expired right now, you could exercise it and immediately sell for a $200 profit. Add on time value, figured by time to expiry, and those combined values will be the price of the contract.

As expiry approaches, time value decreases (at a rate per day called *theta*) until it is zero. Out of the money calls are worthless at that point and in the money calls are worth their pure intrinsic value. 

Break even is the price a stock will need to be when the contract expires for your contract’s intrinsic value to be equal to what you paid for it."
6/27/2021 17:41,stocks,"Breakeven point is an approximation..

6/27/2021 19:50,stocks,"Yes and no. Most people don't exercise options, or hold on to them until they expire in the money. So in those cases, not really.

The big thing is, just making profits on the option. Realize that the extrinsic value decays very fast within 30 days of expiring, so in essence you're kind of losing money every day. If you're in the profit, and don't plan on exercising, you should entertain the thought of selling to close."
6/26/2021 23:46,stocks,"Legit question, even if you are 100percent sure in your prediction you did your dd and you put a price tag on the stock and  its on discount. Why would you buy an option for it and not stocks?

If his breakeven price is $12, strike price $10, underlying $11, he didn't lose his entire premium, he just doesn't break even. He takes a 50% loss."
6/26/2021 21:40,stocks,so i could make money on a option if the break even point is like +50 percent?
6/27/2021 2:54,stocks,"No. Extrinsic value of an option wi be 0 on expiration date. If you buy an option for share at value 100, at strike price of 100 for 40 {$4000} but the stock price only went to 130, you will lose money. Breakeven does matter. On expiration date. Also there is theta decay,. Even if you plan to sell option 6 months before expiration and stock increased not at a desired rate depending on theta, you will lose money."

6/27/2021 17:33,stocks,Did you see the guy yesterday that had -72k on margain but didn’t understand how margain even worked….he was freaking out when he had a margain call lol….
6/26/2021 22:30,stocks,I don’t completely understand it and I buy options all the time. Gambling is more fun when you don’t understand the game
6/26/2021 23:48,stocks,You should at least know how they work before buying them.
6/27/2021 18:34,stocks,Strike must be met for the option to work at expiry
6/26/2021 22:41,stocks,"See if this helps. 

When you buy an option contract you are really buying 2 things. 1) the option contract 2) the option (but not obligation) to buy shares at a strike price at a future date. 

You can make (or lose) on either or both. 

Example.  You pay .10 per option contract for a $10 call with strike in October.   The stock is currently trading at $8.

a) the stock starts to rise up to $9.50 in June.  Your option contract will now be trading at a higher price than when you bought it, as the value of the stock has gone up.  you can sell the option contract before exercising it.  - your stock has gone up but is still below the strike price so the value is in the contract only.  You are done, no shares in your account but you made money on the contract portion. 

If you wait for the exercise date, your option contract can lose extrinsic value (time value)as it will only be worth the intrinsic value (difference between stock price and strike price).   

If the stock goes down, your contract price will also drop. 

I think what you were referring to was the intrinsic + extrinsic price of the option is higher than what you bought and so you are up.  

The break even only comes into play if you are waiting until the exercise date to exercise.  Then the break even is the cost of the stock +the price you paid for the contract.  

So in this example : 
break even = (value of shares + option cost)/number of shares. 
= ($10 x 100 shares ( 1 contract) + (.10 x 100))/100
=($1,000 + $10) / 100
= $10.10 break even. 

Obviously if the price is below strike price at exercise date you lose the cost of the option contract and don’t get the shares. 

Please feel free to comment if I missed something. 

Hope this helps.

6/26/2021 21:45,stocks,U can sell the option really a ship there profit
6/27/2021 0:05,stocks,"It really depends though on what your investing goals are. In terms of absolute dollar amount, it makes sense to buy calls on a stock for short term gain. You need way less money (the premium) and the leverage can give you a nice reward. Granted it can expire worthless, but given you can use smaller amounts of starting money, you could have put the rest into a regular ETF to de-risk. This is not well advertised by people on Reddit, but you can also get out of an option before expiry and eat the loss. That means you can play options just like stocks and get in and out of them as necessary."

6/27/2021 0:37,stocks,As you should. It’s not that you can’t invest with options and be successful in the very short term. Literally anyone can do that. It’s called luck. But if you don’t understand why your contract is profitable when it is not at the breakeven point then you are missing basic fundamental elements of options trading that anyone who knows anything about options WOULD know.

From a shopping perspective I think it might be where you are located since I have a fairly similar experience to what you described: greeted, drinks offered, personal assistant recommending clothes or style options based on what we're looking for. I wouldnt describe our area as anything besides middle class either and theres plenty of foot traffic. Sometimes I'm there to get just a few polos or jeans and I shoo them off but anytime I'm doing something custom theres someone who is with us the entire time."
6/26/2021 21:43,stocks,"They didn't file bankruptcy, but have been suffering lackluster revenues for years. They haven't done enough to modernize, and don't look like a strong candidate to survive the consolidation the next ten years or so will bring the market. They have way too many liabilities, and serve too niche a market to experience the growth needed to survive.

I would not buy any retail stock at the moment, but there are a few names I like better. M at least holds some property, and has the scope to address a broader customer base, in vastly more locations. They'll likely need to consolidate and close up some weak performers, but at least there's a little value there. DDS gets an F for innovation and future growth, but has an A+ balance sheet. At least when they go under, they'll have assets to sell. LVMHF is obscenely overpriced, and isn't apples to apples against JWN, but it's one of the few I'm comfortable saying will make it through any retail apocalypse. It's not a ""competitor,"" but I'd even prefer KSS. It's a poorly run company, but trades closest to book value.

I do like them better PVH, LB, and the now private Tailored Brands. And of course more than Saks or the now defunct Lord and Taylor.

If you want retail exposure, some brands that I would consider buying, in addition to LVMHF, though may not be a ""competitor"" to JWN would be RL, EL, ULTA, LULU, NKE, and TGT."
6/26/2021 20:27,stocks,"I should add the disclaimer that I work for a competitor of JWN. I may be pre-disposed to bias, or I may have insight into the sector and its overall outlook. 

I will say, I turned down a promotion to jump ship to them because I'm not confident in their long term outlook, but that has more to do with actual job security over the next 30 years, and not if you can make a quick buck on the stock."

6/27/2021 0:00,stocks,"If you’re a long-term investor (20+ years), wouldn’t it make sense to invest in foreign emerging markets such as VWO?

Maybe I’m oversimplifying it, but with an increasingly digital global economy, improvement in education in developing countries, and the sheer potential of all countries who have room to grow GDP-wise, I think this is a no-brainer.

This was on a middle class salary, I wasn't even making enough to *come close* to maxing my retirement contributions until two years ago. Most of the legwork getting to six figures came from market returns over those six years.

The point your salty ass is failing to grasp is that it is possible to build ""a substantial amount of capital"" just by having a decent middle class job and practicing good saving/investing habits for a few years. The analogy you're going for is garbage because nobody is saying to just dump your 2K in SPY and forget about it-- you continue to add to your position with whatever you can afford to save, that's how you build wealth with ETFs.

My first priority is always going to be boomer-investing into retirement accounts, because that is statistically the most effective way to build wealth over a long time horizon. As long as you're within a few standard deviations of the average income and civilization doesn't collapse, it works for anyone eventually.

But it doesn't have to be a zero sum game between passive indexing and crunching the numbers on bigger risk/rewards. I've always devoted a chunk of my portfolio for fun stuff and pipe dreams, and as I've progressed in my career and begun to feel more secure with what I have in my retirement accounts, the amount of risk I'm comfortable taking on in my taxable account has grown exponentially. 

We're all here in /r/stocks hoping to beat the market sometimes, so I totally get what you're saying. But boring, long-term strategies with at least a portion of your capital will *at worst* protect you if you fail at that, and *at best* give you the security to chase bigger prizes.

You get a lot of international exposure in the S&P from international companies. Again, I pivoted a bit from the person you replied to saying that on the whole you benefit from worldwide innovations because they seem to make their way to US companies hands. 

I can see now how you were just trying to say innovation occurs outside the US and it looked like I was debating that point. I  am not.

As for the basics, I have a few books: Benjamin Graham Security Analysis, Options as a strategic investment by Lawrence McMillan. They are both available at your local libraries. Mad Money by Jim Cramer is a fun read. Jim's show is mostly for entertainment nowadays but he made some good points from time to time.

The Graham book is about fundamentals of a stock. The ""technical"" research is about reading the stock chart and making a guess of which direction it would go next. I found the cup-w-handle technique by Investor Business Daily website had some merit.

By the way, as part of my degree I studied on his hedging textbook and his statistical textbook. I'm not sure how ""he proves that my degree+career is worthless pseudoscience"" considering that: 

1. My degree is exactly the kind of degree that he's a professor in (at NYU Tandon)
2. My (ideal) career is basically the same thing he currently does for Universa Investments.

According to you he's a professor (and academic reviewer) in a worthless pseudoscientific degree and he considers his own profession worthless pseudoscience. Not sure if you can see the absurdity in your claims.

My criticism has never been of the ideas, but of him as a person and of his writing style (since in his case the two things are basically one and the same).

He is a ridiculously arrogant and (ironically) fragile individual with a **huge** ego. His writing style perfectly reflects that and makes for an extremely unpleasant reading experience. He's a good ""probabilistic philosopher"", but a shit human and an even more shit writer."

Actually most services that uses maps are actually using the map services provided by Google or Apple, and a lot of the servers used are just leased from cloud services that are dominated by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Most big apps usually have capacity leased from at least two providers to avoid down time if one provider goes down. 

So in a sense these tech companies already get paid for the part they do best, which is provide server and infrastructure software, and leave the management of the service and user interface to the other company.

6/27/2021 13:42,stocks,"Enterprise in this case would be the current drivers. Those guys are running a cab business thus, enterprise.

Costs will depend on how much it costs to acquire drivers and clients. Brand recognition doesnt matter in this case. Its a chicken and egg problem. You wont get a single driver if there are no clients and there are no clients without drivers. This is what you are missing in your equation.

My guess is that it will cost around $10k per driver to start gaining a foothold. You basically need to give away rides or greatly discount them for a year or two for drivers and clients to feel this is reliable enough for their time. How much will that cost? In the meantime, there isnt anywhere near enough viewership to make up the money with ads. They will need to have millions of riders before ads can even start making a dent. So all in all, this endeavor will cost billions easily and there is no guarantee that it will even work. This would be the argument for buying an established business.

Not that I am advocating any of the above. In my mind, Google would be absolutely insane to get into the cab business without self driving perfected. Its not worth it at all."

Uber’s valuation is more than $100B - way more than Ford. Ford’s valuation is around 67B. Uber is even more valuable than GM. No other traditional auto manufacturing company is going to buy or even afford Uber. 

And Tesla is about $145B and they don’t have enough cash on hand to make such an acquisition. It also goes against Tesla’s business model of selling electric cars whereas Uber supports both gas, hybrid and electric. Musk doesn’t care much about ride share but he’s probably interested in using Tesla for AV in the future. 

Google will not be interested. They have approx $150B cash on hand but why buy Uber when they can use a fraction of that investment build out Waymo? They are already testing prototypes. 

Uber’s model is to disrupt cab/taxi industry. Neither Google or Tesla are that interested in cab industry as much as they are interested in their cars being driverless for consumers.

And frankly, Uber is in so much regulatory headaches around the globe for disrupting local taxi laws, no company wants to acquire them and then deal with these issues. Uber also has some serious safety and privacy issues. Besides, there’s the whole issue of drivers being seen as contract workers vs Uber employees. No company wants to deal with that headache. Probably the biggest reason why Google wants Waymo to be fully autonomous so they don’t have to deal with the drivers being employees issue."

>It also goes against Tesla’s business model of selling electric cars whereas Uber supports both gas, hybrid and electric.

If Tesla were to acquire Uber they can simply mandate that every vehicle in the fleet be a Tesla, whether owned or rented by the driver. Gas/hybrid vehicles are not necessary to sustain a taxi service.

>Neither Google or Tesla are that interested in cab industry as much as they are interested in their cars being driverless for consumers.

Google owns Waymo which has been offering a limited autonomous taxi service in Arizona. That sounds like they're interested to me.

Taxis would also be an obvious revenue stream for Tesla. If they do in fact solve autonomous driving then Tesla could pay owners to use their cars in a robotaxi network while they are not using them. Passive income for both Tesla and their customers. [ARK did an article on this not long ago.](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-ride-hail-update/)"
6/27/2021 0:00,stocks,"$NTLA and $REGN announce that they have successfully corrected a hereditary disease with an infusion of CRISPR Big news in the medical field today as Intellia Therapeutics and Regeneron announce, for the first time, history-making news that they have successfully treated a genetic disease, ATTR amyloidosis, with a single infusion of CRISPR, a programmable gene editing tool. This data was also published in the premiere medical journal, NEJM

https://ir.intelliatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/intellia-and-regeneron-announce-landmark-clinical-data-showing

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107454?query=featured_home

For those unaware, CRISPR is a programmable gene editing system discovered in 2012 which allows precise gene editing at a target locus. Jennifer Doudna, the founder of NTLA, and Emannuelle Charpentier, the founder of CRSP, were awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

This really demonstrates the promise of CRISPR to treat all genetic diseases. 

I believe this will cause the entire sector of gene editing and maybe genomics stocks to move higher. Other stocks in this field include BEAM, EDIT, VERV, VRTX, and CRSP.

Taxable: Equal parts VTSAX, BABA, Paysafe. BABA and VTSAX are long holds.

IRA: 70% Mutual Funds (60% FZROX, 40% FTIHX domestic/international) 15% MO 15% Paysafe. Bought the recent S&P dip to 4160 $.$

401k: 2060 retirement plan

MF brokerage link: 100% PSFE; only 5% total portfolio, but want to boost this balance to get more tax free growth.

I plan on holding $MO at least until cannabis rolls out federally, which could take forever- but I like nontaxable dividends at this entry point.
I plan on holding $BABA until at least after their big sale day in november.
I plan on holding $PSFE until I get a good exit price, or longer. Won't hold past $16 probably, may prefer to rotate."

House hasn’t made sense for me as I’ve moved 9 times since starting my career as a single guy without kids. The financial math to buy vs rent only adds up if I stay put for 5+ years. 

I’m semi-settled in my current location, but saving up a couple more years at least until I can afford a place I really want ($1M+ w/ 20% down payment). It will hurt to cash out equities for a down payment, but ultimately a good way to diversify total portfolio."

6/27/2021 2:13,stocks,"I started off selling puts with a similar mindset. Only selling tickers which I didn't mind holding long term.  


The issue really was it being capital intensive since I'd have to own 100 shares if I were to be assigned. Especially so if the tickers were high value ones.

So while I want them , getting 100 of them at one go would really mess up my portfolio allocation. I learnt this on my very first CSP."

Maintain your property. If your renting a shit hole for the low side of market rent you're going to attract tenants that you don't want. My strategy has been to buy these buildings and throw gobs of money at rehabbing them when tenants move out. I'm not in the business of kicking people out of their homes.

Put your profits back in, every dollar you pay into the first month of a 30 year mortgage is a dollar you don't pay in interest when it's done.."
6/27/2021 9:13,stocks,"Why can’t you just refinance and cash out a large portion of that money? That would allow you to buy a lot more properties with more cash flow and increased tax advantages.

Possibly taking out 0% down loan and paying PMI would be more beneficial to you overall financially than paying short term capital gains on the squeeze plays if they rocket in less than a year, and using that after-tax money as a down payment.

Also, if you were planning on using it as an investment property rather than to live in, you could potentially use just Roth money to buy the whole thing and seriously save on taxes, as I understand it: https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/self-directed-ira"

I had just wanted to throw the idea out there in case you hadn't considered it yet. Awesome that you're planning to buy a property so young!"
6/26/2021 20:06,stocks,"Agree to disagree then. I don't feel like handing them a stack of cash or investment is inherently wrong or a bad way to raise children, because you can pair it with excellent personal finance upbringing and they'll manage their wealth properly. I've personally known people who received money from their parents and managed their own investments since they were teens, and they're also the most frugal people I've ever met. I've seen others who received nothing from their parents and blow paycheck after paycheck without proper financial planning.

It's the lessons you leave with your child, not the assets, that matter."
6/26/2021 20:16,stocks,Perhaps you made a few assumptions on how I’m raising my kid based on one piece of knowledge?
6/26/2021 22:10,stocks,It all depends how you've raised them up until that moment. Maybe handing your daughter that kind of money is questionable. Not everyone's daughter is like yours though.

6/26/2021 22:01,stocks,"You ok bud? You seems pretty fixated on that one part and have ignored what is really the most important points in the rest of my comment.

Look, [here is a study](https://www.afcpe.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/v24_1_61-79.pdf) on different types of financial socialization and how it affected them as they entered adulthood. Giving allowance alone is not an effective way of teaching your child good financial skills, which is why the rest of my comment - and what was really my one and only thesis - is proper financial education. Furthermore, the study shows that those who ***did not*** receive an allowance were more likely to worry about money, even after correcting for parental and individual factors (i.e., the parent's net worth, etc.). So childhood exposure to allowances are objectively not a bad thing.

Interestingly, out of all the childhood socialization techniques studied (allowance, opening a savings account, parental monitoring of spending, working for pay, and teaching donations), working for pay is the only one that ***increased*** anxiety about money.

So perhaps you should rethink your view about how to teach a child about money."
6/26/2021 22:16,stocks,"Not a kid lol. I’m talking about when she’s in her 30’s. The validity is that money makes life better and less stressful and I’d like to support my child in pursuit of that. It doesn’t have anything to do with “how I’m raising her.” 


Values, morals, responsibility, etc. are all things that are important and important for me to teach to my child. You’re acting like I’m just handing out money and nothing else."

It could potentially be made from corn cob waste or something instead of being mined. The best source for diamonds for industrial use cases is already synthesis, and diamonds require much more extreme pressures to create than graphite (both diamonds and graphite are made from the same element carbon). It's possible no one had bothered to come up with an industrial process to make graphite from cheap feedstock because there was no market, but if EVs really will need tons of the stuff that can change quickly."

While mined graphite is still among the best anode materials nowadays, this can quickly change (within years), as biogenic carbons get better and better.

- They do not plan to bring a product to market until 2023 (if everything goes well). This would be using other mines graphite.

This would already boost energy density and charge rates by a large amount. 
What concerns me more for your investment is the intended transition to Lithium-metal anodes or at least towards Anode-free batteries (where the Lithium from the NMC is directly deposited on the current collector with a layer of artificially preformed SEI on top). This technique is also known as zero-excess cells.

Sorry dude, but the truth is, the average person is going to take like 90 years to amass good wealth and reasonable passive income with a modest income, and even “modester” saving habits.

It’s easier for one to raise their hourly wage by $10, and make additional $1600 a month, than earn the same $1600 in dividends per month. You’d need at least $500,000 for the latter. 

So, right now if you make $3k a month, you should be aiming towards $6, or $8, or $10k. The way I managed
to pass the $10k mark is with professional qualification. I’m a self-taught programmer.

Now, I’m at $15 - $18k/mo, and if I want to go up to $25, $30, I know exactly what I need to do: refine process and start outsourcing, hiring people in one end, and acquiring more clients in the other.

If I take a $3k profit per programmer hired a month, I can, with around 6 to 10, to reach that $30k level. If I do a great job at that and hire 100, that means $300k. And so on.

Only now, that I make $15k/month, is that I actually think a little more about investment. I live with around $4-5 and save all the rest. Investing 10k a month is much significant when it comes to building passive
Income.

FOCUS on making more money!"

Let's take for example the company GAW you mention and calculate it last 5 years:

Total Dividend received about 20%

Gross total profit: 2330+20= 2350% (amazing!!)

I turn 40 this year... If I live to 60, I outlive my parents and most of my grandparents... 

So essentially, if my plan is to hold for return, I have to either buy something young enough to grow to higher dividend payouts, or high yield enough to pay for itself in under 10 years. 

Another factor is how div stocks perform against growth in a downturn... Maybe we never have another market crash. But if we did, div stocks can insulate against panic.

Your kids don't need to understand the 4% rule or anything, they just get a quarterly cheque. 3) if you are retired you wouldn't need to sell anything in a recession so you still do fine and 4) if you add your dividend received with the capital appreciation of the stock, you'd roughly get the same return as an index fund and most dividend giving companys are old value plays that is relatively stable so you don't need to worry about it"
6/26/2021 22:44,stocks,Idk where anyone is paying 50% but even the 40 % is with short term capital gains over 500k and at that point you can keep the money in a corporation and pay corporate tax rates.. I myself pay about 26% on my short term gains and once I get to over a million I doubt I will be actively daytrading anymore also consider it like this.. if you make 9% apr on 10k thats 900 dollars per year still with a 14-21% tax (depending on your state) meaninf you made about 775$.. now if you make 60% apr on that 10k and pay even a 35% tax rate thats still 3900$ so yes you pay higher taxes trading but you make a much higher percentage return.. this is all based on short term realized gains

Dividends are a blood letting of the company.   To keep the price from rising,  and the institutions don’t get exposed and forced to sell,  and then get whatever it’s called when they don’t have enough and have to buy and sell and buy and sell and buy.

It’s not about the dividends specifically, and it’s about how a company manages earnings allocation.

6/27/2021 9:26,stocks,"I respectfully disagree!

If it’s in a taxable account, then you’re paying ordinary income tax on it, which is worse than a commission.

If you’re in a retirement account, there are three situations:

1. You’re reinvesting the dividend in the security that generated them. Mathematically this is precisely identical to holding a stock that doesn’t generate dividends - no gain or loss.
2. You’re letting the dividends sit in your retirement account as cash. Assuming you don’t want your money sitting fallow and losing value to inflation,this is worse than any other alternative (except withdrawing the funds from your retirement funds early, which is so bad of an option I’m not even counting it.)
3. You’re reinvesting the funds in some other security inside your retirement account. Again, this is mathematically the same as going to your IRA or 401(k) website and telling them to reallocate existing funds into a different security.

None of those options is “worth it.”

There’s exactly one situation where dividends make sense over and above just selling shares: you need a *somewhat but not precisely* regular income stream, are willing to draw down your investments to do  it, and value the convenience of having the money show up automatically rather than have to deal with selling shares. That’s it. That’s the only actual benefit. But whenever we have these discussions the thread is full of people who *clearly* think dividends are somehow “free money” rather than them just a forced way of them paying themselves their own money, which is a category error. (I’m not saying this is you…but it’s a lot of people on this thread.)"
6/26/2021 23:08,stocks,"Ah I think I understand now. So your saying that dividend companies deliberstely use dividend to prevent the price from sktrocketing, so people will hold on to their dhares and not sell out. That makes sense."

Getting 3% capped 401k match is very typical, higher is available.  At a 50k per year job that's 3500 a year out of pocket or 300ish per month.  The amount you contribute goes up slightly if your starting salary is below 50k.  

You go to college to better yourself, study something you hopefully enjoy and make yourself more valuable than otherwise.  

Life choices matter too.  If you choose to go to an expensive out of state school, and choose to study something (because you enjoy it hopefully) that may not be the highest paying job out of school, hopefully you thought about the risk in advance and are ready for the pile of student loan debt.

1. They likely collect social security too. Which differs person to person, but the average check is 18k a year. So they actually have 78k coming in.

2. This individual probably made use of tax advantaged accounts. So there's a good chance that a decent chunk of that 78k isn't taxed. 

3. One of the biggest expenses a working individual will have is saving for retirement. When your actually retired that expense dispears and the money is freed up for other stuff. If this person had been putting aside 20% of their yearly income for retirement, then in effect that 78k is going to do the same as if they were making around 94k a year."

6/26/2021 20:01,stocks,the way div works its a cash payout that gets taxed at approximately 20% (i think it changes with tax bracket.) then you can reinvest your div which then goes into your cost basis. so if you get the 100 dollars taxed to 80$ and reinvest bringing your total cost basis to 1080$.  then if you sell your position you are only paying taxes on gains above that 1080$. you only get taxed once on the div as well as the capital gains but capital gains tends to be higher. there are advantages to both types. with div i dont have to reinvest directly to the security that payed out the div meaning i have free cash flow but with a buyback stock i have better equity (if i dont sell) when it comes to margin consideration. meaning ill be able to leverage more.

However, most stocks are not returning dividends anywhere close to a reasonable price for the equity itself. The same can be said for the housing market when compared to median income. Simply put, a highly bipartisan government, A nation with no culture or heritage, a seemingly infinite list of unpaid liabilities promised to government workers, a complete lack of accountability for large corporations, and an overstretched Global influence Is destined to lead to massive inflation and a complete detachment from reasonable price valuations.

It was for netherland merchants trading with India. They had to finance boats and crews so they asked for money in exchange of a part of the adventure entreprise to be in proportion with the future sales they would made upon their return with goods in a year. Multiple companies proposed this and you could buy the share ticket at the harbour office.
Soon it showed that the price of boats and crews were only 1% compared to the large amount of money made from the trade. Nobody would want to sell their share for at least what they could yield in a couple of years. Then smart people though it could be interesting to make money not on what a share could bring each year but on the difference between its value between their buying point and selling point. So they bought and began to bullshit about how this particular ship trading company was going to another part of India with unprecedented goods of formidable value so they could sell their share at a higher price."

I feel like that’d make the calculation more interesting because every dividend being paid out is actually being paid out with an extra 10x, but also the stock’s current valuation would probably be 1/10 of what it’d be due to dilution. 

So removing a dollar from the share price due to the sticker price of the dividend might be interesting. Obviously an absurd hypothetical, but hey food for thought."
6/27/2021 10:02,stocks,It is cash flow tho.  And you're making it sound like the shareholder doesn't benefit from the dividend even tho the price goes down by the same amount.  Cash today is worth more than cash one year from now.  You're forgetting the denominator to that calculation - the risk associated with cash flow.  A dividend received is 'fully valued' bc there's no risk associated with it.  No time value of money element. It's in your hands.

6/26/2021 20:19,stocks,"If a company never pays dividends, then two things can happen. They can stay in business or they can go out of business.

 If they go out of business, they will liquidate. This means they will sell all of their assets and pay off their debts, any remaining money will be distributed to shareholders. This means that at the time of liquidation, shareholders will receive at least the amount of shareholder equity that exists. 

If the company never goes out of business and never pays a dividend, then other investors will buy the company from you at a certain price based shareholder equity with the idea that if the company every does go out of business, they will receive at least that much. Usually they will pay more because of potential future growth. 

In either case, shareholders legally are entitled to shareholders equity and will always receive it in one form or another. Therefore, a stock is not similar to a collectible baseball card. 

For example, if a company had a hundred billion dollars of cash on their balance sheet worth no debt and you bought it for a hundred million dollars, chances are you will almost certainly receive your hundred billion eventually even if you find nobody to buy the business from you."

6/27/2021 7:17,stocks,"Not really. The profit has to go somewhere. For most companies that don't give a dividend the profit is reinvested in growing the company.

Then I would buy up 50%+1 shares, and take full control of the company which is obviously still a valuable thing to own.  I could then appoint myself CEO with massive salary, or sell off assets and pay a huge dividend (of which half would go directly to me), etc.

I’m not saying the shareholder doesn’t benefit.  I’m just saying there’s no added advantage over non-div stocks.  It’s what companies do when they have literally no idea what else to do with their cash flow.  When Amazon has nowhere else to spend their billions, they’ll likely do the same."

There is a company, and the share represents partial ownership of that company. 

Berkshire Hathaway has no dividend.   Not does Amazon or Tesla.  You will have a hard time convincing anyone that those shares are worthless.


>The only way for your shares to have value at that point is for you to sell them to so.eone else who believes they have value.


That's technically true of every stock.  Fortunately, investors realize that stocks have value and will buy them if they are fire sold below market value. 


>If the company doesn't pay a dividend then as soon as people decide they don't want to hold their shares, there is absolutely nothing to prop up the price of the underlying.


Technically also true of companies with dividends.   If everyone decided a company is worthless and sells, the subsequent devaluation of the company may result in them cutting the dividend anyway. 


>I never buy shares of companies that don't pay dividends unless I'm selling covered calls against them.

If everyone decides to sell shares in a company that has a divided, the dividend yield goes up unless there is a reason the company can no longer pay the divided.

Once the dividend yield is high enough, this will stop the stock price from falling further.

Unless the fundamentals change for a company which pays a dividend that threatens the dividend, there is a limit to how fall the shares will fall because the dividend yield becomes more attractive."

You also read the quarterly reports from their local competition, McSnacky. McSnacky also made $1 million in profits and they decided they will give a small bonus to the CEO and CFO and invest $900,000 in expanding the restaurant so they can serve more people and increase the profits next year. They expect profits from the next quarter to be the same, but by next year the expansion will be finished and profits should increase to $1.2 million.

In some cases the buyback would have reduced the perceived value of the company(the same with dividends) and then no growth would occur. When dividends are payed out the assets also fall which may often result in a drop in stock.

But if you assume that there is a given value to a company both methods will result in the same result but with taxation being deferred on asset sales as buybacks result in growth rather than cash.

They are essentially the same but there are perceptive differences and taxation differences.

Of course the perceptive differences are important since many investors now are not entirely rational, but that’s a whole different issue"
6/26/2021 22:32,stocks,"This may be the case but a reverse split

When companies do a cash buy back of the stock it is because there was no better place to put that capital and so it is returned to shareholders increasing the amount of the company each share represents. it is a return of capital to shareholders for those shares.

In a reverse split the company just waves a pen and devalues the shares by the reverse amount. Often this is done to prepare for later capital raises, to reduce share count, raise the price to meet listing requirements.

A stock is a part ownership of the company. If said company were to reinvest the profits, it simply means they buy more stuff that will result to more profits. An example is Amazon Game Studios. They probably bought hardware, servers, a new place to put the department in and much, much more. That also means that your share is now worth more.

My entire point, yet again, is that dividend stocks offer absolutely no financial advantage over non-div stocks.

In practice neither should result in any value generation(with dividends the stock price should fall the amount of assets that have been released, while with buybacks the value should remain constant).

The issue of do Dividends provide value is worth discussing, but you have to account for the time value of money.  Which is exactly what makes the dividend in hand valuable. That's the only way to remove the Time Value of Money factor b/c obviusly the dividend is in your hand today.

You can't really generalize about do dividends add or destroy value. It totally depends on what's going on wiht the company.. what kind of growth they expect and if they have better investment opportunities with which to invest those funds (creating future dividends).

>I don't understand this bit about carving out a portion of the stock.  How do you do that exactly? That makes no sense?  Where are you allowed to sell your proportionate amount of the stock?

Ok.  Lets run a controlled example.  Assume you have 10,000 invested in 2 companies X and Y.  X pays a 10% div, and Y does not.  Now lets assume there is no trading going on, no financial news, nothing to effect share price and the companies are wholly equals.

Company X pays a 10% div.  You have $1k in your pocket and now have $9k invested due to the dividend readjustment.

Company Y doesn't pay a dividend, so you instead choose to sell off 10% of your holdings.  You now have $1k in your pocket and $9k invested.

You now have the exact same amount invested in both stocks, even though X paid you a dividend and you chose to replicate that scenario in non-div Y.

&#x200B;

>So you've done the exact same thing.  What's your point.

That is my point.  That dividends do not offer an advantage over traditional stocks.  Im not saying that **I want** to do this.  Id rather hold my stock and see the financials increase valuation until I'm ready to sell on my own terms.  Not received forced payouts throughout the year.

Couldn't agree more with that statement.  Theres a lot that influences a stock price beyond whether or not they offer a dividend and we all certainly have different reasons for our investment strategy.

Not really. It's no different than owning your own company. Say you start a real estate investing company. You buy a rental home and gets some tenants. The home goes up in value or you are able to raise rent. The intrinsic value/expected returns of the company has increased and you can sell it for more. I.e. the stock price goes up.

You can take the profit from this company and pay yourself ""dividends"" or you can reinvest it into other properties to make more money. The latter is what BH does and the company's expected returns continues to rise if they do well.

> Right but why do the stockholders think the price will rise? 

Because BH continues grows its business to become more and more profitable (expected returns). Buying stock gives you a right to that profit either in the form of dividends, buybacks, or sale of the company. If the company keeps growing, that right to profit (aka stock) similarly grows."

YOu have a lot to learn but speak with total confidence, which will be your downfall and is 100% typical of Reddit.

Edit: i did glance and your controlled example and it's just totally flawed and makes no sense. YOu're not accompishing what you think you are. I'm not sure you really understand how stocks are valued or what that value represents.  You're obviously not in finance.  I am and have specialized in one thing since i left school: valuation.  I've done probably the deepest dive into Dividend Capture I've seen outside of the universities. I know what i'm talking about and tell you what, I'll dive back into dividends and you and I can together watch for companies paying dividends and cases where the stock actually increases, not decreases.

From: [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/091015/how-dividends-affect-stock-prices.asp):

""When a corporation declares a dividend, it debits its retained earnings and credits a liability called dividend payable. On the date of payment, the company reverses the dividend payable with a debit entry and credits its cash account for the respective cash outflow.

Cash dividends do not affect a company's income statement. However, they shrink a company's shareholder's equity and cash balance by the same amount.""

I'll bold that last part for you since you maybe ""didn't read it in entirety"" again.

**""However, they shrink a company's shareholder's equity and cash balance by the same amount.""**

Sure.  Sometimes stock prices do rise on the dividend date.  That could be due to a multitude of reasons... but its not due to the dividend payout itself.

So, I'm fine with you not having even a basic understanding of the investing strategy you're arguing with me about.  I mean, we aren't born knowing this stuff.  I'm even fine with you being aggressive in your stance... its likely due to your own confirmation bias via how you build your portfolio.

6/27/2021 1:38,stocks,"I don’t understand what your point is then. I am not sure what part is your misunderstanding.

What part about the valuation of a company are you confused by? I don’t understand how this chain of comments supports that buying companies are akin to buying baseball cards or like the supply and demand of the public’s favourite colour of carpet driving up the price for specific colours over the other.

If you buy shares of a company, you technically have your right to tell the company what to do within your voting rights (if you buy as a retail investor, your say in a company like Amazon is like a drop of water in the ocean). As you mentioned, if investors perceive that money can be better reinvested, then they will not pay out to shareholders. If they alternatively want to give back to shareholders, maybe they will use buybacks which gives back to investors akin to a dividend.

If investors wanted to, they could sell everything within the company and pay it out to the owners of the company as a dividend. This is known as an adjusted asset valuation of a company and is seen as the floor value for the valuation of the company. To really simplify this, if the only assets and liabilities Apple had were cash of $200 Billion and debt of $135 billion, then you could value Apple at $65 billion as a floor value, because if you liquidated everything today and paid off all debt, owners would receive a $65 billion dollar dividend.

If apples earnings increases the amount of assets that “can be liquidated” by $10 billion every year, then why wouldn’t you increase the value of your company by this amount regardless of whether you pay it out as a dividend or not?

Aside from this, overvaluation over short periods of time eg 1 year do not trump company valuations, and this can take into several other macroeconomic factors"

Stock is ownership. It’s not theoretical. Yes, if you have one share, you have no power over the company. But what you are doing is riding it’s success, or failure. Despite your lack of power, you still benefit if the company grows and expands and is worth more. If you bought Amazon when it was an online bookstore, or bought Apple when it was a struggling personal computer company, or bought Google when it was a search engine, and you held on, then that piece of company ownership that you bought back then in the single or double digits is now worth several hundred times more.

How does my answer not answer this question?

Ultimately, if you want to believe a stock has no intrinsic value, you can believe that, but it’s not correct. A stock has value because it is ownership of a company that has value. If you own one stock of Amazon, no, you’re not Jeff Bezos, but you own 1/504,320,000 of his company. And if you divide the value of Amazon by that, you get the value."

If you have $500 in a locked safe and you don't know how to open it, how much is it worth?  OP is asking about how much that safe is worth when nobody is paying them to hold it, and when the person with the key won't let them turn it in for the cash.

What does it mean to be entitled to something that cannot be redeemed except on an open market?  What is the logical end to that?"

There is. Selling the stock."
6/26/2021 22:11,stocks,"No, you get the market worth when you sell the stock.  The market worth cannot decouple the extrinsic and intrinsic value.  You can run any number of intrinsic value calculations, and market speculation can be such that the price you get still falls below that.  There is no speculation independent way of recovering your slice of the company, you can only get the market value and not necessarily the ""intrinsic"" value (unless you start muddying the waters and mixing the two such that you define intrinsic value partially by market expectations and other extrinsics).

I don't know what else to say.  No sense belaboring it any longer, though.  I know what you're saying, thanks for the discussion."
6/27/2021 1:46,stocks,"> There is no speculation independent way of recovering your slice of the company

So let me get this straight. Instead of selling your stock (the slice of the company that you own) for the market price, you want some mechanism to exist where you can “redeem” it for what you believe is the true value of the company—which according to you, is less than market price?

I mean, you could do this and set a limit sell for far under the market price and it would be immediately filled. But why would anyone do that?

I’m not sure it’s worth having this conversation anymore."
6/27/2021 8:02,stocks,"I don't ""want"" the mechanism to exist, this whole time has been about answering OP's question about intrinsic value.  We have ways to calculate intrinsic value based on what we think it should be, but that's purely ephemeral, while I understood OP to be questioning how the underpinnings of the simplified theories that you mentioned are justified.  We can say we're literally entitled to part of the company, bit unless there's literally a way to get it, the shares actually only have speculative value only, which is a bit circular and reminiscent of a Ponzi scheme.

My answer is just that all of the value in a share is derived from an expectation and anticipation of an event or aforementioned mechanism being in place which eventually liquidates the value of the company, or provides some element of control.  That's the driver behind calculations of intrinsic value, but the share holds none without them.  Maybe my answer is pedantic, but I believe it addresses what OP is asking, just like the other folks in this thread who are going below skin deep DCF and other Econ 101 definitions.

Basically, given our need for continuous production at certain times, we are no where near practical capacity on solar so there is absolutely no need for nuclear at this point. What does practical solar capacity mean? Basically I define it as the amount of energy that we can practically use during sun hours. Until we have enough solar just to cover that, it makes no sense to build anything else. Once this practical limit has been reached, then its time to look at options but this wont happen for a while. Possible not in a decade.

And to make matters worse for nuclear, the price of solar and batteries is still in free fall. Battery prices have declined more than 50% in the last 5 alone, with no end in site. Odds are, we will see another 50% haircut, if not more, in 10 years just from scale alone. And its highly likely we will have a few breakthroughs before then as well.

Which basically means its game over for uranium. It served its purpose but the end is coming. The articles you are reading are probably by doofuses trying to unload their crap. Kind of like how the Saudis sold a huge % of Aramco recently knowing full well that the end is coming.

If you want to play tangent, there will be tons of surplus energy in 20 years, worldwide. Tons will get grounded. A smart person might reroute that waste to produce an easy to make long term fuel. The one that makes sense is hydrogen since you can make it fairly easily without very fancy equipment. In fact, it can probably be made at home and stored in tanks for a pretty low cost.

So in other words, the only thing that makes sense moving forward is renewables and maybe/probably hydrogen as a backup. In 20 years, most homes will simply have solar + batteries. Hydrogen will be cheap so folks will buy hydrogen burning generators as a backup. Businesses will adopt all of that even sooner and they may add wind since its also getting cheaper."

>Leveraged debt in a growing, positive cash flow company doesn't hurt the company 

But if a company stops growing or cash flow decreases, it can turn into a noose.  

>but can actually save it and help it prosper 

The money from leveraged purchases isn't typically reinvested into the company.  It's used to buy the company.  You might as well ""buy"" a house by putting no money down, taking a loan out against the value of the house, and then renting it out to pay back the loan.  

Yes, that's a smart way of doing things, but it also means that you've put nothing into actually buying the house, and if it's not profitable, you have no vested interest in keeping it afloat.  Or in keeping it in general.  

>such as in ASO's situation (using this money to open new stores, buy product in bulk, pay off other higher interest debt, etc). Debt may look scary on a balance sheet but if it puts the company in a better position to succeed long term then it was worth it.

Debt isn't scary.  Of course it can be good.  But the leveraged purchase of ASO wasn't done to give the company capital.  The purchase was leveraged so that KKR could keep their balance sheets clean by forcing the company to take on the cost of the purchase as debt.   They then used the company's assets to subsidize the purchase.  That hurts the company in the long run.  The literal billions of dollars of debt that ASO had to pay off went straight to KKR's balance sheets as profit, instead of being reinvested in ASO."

I’ve had many interest only loans but they usually start amortizing at the first reset rate.

Maybe have her look at one of those. If it’s still interest only, the outstanding principle will be equal to the initial loan amount from 14 year ago.

6/27/2021 18:05,stocks,"There isn’t a graph. It’s a much more complicated formula, loosely based on the Black-Scholes pricing model but it also is affected by things like trading volume. (Some options will be very rarely traded and when volume is super low, price discovery gets difficult and bid/ask spreads widen. Almost always this results in the retail investor getting less than they should since the other side of that trade is a market maker who doesn’t give a shit about someone’s new hobby to trade in obscure and thinly traded options.)

If you stick to high volume options, then bid/ask is pretty narrow and your execution and price discovery is almost entirely dictated by the market at large. 

And options have many aspects that factor into pricing: how far away you are from the strike price, time to maturity, implied volatility of the underlying company, how sensitive that particular option is to underlying price moves, etc…

So you can have a situation where the underlying stock goes up, but your call option goes down in price and a put option goes up. It isn’t just whether the stock price moves up or down but whether it is doing so in a way that contextually is going to move the option you bought the way you want it to go. 

It’s a complex subject but a very interesting way to trade. Best of luck to you!"

As far as servicing is concerned, yes, they can improve there. What you need to realize though is with a hyper growth company you're going to have many growing pains. How they respond over time to provide solutions such as including OTA updates while you're sleeping or preventing problems before you even know that they exist is what matters.

6/27/2021 16:17,stocks,"If you don't know what to do with stuff you shouldn't screw around with it. It's all trading stuff. If some of the companies have good long term prospects you could use it as an entry point. Or not.

I trade sometimes as well and won't get into any of these particular ones because it's not my style. Maybe the last one but like he says wait for a breakout first.

He's not doing it for you, you have to know how to handle it yourself."
6/27/2021 12:51,stocks,What's wrong with just go outside  and walk there .. air is much fresher  than your moldy basement
6/27/2021 10:58,stocks,This us wrong. You only lose ltcg if its assigned.
6/26/2021 21:57,stocks,"And retail is betting on the losing side being hedge funds heavily invested into their short positions


Obviously they could be fucked somehow but all the information shown so far has only supported the claims being made for months about certain “meme stocks”"
6/26/2021 22:11,stocks,"No it hasn't. If you have any sense of critical thinking at all you can see how the days has been cherrypicked and misrepresented. That's zero proof that Melvin didn't cover, and zero proof that RH and Citadel colluded to manipulate the stock. Just a bunch of disingenuous accusations and laughable charts that don't say what the posters say they say"
6/27/2021 17:12,stocks,"I never said it was proof that Melvin covered, in fact I didn’t even mention them specifically. All I said was that’s the theory behind why so many people are holding.


I obviously cannot provide proof for that either because these postitions were never really public but if you’d like to post me a link to a source with evidence of the short postitions being covered then fair enough, but I can’t find that anywhere."
6/26/2021 20:05,stocks,"After thinking about this a bit. I think the caveat with frequent trading is such, the money isn't technically available until settlement, and the ability to buy immediate after sale, is like using interest free margin. Margin isn't allowed in tfsa. 

I think that's how cra get you."
6/26/2021 20:07,stocks,"Lol bag holder at negative two dollars? 

There we bag holder down one hundred, and they are still holding"
6/26/2021 20:14,stocks,"It was down 12 for most of the day and another 6 for the next day. You are a bit late to the party on this post.

Ultimately I sold it for two reasons. A) I don't believe it's a hold forever or at least long term stock B) it's price is too tied to the price of crypto itself, I have enough violatilty with crypto itself.

I've never understood why being down and holding the bag seems to be a badge of honor. It's one of the reasons I'll get out completely once I can."
6/26/2021 21:13,stocks,"No, they were put through some stressful situations to see how they would react given some extreme scenarios. They needed to prove that even under duress, they would be liquid enough to still give people their money back should they need it. 
This began after the 2008 financial crisis that the banks where obviously not ready for."
6/26/2021 21:55,stocks,"Oh no I'm not disagreeing with that - that did genuinely happen. 

What I'm saying is in the fine print, it was noted that the stress test was applied to their financial positions as at October 2020. 

That would be the equivalent of taking a pregnancy test before having sex lol. (Not my own analogy)"
6/26/2021 22:02,stocks,😅 totally agree!
6/27/2021 19:17,stocks,Skilz
6/27/2021 17:00,stocks,"that... doesn't change the fact that it's not hindsight...

I mean dude, just admit you were wrong about it being hindsight. It's not that hard, and the alternative is pretty cringe"
