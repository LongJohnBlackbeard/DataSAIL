2021-05-18 19:57:14,wallstreetbets,My fear index is at a zero. I‚Äôll short the SPX by selling verticals as a hedge for my long term. As long as you know what indicators to look at and know your key levels. The fall should be no surprise and your account shouldn‚Äôt get clapped.

2021-05-18 19:54:20,wallstreetbets,They wouldn't. Dealership network and brand recognition is huge. Most small businesses with fleets have well established relationships with the local dealer of whatever brand they prefer.

2021-05-18 19:55:25,wallstreetbets,Those are not advantages to the end consumer. Wich is all that really matters when your trying to sell someone a product
2021-05-18 19:58:57,wallstreetbets,If the car can be made at a lower cost it get‚Äôs passed on to the consumer‚Ä¶ the skateboard with only 4 moving parts also means potentially less breakdowns.  I agree they might not be too evident but this concept will gain some traction

2021-05-18 19:03:02,wallstreetbets,Chinas Swine fever which wiped out a large portion of their herd is part of what has been driving this massive demand. When the second largest producer is the biggest net importer of a good that shows an unhealthy supply chain. Desperation even as Chinas buying has been accelerating especially in the last 7/8 reporting days.

2021-05-18 19:33:07,wallstreetbets,Once that happens? You mean the fact that US exports to China for next year are going parabolic. Exports are well ahead pace from 2020 which was also a record in recent years. The growing demand for ethanol and animal feed which account for the majority of corn use grows as populations grow and demand for meat and biofuel grow.

2021-05-18 19:51:16,wallstreetbets,"People are moving away from eating meat and drinking soda (which is made of corn). Factory farming is terrible for the soil, water table, the animals (they are also fed corn) and our diets. Look up how much water it takes to produce a pound of beef and you will reconsider beef consumption. Burger King has a beyond meat burger and I only see that becoming more commonplace. Ethanol was not the fossil fuel alternative the Bush administration said it would be. More EV , less fossil fuels. I see society moving away from a corn based economy and look to more sustainable alternatives heading into the future. 

This is my DD as an investor and someone who studied the environnement in college."

2021-05-18 18:17:33,wallstreetbets,"I have always been really curious about exactly what their full scam is.  If one item is 
Purchased from one of their merchants it is priced at the low low price of example $1.
Customer thinks ‚Äòwow, great don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs cheaper quality... I‚Äôm only using it to decorate for a one evening event and it‚Äôs a fraction of the competition price, then I‚Äôll dispose of it‚Äô
Ok
But but.... I need 10 of them.
No problem all ten of them are still just $1 each ($10 total)

Shipping is separate  $4 express (5 days) 
Or ($2 pony express  or life boat 10-15 days)

FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL ITEM!!! 
So 

$10 for items  and .... $40 express shipping

Anyone have any intel
Other than it‚Äôs a ripoff don‚Äôt buy from them?
I‚Äôm asking about their mktg angle and how they get away with it

I was thinking WISH must really just be a shipping company
Nothing to do with retailing 
All profits in Pkg and shipping?"

2021-05-18 19:40:50,wallstreetbets,"People underestimate the amount of trash the poors and the young buy from this place. It's a cheap valuation for a company that has already done the hard work and is on a lot of phones with billions in revenue. It'll be easier to expand to other products and create new streams of revenue in the future. For this reason I'm in..after I look at the options strip(s). It's okay to be trash, alibaba was trash and now it's still trashy but less trash. They were able to expand to all sorts of shit, even cloud computing. At ~5.5B market cap Wish is a good deal."

2021-05-18 18:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Bought some at $9, worth the risk. But wouldn't put alot of $$ in it.

2021-05-18 19:47:31,wallstreetbets,"Pre pandemic was $73 ish

Returning to the house show circuit might generate more revenue

However their Network is in decline and I don't think they'll match their TV deals in the future

Firing talent was a shitty move but financially could work out. Especially if AEW don't consider it a rivalry, and if New Japan don't attempt to invade the US market again, there's really no reason for them to take on more salary in the near future.

Interesting. Could it rise back to pre pandemic levels? Sure. Do they have enough innovation to stay there going forward? Doubtful."

2021-05-18 19:56:05,wallstreetbets,There is no easier way to get into options trading than RH. They are shady and suck but have a use and I don't see popularity slowing down anytime soon. If anything these last few months have been free publicity
2021-05-18 18:17:18,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't it moon? The ape retards are upset at RH because they don't understand the purpose of underwriters and the money it requires. Outside of a minor blip, RH has proven it leads the foray of brokerages by popularizing feeless trades and fractional shares (something that retail investors want) and is the only one that seems to understand productization. Their UX seriously blows any competitor out of the water.

It's also the easiest fucking platform to get options approved on, it's 5 Qs that you answer yes to and you get approved to level 2 options trading. That's fucking awesome.

They will absolutely make money and I will absolutely think about buying shares after they dip from the IPO."
2021-05-18 19:08:56,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm really concerned that this ultimately will be true. Sadly those assholes have more money than us and in this case if they ask Robinhood will just print more shares (secondary offering). That option was not available with GME squeeze.
2021-05-18 17:08:27,wallstreetbets,But doesn't Robinhood get the fees for that?

Never comment shit if you haven‚Äôt been here for at least 2 months. Learn the ways and then start with simple comments such as ‚Äúbull is fuk‚Äù when futures are slightly red at 6:01pm.

Remember to go hard on Palantards when their stock is crashing but stay silent if it‚Äôs 10% up.

Keep your losses a secret from family and friends, that way when you get a big win you can surprise them!  Money isn't real, so borrow as much as you need to break even.

Everyone on Twitter talking about SAVE AMERICAN BUSINESS SAVE AMERICAN MOVIES while actually investing in a Chinese company and bailing out Chinese billionaires.

2021-05-18 16:52:29,wallstreetbets,"housing prices high because demand imo, but if you can buy brand new for comparable price to ""used"" homes I think it will even out the playing field. That said, you cant do that with lumber priced like gold bars. so if you see lumber pull almost all the way back AND developers / builders turn the heat up then yes you COULD see housing prices go down.

tl;dr why buy used house when new one same price"
2021-05-18 16:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Already built housing will likely be unaffected short term. Might slightly lower the cost to build a house though. 

Even if he dropped the tariffs today it would probably take months to work it's way down to local contractors and the ultimate price you pay. Your big home builders will short term just pocket the lumber savings. 

Housing/Building housing is likely the best investment there is currently"

2021-05-18 17:05:59,wallstreetbets,Patterns predict price movement. TA is definitely not fake.
2021-05-18 17:09:16,wallstreetbets,Not that I'm some kind of TA zealot or anything but maybe try doing some reading before talking going forward lol. TA has been basically accepted as useful indicator since the 1970's
2021-05-18 17:17:45,wallstreetbets,"Then you want to go on the encyclopedia of chart patterns website, it has the systematic approach with percentage of accuracy for the pattern."
2021-05-18 17:30:07,wallstreetbets,"It just helps improve your odds, like if you find a stock trading in a range or channel you can buy off support or resistance in that pattern.

It can always break and go against you but it can help you know when to get out. For instance earlier in May  SPY  was coming up on a trendline it got rejected from multiple times for months so I was holding some puts and going small on long positions.

 I even shared it in the daily and got called retarded, but to me its like why ignore something that follows a similar pattern? Next two days it sold off. I didn't know how much it would sell off but when it started taking out moving averages I was like ohh this may be something bigger than a pull back. 

Not that I still don't have bad days but I don't have near as many or ones where I'm just crossing my fingers hoping things go in my favor. It doesn't predict the news, it cant tell you what it will do tomorrow, its just something you can combine with other factors in trading. Like driving with a road map. The map can help you get where you wanna go but the map wont tell you if you're gonna hit a traffic jam, but your awareness that its rush hour could help you with that.

Anyway I think its worth diving into, its helped me. It does take time and experience to get better with. I understand where you're coming from though. I also think TA works best for day trading and stuff like forex and banned currencies. Markets opening and closing can break patterns on shorter time frames pretty easily, though on longer ones you can start to see a pattern emerge."

The church follows what it teaches, which is to have saved an emergency fund of a certain amount of their expenses, which is an enormous number. This was heavily needed during the beginning of the pandemic, not only as relief aid, but also to take care of their missionaries. Because the church has a fund saved up, it was able to put every single missionary that was stationed in the Philippines into hotels, then they were able to charter planes and send those missionaries home.

They supply bishops store houses around the world, they constantly support relief aid. Yes, that money does go to help others, but not in the direct way you might think"

2021-05-18 19:29:08,wallstreetbets,"The plurality of gods sermon by Joseph Smith in 1844 disagrees with this notion, as do other sources in the church:

1971 New Era article:

> Not only do we know about the existence of people on other worlds; Latter-day Saints know also that people from other worlds visit the earth! Earth has been receiving visitors from outer space for years, and these visitors have been leaving highly intelligent messages for our benefit.

Also the book of Moses, chapter 1:

> there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them. And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.

Moses 7:

> And were it possible that man could number the particles of the earth, yea, millions of earths like this, it would not be a beginning to the number of thy creations

Brigham Young (via Discourses of Brigham Young):

> there never was a time when there were not Gods and worlds, and men were not passing through the same ordeals that we are now passing through. That course has been from all eternity, and it is and will be to all eternity.‚Äù

And D&C 132:

> a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever...Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting


""Mormon"" doctrine (or rather, the doctrine of Jesus Christ) is that God has created worlds without end, as have those exalted before and after him, and have populated those worlds (or for a more accurate term, those universes) with life for all eternity and will continue for all eternity."
2021-05-18 18:36:56,wallstreetbets,"Um.. It's ""doctrine"" when the leader and founderof your church claims quakers live on the moon."
2021-05-18 19:27:43,wallstreetbets, Stake President doesn't get paid either. I think pay starts at Area Seventy.
2021-05-18 19:37:46,wallstreetbets,"I can only speak about paying for missions - when I went everyone paid $400 a month. There is just no way that would have covered just me being out there. Expenses like our apartment, food, car, gas, insurance, cell phones, etc. $400 is definitely not enough for that.

Actually now that I'm thinking about it - for salaries, I saw some article in the Salt Lake Tribune saying that 89 people in the entire church had a living allowance. Definitely a lot less than they were making before but yes, there is money going to them.

I just saw it online so I'm not sure if the salary is true or not. There might be more, there might be less. But the mission expense is from my personal experience and I knew how much my expenses were there."

2021-05-18 19:48:03,wallstreetbets,"You make a very strong argument, and I'm really impressed by how much effort you've put into learning about our beliefs.

I am not disagreeing with you, but just to share the argument against it that I hear, some believe that these verses are referring to an eternal *cycle* of creation, that a world exists and progresses and its people develop themselves to the point where they, in turn, have the opportunity to create a world and be their God (I'm not saying that this is *my* personal belief per se, just that that is what some particular individuals have explained to me in the past). By this speculative idea, the timeline of creation extends ""from everlasting to everlasting,"" filled with ""millions of earths like this.""

That New Era article from 1971 isn't something that I've read before. That is very interesting to me. My initial thought when I read this was of angelic visitors to the Earth, such as when the angel Moroni visited the young Joseph Smith, Jr. Is heaven on Earth? If not, wouldn't that make angels travelers from outer space? Or when God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to Joseph in the First Vision‚Äîare they not aliens in that sense as well? Strange stuff to think about.

Make of it what you will. There are arguments for both sides. I don't think it's necessary for me to get into my stance on the matter."

2021-05-18 18:43:01,wallstreetbets,Why did the church promote the term ‚ÄúMormon‚Äù for so long then? Does god just change his mind with each prophet? Dumb policy.

2021-05-18 19:24:23,wallstreetbets,"For a self-professed  ""member of the church,"" it's pretty telling (albeit expected) that you don't even know your own religion's history. Black people weren't allowed to hold positions of power (or participate in the ordinances) because Mormonism has always taught that darker skin is bad, i.e. that dark skin is a punishment from god for sin. They literally believe(d) it was the ""Mark of Cain."" They also opposed interracial marriage and the civil rights movement entirely. Joseph Smith also referred to black people as a different ""species."" The Mormon church has a long history of white supremacy and racism. This isn't a secret."
2021-05-18 16:45:02,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not ceos that are bad. It‚Äôs worthless people. Worthless people that act intelligent enough to accept responsibilities only to fail.

They raked in gains, and didn't use the funds. 

It's an interesting read."
2021-05-18 19:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Sure if your definition of ""nothing wrong"" is finding a loophole so they aren't breaking a law.

What most people who find this gross don't like is not the legal status, but the blatant loophole use of the tax system to avoid taxes on a massive wealth fund while doing next to nothing with the money for actual charity work.  A few tens of millions per year pittance vs the billions they are rolling in.

If one doesn't find a charitable organization that is also drowning in money a moral problem, I'm afraid you moral compass is broken."

At this point, the church doesn‚Äôt need tithing at all. 10 years ago, the church didn‚Äôt need tithing at all, but the purpose is a commitment to the church. God might not care about money, but we do, and money can be used for great things like helping people out after natural disasters."
2021-05-18 18:44:29,wallstreetbets,No we referred to as Mormons because of the Book of Mormon but when people thought we were worshipping Mormon as in Mormonism we changed it because that isn‚Äôt what we wanted to construe to the world.

I've lived in communities of members that showed nothing but love and acceptance to the individuals we knew that left the church. In some other communities, though, members acted like how you're describing, and it made me really sad.

This has got me thinking. My best friend in high school was a member who ended up leaving the church some years after we graduated. We've more or less fallen out of touch (just because we've been busy with school and work and dating and everything else, *not* because of his personal decision to stop considering himself a member), but I ought to reach out to him and see whether he's doing okay.

Also, it is definitely Cain. It refers to the story in Genesis where Cain kills his brother Abel out of jealousy and gets ""marked"" or ""cursed"" by god as a result. Canaan was the name of a specific region in ancient times.

Lastly, you can't excuse blatant racism by saying ""oh things were just like that then."" That's not how it works, and 1979 was VERY late for the Mormon church to change its stance. The only reason they did so in the first place (or had a ""revelation"") was because they faced increasing pressure from the rest of society to do so and they had trouble figuring out how ""black"" people from other countries were that they were trying to proselytize to. Hardly a commendable act. Oh, and adult women still can't hold positions in the church that a 12 year old boy is considered ""qualified"" for, but I digress."
2021-05-18 18:00:13,wallstreetbets,"In some ways yes and in some ways no. 

A worthless person in power is just a reflection of a group of worthless people pacing that individual in power or a quality person allowing themselves to get hurt by someone‚Äôs worthless actions.

It‚Äôs not powerful people that are the problem. 

Worthless people CAN NOT create wealth or success EXCEPT to destroy more than was used to obtain that position. 

But people in power already know how to express self value in a way that doesn‚Äôt make them victims of worthless people. They construct environments where worthless people FAIL and extract resources out of the worthless people. 

If someone will always fail you, always lie to you, always agree to conduct themselves intelligently only to act mentally ill, just so that they can hurt a quality person and express their inner eternal worthlessness, than those people don‚Äôt deserve an afterlife of pleasure, but rather, pain. They don‚Äôt deserve to experience happiness. Or pleasure. Because they will use it to glorify the destruction of quality people. 

It‚Äôs just that many people in power are not necessarily worthless, but they hold power because of worthless people."

2021-05-18 17:21:01,wallstreetbets,I don't. And it depends on what income brackets they put that tax at. A one-time sale of your business could put you way over what you are normally making and you'd get nailed in one year with a 40% hit on something you've worked years to build.

2021-05-18 18:04:19,wallstreetbets,"The 40% is for everything over a million. Capital gains are structured in the same way as income. Everything up to a bracket is taxed in that bracket, regardless of what bracket your gain ultimately ends up in. So if it were to be passed and you sold your business for one dollar over a million, you'd only pay 40% on that one dollar. It's not great obviously, and I haven't looked at the other brackets, but it absolutely won't be 40% on the entire amount you sell for. If you're looking at multiple millions for your small business, maybe now is the time to sell just in case as then the difference would be substantial for you."
2021-05-18 18:57:26,wallstreetbets,"He bought them because he thought it was authentic.

While many things in this world revert to the mean, there's something to be said for radical moments.

Let's not forget the average cruise passenger is older than Yoda's grandpa. They just spent the last year and a half watching their fellow old folks drop like flies to COVID. They've generally been masking and getting vaccinated more than any other group.

Also, not to be too crude, but a shit ton of the target cruise demographic is now dead.

I'm sure the cruise industry has an equilibrium where it can make money. I have doubts about whether that equilibrium is in the ballpark of the pre-COVID level.

My bet is cruise looks like the world of airlines after 9/11. Not down, and not out. But definitely under major pressure. And cruise lines don't have a lot of room to cut costs and raise fees like airlines did."

2021-05-18 19:53:29,wallstreetbets,"Lmao look at the replies, i mean obviously there will be a least muslim on betting subreddit, but heres why halal important. Halal basicly means that its allowable for the muslim to consume, its clean, safe, quality, and bring postitive value to the body. Thats why weed is not halal, and tabacco is not halal(its simply because when people are overusing it, it will brings more harm than good, just like why alcohol is not halal. But for medication purpose it is allowable because it brings the positive value to the body). BUT, the most important thing here is, when the muslim body/organization(idk what mufti is in english) certified that its halal, so the muslim consumed it, as we know humans make mistake(not properly clean the utensil for example) the sin will be responsible towards them. Thats why ""halal"" is important for muslim. As long we dont know about it, we are not responsible towards the sin(obviously you need the dd first)."

2021-05-18 14:22:53,wallstreetbets,What the hal‚Äôal try it
2021-05-18 16:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Halal is basically a Halalious joke disguised as a command from God.

Keeping Kosher/Halal (which is incomplete copy of Kosher) means one virtually have nothing else to eat except nuts, fruits, and veggies.

Surprised? Go google for what is ""fit for consumption"" under ""Kashrut Law"" ...

Attention Muslims:

Here is the Holy Truth > The illiterate Muhammad pubh heard about the Jewish dietary technology from a Rabbi in Medina. Dog was added to the banned list simply becos the Allah's messenger just HATED dogs (no other reason... Hater gonna hate).

One of the good (or bad) thing is Mohd pbuh only heard about pork ... The truth is Kosher requires total abstinence from virtually every damn food on earth eg. Red Lobster, Hairy Crabs, Juicy Clams, Caviar, Tuna (any fish with shell or no scale is forbiddance ...about 95% of all sea organism?). Also the yummilicious Peking Duck, Dim Sum, Abalone (one of the most priced Chinese delicacies)... And the list can be stretched all the way to Mars and beyond.

What is Kosher?

TL:DR: Observations made by a hygiene freak Rabbi in an attempt to be more ""holy"", who eventually compiled a list of what he believes is food fit for consumption (Kosher). The list was later included in the Holy books as ""command meted out by God Almighty).

As you may be aware, the Abraham religions are basically founded on Zombism/Slavery, and something in this direction...  that no one is likely to question something they have been indoctrinated since birth. This is how we ended up with this dietary nonsense called Kosher/Halal, and the Hindus has a similar nonsensical idea for not consuming beef and yeah, producing tons of unnecessary methane gas that probably only Donald Trump see as ""invincible gold"".

I urge all Abarahamic sheeple to try Ketoism instead. The Kosher/Halal nonsense is bad for humanity... folks can't get together for meals is one such consequences.

Another criminal truth -- one will be missing out the best and the most yummy food mother nature has to offer... Why would God command you to refrain from consuming what is nutritious and yummy eg. bacon and sausages?

5) Jewish people care
6) Jain people care

you don't need certifications for each and every entity... you just need the one that encompasses the most restrictive set.

NOTE: I personally enjoy eating meat... I ask for no veggies with my meats. I personally could care less about beyond meat products (I prefer the real thing).

The problem is, unless you are cooking it at home, you can not guarantee against cross contamination by those who are preparing the foods. Did the Burger King food prep guy just finish making all the bacon burgers and was too lazy to change gloves (like do these people ever give a $hit) and then start making your Kosher Beyond Meat burger?"

Actually they (Hindus) do. Perhaps unconciously.

Not that they're prevented by the religion to refrain from consuming pork, guess they do so as a matter of culture/society (as many Indians are Muslims)?"

2021-05-18 19:13:19,wallstreetbets,Never discount retard strength lol. I'm diamond hands short on AMC as we all know how the story will end. This price run up is entirely retail driven and I can't wait to read about the loss porn when it all falls apart.
2021-05-18 14:18:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree but it seems to be pushing it like GME. I didn't think that was going back up any time soon but many waited on a dead stock and made millions. Its seems to be the next step for AMC maybe the hype will cause a buy frenzy like GME but its a long time coming. SO, I would just sit on the shares and wait, so many people wanting to get back to watching movies on the big screen; last year was a long wait for many people and some they may actually make a great earnings this coming month or two months as summer roles in. It could be already a  factor since some places are still doing online classes and work. Come summer the rest may follow. Its  a good stock for the time being but I would hold for the 20+ dollars evaluation with all the shorters getting screwed to have to pay that sum to cover. Then I would short it. The ""puts"" are in after the price rises to a ""call"" of 24 dollars by the end of August. Losing big is that bet becasue it may not even get to that. I mean a lot of people had a lot of time on their hands who were able to ""Dimond Hands"" with all the money and time they then had 2020 to work for self.

2021-05-18 15:03:49,wallstreetbets,"So much wrong with this I don't even know where to begin.

Dark pools are not illegal, and there's not any proof that it has been illegally manipulated like the cult would have you believe.

Buying at the market price is not illegal manipulation, but it *does* have an effect on the price. Massive buy orders push the price up, even if they're below the market price, because other people trying to buy are forced to either wait until that massive buy order fills, or they have to place their buy orders at a higher price if they want it filled. But buying large amounts of stock is not illegal.

As for no short squeeze ever happening when social media was involved, what do you call what happened in January? That was a short squeeze, no? Idk how you could think social media wasn't involved, unless you think Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube don't count as social media.....

I don't see how anyone can read AMC's 10Q and like the stock. If you think there's potential for a squeeze then that's one thing, but looking at the company's fundamentals for even a brief moment shows that it's complete dogshit.

But even if you think there's a squeeze potential, it gets a LOT harder when there's massive share dilution like AMC has done. They've literally quadrupled the number of shares in the past year, they just issued 43 million more, and they still have an additional 30+ million they're authorized to issue. All of that makes it easier for shorts to cover and harder for retail to buy up the float.

So it's hard for me to be jacked to the tits on this pile of shit. If you make money off of it then congrats, but I'm gonna sit this one out."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC has a business model that should weather the storm much better. This pure focus on wholesale means UWMC does not spend as much cost on the servicing and advertising necessary to sustain a large retail business like for RKT. Overall, UWMC actually has had consistently higher net income margin than RKT, currently sitting at 68% vs. 58% for RKT.

UWMC's focus on wholesaling and working entirely with brokers makes it much easier for it to pivot to home purchase originations, which Freddie Mac actually predicts will grow 16% by 2022. Home purchases are more complex than refinances and the value of using a broker shines in those cases. In fact, UWMC is already more heavy on home purchases than its competitors. In the most recent quarter, 25% of its volume came from home purchases. Furthermore, a rise in interest rates may actually benefit UWMC in that the value of the loans they generate will be higher due to the higher cash flows."

2021-05-18 14:46:05,wallstreetbets,"I like how you think RKT is only home mortgage. You‚Äôre comparing income between JUST Rocket mortgage and JUST UWMC Holdings. RKT owns intuit quickbooks, which is a highly regarded and heavily used business organization system. They also own intuit turbotax, which you‚Äôve probably used to do your own taxes because UWMC sure as fuck didn‚Äôt offer that while turbotax has and will continue to be the nations easiest and most popular tax return website.

Ever heard of Rocket home? Rocket auto? Home insurance. Auto insurance. This company has so many avenues for profit, and you want to sit here and blindly call out RKT for being subpar in comparison to UWMC, when you have absolutely no idea how their product/service lineup encapsulates the market in those areas. I‚Äôm going to get so many dislikes because nobody here cares about what‚Äôs actually good, what‚Äôs actually been working, what‚Äôs actually been turning profits, etc. Just follow what Joe Shmoe said on WSB, that‚Äôll work out great for you!

2021-05-18 12:57:37,wallstreetbets,Does the share borrowing interest rate only effect new shares borrowed or does it effect the shares shorted up until this point? So basically does the higher borrowing rate only hurt new shorts or does it hurt existing shorts as well?
2021-05-18 14:19:53,wallstreetbets,God bless

2021-05-18 13:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm from Cleveland, and maybe when we had LeBron and there was focus on the cavs it would be better for the marketing, there was constant talk about the cavs on ESPN, people cared about the cavs cause they cared about LeBron. BUT THE CAVS ARE THE WORST NBA TEAM IN THE LEAGUE NOW no one cares about Cleveland basketball right now except people in Cleveland. I'm in UWMC all the way

2021-05-18 13:10:29,wallstreetbets,"If you wanna sell a put, go ahead. Selling a call right now seems like madness. Getting 5 cents extra per share seems like madness when WSB might run away with it. 

Schwab made me cover my put and didn't allow my margin to do it, so that was lame. Had to move over 3k for my 4 contracts... Having 3k babysit my $160 from selling the puts makes me want to buy to close..."
2021-05-18 13:20:25,wallstreetbets,"its a fine play, just with limited upside.  If you sell a covered call for 9 or whatever and it squeezes way up past 9, you are still going to sell at 9"
2021-05-18 12:19:30,wallstreetbets,Just bought 125 shares. It only goes up. I like it.
2021-05-18 17:44:47,wallstreetbets,"RKT is down 22% since May 5. UWMC is up 8% from the same day.

RKT may do well in the long term, but short term UWMC is far superior."

2021-05-18 13:13:17,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure and would like to know this as well. I think it might be a little of both, similar to interest rates on home loans, that is, some shares may have been borrowed on a fixed rate for a limited term and when the term ends they need to negotiate new rates, others may have been borrowed on a floating rate."
2021-05-18 16:54:59,wallstreetbets,can do!

2021-05-18 14:00:13,wallstreetbets,Thank you. That‚Äôs really significant since it drives the old shorts out and doesn‚Äôt just prevent new ones from coming in.
2021-05-18 16:56:31,wallstreetbets,But then it went right back up.  It's got a solid support at 8.30 and resistance around 8.50-8.57
2021-05-18 15:37:29,wallstreetbets,"Not sure at what premium he got in, but he probably has a break even at $10. 

That's a 17% increase in UWMC.

Before maturity, much can happen, but the delta is 0.5.

If there is a ""squeeze"", he will cash in.  If there is ""normal"" activity, I'm not so sure.  If the stock goes up by $1 again soon, that would work out as well. 

As a counter example, a Jan 22,  6c at $3.10, with a break even at $9.10, has a delta of 0.8. If the stock goes up by $1, the option would gain more. 

From a ROI perspective, the short term OTM costs only $1, while the long term ITM costs $3.10, but there is a lot more wiggle room. 

I'm not trying to say one is always better than the other though. Just trying give counter examples."
2021-05-18 12:40:01,wallstreetbets,You are aware they have tools to track and gauge the effectiveness of their various marketing channels?
2021-05-18 17:20:56,wallstreetbets,"When it comes time to refinance and the first thing that pops into their mind is RKT then it will have paid off

Advertising is about staying in the mainstream and being known more than triggering a purchase when you see it. It's why when you go to the store and want a candy bar, you never consider Oh Henry! bars or Whatchamacallit"
2021-05-18 13:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Still I think the better play would be to set a stop a couple dollars over what you think the best case is and set it for good til close.

Still never bad to lock in profits, I just don't think selling calls when your bullish is the right answer."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"iQIYI Inc investment thesis and summary of DD Disclaimer and Risks: This is not a financial advice. Be cautious to bet against Winnie the Poohüêª. One major risk factor is the fact that BIDU owns 53.08% of IQ, and even more worrisome is that about 30% of BIDU‚Äôs revenue in 2021 stems from IQ. Whether or not China will intervene to prevent the plunge in value of its own version of Google is unknown, but is certainly a risk that should be hedged against. I‚Äôm very confident on this trade and have verified some of the more important arguments lined in the paper, but as always do your own DD and hedge appropriately.

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm here with another DD, but this time it‚Äôll be a little different than my usual options-exclusive DD. Today, IQ has just released its 2021 Q1 result. I‚Äôve seen a couple posts on iQIYI two years before and it seems to be the time to short squeeze it again. It has reached its historical low at servals data before, but it soon rebound for 5% after the financial statement is released. However, me and my team did a deep dive into IQ and I wanted to share this stock with you

&#x200B;

What is IQ?

iQIYI Inc is an online entertainment service provider in China and it is known as the ""Netflix of China"". It is valued at around 10 billion dollars currently. It is primarily engaged in providing a variety of services encompassing internet video, live broadcasting, online games, online literature, animations, e-commerce and social media platform. The company produces original video content and distributes appealing professionally-produced content, partner-generated content, and user-generated content. It also offers a diverse collection of internet video content that appeals to users from broad demographics. The company's revenue is generated from membership services and online advertising services. The company earns the majority of its revenue from China. The company is based in Beijing and is partly owned by Baidu, the ""Google of China"". It had its IPO in 2018 and is currently sitting at around $13.3 per share.

&#x200B;

How is IQ 2021 Q1 financial report?

Total revenues reached RMB8.0 billion (US$1.2 billion), representing a 4% increase from the same period in 2020 and beat the estimate of $1,180,000,000.

Membership services revenue was RMB4.3 billion (US$658.1 million), representing a 7% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the decline of our subscribing members from 118.9 million as of March 31, 2020, which was a high base due to the impact of Covid-19, to 105.3 million as of March 31, 2021. Our subscribing members grew 3.6 million quarter-on-quarter due to the strong content launch coupled with the holidays in the first quarter, during which people spent more time viewing content.

Online advertising services revenue was RMB1.9 billion (US$292.5 million), representing a 25% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the rebound of both brand-advertising budgets and the number of brand advertisers amid the macroeconomy recovery.

Content distribution revenue was RMB779.1 million (US$118.9 million), representing a 29% increase from the same period in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by more content titles we distributed to other platforms during the quarter.

Other revenues were RMB961.0 million (US$146.7 million), representing a 10% increase from the same period in 2020, primarily due to the growth of certain business lines.

Cost of revenues was RMB7.1 billion (US$1.1 billion), representing a 10% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to less content costs and bandwidth cost during the quarter. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB5.4 billion (US$829.6 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to decline of licensed content cost.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were RMB1.2 billion (US$183.3 million), representing an 8% decrease from the same period in 2020. This was primarily attribute to less provision for credit losses, which was a result of improved macroeconomic environment versus the same period last year.

Research and development expenses were RMB672.3 million (US$102.6 million), representing a 1% decrease from the same period in 2020.

Operating loss was RMB1.0 billion (US$154.8 million), compared to operating loss of RMB2.2 billion in the same period in 2020. Operating loss margin was 13%, compared to operating loss margin of 29% in the same period in 2020.

Total other expense was RMB222.4 million (US$34.0 million), compared to total other expense of RMB628.5 million during the same period of 2020. The year-over-year variance was mainly due to less foreign exchange loss.

Loss before income taxes was RMB1.2 billion (US$188.7 million), compared to loss before income taxes of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020.

Income tax expense was RMB20.6 million (US$3.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB4.8 million in the same period in 2020.

Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB1.3 billion (US$193.4 million), compared to net loss attributable to iQIYI of RMB2.9 billion in the same period in 2020. Diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS was RMB1.61 (US$0.25) for the first quarter of 2021, compared to diluted net loss attributable to iQIYI per ADS of RMB3.92 in the same period of 2020.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB13.3 billion (US$2.0 billion).

&#x200B;

Financial Guidance

For the second quarter of 2021, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB7.21 billion (US$1.10 billion) and RMB7.65 billion (US$1.17 billion), representing a 3% decrease to a 3% increase year over year. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which may be subject to change.

Price Target

If we use Netflix valuation as a benchmark. We can estimate the fair market value of IQ being at least equivalent to NFLX at 216B ($480/share). However, I personally think IQ should garner less since it main business is in China while Netflix is in America, Canada, Europe, you name it. Also, the subscription member of Netflix is about 207 million while IQ has only half of it, which is 105 million. Also, the member revenues of Netflix is about 24.7 billion, while that of IQ is only 4.3 billion. IQ has only about 18% of revenues of Netflix and so give IQ an $86/share target price. But my price target for the entire company is at least $200/share as it has half of the membership service of Netflix and it is still growing for IQ. Also, there is a large room of growth for IQ as it mainly focus on mainland nowadays but it will sure expand its business overseas"

2021-05-18 11:43:35,wallstreetbets,AMC and GME still below yesterday's close? So you're down? UWMC only one above yesterday's close? SO they're up? I don't know if this is the answer you're looking for but this is the case... maybe it will change throughout the day but you're the one that's down bud.

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to -296 (stock has a put gamma position but has been declining)

Put Wall Support: Unchanged

Call Wall Strike: Decreased to 420 (considered bearish when rolled lower)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to .91 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

# TA Notes:

* Bulls need to keep it above 415
* Look for some resistance around 417-418
* Major residences at 420
* Bears need to. hold 417-418 and then plow through 415 support
* Bullish pt: 419.29 - 420 - 421.20 - 422.71
* Bearish pt: 413.67 - 412.49 - 411 - 410

# 1D Timeframe Note

* Tested bottom range of gap fill for support.
* If it fails we may see the second half of the w-shape recovery form. We could see a few days of downside if we close below 415 IMO.

2021-05-18 15:01:41,wallstreetbets,"20 dollars is pre-covid value is it not?  You guys think AMC is fundamentally sound company of having the ability to bring in crowds of people like it was pre-covid times?  I'm not slicing one way or the other, honest question about it.

Personally I'm someone who used to always go to the movies and I just have no more taste for it, but that has more to do with holywood more than it does to do with movie theaters.  I don't live in big cities but given how much content the big companies like Disney is pushing on their online stores (Disney+ with Marvel and WB content on HBO Max) which I have been keeping up with it just seems that movie theaters as they once were would find it hard to find that market value.

I would think 15-16 sound about right with a board that has a vision for post-covid world with streaming becoming big (someone was saying instead of big theaters selling just movies doing some sort of deal with gamestop to experiences to smaller groups of people with simulated big screens of whatever kind of entertainment).

I just haven't heard what they plan to do and I don't see any movie lineup this summer that is going to pack any theaters and sell concessions like it used to.  Maybe someone can explain it to me why they think it one way or another? (I own no stock in any of the meme stocks)"

2021-05-18 15:16:34,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for your genuine interest and the question! Fundamentally, you are making a solid point. However, with the current euphoria and the crazy retail burying the stock like it‚Äôs on sale, the company has been given a card blanche on reinventing itself and they must be fucking retarded to waste it. The retail support and the genuine love for the company and the stock is a powerful driver in itself. Furthermore, couple it with the short squeeze saga and the fact the the shorts still have to cover the massive amount of shares shorted - for that even the current TA forecast and estimations are actually overly conservative."
2021-05-18 19:39:16,wallstreetbets,It's cute how new investors look at stock price comparisons out of context by ignoring the market cap. It's like a stock doing a 2:1 split. OMG price is at an all time low! lol

Edit: but seriously averaging down is the dumbest concept I‚Äôve heard in investing.

It‚Äôs still bad, but now you‚Äôve spent more to make yourself look better on paper. Why waste resources on a known bad investment when you could instead make a different good investment?"
2021-05-18 16:19:12,wallstreetbets,Sell on the way up... buy on the way down... this is not investment advice.

I had NOTHING to do w/wsb. Later found out it was somewhat because of wsb, but I had owned for about 5 weeks prior. So lucky I had logged in exactly when I did!!!"

If you originally bought in at 20, and then the price is 10, and you average down to 15, and the price goes up to 15, you are now breaking even, instead of still being down 5.
Its not a dumb concept, but you are dumb if you dont understand it. But, granted we are all dumb apes, so it goes with the territory."
2021-05-18 14:09:06,wallstreetbets,well you would probably be in the green if you averaged down at $5?

2021-05-18 15:15:20,wallstreetbets,i sold the rest at 10 and turned it into profits elsewhere

[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC)  


GOOD JOB! TAX THE SHORTS! 

The 7.50c line held strong and the stock kept the Friday gains and pushed a bit more.

UWMC is obviously picking up some steam here on Reddit with spillover into many other stock-related platforms (yahoo, twits, alpha, etc). That chatter will certainly help continue the push.

Up some change in Pre-market for what it's worth but should only get better throughout the day.

This is a powder keg ready to go as soon as the 9c's go in the money. If we can exercise at 7.50 and 9 (EXERCISE FRIDAY 5/21 IF YOU CAN FRONT THE Cash!!!).

I suggest exercising even if you are 0.01$ ITM.

The Volume 05/17 was impressive at 17M (8M average) so there is certainly upwards pressure due to buying volume.

Another 2 days like yesterday and those 9c start printing, then it is really off the races and not messing with 8,10% and instead watching a serious gap UP.

Hopes some powder was saved for the push to 9c . I will be buying a few more shares today once some other options are sold for liquidity.

Position:I am loaded up on 6/18 8c and LEAPS. I still really like UWMC long-term but this short-term profit potential is simply staggering.

UWMC looks really good for breaking 9 by Thursday, we already have the 7.50c's ready to print from the push last week, then it's TO THE MOON as those options are exercised. 9c needs to hit this week to hit 12-14 (minimum) next week.

LETS GET FUCKING PAID!

Down a few pennies in AH but it doesn't matter.  


Low volume day at less than average, I guess thatd okay since it is UP but some volume would really make it easier on all of us. 

Tomorrow,  the $8.50 resistance should be shattered with 9 close behind on Thursday.

If those 9c's get exercised and HODL, that should be all the rocket fuel we need.

Then onto next week where 10c 6/18 going ITM will ignite the highly fueled rocket.

Next stop Wendys, then the next stop Wendy's again but this time on the fucking moon!"

2021-05-18 10:41:07,wallstreetbets,Gonna need that powder to get above $9.00. Looks like the hedges put 150k shares to sell at $9 as last ditch effort to stop the squeeze.

If the 10c gets pushed ITM 5/21 that would be considerably ahead of the forecast.   


9c by 5/21 is a realistic goal for a real gap-up rocket next week. 10c would probably push it to the moon by EOD Friday."

If it gets to 12 I will unload my shares and 6/18 option for sure.   


Not sure about the LEAPS as if they get high enough (above the fundamental value for UWMC which is around 12$ IMO) Ill dump them and rebuy them after reversion to the mean.   


SO yes, I am long on UWMC but will take profits on my long positions if the price gets high enough. I will be long on UWMC again after this push/squeeze/whatever is over (depending on resting price anyway)."

I have price targets of 9 by Thursday , then 10 early next week (the 10c going ITM should ignite the rocket)

However once the rocket goes there is no way to forecast.

I would say 12-14 late next week is a good exit point but a good chance the tail end gains will be missed, if sold at 12-14.

Once the rocket ignites it will fire up fast and may fall just as quickly, impossible to really know or pretend I can make the forecast with any reasonable accuracy."

2021-05-18 14:49:44,wallstreetbets,"For me its both.

I was long on UWMC before the squeeze potential popped up.

I am not opposed to holding UWMC long (depending on the price) after this.

I was long on UWMC as my second-largest holding before the squeeze/gamma/whatever potential started and will be long on them again (once again depending on price, I am value-focused),

However, if the price rockets to $16 I won't jump back in until 10ish or so.

I feel the fundamentals justify a value of \~$12 so use that as my ""stop buying"" point. I simply will not pay more than a share is ""worth""."

https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012"
2021-05-18 15:50:59,wallstreetbets,"A call is the opposite of a put. Shorts are something different, this is an edit because as others have pointed out I am fucking retarded. You have the option to buy at the strike price on or before the call date. If the actual price goes above your strike price, you can profit one of two ways:

1. exercising the option (buying the shares at the lower price in your contract) or

2. selling the contract (let someone else who has the cash buy the shares and they essentially pay you a ""finder's fee"" for the discount your contract gives them).

For a breaking-even call, the bigger the difference between the strike price and the share price, the more valuable the contract becomes.

One caveat is that options contracts are written in increments of 100 shares, so if you can't afford to exercise, you have to sell the contract, which is less profitable but also carries less risk. (It's another artificial barrier for entry to make sure only rich fucks can do the more profitable thing, but you can make money off of them either way.)

You can also lose a lot of money on them since you do have to pay a contract fee up front. So if the contract then becomes worthless, you're still out the fee, albeit not nearly as much as if you had bought regular shares that lost equivalent value. The contract price is based on several factors, the main ones being the current price and the call date, as well as other more nebulous ones that The Invisible Hand determines based on how likely that price is to actually happen."

Clov paid out at end of April. Just a small window to profit (10 day 30% rise paid out 60% in options that's fucking TENDIES)

I don't think anyone should listen to you ever.

MVIS, CLOV, RKT, GME, AMC, UWMC all succsesses if you time them properly.

I dont think you understand how WSB works, these are high-risk high-reward short term plays.

If you want long-term hold succsess, WSB is not the place for you.

Maybe try r/stocks r/investing or r/boomer , they seem to be more your speed.  


Also, I bought at lows and its not currently low.   


Yesterday 5/17 was a RED market day, RED for mortgage niche in general yet UWMC was up 8+%

I've been following this apeshit like a smooth brain since.  Just bought my first share in gme yesterday. Fuck those rich bastards. I love gamestop. I've been buying used games there for a decade.

2021-05-18 19:11:46,wallstreetbets,$1 billion loss...it‚Äôs going to be much much more than that when we finish...the quicker they let this rip and we make our gains the less they will lose.

2021-05-18 12:30:43,wallstreetbets,"So? They haven't literally lost any money, guys. All they need to do is wait a year or two for all of you to move on to the next fad. GME has zero value outside of being a meme. It has nothing to offer and is miles behind apps like steam. Eventually, the price is going to plummet because you can't create value out of hot air alone. You eventually need some kind of product to maintain that value and GME's product is outdated, unnecessary, and nobody uses it anymore."
2021-05-18 10:00:45,wallstreetbets,I have enough money to buy 2000 more shares of AMC.  Should I be an ignorant ape?

2021-05-18 12:02:37,wallstreetbets,"Every week I buy a fair amount of puts on GME and AMC for a few simple reasons:

1) I don't believe in the fundamentals of either company, at all

2) I don't believe in the leadership of either company

3) Their current valuation is artificially inflated now on the same scale it was artificially deflated before

4) GME is capitalizing on the current trend of 'muh dumb ape luvz stonks'"

Are these transactions kept secret or are they publicly available to see? I can't imagine companies would allow such information to be publicly available.

How do people know these shorts exist? What if people are just buying and raising the price of this stock in some false belief that these shorts exist and at some point this company will be due to pay back?"

But!!! Thanks to our great DD about brokers and stuff, I found out I can pay them 10‚Ç¨ for extra hassle to make them vote on my behalf. First I was a bit lazy thinking ""naah we own the float anyways, people are going to vote like crazy"" (and GS twitter suggests they already have).

Anyways I changed my mind, I said to myself every vote counts just like you and here we go - I voted, !apevote!, and have their confirmation it will count.

Moral of the story: if you're like me don't be lazy. We know nothing until we get there - VOTE!!!"

2021-05-18 12:45:13,wallstreetbets,Just had an evil thought.  Wouldn't it be fun if it leaked that the board of GME was looking at taking the company private.  The chaos as shorts scrambled to cover while share prices soar.

2021-05-18 15:50:38,wallstreetbets,AMC has been nice to me these last few days. Sold enough shares to pay off three years of debt
2021-05-18 15:54:43,wallstreetbets,How can they still lose money since we all know they already covered their short üôÉ
2021-05-18 15:55:10,wallstreetbets,Should I keep holding or cash out on gme/amc?
2021-05-18 16:27:20,wallstreetbets,Still holding 3k of each
2021-05-18 16:30:41,wallstreetbets,This is an estimated unrealized loss. Shorting AMC and waiting to buy back in can get pricey but you can practically short GME for free. They can wait to cover
2021-05-18 17:36:26,wallstreetbets,"The price of AMC is not irrational yet.  When it gets to GME levels, say if AMC goes to 80 or so, then do an orthodox REAL short (selling AMC stock & staying away from options) at the peaks and buy 2 cover when it drops.  ""Shorting"" via PUTS is combining a short sale with a buy 2 cover at the strike price.  Reminds me of a long story about the Emperor Caligula and one of his courtiers/sycophants; if you watched ""I Claudius"" you know which one.  If GME jumps above 200 I may short it.  Shorting small lots, say 50 shs, gets treated more leniently by brokers and hedgers and maybe the regulators.  I pocketed 6300 so far on four GME shorts--which will be in 3 years a great company selling at 160 at least on fundamentals because they have good management that's debt-free now."
2021-05-18 17:52:44,wallstreetbets,Uh oh. Are we allowed to talk about this here? Don't want to upset the snowflakes. They'll go crying to the mods. I'll just be over here counting my AMC and GME tendies.

2021-05-18 09:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Well to be fair, any shorts taken out when it spiked to 330+ in March could have covered for 100+% gains a couple weeks later. So it's not like it's a terrible option for people to take moderate short positions. It just may not be a great idea to take out a giant short positions right now.

My MVIS call is currently still double digits in the red, and the MOON call I bought, since they held a bunch of MVIS, is worth exactly $1, down from the $200 I bought it for.  

BUT!  I liquidated a bit more stock that I was only light red on, and I have purchased a full share of GME, with plans to pick up more after I divest myself off the MVIS call.

Ape dumb, but stronger now."

>Ortex said short interest in AMC is currently estimated to be 18.3% of freefloat and in GME it is estimated at 21.8% of freefloat.

2021-05-18 18:58:54,wallstreetbets,"I can't imagine it is or people severely overestimated hedge funds exposure. I just posted this elsewhere here that addresses this: If the cumulative realized loss by hedge funds is only $1 billion then that's a drop in the pan and not a terrible loss. Think about how much money these funds manage. Long short equity hedge funds alone manage 175 billion. In total they managed 3.8 trillion across all types of strategies. So either the dollar exposure wasn't too high to begin with or the squeeze hasn't happened, because this 1 billion lost is nothing and is 2bps of the industry or just 57bps of just long/short equity strategies run by hedge funds"
2021-05-18 08:55:25,wallstreetbets,"I'm no expert, but my general understanding is there are two types of squeezes: short squeezes and gamma squeezes.    

A short squeeze involves buying into a stock en masse causing its price to rise, and the shorter, who has borrowed the stock with hopes the price would go down has to cover increases in expenses associated with holding the stock, or sell out at a loss. This forces the stock price up further and it becomes a snowball effect.       

My understanding is a gamma squeeze is similar, but it applies to covering options contracts where the holder is expecting the underlying stock to decrease in price.          

In most cases it's an entity that's capable of trading in huge numbers that is shorting, so they will be sticky about simply getting away from the holding because time is usually on their side. If there are equally stubborn buyers of the stock who continue to hold after it's price has increased, the shorter is screwed."

This is what is referred to as ""The Squeeze."""
2021-05-18 09:09:22,wallstreetbets,"The actual squeeze is that, investors have shorted the stock. They how the price drops and they can But them bank at a cheaper price. But the stock went up, so they holds off buying back.

As the price goes up, the short seller is pressured to buy in order to curb their losses. (A company can also forcibly close the positions if it is worried the short sellers won't be able to cover the cost of their losses, but usually this doesn't happen). 

of course, buying back shares will further increase the stock price. And as the price shoots up, other short sellers may decide to buy back before it shoots even higher, which is more buying activity increasing the stock price even more."

2021-05-18 13:15:42,wallstreetbets,Because at since point it will go down. It's not worth it's current price.

2021-05-18 13:46:40,wallstreetbets,Traditional valuations make it a good play to short.  The meme effect is not traditional.

2021-05-18 14:51:49,wallstreetbets,"If there's anything we've learned since 2008, it's that finance pros are dipshits like everyone else. They just happen to have a massive pile of cash to start from, which allows them to manipulate things (via informal generalized monopolies), which makes them seem financially smarter than the average human. The minute things get weird, they all have a collective meltdown."
2021-05-18 14:59:51,wallstreetbets,They still haven't understood the full extent of just how gloriously retarded you people are
2021-05-18 15:00:19,wallstreetbets,Because they think meme people has the same paper hands that they have.
2021-05-18 15:02:56,wallstreetbets,Because they‚Äôll probable get a bailout in the end.
2021-05-18 15:14:29,wallstreetbets,They dont like the stock
2021-05-18 15:38:10,wallstreetbets,Likely a manipulating show to show that the squeeze had occurred. So they can cover up their actual loss.

Now they can't afford to lose."

2021-05-18 16:00:33,wallstreetbets,"I don't think I understand it correctly, but surely the ones who shorted when GME was at $300, are absolutely buzzing right now? No? Also every single day I check, it's gone down more (bar today when it's gone up 0.03%), so surely anybody shorting the stock has been winning every single day for the past few weeks? I'm probably being a retard but it sounds to me like the real winners are the few who made a fuck ton from the GME boom, and the few who shorted when it was at its peak"
2021-05-18 16:26:26,wallstreetbets,It makes sense to short it when it's super high cost per share.
2021-05-18 17:19:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm betting at this point it doesn't matter anymore, they dug themselves in so deep might as well keep digging and hope to come out the other side."
2021-05-18 17:39:25,wallstreetbets,Because is almost broke.. you can hate or love short sell but there is a real financial component. We can inflate the stock price but the underlying asset is still garbage. If I open a burrito stand and go public and reddit investors buy my stocks like crazy and I get a 1 billion dollar burrito company... It's still a burrito stand with a revenue of a burrito stand.

2021-05-18 18:33:14,wallstreetbets,AMC is bankrupt and will eventually trade for 0 so it‚Äôs not a bad play at all. GME book value is seven so ‚Ä¶ the reason one shorts is there is a lot of money to be made.
2021-05-18 18:37:53,wallstreetbets,Because no one stops them.
2021-05-18 18:41:55,wallstreetbets,"Because they believe it is super overvalued (it is, that's the point) and they're waiting for people to get bored so it corrects, and they make the money they have been expecting all along.

Depends on how hard people hold, I guess. This is basically a double or nothing, ""Fuck you, apes, it's overvalued,"" bet."
2021-05-18 18:43:55,wallstreetbets,Because at some point you are all going to need to sell.
2021-05-18 18:55:42,wallstreetbets,They have no choice. They can‚Äôt cover without going broke so their only play is to continue shorting and hope people will go away. It‚Äôs not going well for them.
2021-05-18 19:22:52,wallstreetbets,"Cuz surely surely those retards won't keep buying and holding, this time right? Right?!?"
2021-05-18 19:47:35,wallstreetbets,"To try to get stocks moving, they are trying the same tactics as when shorting becuase they don't have any tool to dislodge stocks in this situation so they just keep slaming their head against the wall"
2021-05-18 10:02:06,wallstreetbets,"This is clearly not the place or time for any nuance and reasonable perspective, sir."

A lot *did* close their positions. Short interest was > 100% back in January. Those shorts lost a lot more than $1B."
2021-05-18 12:54:58,wallstreetbets,"some of them held assuming bankruptcy - some of of them had term limits , some of them have conditions for their options to be called .    IT depends on a lot of factors a few of them can hold the debt for a long time , but AMC and GME also have some options to call in on the debt they have not yet executed .   The higher their stock goes the more debt they have to call on - so these investment companies often hold or just declare bankruptcy if the debt gets too high  - the messed up part is that by going bankrupt and AMC no longer having that debt owned or unable to collect its full value their stock value goes down.   So the more of these guys that tank without paying the better it si for the other guy so  a lot of them are just trying to play  a game of who can last longer.

&#x200B;

What even worse is that they places with declare bankruptcy and open up again right away under a new name...the original licensed holder is out for x amount of years but often just get a buddy to get a new license in their name and become a high ranking board member .   They almost have a system where they can't lose because they sell their client lists to others for those sweet deals"

Plus, if you engage in high risk plays, the rich winners are just the lucky survivors.  If they weren‚Äôt lucky, they‚Äôre not in the group to be considered.

But for real there are a lot of quite wealthy people who are less wealthy than they could be because they hamper their own financial growth with the money they earned."
2021-05-18 12:46:15,wallstreetbets,"They do buy things like VTSAX. Hedge funds are meant to give access to more unique strategies so that you can diversify your portfolio performance. You usually wouldn't put more than 20% of your money into hedge funds(and 20% is still probably too much). The primary investors for hedge funds are institutions like pension plans or foundations, not  the rich.

I've met some advisors who manage some of the pensions for some large US companies and a few of them do not like the short side of hedge funds. Some hedge fund managers often short simply because they're expected to, it has a much higher rate of failure."

2021-05-18 10:50:08,wallstreetbets,"I really, really don't think this is remotely equivalent to any of the bailouts. The narratives you guys come up with to make this political are crazy. Congress is going to bail out random hedge funds over GME losses?

This is nothing like the bank or auto industry bailout situation. But it fits this weird victim narrative that's constantly pushed here..."
2021-05-18 12:41:58,wallstreetbets,No hedge fund was ever bailed out. Nor is a $930M in losses spread across the industry particularly notable.
2021-05-18 13:49:24,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds aren‚Äôt banks. They won‚Äôt get bailed out
2021-05-18 16:06:57,wallstreetbets,"Oh, get a bailout? Just get a bailout? Why don't I strap on my bailout helmet and squeeze down into a bailout cannon and fire off into bailout land, where bailouts grow on bailies?!"
2021-05-18 16:35:33,wallstreetbets,When did a hedge fund ever get bailed out with tax dollars?

2021-05-18 14:20:58,wallstreetbets,"I know it's fun to blame everything on corporate bailouts, but the government is actually in the green on bailouts due to being paid back, and earning on assets. So while it's fucked that they bail out the big guys, it's a loan, not free money.

2021-05-18 15:03:40,wallstreetbets,There isn‚Äôt enough money in the world to bail them out this time

2021-05-18 11:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Right, which is completely meaningless and was only used to make a catchy headline that they knew would explode on a sub like this.

It's essentially the equivalent of saying ""GME is up 12% in the last 5 days"". 

Okay? Does not mean they actually closed their short positions and took losses."
2021-05-18 12:36:47,wallstreetbets,"depends on who you ask. 

This article and those HF that are short will probably say this is the correct number.

Redditors are skeptical however because short reporting isn't the most accurate process and the fine for not reporting an accurate short position is not very much. So Reddit assumes the HF are lying about their short position and are just willing to pay the fine if they get caught.

Time will tell...the GME vote count should help clear up some of these questions."

Because this situation has become an international affair and if the little guys gets screwed over, the repercussions would be immense. 

The recent rule changes of the SEC, DTCC etc. are benefitting for retail investors. On the other hand the government would have more to gain, if retail investors would win, due to us paying taxes unlike them."

2021-05-18 12:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Why 'potential'? Why wouldnt they have taken the loss back in Feb? Why would they hold out, only increasing the financial damage on themselves?

The problem with this idea is that 'apes' have made their strategy *very* public. So assuming HFs have been keeping up with the meme stocks on Reddit, they would know everyone plans on holding, and that a drawn out battle would be even more devastating for them."
2021-05-18 18:55:41,wallstreetbets,"If the cumulative realized loss by hedge funds is only $1 billion then that's a drop in the pan and not a terrible loss. Think about how much money these funds manage. Long short equity hedge funds alone manage 175 billion. In total they managed 3.8 trillion across all types of strategies. So either the dollar exposure wasn't too high to begin with or the squeeze hasn't happened, because this 1 billion lost is nothing"

2021-05-18 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,Also the government is not bailing out failing hedge funds. What is this argument.
2021-05-18 14:04:52,wallstreetbets,"That's not quite accurate, IMO. The company getting bailed out already made out like bandits. The bailout is enablement. 


Imagine I go betting and bet big, raking in huge gains and banking them. If I was a regular guy I might play more conservatively, knowing that if I get hit, I'm knocked out, bankrupt, done. Instead, I know that if I somehow I get in the hole for a million and can't pay up, there's a bailout waiting for me. Yeah, maybe I have to pay it back with interest, but that's hugely outweighed by the money I'm raking in. Regular people don't have that, so they can't bet and take the risks I do, and therefore can't make the money I do. 


That's the problem with corporate bailouts. I don't care if banks who contributed to the 2008 financial crisis got bailed out for 1 trillion and paid back 1 trillion * 1.05. Having that safety net, even if they eventually need to pay for the net, is something that enables them to behave recklessly and rake in profits that aren't available to me."

2021-05-18 10:54:46,wallstreetbets,"Right, except they don‚Äôt increase the total number of shares they own or short. They probably keep similar short position count, but every time they roll it forward it costs them money to buy the contract. So, they lose money every time but not nearly as much as they would if their position was closed out by their broker in a margin call or if they simply were forced to produce the shares at the end of the contract period. 


Regardless, depending on their war chests and the performance of the rest of their positions, they could hold out for a long time. It‚Äôs a cut throat market though so if their investors decide to pull their money from the fund, things will cascade quickly. You can only underperform for so long before the fund contributors take their business elsewhere."

2021-05-18 10:43:08,wallstreetbets,"They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight."

""Too big to fail"" has some meaning for implications on the risk level in markets and appropriate use of capital, but only in pretty wonky circles.  I guess I characterized the outcry as socially oriented.

Also, I disagree that Obama ran on anti-bailout. When the crisis hit, he suspended campaign activity and he was the primary leader overseeing bailout efforts that were brought into effect under Bush at the very end of 2008."

If AMC said they were looking to expand in Asia... I'd have dumped my entire life savings in **months ago**.

But the fact remains the same.

Yall yanks chat about magic of movies, but fewer of you go now. ...

And that was during the post 2011 economy ""boom"", so to speak.

AMC brings in more revenue, but the customer watering hole is drying up. Not to mention they have no cash to purchase the theatres left behind from their competitors *who all went bankrupt*. They have no cash to transform their existing theatres. They have no cash to repair theatres. They have no cash to open new theatres. ...

And why the hell would they? Cinemas are finally shrinking, and boy was it overdue.

$10 for a ticket, on average... to watch a movie at a specific time, with strangers, in an uncomfortable seat, with limited food selection which... costs a *minimum of another $10*.

Man, there is a god damn reason that home theatres is *already an industry that is half the size of the theatre industry*. The middle and upper classes have already moved into the future.

For a one time investment I get unlimited convenience for me, my family and my friends. So what, we have to wait a teeny bit longer than other people... but wait, that's why digital industries are offering movies now.

And maybe you should listen to the fucking CEO. You aren't going to see a post pandemic boom. He, on the record, said you won't see 2019 revenue levels until 2023 AT THE EARLIEST.

That's TWO YEARS from now dude. Two years from now to have *caught up with revenue streams from 2019*."

Given business owners are always optimistic, over-estimating hiring plans is not surprising. However, reality occurs when actual *‚Äúdemand‚Äù* meets its operating cash flows.

**Currently, there is little expectation for a strongly recovering economy.**

&#x200B;

Businesses understand that the stimulus [***‚Äúpulled forward‚Äù***](https://realinvestmentadvice.com/the-problem-of-pulling-forward-sales-revenue/)

much of the current demand. **As such, they can not commit to the** ***‚Äúcosts‚Äù*** **of** ***‚Äúlong-term employment‚Äù*** **for a** ***‚Äúshort-term‚Äù*** **artificial economic boost.**

The Big Hit Is Coming

**Retail sales make up about 40% of personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which comprises roughly 70% of the GDP calculation.**¬†Each month the NFIB tracks both actual sales over the last quarter and expected sales over the next quarter. There is always a significant divergence between expectations and reality.

There are risks to assuming a strong economic and employment recovery over the next couple of quarters. The damage from the shutdown on the economy, and most importantly, small business, suggests recovery may remain elusive. Therefore **Fed will cap yields and do whatever it takes to support the economy , employment and markets.**

At the risk of repeating myself, the risk to the upside in the 30-Year yield is capped somewhere between 2.75-3.00%,

2. **Inflation will rise dramatically, and the risk is that it‚Äôll be worse than expected:**

We finally got ‚Äúofficial‚Äù confirmation in May that inflation has already begun to take off:

The headline CPI year-over-year increase at 4.2% was the highest since 2008. Energy prices rose 25% and gas prices 50%. Rising energy prices filter through to almost everything. Used car and truck prices were up 21%. Rents rose 2.1%. If you substitute home prices for rents, that number more than doubled.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1qccmij89vz61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c72ce894c8a9cddbf6a739715174d69d093229

 On top of all that, the CPI is widely understood to dramatically understate inflation, so the increases are much worse than the headline numbers. As I like to say, one just has to look at the performance of commodity futures over the past year, or go to Home Depot or the grocery store. It‚Äôs not rocket science. This will continue until the monetary and fiscal stimulus stops, small and medium-sized businesses return, and employment rises significantly. Don‚Äôt hold your breath, 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fjw00bba9vz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09d8f5b80ba4ea16d4fe02b812aa64a15ff8c3c

 

The month-over-month increases were far higher than expected, double in the case of the headline PPI. These are the prices that filter through to consumer prices over time‚Äîi.e., the CPI is likely going even higher.¬†

If that were not enough, wage inflation is on the rise, too, as employers struggle to get people off the couch who can otherwise live on their stimulus checks. Checks that are unlikely to be inflation indexed. Several States have already begun or are considering a ‚Äúreturn to work bonus‚Äù in order to get people to go back to work.

""Therefore I assume inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside .""

Conclusion and Goals :

Being optimistic about the economy and the markets currently is far more entertaining than doom and gloom. However, it is the honest assessment of the data and the underlying trends, which help protect one‚Äôs wealth longer-term.

The scenario to play out in weeks in precious Metals ;

 

Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and Gold and the metals soar.Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields.I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold & silver's monthly defined 2021 road map still intact. Q2 and Q4 belong to silver, while gold will shine in Q3. For Silver q2 /2021 my targets are 42 Usd /ozz while gold 1.900 Usd/ozz .

We also need to take into consideration that the Biden Administration is currently running wide open trying to pass another 1.9T money printing scam. The gas/energy price hikes are self inflicted due to this administrations war on fossil fuels. The new child tax credit payments are getting ready to start going out making it even harder to get people off their asses to go back to work. This administration is also running wide open trying to pass ridiculous tax hikes on businesses which will increase unemployment, prevent expansion, and incentivize companies to move out of the country. Pretty much everything this administration is doing is a recipe for disaster. Nothing they are doing makes any sense unless you are intentionally trying to cause a recession."

Therefore, I fundamentally disagree that the shortages and raw material price increases are temporary.  In addition, inflation doesn‚Äôt have to happen for gold and silver prices to soar.

2021-05-18 19:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Housing starts are already slowing down in response to higher lumber prices, meaning fewer people are paying those higher prices, relieving the price pressure. The demand is not constant - it can be delayed while waiting for supply to catch up. And wages are starting to rise to attract workers, making them better able to pay higher prices. The back and forth will be a bit bumpy, but essentially I agree with what you said except that some of the indicators showing demand easing a bit, along with overwhelmingly positive earnings prints, tell me on that scale of months to years, it will take months to resolve, not years. And that's why money has started flowing back into growth stocks the last few days."
2021-05-18 13:51:11,wallstreetbets,"And there's no way to ever pay it back... oh wait there is tho - it's called economic growth, which the printing is designed to enable. Why are you against that?"
2021-05-18 17:37:10,wallstreetbets,"In the case of 2008, banks were bailed out with over $1.5 trillion, which helped save them from those who couldn't afford to pay their debt. The money given this year to familys, $218 billion. In both cases, money was given to people, and yet it hasn't affected the numbers. CPI numbers were carried by used car sales, PPI numbers were far from special, solidifying this case, and Retail sales fell below estimates, with no change from the previous month. Also worth noting that the Fed did the exact same thing this year, as they did in 2008, lowering the Fed rate to 0%, and it clearly benefited stocks across the board to recover, and push even higher."

2021-05-18 14:30:35,wallstreetbets,"this is a child's understanding of economic behavior

if you reduce the return on capital through corporate taxation, then that cost must be made up from somewhere else in the production chain (such as lower wages) or the product price (a tax on consumers), or the capital will simply move somewhere else with a higher return. this includes intranational capital movements between sectors and industries with different risk/return profiles

im sure there are dozens of recent, reliable studies showing the effects of higher corporate taxation on wages, unit prices and so on available from a simple web search. this is only a topic of 'debate' among painfully uninformed people

the most successful welfare states have very low corporate and business tax rates because it is among the least efficient forms of taxation. putting aside the general high tax/low tax argument, you will achieve far better outcomes in terms of both tax revenues and economic perturbations by focusing taxation on income and capital gains"

One lady in particular comes to mind, magnifying her pain and symptoms 10fold around hospital staff to get the needed signatures for disability.

The majority though, IMO, are trying to get out of a hole or what not and do want to improve.

But if you were suddenly making more money by not working why the fuck would you go back.

Because you see the price of silver going up you think it's inflating, when in fact the FIAT you are using to measure it is actually the thing that is inflating.

Although precious metals do inflate, when compared to the fiat they are valued against, the inflation of them is negligible in our short life spans."
2021-05-18 14:52:34,wallstreetbets,"So a firm in your mind only starts trying to maximize profit once taxes are raised?

If there‚Äôs a way to maximize profit today, that you‚Äôre not doing simply out of laziness, your shareholders have right to sue you.

If you try to do that by bringing profits back from overseas to pay shareholders, you pay US tax rates regardless, so the absolute rate does not impact that equation as to where you should invest.

2021-05-18 15:05:07,wallstreetbets,"no, its you lol

there are consequences to the firm lowering wages or raising unit prices, but its not on the rate of return on capital, its on the volume of capital invested. they will maximize profits on a smaller share of invested capital

also, capital reduction doesnt just mean that an individual company moves investment overseas, though this is a common practice of course. the capital is most often simply returned to equity and debt holders, who then reinvest in other assets

if it goes overseas, then it only comes back as capital gains taxation. if it goes into national companies, then this is an economic distortion that costs productivity, growth and jobs. or perhaps it goes into speculative assets that are not considered investments in economic terms

clearly you are in way over your head. corporate taxation is a silly hill to die on regardless of your general view on taxation"

1. Offshoring is not a form of capital reduction, mixing these up is very misleading. 
2. Foreign earned income is taxed relative to the corporate income rate [according to this handy formula](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work), not capital gains. 

3. So you agree capital reduction has only to do with adjusting capital structure, which in the case of a rising rate means a greater tax shield from debt; this changes the capital structure to rely more on debt funding than equity, but does not impact the underlying profitability of marginal investments."

so ""government spending"" enables growth. not quite the same thing as ""government deficit spending"", which is the best economic approximation i can place for the term ""printing""

what if all that government spending was just spent or invested by taxpayers (present or future) instead?

exactly

so not only is ""government spending"" not an engine of growth, it is even less the case with ""government deficit spending"" or ""printing""

all that said, there is a place for the government provision of goods and services that are either impossible for the private sector to fill (police, courts, etc) or for which we have not yet developed an adequate private sector (infrastructure, schools, healthcare, welfare, etc). 

moreover, insofar as the government is required to spend, it should be done in a counter-cyclical fashion as best as possible help smooth the effects of the business cycle on citizens

however, the idea that we can tax and spend through government and achieve some resulting level of growth whose revenue generation justifies the initial spending is sheer fantasy

countries generally do not pay down their debt, they simply inflate it away, which is exactly what is happening right now"

MDL 2989:  IN RE: January 2021 Short Squeeze Trading Litigation.

The first known instance of the word ""meme stocks"" in the legal lexicon. Consolidated on April Fool's day, 2021.

All active MDL dockets:

[Pending MDL Dockets by MDL Number](https://www.jpml.uscourts.gov/sites/jpml/files/Pending_MDL_Dockets_By_MDL_Number-May-17-2021.pdf);

What does this mean? It means that so many people filed lawsuits, including class actions, that they had to be consolidated into a single court as to avoid duplicitous litigation; very normal these days, but also indicative that this is a big deal legally speaking. Receiving an MDL assignment is considered very prestigious for a federal judge because it takes so much personal involvement and the cases often affect many, *many* people plus the state of the law more generally.

If you read those footnotes, you can see that some judges on the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (which is 7 very qualified federal judges) have recused themselves and others have had to renounce their claims (normal for judges) against the defendants to even participate, as they would have been members of the several putative actions. Meaning: one or more judges just on this small panel were holding meme stock at the time, if not currently."

2021-05-18 09:20:47,wallstreetbets,AT&T has been going downhill ever since they got rid of the big titty girl
2021-05-18 06:30:51,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the way. Nasdaq up about 0.75%. S&P 500 and Dow about 0.3% to the good. That‚Äôs as of 0620.

This follows a day of modest losses on Wall Street. Losses narrowed into the close and apparently that has kept up overnight.

On the economic data front today, we have housing starts and building permits for April, out at 0830. Estimates call for 1.75 million new permits, roughly in line with March. The question is if we beat February‚Äôs 15-year high of 1.89 million. 

You don‚Äôt need me to tell you that this will bring more talk of inflation. That could hurt tech. I‚Äôve been active in tech shares but you‚Äôll have to listen to the audio to get that information.

Earnings today: Home Depot just beat estimates. Waiting on Macy‚Äôs and Walmart."

2021-05-18 08:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Despite high demand housing starts fell super heavy. Massively increased materials prices created shortages that have boosted prices to levels that are now stymying the construction industry. Calls on home prices? 
Lumber futures have fallen over 25% in the past week. Is this the legendary cyclical demand glut fizzling while the available supply surges? 
Possibly, but not likely. It‚Äôs more likely that people aren‚Äôt starting new projects and haven n‚Äôt been for awhile. In progress projects will pay those high prices because you end up losing money when half built stuff sits. Most summer seasons are bad for building material demand anyway, which is probably only exacerbating the drop.  I‚Äôm not bold enough to put a price on where lumber futures will stabilize, but for the sake of my calls I‚Äôm going to say. ‚ÄúSoon‚Äù. Lumber companies are making bank when the price is above 400, let alone 1700. Many will find profit margins take a significant hit when it does fall to 400 though, the extra capacity lines they bring on during periods of high demand have higher marginal costs. 

I‚Äôm still wagering these companies are fairly undervalued due to the overall high sustained demand for more housing in suburban and rural areas, especially considering supply conditions in general, and I believe the shift to remote work, and the houses people will want, is going to keep demand higher than expected for several years. 

I‚Äôm also hoping it solves gentrification in cities, but I mean hey. I‚Äôll just keep buying calls."

MGM

AMZN looking buying MGM HOLDINGS (A studio company)- NOT a public company

It is NOT MGM the casinos-Public Company

They are 2 separate  companies and have no relationship

If you buy MGM (which I own and think is a good buy) you ARE NOT getting in front of that potential sale. It is meaningless to them

It's not even easy to search for cause the casino MGM overwhelms the results

2021-05-18 07:06:57,wallstreetbets,"Daily reminder about AMC

Trading at x20 the market cap ***pre***pandemic on NO BULL NEWS.

There is no innovation, no merger, no acquisition, no new technology, no theatre construction, no theatre renovation, no plan to revive theatre interest in the USA (on a HUGE demographic decline over 10ys), no change in leadership, no replacing lost revenue streams from permanently closed theatres, no new subscription models...

Nothing.

They are changing... **nothing**.

Retail is holding some 80-90% of the shares, bullish? WRONG. There's a fundamental reason that institutions aren't *investing*, but short interest has been **increasing**.

The share price is OVER VALUE.

The company BARELY survived the pandemic, almost all of their competitors went bust. How did AMC survive? By being a valuable and irreplaceable service? 

# NO

By diluting the fuck out of the stock. Thats why, despite ALL the buying pressure behind AMC... it didn't move above the 20s. Because the fucking company took your money and said ""thanks, idiots.""

The market IS irrational. Yes. But all companies return to fundamentals *eventually*. When the AMC bubble bursts, don't be left holding the bag.

Get in quick. Get out quicker."

2021-05-18 07:19:37,wallstreetbets,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are estimated to have lost $930 million on their short positions in meme stocks GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment(AMC) over the last five trading days, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed on Tuesday.  
  
Shares in GameStop(GME), which was at the heart of the so-called ""stonks"" retail trading mania earlier this year, have risen by a third in the last one week, while shares in cinema operator AMC are up 39%.  
  
Ortex said short interest in AMC is currently estimated to be 18.3% of freefloat and in GME it is estimated at 21.8% of freefloat.  
  
Yesterday alone, short-sellers lost over $200 million each in both of those stocks, Ortex data shows. GameStop(GME) closed 13% higher at $180.6, the highest level since April 30.

2021-05-18 14:59:11,wallstreetbets,Why are you retards buying or still holding AMC? The share price is in the ball park of where it was in 2018 when the co. made $850bn EBITDA.  But the share count has been diluted 80% since then. And there is way more debt to service. And there is no way the co is making that level of EBITDA again anytime soon. It has less theatres for one. So why on earth do any of you think its a buy or a hold?

2021-05-18 11:56:02,wallstreetbets,"He could, and in fact he could be short puts, which he doesn't have to disclose on a 13F. But Burry has been pretty transparent for months about how he thinks TSLA is massively overvalued. He's never been a short term trader and probably doesn't care about 1-2 day swings after he files his 13F. I think he believes his thesis and is sticking to it."
2021-05-18 12:00:29,wallstreetbets,13f is an end of quarter report that isn't due til 45 days after the end of quarter.  Generally find managers aren't reporting right at end of quarter so no one is reacting to it because the position had over a month to change from what the 13f states.  Burry's filing was from Q1 so he did not exercise the idea of filing immediately to influence the market.

When you set up your account you will have the option to have a cash account or a margin account. Cash accounts are not subject to the PDT rule, but you have to wait for the funds to settle. Margin accounts are subject to the PDT rule but you can trade literally unlimited times per day and never have to wait for the funds to settle. This is the same across all platforms."
2021-05-18 07:14:22,wallstreetbets,A lot of people may be down in it.   But I still like and use E*TRADE.  Simple mobile app. And really good desktop platform.  Easy margin access. Also any (like 3 in 5 years) problem/questions were addressed very quickly.  Might not be the ‚Äúcool‚Äù broker but I like them.
2021-05-18 07:08:06,wallstreetbets,"They all do that unless your acct is big enough and you have margin enabled

2021-05-18 05:45:46,wallstreetbets,I thought their hbomax progress was doing really well.  I think long term its great.  Not a WSB stock though.  Going to be a slow road with dividends collected along the way.

2021-05-18 06:01:00,wallstreetbets,"I think i heard because of the cost of discovery, they will be slashing their dividend since its considered a value stock.

Also it pretty much locks ATT into the streaming content competition with disney, nflx and youtube (you can only pay for so much content) - 

same problem happened when disney bought espn in 2018 and they pretty much ate losses on not enough subscribers for what they paid for it"
2021-05-18 11:25:15,wallstreetbets,Good long term buy very long term tho
2021-05-18 06:19:35,wallstreetbets,I think they want to move the business valuation multiple to that of the streaming services. Highly competitive environment with lots of capital investment required. Not sure how this one is going to go.

2021-05-18 13:08:08,wallstreetbets,Price is going to drop because the dividend is being cut in half. So the dividend investors and boomers are probably going to sell.

2021-05-18 09:07:39,wallstreetbets,They supposedly slashed their dividend by 50%. It's probably going to freefall as income investors leave. T owners will get a slice of the new Warner/Disca company though.

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Thinking of following Dr. Burry in shorting bonds As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry‚Äôs hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Dr. Burry. I‚Äôm sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I‚Äôm posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I‚Äôm missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn‚Äôt detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I‚Äôm thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don‚Äôt think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there‚Äôs anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I‚Äôm interested in hearing other opinions on this.

POSITIONS: I have no contracts at the moment, will update if I enter into anything."

A lot of people think it could be really, really bad due to all the debt and eviction moratoriums and other shenanigans. Powell himself has said it's too early to even THINK about raising rates. Inflation is going to get a lot higher before they do anything IMO. I think it won't be until next year. If not next year, then never gonna happen & we will see hyperinflation in \~4yrs."

2021-05-18 16:18:36,wallstreetbets,At some point rates will have to go up. The question is when and how high? We will risk world reserve status on the USD eventually if the Fed keeps them low. How much more unaffordable do you want to make houses and property? The gay bear only fears a Japan of the 1980's monetary approach but I think that lessons regarding 100 year mortgages should scare the doves at the Fed.

2021-05-18 08:55:44,wallstreetbets,"This thread does a great job of arguing both sides. The problem is the system is corrupt and will be difficult to predict either way. 

Historically speaking interest rates have been raised to slow down the economy and hedge against inflation. The problem is we've been printing so much money that devaluation of the dollar is inevitable. Pair that with rising interest rates, you'll have a huge amount of inflation the likes of which we haven't seen in this country in quite some time. But based on what I've seen since January's inauguration, as inflation increases, and rates go up, the job market will get worse unemployment will rise, and what will the whole of the US government do? Print more money. It's a vicious cycle. Most on the sub are probably too young to remember the '80s, but I was born in '78. I remember waiting in lines for gas even in Texas where it was readily available. Not due to a shortage. Just really bad economics.

I agree with the short, I'm sure he's figured out the way to do it right. But if we're reading about it online we're too late to the party. There may still be some money available, but the government can prop itself up for a long time. Plus, I'm sure he figured the filing exposure into his scenario. That's something we could probably never grasp completely."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is RKT dead to WSB? Ok so I was long RKT since IPO. I recently doubled down and bought 100 option contacts for $0.64 at the most recent dip after earnings. I have 300 shares and 100 contracts call for Jan 2022 strike $33.

Is UWMC that much better that I should ditch RKT? If so please explain.

I know RKT guidance is down but 


- the P/E ratio of under 7 is extremely cheap

- They have a great current ratio

- They are profitable which is great during inflation times like now. Revenue and earnings are steady in guidance for the next two years 

- Possible addition to S&P 500

- Dominant name in the industry


This is a conversation around fundamentals. If UWMC is a pure short squeeze I understand but I think RKT is so much better than it‚Äôs valued or forecasted to perform relative to other stocks in the broader market. Also I‚Äôm not a hater I think both stocks (RKT and UWMC) can do great over the next 5 years."

2021-05-18 10:10:18,wallstreetbets,"The problem with RKT is a matter of PR.  When you become a public company also there's a certain level of push back against the market that is needed, like the ceo's of aapl and tsla but there are many others.  Jay farner is still operating rkt like its a private company where you let performance speak for itself.  When you do that, elements of the market will push you down cuz they see an opportunity.   There's no volatility to keep the bears under control and that's when you get a continued downward move on the stock.  there's a difference between the stock and the company. UWMC Matt so far seems to be learning faster that Jay.  Jay deployed a one time dividend, while Matt issued a continued quarterly.  That's smarter because that gets institutions in on the stock.  They love to buy and hold for dividends and that's what's needed to put a floor."
2021-05-18 09:03:24,wallstreetbets,"So I have written some DDs on UWMC and am a shareholder of UWM. 

So the largest problem UWM and RKT face are raising interest rates (75%+ revenue is refinance which contracts as rates rise). The mortgage market is set to contract 14% in the future. 

The difference is RKT is the market leader. So in a contracting environment it is harder for them to grow cause they are already so much of the market. 

So it is hard for me to understand why investors pick both. I think you have to try and pick the one that is gonna grow the most from here to in 3-5 years."
2021-05-18 01:20:37,wallstreetbets,"Inflation, rates will rise, and profit margins for each loan originated have greatly decreased. The refinance boom that inflated their earnings report is over. 

RKT has other issues as well, as does UWMC and they are in a pricing war now (RKT has a growing third party origination unit).

Edit: also, mortgage industry is very volatile. Seems every decade there‚Äôs a new top dog in town."

Yea I read that in the earnings call but I think profit per loan is going from 3% to 2% so even being in a pricing war I didn‚Äôt think that was too bad despite refi pull forward demand being over. Housing market is still hot AF
2021-05-18 02:37:10,wallstreetbets,Every houses in my area is being bought up for 20% over the asking price that‚Äôs fucking insane. I don‚Äôt know why the mortgage stocks are going down when the housing market is on fire right now. Even in Other states people are saying their neighborhood houses are being sold left and right over the asking prices.
2021-05-18 01:18:00,wallstreetbets,Right I agree but I was just looking at a house this weekend that got bid up 80k over asking price and 60 people line to get in so I think demand is still strong and fed said no rate increases through 2022 (if they keep their word)
2021-05-18 12:00:00,wallstreetbets,hype
2021-05-18 01:18:28,wallstreetbets,Oh yea shit is heavy
2021-05-18 08:24:20,wallstreetbets,I think in short the answer is yes to your point which is why the stocks I have traded sideways
2021-05-18 08:24:47,wallstreetbets,üòÇüòÇüòÇappreciate the advice
2021-05-18 08:28:15,wallstreetbets,interesting how come?
2021-05-18 08:01:38,wallstreetbets,pretty sure the original RKT1.0 bagholder support group was formed before January
2021-05-18 01:38:25,wallstreetbets,Yes this is all true but don‚Äôt you think this makes it a good ‚ÄúValue‚Äù play since that‚Äôs what is in? I agree def not a growth stock offering anything super unique. Instead more of a commodity that dominates an industry
2021-05-18 02:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Because I‚Äôm actually learning something because i‚Äôm a fool

but also good point lol"
2021-05-18 01:26:12,wallstreetbets,uggg can‚Äôt fight the tape

2021-05-18 10:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they are working on a variety of other revenue streams. So good for them cause they can see the problem. 

Problem is all those revenue streams are tiny in comparison to their mortgage revenue. 

So in the long view they may grow much larger, but I haven't seen anything there I would hang my hat on."
2021-05-18 01:33:07,wallstreetbets,"TPO has even lower margins than retail so not a good thing if TPO is growing faster than retail (which it is). UWM tried to make brokers sign an ultimatum to say they can‚Äôt work with RKT (and because of their market share have a class action lawsuit pending; there‚Äôs another class action too for retroactively changing early payoff policies at UWM but that‚Äôll be a 1-2mm settlement at most). Regardless, this ultimate is slightly hurting RKT as well. 

Also, housing market is hot for sellers because their homes are asking for more than their worth. But in reality there is a shortage of houses on the market, and because so many people locked interest rates so low, many are holding onto properties rather than selling even when moving or purchasing new homes."
2021-05-18 01:33:37,wallstreetbets,"The market is really expecting interest rates to rise and loans to fall. Confirmation bias kicked in when RKT reduced earnings guidance. Homes, auto, and personal will grow, but likely not enough to offset the decline in loan revenue over the next 6 months.

Other things to do with your money in the meantime and buy back later. Or just buy long dated options."
2021-05-18 01:20:25,wallstreetbets,"I work in real estate. Yeah the demand is absolutely there. I can't understand why they are not spiking right now considering everything. It's weird, but maybe investors are still moving to value plays?"
2021-05-18 01:51:21,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls at your cost basis every quarter to lighten your bags.
2021-05-18 02:28:09,wallstreetbets,PE ratio is very misleading on RKT. Look at cash flows to see why this is not value.
2021-05-18 03:12:01,wallstreetbets,"People are acting like mortgages are suddenly going to disappear lol, even if interest rates rise house prices will simply fall because people will have less buying power. It doesn‚Äôt mean mortgages will disappear."
2021-05-18 01:28:18,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-18 08:29:00,wallstreetbets,yay someone bullish I agree hoping it goes up
2021-05-18 01:20:22,wallstreetbets,My cost basis on the shares are $19. You don‚Äôt think this stock should be trading at least 14 P/E? That‚Äôs a $40 price and that‚Äôs if they do no buy backs
2021-05-18 11:59:42,wallstreetbets,I have hope they may be in competition with Zillow one day with your housing app and steal some brokers fees and take some share from Zillow if they were smart
2021-05-18 01:36:27,wallstreetbets,Wow see thank you for this. This was a good explanation of the situation broken down well. I appreciate it! I may try and hold to make some money as it gets back to support around $21 and then trim down my position if this fact pattern holds true the next few months to avoid losses if it gets stuck at support again
2021-05-18 01:40:00,wallstreetbets,I think confirmation bias is def a real thing here. Getting nervous it will be in purgatory awhile so I‚Äôll trim my options if it gets stuck at old $21 support again
2021-05-18 01:22:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info I am beyond puzzled. I feel like RKT also fits the value play on a P/E multiple basis but wall street just keeps it on the sideline for some reason. You work in loans or RE agent? I heard other people say RKT operations and technology is good from people who work in the field
2021-05-18 01:53:18,wallstreetbets,dumb question but how do you do that on fidelity
2021-05-18 02:33:23,wallstreetbets,I will first thing tm morning. Why operating cash is trending down?
2021-05-18 08:23:20,wallstreetbets,yes agreeed
2021-05-18 01:31:12,wallstreetbets,Alright bro chill out I‚Äôm not trying to sell anyone legit just asking a question to get some facts and discuss fundamentals of a stock
2021-05-18 10:35:59,wallstreetbets,"doesn't matter what the company is doing, the market will tell u what a company is worth and that's the problem.  All the fundamentals in the world isn't going to change that.  Rkt's shareholder meeting this month might be a trigger for a rally.  Lets see if Jay Farner actually does something, till then UWMC up."
2021-05-18 01:20:53,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-18 01:27:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm an agent. I've personally had no clients in my market use them so I can't really attest to their processes though. Like realtors though, there's tons of mortgage brokers too. Maybe it's close association to tech because of ""online"" mortgage is holding it back or just the overall financial market seeming just average it isn't getting any lift."
2021-05-18 02:03:10,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll first need to apply and get approved for options.   I don‚Äôt use Fidelity app. It‚Äôs pretty simple from the web site. Just click trade and select options from the drop down menu.  Read up on how options work before jumping in with both feet please.
2021-05-18 02:41:35,wallstreetbets,"They issue mortgages and finance them by issuing debt. Look at financing cash flows and long term debt growth in the balance sheet. It looks like they aren't appropriately amortizing the cost of capital to back the loans (which should probably be counted as COGS or D&A), so it shows up as higher earnings than it really is in the income statement, hence the low PE. I haven't done a deep dive on RKT to see exactly what they're doing, but it looks fishy from the cash flow statement."
2021-05-18 12:02:28,wallstreetbets,Yea per our other comments he better grow a pear fast and be like ok we‚Äôre here to f sh*t up and we‚Äôre winning big and give some solid future developments
2021-05-18 01:23:06,wallstreetbets,He needs bag holder friends
2021-05-18 01:24:57,wallstreetbets, No I‚Äôm really not at all I just want smart input into what I‚Äôm missing and if I should cut my losses before I actually have major losses
2021-05-18 01:29:01,wallstreetbets,Maybe I can see your point there. I‚Äôm hoping strong RE demand can lift them up and keep earnings in line with guidance at the very least
2021-05-18 02:05:57,wallstreetbets,I have options trading I just never wrote a contract. I started doing some reading on it thanks for the tip. I feel like an iron contour strategy may work here too but need to look more into how that works too since this stock loves to go sideways
2021-05-18 10:03:21,wallstreetbets,I just took a look I see what you‚Äôre saying especially because the largest category in investing and financing on the cash flow statement are ‚Äúother‚Äù and operating cash has been in the negative last 3 quarters
2021-05-18 01:27:31,wallstreetbets,Doubtful
2021-05-18 01:39:35,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in mortgage lending and 95% of our loans go through UWM .. I‚Äôd bet on UWM over rocket, but I haven‚Äôt looked into rocket‚Äôs financials"
2021-05-18 09:06:08,wallstreetbets,Call your broker and let them walk you through the process a few times.
2021-05-18 01:30:06,wallstreetbets,Idk what else to tell ya I‚Äôm just looking to talk to others about there thoughts not sell anyone anything
2021-05-18 01:40:59,wallstreetbets,Is this for real!? I thought RKT was the largest in terms of market share. This would be a game changer. If you peak the FS let me know what you think
2021-05-18 09:51:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-18 01:47:51,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt attest to their balance sheets, I‚Äôve yet to look that deep into the situation, but yes 95% of the time UWM has the best rates available and the processors at the brokerage I work at go through UWM. They have a great A-Z system in place for loan originators. Literally A-Z from training people with no experience in the industry through their UWM Success Track, to importing the 1003 file (loan application), to CRM System, to great wholesale rates, to everything inbetween. The CEO knows what he‚Äôs doing. It could be the Zillow of Mortgage lending in the end, in that it obtains so much power that it starts running brokers the wrong way how Zillow has done realtors. But for now it‚Äôs great so long as it keeps ultra competitive rates and easy to use systems"
2021-05-18 03:09:22,wallstreetbets,"Just bought a house a year ago initially got approved through rocket but rate was horrible, I started looking around and got a much better rate through another bank. Dude I went through worked for rocket and said they are too big and think they don‚Äôt have to compete on rates since they have the brand recognition."
2021-05-18 01:50:34,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info on this I‚Äôm definitely going to do a deeper dive myself into the weeds of their operations
2021-05-18 08:22:39,wallstreetbets,damn seems like the wrong attitude
2021-05-18 01:54:16,wallstreetbets,"Let me know if you find anything interesting. I honestly know zero about rocket, but I do know my broker owner had a meeting with us when UWM asked us to support wholesale lenders over Rocket and we chose UWM and I know hundreds of other brokers did as well. UWM isn‚Äôt perfect, they need to train their underwriters better, but from what I‚Äôve gathered, they‚Äôre the majority of independent broker‚Äôs go-to."
2021-05-18 01:55:28,wallstreetbets,"Good luck with your positions though, anything could happen! This is just what I‚Äôve gathered (I‚Äôm on the ‚Äúbrokers are better‚Äù FB page and most people on there like UWM over rocket)"
2021-05-18 02:01:46,wallstreetbets,I definitely will let you know and you let me know once you check out the FS
2021-05-18 02:02:17,wallstreetbets,Appreciate it bro best of luck to you as well and with selling homes

2021-05-18 10:36:52,wallstreetbets,I mean MGM resorts has its own reasons for being up
2021-05-18 15:30:54,wallstreetbets,"In content distribution you used to have 1 cable provider and two satellite providers.

Now those still exist, plus Disney, Amazon, Warner (HBO), Netflix, and Paramount.  So there are at least 5 serious providers vigorously competing not to mention all the smaller stuff out there.

In content creation Amazon studios is basically an after thought.  They have nothing comparable to MGM and basically this probably gives MGM more resources.

Just being big and entering unrelated markets doesn‚Äôt make you a monopoly.  A monopoly is a company with unfair levels of market share in a single market."
2021-05-18 14:49:53,wallstreetbets,How does this make Amazon a monopoly
2021-05-18 14:49:36,wallstreetbets,Looks more like a SHOP competition than AMZN lol
2021-05-18 02:30:00,wallstreetbets,At that point I wouldn‚Äôt doubt that Amazon would be tempted to buy out only fans and include it on prime streaming.

Also agreed on the different worlds viewers, but talking murica here. Boxing will never be a global powerhouse of a sport (again) without Americans jacking off to it like we did in the 20th century.  We need 6'3"" 230lb jacked monsters trying to punch the jaw out of another gorilla, with no hugging, and the speed/athleticism of a 130lb fighter to get Americans tits jacked for boxing.

130lb fighters look like 15 yo.s in the ring. Especially when you have a ref in there for a 3rd person point of reference.  Theyre tiny. Connor McGregor looks fit in the ring.. but he doesn't look like a scary human. Saying Manny Pacquiao and Mike Tyson look the same in the ring is just fucking laughably stupid.

2021-05-18 11:29:10,wallstreetbets,Tesla sucks and the disposal of the batteries for all EVs do more harm to the planet then amy gasoline or diesel driving vehicles. Also any person who uses thier influence power to sway markets for fun and games and or out of spite is wrong and all those that follow musk are sheep. A real investor will do thier own research and making thier own choices solely on thier own. Anyone who follows a man solely on the hopes of making them rich off of someone elses tweets is pathetic and probably should not be investing in the first place. Those who follow musk and his assburgers indecisive mind are nothing more than loser sheep. Musk is the puppet master and all those that follow him are the puppets and the strings that get pulled. Again its easier to be a sheep in America then it is to be an individual. My two sense im sure mad people will hate on me for this but then again i expect the sheep to defend and support Thier puppet master/herder.

2021-05-18 10:15:02,wallstreetbets,"This is a bigger game than I dare to play, so I'll just sit back and watch, but I predict that Tesla crashes and burns once they figure out Emperor Musk has no clothes and that Tesla can't exist without billions in subsidies from the U.S. taxpayers. 

His net worth will drop $160B once Tesla shares crash to a more realistic value. Tesla will either go bankrupt or he'll be forced out as a liability. 

The already extensive list of lawsuits against him will dramatically increase as tolerance for his fraud becomes unbearable. 

The board of SpaceX will force him out and start to pursue sensible business practices with their already amazing Falcon rockets instead of the idiotic ""I'm an alien!"" bubble dreams of this clown. 

He'll lash out and start attacking people to justify his failures, much like someone else has been doing a lot lately. 

The fraud of Musk is going to come crashing down."

I bought a house and two Teslas thanks to Elon, and I've been on wsb long enough to know that TBEV was going to be the next snapple. Those who study TSLA know exactly what's going on. Those who sit on the sidelines reading headlines pretending they know what the fuck they're talking about are the losers (in many ways)

Nobody working at TSLA is forced to work there. It's not a union gig. It's not state-ordered employment. It's like joining the olympics. You consciously make that decision, and know that when you apply and you know that while you're working there. These people think differently than you and are motivated by differnet things. Why you think someone *is not allowed to make that decision* is beyond me but thank fuck this is a free world."

2021-05-18 17:34:23,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen a m3 from China ? I did and it‚Äôs better build than any E class. Fremont is shit, but that gets solved soon for the US market too. And most people don‚Äôt give a damn about build quality, when they get better range, performance, efficiency, better software, ota updates, cheaper easier and better displayed DC chargers...  Ionity cost 0,79‚Ç¨/kWh in Germany Tesla is at 0,37‚Ç¨/kWh. German Dinosaurs still don‚Äôt give a damn about EVs"
2021-05-18 01:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree. Build quality is lacking. Looks wise some argue it‚Äôs nice some say it‚Äôs ugly. But definitely lacking finesse. But the tech is what makes the experience, no one is buying a Tesla because it‚Äôs the nicest car. People are buying for the experience, the AI especially is very ahead of competitions as well as the rest of the software. I think you are focusing on the wrong areas, as no one buys a Tesla thinking the build quality is good. Also I would argue that catching up with build quality is exponentially easier than catching up with software, have you seen and modern car software? They‚Äôre terrible, bmw was still using CD and lacked Bluetooth in 2010. Traditional automakers are very behind when it comes to cutting edge tech(software wise)"
2021-05-18 08:58:09,wallstreetbets,"whats easier to improve though, the tech or build quality? its a matter of time for a tesla to be as good in that regard as anyone. as long as elon keeps the hype alive and makes people 'forgive' them for that (and for now), they good.

the question is what kind of young dude you want to bet on to get more girls in the long run. ugly and smart or pretty and dumb? no brainer imo."
2021-05-18 02:42:07,wallstreetbets,"Lol what? Read up on what actually happens, these people are driving in the back seat in the recent cases."

*Exponentially* easier? You don't know shit about cars or manufacturing. The industry has been at it for over 100 years, it's not easy. You suffer from ""anything I don't understand must be simple""itis."

This post isn't intended to draw away from that, just an opportunity that I see and would like to share. This play is based on $AMCs undoubtable liftoff to $30+.

AMC READY TO FLY.

Plenty of DD has been done on AMC and why its going to take off - I'm not here to talk about that. It is coiled, has popped, and is ready to rip a new butthole in the sky.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/co13u0s3hsz61.png?width=2685&format=png&auto=webp&s=99b295c5af11bdccf9e70237aacc3be81e313bf6

$CNK is AMCs largest competitor and is in the great business we know as movie theaters. When AMC last went crazy, CNK ran up over 56% in a few days from 22-27 of January to $27+. In the past month, AMC is up over 50%. CNK is roughly even. It is lagging behind and is due for a major pop on this AMC craze. It is a classically more boring stock that takes a big nudge to move. 

**CHART**

https://preview.redd.it/o5kx7cgjisz61.png?width=2684&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b4885682006b318bee81193abdfbc1700d87a7a

Breaking out similar to AMC. Insanely strong volume shelf in low 20s (high demand) and above 1D 21MA. RSI has lots of room to run. 

**MARGIN**

CNK has a much lower implied volatility and actually allows for margin borrowing. This could be attractive depending on your risk appetite

**DILUTION/FINANCIALS**

CNK has almost no share dilution since the pandemic started, and it has been historically stronger than AMC from a traditional (retarded) financial perspective. AMCs market value growth has passed CNKs by many multiples over the past year. No reason she can't get some love.

Don't overthink it. We love this guy. Fuck you and lets make some money:

Basically they meant that they had access to doctors with a total 200K Medicare patients. But not all those patients necessarily pick CLOV.

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GME TA - BIG BREAKOUT TODAY - SETUP LOOKS BETTER THAN IT EVER HAS I don't normally play meme stocks - but I thought the GME technical setup was especially intriguing recently.

[GME TA](https://preview.redd.it/1tmj448o6sz61.png?width=2233&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de6593bb253ff2a102250d3e4a97d521e0b3455)

The setup is a symmetrical triangle. Normally when continuation patterns come from downside - they have a bearish bias. However - we broke that red trendline  with an uptick in volume - this was a hint we were ready for an actual reversal. That trendline kept us in a downtrend for about 4 months. Not only that but...

**TODAY WE BROKE THE SYMMETRICAL TRIANGLE UP - WHICH MEANS ITS FULL SPEED AHEAD!**

Confluence between technicals generate the best signals.

This is the best the setup has looked since GME was at 10. Price target for this is 231.52 resistance initially, followed by 348.50. Breakout is invalid and play is dead if we get a daily close back under 158.11.

And... that's it.

I've been trading for a long time and only use patterns, trendlines & volume. Keep it simple. You don't need to waste 100 hours doing 15 paragraphs of DD for one swing trade - or look at 100 different indicators cherry picking the ones that say your position will go up.

***TL;DR*** \- GME actually looks good for once from an **unbiased** technical standpoint

***EDIT:*** Clarification - I wasn't speaking for GME as a whole when I said it was dead under 158.11 - I simply meant this setup in particular was no longer valid. It could always form a new one. I chose that level because it's the most significant one below the breakout point.

Edit 2: Not Financial Advice (i thought that was a given)

Edit 3: It's back testing so far - really common in Technical Analysis. Price will retrace the pattern it broke from before deciding direction. Focused on the daily close to determine whether it's a fake breakout (when a stock closes back inside a pattern the candle after breaking out) - which happens.

Edit 4: Backtested - and bouncing so far.

Really important to reclaim 174.26 on the hourly close. You can see we bounced off this zone from 168.07 - 167.55 - that's key demand or support.

Edit 5: Reclaimed 174.26 - back tested that as well. Key levels are normally retraced as we move. Price wants to confirm that resistance has become a support.
Now, 174.26 must hold as support - and we are looking pretty good.

https://ibb.co/fCrq0Fb

Edit 6: Bull flagging now into lunch time, New support put up at 176.48. Constructive.

https://ibb.co/3WTR25r

Edit 7: Great breakout from that flag. New support put up at 181.50. Still need the 1:45 close for confirmation. Look at the volume on that candle - shorts trying to defend this breakout with their lives.

https://ibb.co/cFHv6W6

Edit 8: Keyboard warriors storming my DMs at open - quit trading, you are more driven by your emotions than a teenage girl.

Self proclaimed geniuses saying ""TA Doesn't Work On GME, Ban"" - it's not that TA doesn't work on GME: 
The issue is - all the TA you guys normally upvote is done by some kid who watched three YouTube videos on it the night before. I don't blame you for feeling that way though - so many of these people the past few months with the influx of retail in trading. 

Just because you don't understand something and are afraid to admit it, doesn't mean you should dismiss it.

The sheer amount of hate GME posts get on this sub is a super bullish data point honestly - insane how sentiment shifted. You guys are getting played like a fiddle. The tutes have been pushing this thing both ways the whole time and using you all as a scapegoat.

Lastly I, appreciate the people who have been messaging me with legitimate questions eager to learn. DMs are open.

Edit 9: 189.00 is the next resistance coming up - careful there. Like I said, 181.50 is the new support to hold. Still on track for my price targets. Volume is in all the right spots.

Edit 10: Backtested & we are moving again. Support is actually a zone from 182.51 - 181.50. Notice how the volume on that red candle was literally nothing compared to the prior two. Remember some resistance at 189.00 - might flag there the rest of the day.

https://ibb.co/hyj7mrf

Edit 11 [3:13 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Notice how every candle we aren't making new highs has decreased volume. Still bullish consolidation below this key 189.00 resistance. Above there, straight to 200+. Shorts going to fight for their lives this last hour. I'm watching this rising channel in yellow to dictate the near-term trend.

https://ibb.co/R634KNj

Edit 12 [3:46 P.M. 5/18/2021]: They got the close just below the uptrend. Not a great sign - but only a 15m trend so not too damning. 
We need to hold 182.51 - 181.50. They are going to try and test that now. Shorts doing everything they can to dump this thing before we close to high up.
Still garbage volume on the red candles which is encouraging. Literally no volume the last hour as we trend down.

https://ibb.co/VpDJQr0

Edit 12 [4:01 P.M. 5/18/2021]: Not an awful close - but definitely not a great one. Shorts fought hard end of day - the fuckers. They know if we break 189 they are done for. Important thing though - breakout is still intact. Also - broader market dumped hard end of day which didn't help.

Tomorrow - will be looking for 173.02 and 167.57 to hold - and looking for 182.54 to break (as well as 189.00).

https://ibb.co/5YcfNmG

Hope regardless of the end result you guys can pull some knowledge from this. Appreciate all the awards. Keep in mind this is a swing trade so could take a couple weeks to play out. Will probably move quicker since it‚Äôs GME.

Edit 13 [9:35 A.M. 5/19/2021]: Again getting dragged by the broader market. Major indexes opened -2%. Still - holding up relatively well honestly. Basically - between 182.54 - 167.57 is CHOP. It's when we break one of those that we can see the next move play out. Remember I said this is a swing - on these kinds of trades I just focus on the daily chart (and sometimes the hourly for monitoring the health of the trends).

Major point is -
- Above 167.57 (and that teal line) the breakout is still intact

2021-05-18 09:44:04,wallstreetbets,"This is sticking me odd that this person has only posted twice and has basically only commented on this post ever. Please be vigilant as his account is only 4 months old which was created around the first squeeze in January. His analysis may be right on the triangle but be careful that you don't sell early. 

Over on the GME specific threads the theory is that a small fake squeeze will be initiated and that a total unknown hedge group Glacier is being margin called as a scapegoat to make retail think they won. This small squeeze isn't the real squeeze and people should hold. The stock by itself with changing over to a e-commerce model should be valued much higher than where it currently is anyways.

I will admit I am newish to this financial game but this account being added the same time as the first GME squeeze puts some red flags up for me. Be careful who you trust and hold to the moon."

2021-05-18 07:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Tradespotting put out a 1am (local time) stream last week about a rare signal on the Historical Volatility Percentile, the last time we saw it in $GME was August 2020 and it generally preceeds a big swing in price.

That's a big tick in confluence of indicators for your TA here I think."

2021-05-18 07:42:22,wallstreetbets,I like lines and colors

I would say, though, swing trading might not be the best way to go here.  The apes own the float and that should mean a far more intense breakout might be just around the corner.  There is also a pretty hefty options chain lined up that could make for another gamma squeeze, and volume, while outrageously low for the past few weeks, has begun to pick up somewhat.  Shares only for me.  Squeeze them until they bleed out their eyeballs!"

So in order to prevent anyone in the class from becoming upset and turning into emotional refugees (and reporting me to the Diversity Dean), I am going to award everyone in the class an A+++ for the entire semester.  In addition, this will remove any stigma your classmates might feel towards you for being smarter than them.

2021-05-17 22:53:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah we could reject initially - and stall for a few days like AMC did recently - it's not uncommon for patterns to backtest

they just say it is looking good"
2021-05-18 02:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Ihm, sorry to tell you but technical analysis has nothing to do with a squeeze. There is no ta to predict a squeeze. All this posts says it‚Äôs likely to bullrun up today. Nothing about a squeeze. That might take another 5 months"

2021-05-18 03:28:38,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in an abusive relationship with this stock called WKHS. They offered me some really nice premium one time then they were assigned to me and locked me in their basement. Every so often they throw a little premium downstairs they say if I save up enough in my little basin they‚Äôll go away. But sometimes they open the door and just diarrhea at me instead of throwing me any premium. I‚Äôm hungry and scared of horses
2021-05-18 04:22:57,wallstreetbets,"GME is going to squeeze the day after I sell

I thought this was common knowledge"
2021-05-18 03:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Easiest way is to just ignore anything dates related - we really can't say for sure because of the amount of manipulation on the stock.

However, the volume etc. all points to the ""squeeze"" happening at some point - we just don't know how that's going to play out because America is such a fucking corrupt shit hole.

Simple really."
2021-05-17 22:54:38,wallstreetbets,I did AMC recently and it followed the TA perfectly. You would be surprised. It's not that the stock doesn't follow TA - it's that all the people you see do TA on here only pretend to know what they are doing. This is the first time I've seen it have a good setup since it was at 10.
2021-05-18 02:20:56,wallstreetbets,"He didn't say sell so practically makes no difference to me.  Everyday I come on here to get a dose of ""it will moon tomorrow guys!""

This post was my hit, doesn't matter if it was a photoshop I created to trick myself, whether it's real or not tells me what to do, wait/hold and sometime soon the number will be much bigger than today."

2021-05-17 23:17:51,wallstreetbets,They show volume at price levels.  There's a lot of green at low price levels because the price was around that level for a long time in 2020.

I have 29 shares this time and I'm selling in batches of 5 at different levels (sell orders already placed). If we miraculously break $300 again I will sell everything remaining except 2 shares and diamond hands them. I'm done losing unrealized gains when gme seems to have it's period every few months.

2021-05-18 10:31:23,wallstreetbets,"If only WSB was enough in itself to make GME move. 12B market cap would require extremely coordinated buying by everyone on the sub to cause a real move. This shit has been heavily manipulated both ways. 

There are many institutions ""on WSB's side"" that are taking full advantage of this to make free money & fuck over their competition (push price up). Easy for them to use retail as cover when they need to get out too. It's a dirty game so just make sure you don't get too confident and take profits when they are there."
2021-05-18 13:30:36,wallstreetbets,Just FOMOed in. Will buy more if it starts flying. Will also buy more if it dips.

2021-05-18 07:38:49,wallstreetbets,You can see how much is traded on a specific period of time. High volume gives stronger price support.
2021-05-18 08:26:44,wallstreetbets,Or you could buy more today and average down and get more tendies wen moon

2021-05-17 23:16:14,wallstreetbets,"> I'm not playing any of that squeeze fortune telling voodoo

I don't mean disrespect, but it feels like that's exactly what you're doing.  You could've drawn that flag with any of those candles and you chose the two that produced a breakout today.

Ignore the May data, pretend we're still in April, and draw the lines again.  We get a flag that should've had a big breakout already, except it didn't, because breakout flags don't matter on a heavily manipulated stock.

I don't know what that red line represents but it starts on a candle that is the result of an illegal trading halt.  That's not good data for TA.

TA doesn't matter on GME right now.  All that matters is BUY and HOLD."

I requested OP clarify the submission as well. I will happily remove my relevant comments or edit them to leave just the TA = dumb bits.

The blue-ish bar chart is basically a histogram showinf volume (x axis) v price (y-axis). The bright green horizontal lines are support/resistance, and it‚Äôs worth noting that OP does not map all support/resistance lines, but only the ones they deem ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù. Probably based on volume or number of touch points."

I trade full time and have stared at charts for thousands of hours honestly - tons of repetition. I chart 20-50 tickers a day.  I developed the personal system I use over the course of that.

 For the basics I read a ton of books. 

""Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets"" -  John J. Murphy is my favorite - reads like a textbook but it's basically the TA bible. It will teach you all the basics. I'm not a huge fan of videos - I'm a reader.

These are the things everyone skips over because of short attention spans - people too addicted to instant gratification. It‚Äôs unavoidable though - trading is a long, hard journey."

2021-05-18 02:40:06,wallstreetbets,If it wasn‚Äôt why would you invest in it? Why would you hold gme shares if everything is rigged? Because in that instance where billions are on the line they make an exception. Chose your side. But cherry picking when the market is free and when it‚Äôs manipulated is retarded
2021-05-18 00:53:36,wallstreetbets,July 16th is the next big one I believe.
2021-05-18 13:35:55,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you still. TA doesn‚Äôt just come from thin air no matter how manipulated the stock is. There are reasons why certain points were reached and reasons why certain patterns form. Those data points aren‚Äôt just spewed out for nothing. Not sure why people don‚Äôt see this or understand it.

I will say tho that GME has been manipulated to an unbelievable amount. Look at March 10th 348 to 172 in 20 minutes for example. I‚Äôve never seen a stock lose half its value in 20 minutes (95% of that Time was circuit breakers in place) it‚Äôs just unheard of like the flash crash of 2010. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I try to follow all the research I can to make my own opinion, and for that I thank you for posting this. 

What are your opinions on the cycle like nature of GME? Use reference points such as dec 20, jan 22, March 10th, feb 24-26, April 26th and so on. It‚Äôs clear there is a huge spike in volume and price on these days which I believe is from a fail to deliver cycle due to INSANE amount of puts expiring. Look at Jan 22nd 2022 GME puts. .5 strike alone has 143,000 puts, I believe 255,000 total. Also notice July 16th 2021, I believe itd 380,000 total puts for that date alone. Certainly you‚Äôve never seen something like this before right?"
2021-05-18 11:27:05,wallstreetbets,">Just stfu and go away.

Um, this thread is literally about GME. It's not obsessing to talk about GME on a GME thread. I'm bingewatching Netflix, redditing (doesn't take 100% of my mental capacity to roast trolls like you lol), and also tracking my various investment tickers on a separate tab. I can multitask, esp if they're simple tasks.

It **is** however, obsessing to talk anti-GME on a GME thread. That's like jealousstalking an ex ~~after she dumped you~~ it was a mutual breakup you swear."

2021-05-18 01:03:56,wallstreetbets,"Google ""GME options chain"" and you'll find some websites with charts showing the number of calls/puts expiring on a given date and at what strike price. Cycle through the dates and compare the volumes.

Here's a link the options chain via Yahoo finance. Look at the number of puts expiring OTM on July 16th. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options/"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Renewable Energy Set to Skyrocket Under Biden Administration As an avid investor, I often speak with financial advisors about where I should be putting my money. Of course, with any new administration comes a new stock set to explode and others set to fall. The financial advisors whom I have spoken with have advised me to stay away from oil and coal and to start putting more and more money into renewable energy ETFs and companies. The two stocks that they projected would gain the most are listed below. 
- FuelCell Energy (FCEL) 
- iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) 
These two are predicted to skyrocket under the Biden administration due to his push for renewable energy, especially if the Green New Deal is passed. Though they seem like big bets, I am confident in my advisors and I know that this community has never been afraid of big bets and will trust in my advisors as well."

2021-05-17 21:43:06,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree that renewables will grow under this administration but I worked in fuel cell industry back in early 2000s. While I really like the technology it hasn't really gained traction. No hydrogen infrastructure ( I would rather make hydrogen for gas turbine technology as it makes better use of it and has a further reach), it's still expensive, and is relatively unknown. I like the technology a lot, but it's still so far out there before it's really viable and green new deal will have little impact on it. Maybe I'm wrong but I've been waiting 20 years for it to do something.

Now, if you find anyone focused on hydrogen production, that Is something to look into.

Battery storage, hydrogen, wind are all going to do well. While I would like to see fuel cell technology grow, just not seeing it for quite some time."

2021-05-18 00:24:40,wallstreetbets,"If you're paying these advisors, you need to stop right now.

I guess my question is, why do you think investment in renewable energy will produce superior returns than investing in another sector of the economy like tech, consumer staples, or healthcare?

Energy producers, energy distributors, and utilities are all capital intensive, highly regulated, and have historically had middle of the road returns.

If I imagine the best, most capably managed clean energy company on earth with unlimited government backing - I just don't see it having the long term return of a company like Microsoft or even Apple."

The FED refuses to raise rates? HA! I look forward to them suppressing the price of gold and silver when people start to panic from inflation soon.

 It already started with the housing markets, thats why house price\`s shot up so high in just a few months. Its inflation not ""supply shortages"". The house you want is out there but it just cost 300k-500k. The government wants people to think everything is hyper inflating due to ""shortages"".

I live in central florida bro, I know what I am talking about. I own 3 rental properties also...and I am actively shopping for a new rental.  My rental properties each shot up around 30k-40k in JUST 6 months that is F\*\*\*ing insanity. I would not even buy these shyts I own for 220k, but that is the price they are going for now....

If you‚Äôre holding your positions at ATHs, with a lot of downside risk to the nearest support, then it‚Äôs probably time to be defensive.  Either sell, buy some cheap puts, or sell some calls against your position.   

Same with entering the trade, if you‚Äôre just popping in and buying, with little care about placement, then you‚Äôre gonna get wrecked over the long run.  

To clear, I am speaking about these concepts specifically related to intra-day and swing trading.  Al"

**Netflix has a history conducting hit jobs on struggling companies and taking their customers.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL:DR: My Thesis**

I think Netflix was secretly trying to drive these companies into the ground and hold their heads underwater with their hedgy henchmen. Their plan was within sight with the Lockdowns as both companies were hit hard. They were very close and slotted for BlockBusters fate until **we stepped in and fucked it up**. With everyone straped into their couches this last year binging tiger king how do you increase revenue? They've been trading sidways ever since. Now Netflix is fucked. The release of Cuties shot themselves in the foot (lost 800,000) viewers at such a competitive time in the streaming sector.

Karma's a bitch, just like my stepmom: Netflix has it coming, and that's why I'm not very tall and I hear they have hedges in between the Eiffel tower. *yeah you like that?*

&#x200B;

I personally just don't like Netflix as a company, and for that ***I don't like the stock***

2021-05-17 20:41:37,wallstreetbets,"This is an amazing thesis! It would be quite foreseeable that Netflix would want to expand their exclusive movie operations and is looking to take over the majority ownership in AMC through equity shares in order to do so. But... instead of purchasing those shares (like Porche did to Volkswagen back in 08') they shorted the company almost into liquidation so they could get it on the cheap. Only problem is they didn't see this squeeze coming.

I gave some thought to the GME play as well. It would also be quite foreseeable that Netflix saw the value in Gamestop's customer base as they could take over the chain with the same play stated above, and rent video games to Gamestop's customer base.

Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to waste time on a sleeping üò¥ pile of crap like amc when they can just take a tiny tiny tiny fraction of capital and do it themselves better. They would renovate them anyways. Easier to build and depreciate. 

They have a mail business but games are more aggressively going digital. Better served to allow gme to operate but purchase game makers and rights so you control profit funnel from top down. Then they can restrict games to digital only removing the need for gme and the high cost of physical distribution. 

Amc is better served partnering with gme to host gaming events.....it would actually fill the seats.  Basically amc‚Äôs become gme but the New gme hosts, sells, allows you to play all in one."

Gamestop is currently no threat to them. AMC is a juggernaut that they cannot compete with. It would make no real sense for them to do this.

Spoilers: >! The MC nearly murdered another girl by shoving her into water and then doing nothing but watching as she comes close to drowning then goes to take her place on the team at a dance competition that she, the MC, pushed for the group to join before she got kicked out of the group for over exposing herself. The team performs a raunchy dance and the MC bails before the judgment for . . . reasons? She goes back home to where a traditional family wedding is being prepared then bails on that because . . . uh, she hates her family?  Kind of seemed like a theme at times before.  So then the movie ends with the MC, who has done ZILTCH to remotely redeem herself for anything she's done in the entire movie, and she's been a corrupting influence generally, suddenly decides to act like a kid and go skip rope for an esoteric happy ending that just seems like some bizzare delusion.  Hell, I half expected a full bore ""Saint Elsewhere"" ending but nope!  It wasn't just a perverse movie, it was a bad movie too and frankly a complete mess narratively speaking. !<

It is not and never was some sort of pedo film. But the PC police sure jumped on it quick. I‚Äôm sure most of them didn‚Äôt watch it either. But yet it‚Äôs ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù blah blah blah.  Is there nudity? Were these filmed in public at public pageants? What‚Äôs the problem?

Also, there‚Äôs a reason it won awards. People thought it had an important message. 

Or maybe it just won them because the pedos loved it."
2021-05-17 20:50:53,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just a way of deflecting. They have no answer regarding why it‚Äôs bad. So they deflect to personal attacks or ad hominems.

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC: The Thesis on Why I'm Still In Even Though I finally Turned a Profit or Never Tell Me The Odds. It's Tendies or Guh on my options people. Hey Guys, it's me again. I think you guys may remember me, after all I wrote an extensive series of DD over a month on UWMC through its trials and tribulations, in anticipation of it's breakout moment. You might even remember my YOLO, and remembered I continuously added to it. And that I eventually upped my margin to 13.5k on it. Well, I'm here to tell you that I'm not out. I bought more calls to average down, on earnings day, and I held them when they tanked to ten cents a pop. My only regret is that I didn't buy more then. Though I threw a bit more cash into shares!

Back then, I said the Theta Beta's would regret selling those calls, and it was one of the few plays where there wouldn't be IV Crush. I was right. Their probably a little sour. Sorry chaps, you usually are the one's making money at our expense. This time it's going to have to be the other way around....

Today, I had the chance to exit my options for a 47% profit roughly. Sell calls for a chunky profit after that. I said no. You know why? Because fuck the people who shorted an extremely profitable company to 6.26 dollars, that's why. The Fear, the Uncertainty, and the Doubt people expressed to me regarding this company espoused to me because of the actions of those people gave me an aneurysm. So fuck them. We're playing Pac Man people. The CEO of UWMC is reducing the float, and increasing the percentage of the float that is sold short while increasing buying pressure. We're buying up the stock to get the price to 9-10 because people bought options for 5-10 cents and they'll be in the money quite easily. And because of the rising volume, every day the CEO is able to buy more and more shares thanks to Rule 10B. The delta on the options is low, and they will need to hedge as the price heads steadily upward on Friday. Then the Shorts are going to be squeezed even further as the market makers hedge.

So no, I won't sell my options for a 10 or a 50% profit. I'm going to sell my options at a price I damn well want to. One that compensates me for the trouble that these people have given me. And so should you.

I understand people have taken profits, but honestly, at the price point they were selling at the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. Good for them though. Next time, could you at least sell deep ITM covered calls though lmao.

And for those people on the fucking fence. You jumped onto MVIS, you jumped into GME, and AMC, and all manners of companies that are either unprofitable or make very little money. But the fucking BOOMER stock is where you hesitate the fence?! The fucking (Eyy Lmaooo) Boomer stock, giving you a 4.87% dividend? The one that, if you somehow baghold can give you 10-15% cash returns through divitendies and covered calls until you get assigned at a strike that is profitable to you? The 10-15% backboard cash that can fund all your yolo's? That's the fucking stock you hesitate on? El LMAO. The companies margins will expand hard in a few months, and it's still hugely profitable at a less than 1 percent margin so yeah. Now if you were buying at 14 fucking bucks, you're a dumb ape, but yeah.

I'm fucking going to ride my options to a fucking profit margin that compensates me for the shit they pulled, or to a GUH. No in between. The Stock Buyback middle finger is just the fucking sweetener.

Matt Daddy, and I, and all the people who everyone called bag holders are going to skull fuck the shorters harder than they skull fucked UWMC's share price. They're going to fucking Guh their way into a fucking shoebox. Fuck em. I want me tendies well cooked, a side of fries, and a foot massage. And their going to give it to me. And to all of you who bought, and are buying UWMC.

This is not financial advice, this is a layup. But seriously, i'm not a financial advisor, and you do you with your money.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Recently FDA approved their drug, but seems some big daddies (like Biogen) want to buy the company cheap, so shorted this baby up to 26% short float. (see links below for proofs). 

The Heron's drug relieves pain without opiods and they seems to want to destroy, get the company out off business or buy cheap this baby. 

Proofs:

Update: 
Since FDA approval, Northland Securities ($35 price target), Cantor Fitzgerald ($26 price target), Stifel Nicolaus ($27 price target) and Needham ($28 price target) have reissued Buy ratings on the stock of Heron Therapeutics. Cowen & Co. took the same action, but did lower its price target from $34 to $31 on the back of the FDA action Thursday.

Seems not fair. Let's kick their asses!"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wingstop ($WING) has 11% growth in Twitter followers, 3% drop in stock price after denying that their special white sauce contains human ejaculate One of the things I track is¬†[corporate Twitter followers](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/neq82c/dashboard_tracking_companies_twitter_followings/), and I came across an interesting phenomenon this week.

It's no secret that companies hire teams of people to brainstorm, draft, and send tweets, but even with the millions of dollars spent on this process it is rare for corporate twitter accounts to have big spikes in followers. Wendy's can obviously tweet some witty stuff that will get lots of likes and retweets, but this usually doesn't motivate most people to sign up for extra ads on their timeline by actually following these accounts.

Wingstop, however, cracked the code on Wednesday by denying the presence of ejaculate in their special white sauce. On Wednesday, one customer tweeted ""wingstop ranch gotta have nut in it no way it‚Äôs just that good"" to which Wingstop replied ""it's a special white sauce but it does not contain \[nut\]""

The rest of the conversation did not contain any more trade secrets on the Wingstop recipe, but it was notable in its own way.

[Twitter screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/2rmwspravqz61.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=090ca925fe321799a1934ea2edfc746480922449)

I rarely ever see companies with hundreds of thousands of followers (Wingstop has over 200k) receive over a 5% increase in Twitter followers over a week. Wingstop had a 10% gain in a matter of days.

The market seemingly reacted with disappointment to the lack of bodily fluids in the secret recipe as $WING fell 2% in the day following the exchange."
2021-05-17 21:56:56,wallstreetbets,"With so much money spent on social media teams, I question if this is an organic conversation or scripted on both sides."

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **96.02** which gives us a total value of:

2021-05-18 05:48:36,wallstreetbets,"Some thoughts going into today's trading day:

Semis getting a semi today... üçÜ

As noted TsLa is currently in a super bearish trend ,(bears and Burry are in full control), and unlikely to make any strong technical bounces (case in point: qqq up .75% and it's up a measley .25%). I expect it to consolidate in the $570ish-$600 range for now. I like short entries at $600 and love it at $620...

Fade the spikes on ü™ô, has been easy money for weeks and is still the play until it shows a reversal...

Facebook is one of the FEW tek stocks holding a clear uptrend, bullish on this and until it breaks the uptrend it's buy the dip...

NFLX chart looks worrisome and looks like $460 is in it's future...

Buy the next nice dip on GLD/SLV > showing strong uptrends...

10yr/TLT good short trade at $137.50 > bonds are gonna selloff again soon...

VXX get fooked today, pay me, expecting a 4-5% move today..."

The mind and inspiration do not perform like a light switch. If you take inspired, inventive people and constantly force them to perform mediocre tasks to meet mediocre objectives; with sufficient time, you end up with mediocre people. Once you let casual indifference replace intellectual integrity, and complacency take place of inquisitive vigor, deliberate indifference first becomes a habit, and then an ingrained character. Without proper cultivation, talent, and motivation erode quickly and once ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù becomes a collective culture, it is pretty much irreversible. Soon you won't have any potential to tap, just an army of sterile minds only interested in scavenging the next paycheck at the end of the month.

Spoiler alert.  The stock has always been a piece of shit.   March of 2019 it was trading in the $7-$8 range.  For the apes that can't math, it was a shit stick a full fucking year before corona was a thing.   

Now that we are on the back side of the pandemic just keep in mind they've diluted the piss out of the stock, it has shit fundamentals, it was probably 2 years away from going under BEFORE corona, and it that wasn't enough, their popcorn sucked and my ass stuck to their fake leather seats.

Even with all that, there's a ton of idiapes like ""omg buy the dip! Stick it to the shorts!   Dude, SHORTS will ALWAY WIN on this one.   You buy the dip and they sell the peaks.   Rinse and repeat.  The shorts want you to keep buying those dips . .lol...

-Also...I'm mostly just pissed cuz th May 28 13p's  I've been holding onto for a while are probably gonna be worthless in no small part due to the complete irrationality that AMC is some sort of Awesome opportunity no one should miss out on(...cuz' ya know...the squeeze seems to always be happening tomorrow)"

In England, for example, are now the first to make it public. They are starting to remove Huawei 5G network components and replacing it with Nokia equipment. This is the beginning of a US led effort to fuck Huawei. I've spoke other apes who believe it isn't a smart move to bet against Huawei, with the China shit and everything.. But all the info I've dug into leads to me be very fucking confident in the trajectory of how this thing will play out with Nokia's position in the center of growing 5G worldwide. And this recent action is an excellent sign. Look, it's not a goddamn meme stonk. It's not about a squeeze.

If they drop to 0.70/share they have a real floor there now. AND, they have Zero debt, became profitable, and have tons of flexibility in a wide-open market. All from taking advantage of their accidental P&D.  Likely they're still shit, but they're debt-free, 1B cash in the pocket, and profitable shit. AMC could have at least raised cash, and they chose not to. I literally think they're scuttling the ship and want a re-org of their 11B debt via chapter 11 but the tards are fucking up their plans."

Edit: He runs a charitable trust and can trade for it. He can't trade any stocks for 5 days after mentioning it on air, and the trust has to hold it for 30 days after buying. My guess is he still cares more about the ratings than about trading on a given stock."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"American National Insurance Hello fellow apes. Today we will be talking about insurance. Actually never mind i take that back, who cares about insurance anyway.

Recently been looking at stock named $ANAT. American National Insurance. They took a large hit at the beginning of covid for obvious reasons... they have a diverse portfolio of insurance policies which is counter to what other insurance companies are going for. Down below I will link some information about this company. I like doing a form of DD that lets people make their own conclusions. Fuck confirmation bias.

What does the company do? :

Up for sale and trading below price to book when M&A usually prices at a premium... I like it. I believe book value puts the shares at $250+ while it is currently trading at $147... This stock isn't a yolo for me, but hey I'm up like 15% in the last week so we doing good. They also post really high EPS and we can all love a company that makes money.... Enter at your own risk and do your own DD. I understand many of you are autistic, but I am not your care taker.

2021-05-17 22:31:23,wallstreetbets,"Everybody is different so I'm not trying to judge OP. But to me, buying COIN instead of B T C is like buying a first model TSLA instead of putting that money INTO buying the stock... Pretty much the opposite I guess."

2021-05-18 01:15:23,wallstreetbets,"People need to start thinking more in percentage. 

(510-240.35)/240.35=1.12 

So you are hoping for a 112% increase in the stock price for it to just touch your $510 strike price, not accounting for the premium you paid. 

For your lowest strike of 302.5

(302.5-240.35)/240.35=.258

You need a 25% increase from today‚Äôs AH closing price to get to the strike. 

Please think in terms of percentages.

Edit: I‚Äôm super high and though this was r/options my bad. Carry on with these."
2021-05-18 02:00:35,wallstreetbets,"COIN will very likely recover, but I doubt this happens within your expiration date. I would dump this on next best peak. If current UWMC play yields a profit, COIN will be my next play too."

2021-05-17 21:17:11,wallstreetbets,"Bought four shares at 320, may buy eight more at 200 if it sinks more. But I was always in it for a one or two decade hold."
2021-05-17 20:11:31,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt even tell him buy more calls unless he wanna lose money ! That markets been too shaky recently to even swing options . That man needa be put on some stop losses

2021-05-18 01:46:13,wallstreetbets,"Ok.    I actually figured this out a while ago.

In order to travel faster than light you pretty much have to master the whole matter to energy conversion thing.    You're not just moving a whole fuck ton of flammable stuff and lighting a match anymore.

Anyways.   Once you've got that done... you must have figured out a lot of other cool tech stuff.

So what are we good for?

Forced labor?    No way.    1 doing what?   2 they got robots.  3.  We kinda suck.   Were fragile and complain a lot.

Resources... nope.   Matter to energy... they don't need gold or oil.   They flew here.   They got resources pretty much figured out.

Food?   Nope.   The food we eat doesn't make us healthy... I doubt they would wanna eat us.


Whats the one thing every body who gets abducted says?    Butt stuff. Or maybe they call it probing to keep some dignity,  but we all know it's butt stuff.  That's all we're good for.   Picture some hill billies sticking a fire cracker in a frogs butt.   Now make that hill Billy shorter.. with big eyes and grey.     Lose the pick up truck and add a space ships. We are the frogs..  The aliens that visit here are the hill billies of the universe coming here for butt stuff.

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UiPath - How lack of enough available shares can cause an artificial short squeeze UiPath is a software company for robotic process automation. Their software monitors user activity to automate repetitive front and back office tasks, including those performed using other business software such as customer relationship management or enterprise resource planning software.

In April 2020, UiPath was named the top tech company and #2 overall in the Financial Times FT1000 ranking of Americas' fastest growing companies 2020[https://www.ft.com/americas-fastest-growing-companies-2020]. In June, UiPath was named to the CNBC 2020 Disruptor 50 ranking [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/uipath-disruptor-50.html]. In September, UiPath was ranked #3 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list for the second consecutive year[https://www.forbes.com/consent/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/cloud100/#37c358225f94]



Last month $path went public with only 23million shares as IPO. In addition, UiPath has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 3,583,616. All together that's less than 25 million shares. 


ARK already snapped 6.4 million shares of path. Minus the ARK's shares, there are less than 19 million shares available. Any bulk call buying can trigger a huge run on shares as just 190k call contracts would require option sellers to buy every single available share from the market (incase they didn't cover their calls yet) .

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hear me out. Facebook will acquire Dropbox. 11 puzzle pieces why. Some clues.

1.Drew Houston is on the board of directors of Facebook as of 2020.

&#x200B;

2. Dropbox is building its marketting and collaboration tools, and no longer has a central office.

&#x200B;

3. Facebook workplace has grown to 7 million users.

&#x200B;

4. Dropbox has over a decades worth of stored images and files.

&#x200B;

5.Dropbox has acquired business tools like Docsend and Hellosign to compete with Adobe and Docusend, purchased at discounts under 300M each.

&#x200B;

6. Dropbox is well integrated with Facebook already in terms of file transfer and chat tools.

&#x200B;

7. Dropbox is ubiquitous in integrations across platforms like Zoom, Slack, and other major internet properties.

&#x200B;

8. Dropbox is fundamentally undervalued from a financial perspective, which makes it cheap for Facebook.

&#x200B;

9. Facebook has recently acquired Kustomer, which is a customer-service and chatbots tool centered around their Shops.

&#x200B;

10. Collaboration competitors like Adobe have acquired workfront. Salesforce has acquired slack. Microsoft has teams. Facebook will have Dropbox.

&#x200B;

11. Both companies are blue.

&#x200B;

In my view, I would not be surprised to see Facebook pick up Dropbox."

Summer is gonna be lit for Tesla. Tesla perma bulls are going to buy the dip while they can. And wait for a year over year comparison to last year, which marked their fifth consecutive quarter of profit, qualifying Tesla for the S&P.

So this data point would be what gives either the bulls the trendline they need as validation for the exponential growth they talk about. Or the Bears the data point they need to rebuke that claim. Lots of money on both sides.

And Burry wouldn't be Bearish enough to hold thru the news.

2021-05-17 20:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Friendly PSA WSB:
Make your own judgement here, but consider...

1) Burry has to file this. He wasn‚Äôt promoting it. 
2) This is for positions held through 3/31/2021. That was 45 days ago. 
3)TSLA closed at roughly $670 on 3/31. It‚Äôs currently at $570 and Lo of $559. 
4) it‚Äôs entirely possible he could have closed his position and made a lot of money. He also could still have it. 
5) he has very consistently expressed his feelings about TSLA since last year. This isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúnew‚Äù or ‚Äúnews.‚Äù
6) before he deleted his Twitter a few months ago, he was REALLY comin in hot with the hyperinflation narrative and comparing it to Weimar, Germany. Could he be right, yes, could be. Is he probably going insane because no one expected the FED‚Äôs intervention efforts to play out like this? Possible. 

Point is, Burry is smart AF. His analysis is right from a technical numbers standpoint. But there are many other factors to consider as well.

*****
> Tesla historically racked up around $1.6 billion in regulatory energy credits, primarily zero emission vehicle credits, which helped Tesla report more than four consecutive quarters of profitability, qualifying Elon Musk&#039;s automaker for addition to the S&P 500 index.

> Tesla is currently delayed in producing and delivering its updated versions of its high-end sedan and SUV, the Model S and X. And it is delayed in commercial production of its custom-designed &quot;4680&quot; battery cells for use in forthcoming vehicles, including the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi.

> Correction: Michael Burry is long puts against 800,100 shares of Tesla, according to a filing with the SEC. An earlier version misstated the number of put contracts Burry purchased.

2021-05-17 23:09:09,wallstreetbets,Anyone wonder if Elon secretly knows the put expiration date and is purposely crashing the stock so it can rebound faster and screw over burry‚Äôs profits?

2021-05-18 00:19:37,wallstreetbets,Seems pretty straightforward to me - the big 3 are having problems making cars from the chip shortage. Tesla is leveraged hard by selling its carbon credits. Big 3 won't be needing so many credits in the short term. Tesla takes a serious revenue hit.....Profit.

FSD is getting better but its no where near level 4 autonomy for Tesla Taxi Service. Battery Tech has gotten better but we haven't seen it in products. CyberTruck promised. Tesla Roadster promised. Tesla Semi promised. All of which are yet to be seen and are delayed.

2021-05-17 21:01:17,wallstreetbets,He had a talk in March when he mentioned his bet on the rise in the gamestop price as he bought into it about a year ago. He called TSLA a price bubble that was waiting to burst at the exact same time when people asked him where his next bet was placed.

2021-05-18 00:17:42,wallstreetbets,"No he tweeted about it late last year early this year. While TSLA was around 700 he probably continued to buy all the way to 790 maybe after on its way down.

He could have them expiring for the next 40 to 60 days.

His 13f have been public for months. He had like 240m in the market. After making probably 900m+ this year and he had 500m in the market starting."

2021-05-17 21:17:00,wallstreetbets,"He just does actual research. Most investors take reports at face value. The thing is, companies are always trying to BS. If you know why they are doing it, it makes proper bets easier. 

I have heard traders say that they got their position by just talking their way in after just skirting their way through college. Many don't do truly in depth further research. If a company says that it is making billions, find out where and why that is. If they claim they will double their profit, find out how and why. Half of what he had done to make so many great trades are the things that people skip over. It is even in the movie The Big Short, but most just see it as a throw away line. They discuss how he knew the market was going to fail and one of the characters says he actually read the documents followed by ""who actually reads those?"". 

He probably researches 100s of companies and that is the reason he makes so few trades. If you go for the ones where the BS is going to surface soon, you can ""YOLO"" it all on 2 or 3 trades a year and end up with massive gains. If anything, he is probably way more risk adverse than people think."

2021-05-18 12:30:40,wallstreetbets,"> Does anyone know why the regulators are so against Burry?


Because the ""normal"" people are NEVER allowed to actually win.  Same with why DFV got called to testify.  The people owning the market/politicians never expected someone to make such big public gains.  They hate him cause he's not doing what he's allowed to do which is either lose it all, only put in for a 401k, or make peanuts back.


It's like a casino where instead of them wanting people to win sometimes so more will try it, the ""market"" actually wants nobody to win ever(but themselves of course)."
2021-05-18 12:44:47,wallstreetbets,"> I mean he can‚Äôt even have a Twitter account? 

Mate, no one forced him off twitter. ffs, it's not like the government has barred him from tweeting.

He took a short position on Tesla and publicly announced it in December. He then deleted that tweet (as he deleted all his tweets after a few hours to days). He then posted more negative stuff about Tesla publicly (which,f frankly, I mostly agreed with), then deleted those tweets as well.

That's 100% the shit the SEC will follow up on and is likely the reason they paid him a visit."

Some online articles have theorized why Burry did this (most point to Tesla's income from selling regulatory credits to other automakers which is really the only reason Tesla is profitable ATM... and Elon knows this) and from those theories its completely possible Burry was right again."

You don't need to be a genius to see that TSLA is overvalued as hell. To justify it's current price today (even long after dipping from $900), it would need to sell all the cars sold throughout the world for several years.

Retards will counter this with ""iT's NoT jUsT a CaR cOmPaNy"", but it is. They buy their batteries, they buy their solar panels, they only build the car, and according to the many bad reports, they don't service them well.

TSLA is going to crash below $100 by the end of the year."

2021-05-18 17:45:42,wallstreetbets,"News drones know 8,000 puts doesn't make a good headline."
2021-05-17 20:23:48,wallstreetbets,Has that mattered the last five years lol.
2021-05-17 20:31:34,wallstreetbets,Now it‚Äôs back to a car company eh?
2021-05-17 20:28:50,wallstreetbets,Except Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company. It‚Äôs a carbon credit company that makes ‚Äúclean‚Äù cars to generate and sell the credits. Just like McDonalds is a real-estate company that gets people to sell burgers to pay the rent. Teslas are sold significantly under market value which is why they are so ubiquitous and the company so popular. Plus the competition names their company stupid shit like Fisker which sounds like a dildo/blender combo.
2021-05-17 20:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Too bad Billions, maybe hundreds of billions, have already been lost betting against Tesla."

2021-05-17 20:16:20,wallstreetbets,well he made at least tens of millions off the short how much did you make shorting tesla?
2021-05-17 20:16:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean you have to admit his timing is pretty right on, pretty much any other period would have killed him. Let's see how long he keeps his position."
2021-05-17 20:30:12,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt get the comparison between Tesla and other car companies even when grouped together. It seems like apples and oranges. With the Tesla roof, Semi Trucks, and solar farms like the one apple supposedly bought, they do more than just a car company. Or maybe I just haven‚Äôt heard about what other car companies are doing besides cars. I heard Elon started with a roadster to gain attention and eventually mass produce cars like he‚Äôs getting to today. What‚Äôs to say the production of cars isn‚Äôt just another step to something bigger as well that justifies the price? I‚Äôm sure I could be way wrong and not taking a side or saying right or wrong just looking for some perspective."
2021-05-17 20:34:05,wallstreetbets,You say that like this sub isn't loaded with people who actually do think that very thing
2021-05-17 20:36:13,wallstreetbets,I think the key is whatever force is driving up ‚Äúair coins‚Äù can sustain themselves or not on overvalued meme stocks like tsla
2021-05-17 20:40:06,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúCar company‚Äù is a stretch, more like energy credit company"
2021-05-17 20:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Being worth than most other auto car companies isn‚Äôt the issue. Tesla sells more than cars. They sell solar panels and a self driving feature that‚Äôs the most advanced on the market. No, what‚Äôs ridiculous was their 1600:1 P/E ratio when apple is 14:1. I can see Tesla being worth more than all auto manufacturers combined, I can‚Äôt see it being worth more than most TECH behemoths."
2021-05-17 20:58:22,wallstreetbets,No but yes. Tesla shorts have been raped for a decade. The man timed it perfectly. U could have made that statement any time in the decade and got margin called

2021-05-17 21:06:17,wallstreetbets,Did you buy puts?
2021-05-17 21:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Plenty of people have said that exact thing and lost their shirt trying to short TSLA.  It's one thing to be right, and it's another to put on a profitable trade."

2021-05-17 21:48:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I‚Äôll give Musk credit. While I feel he has made progress in certain ways, his main skill is extracting money. Even if his inventions don‚Äôt work as intended, or even make money, people throw money at his feet. It‚Äôs almost as if he himself is worth all those billions and not his products. It‚Äôs ludicrous really."
2021-05-17 21:53:00,wallstreetbets,Sure we all were thinking it. But maybe the ‚Äògenius‚Äô is having the balls to put your money behind it?

2021-05-17 23:09:37,wallstreetbets,"But they sold 180,570 cars last year! So many! Surely that's worth a 1/2 Trillion evaluation!"

Oh wait. By 2001 they were producing IPods.  Then IPhones. Then AirPods. Apple is no longer just another computer manufacturer.  

And at some point Tesla will follow suit and be much more than an automobile manufacturer.  

I‚Äôm no fanboy but the signs are all there. Tesla is not comparable to other automobile manufacturers.  

2030 will look very differently than 2020.  Just like 1998 looked very differently than 2008 for Apple.

2021-05-18 09:27:01,wallstreetbets,I've been holding a while. My average share price is $52 (bought a bunch in 2017 at an average of ~$250).
2021-05-18 10:27:40,wallstreetbets,this hurts me :(
2021-05-18 03:01:36,wallstreetbets,I believe Burry is an example of a risk adverse trader and an example of doing research.  Much respect.  The style may be boring to most investors.  The gains justify the boring method.  There's nothing wrong being boring.  Can you make boring investing awesome?  Burry has done that.
2021-05-17 20:08:01,wallstreetbets,The fact that you think those 2 situations are comparable is hilarious. True smooth brain things.

2021-05-18 12:42:31,wallstreetbets,"You know I‚Äôm wondering , because I don‚Äôt know the answer, has any other person exposed the corrupt practices of Wall Street, the collusion with government more than Burry? I mean he didn‚Äôt set out to investigate them, he was just smart enough to follow the trail and make money from it. Of course they figure if he did it once he can do it again. I‚Äôd say that makes him heavily watched. I find it troubling that the government can recruit criminal hackers to help us protect the country but they don‚Äôt see him as an ally against corruption or at the very least unscrupulous market practices. I think a heads up from him would be valuable. How does it benefit our country- we the people- when these practices lead to the wipe out of 401ks?"
2021-05-18 12:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Mate, there a shit ton of tweets on shorts.. Ackerman Et al. Burry is different situation. It‚Äôs a observation that one either agrees with or doesn‚Äôt."

He has probably been taking profit this whole time shrinking his position. I would be shocked if it doesn't bounce hard at or before $500/share. He can't liquidate a put position of that size in one transaction or even in one day. It will probably take careful selling over multiple weeks.

Look at GME. He cashed out way to early because he didn't think it would explode up like it did. He rationally took profits and didn't diamond hand it."

And even if, say, VW and Toyota catch up, they will catch up in a world where car companies are tech companies and where the oil giants are far less relevant. I can see a world where all three of them hit $1trn valuations (assuming they are the top 3 EV companies), which is still nice gains even if Tesla takes a decade to hit it."

Not many I bet; we've all done or said something at some point that we don't want the whole planet to know.  But that's the thing: we can be sure that if we ever were in his or DFV's position, our whole life would be scrutinized for any chance they can take to keep the money.


If anything, I feel for the guy.  He may have a ton of money but he's got eyes on him all of the time by now.  And that takes away freedom or a sense of it.  The gov also probably doesn't want him because unlike hackers, these people are probably too famous to not generate attention."

The hypocritic tesla bear was too damn quiet when at the end of 2020 it almost hit 1k but now that is crushing for no apparent reasons ""told you so""s aren't gonna make someone look smart.

TSLA had the greatest bullish run in the history of any public companies and it has made some people incredibly rich. The big short of tesla is just hypocrisy. At the end of the day, financials doesn't make you right, your net worth makes you right."

3) I think what you‚Äôre referring to could be more moderately defined as binary dichotomy, which is also a useful tool, but in situations such as this are imperative to resist, as it would be an oversimplification as pertaining to merely a clarificatory manner.

2021-05-18 02:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Okay great!

A put is an option (financial product) associated with a stock (TSLA in this case) where the value goes up if the associated stock goes down.

This is because the put gives you the right to sell the stock at the agreed strike price (specified at put purchase time). So if you buy a put at the current stock price, and the stock price goes down, you have the right to sell the stock at a higher price than current market value, giving the put its value.

There are a lot of subtleties to this but the basics is: stock go down, put go up."

Further rho measures the theoretical impact on the price due to changes in the risk free interest rate ALL OTHER FACTORS remaining the same. However if risk free interest rates do go up significantly, we‚Äôre also likely to see a correlated stock market pull back as money flows back to T-bills. Money flowing out lowers prices, and if that applies to TSLA that negative delta from his LEAPS is a much more significant factor than rho, and the delta price impact on the option is probably at least an order of magnitude larger than the rho impact."

2021-05-17 23:50:22,wallstreetbets,He seems to make investments based on actual value. GME has none above $30. No head scratching needed.
2021-05-18 08:36:08,wallstreetbets,"Lol, he doesn‚Äòt want to be the initiator of this squeeze‚Ä¶ if it squeezes we are back to the 1930s.

So, actually he‚Äòs betting either on (very‚Ä¶?) high inflation, increasing interest rates, default (S&P threatening the US government to take away the AAA bond rating), demand declining. Wtf‚Ä¶ easy short. Also he is betting on private prisons (or was betting)‚Ä¶ bc higher inflation = more crime‚Ä¶ alcohol going up. His bet is against the US economy. 

Ofc you would be fucking afraid to pull off the ‚Äûbig short squeeze‚Äú that wrecks havoc the entire financial/economic system. 

FTDs in May 2020 were 60% when his brokers searched for his shares. 

Rehypothecation was probably maxed out at 140% SI, lmao. Just need the answer: are counterfeit shares without rehypothecation visible to the market as a short position? 

Probably not :p actually I‚Äòll look for that.

And again: IF HE IS THE REASON TO FUCK THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HE HAS GOT A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM. It was fucking him to convince the GME board/execs to purchase their stock back‚Ä¶ that‚Äòs where they were about to get raped. 

People here are underestimating the crisis here‚Ä¶ we could see the market crashing 80%‚Ä¶ and having a bear market for multiple years lmao. There were far worse times than 2007-2009 and now (economically) 

Equity premium risk & margin debt at astronomical height, retail not willing to sell and still buying the dip (metrics are weird now, lol) 

Don‚Äòt worry about GME‚Ä¶ there was by for not enough liquidity for them to cover their position, also just take a look at the borrowing rate while AMC is rising. Lmao, there is no mathematical model for setting up a borrowing rate, the clearing will asses/set up the borrowing rate. Stocks that have an lower SI and higher available float have even a higher borrowing fee. Lmao‚Ä¶

GME is weird, one of its kind. 

Btw: if retail pulls it off and Cohen doesn‚Äòt fuck w/ the legal reported short interest‚Ä¶ nothing bad will happen to GameStop after the squeeze. 
So if he squeezes it like Overstock but offers the official short positions to buy themselves back without forcing them to get squeezed (even the legal naked short positions)‚Ä¶ nothing bad will happen."
2021-05-18 04:10:53,wallstreetbets,"He is trading based on Efficient Market theory.  The reality is the market is a mix of Efficient Market and Behavior Finance.  The market always overshoots up and down before arriving at or close to fair value.

GME is trading at $180 right now.  Fair value is probably in a range of $40 - $200 given the publicly available information. The strategic new hires, retirement of all debt and recent raising of $500M in capital lean it towards the top end of that estimate for me. This info is all fairly new.  Some investors are buying with the expectation that new information will be released that will show a higher value for the stock like eSports, Build a Gaming PC etc.  Some may be over estimating the impact, others are under estimating.  

Pricing on securities is very dynamic and is impacted not just by the info around a stock but also large macro events and alternative suitable investments. I think Burry under estimated the price of GME and is likely over estimating how far Tsla will drop.  My guess is it will find a bottom and then proceed to rip upward and trim his unrealized profits pretty quickly.

The market wants to run."

Going to that tweet and actually reading the charts, you see that he is pointing out that unarmed minorities are being killed at a higher rate than whites (bottom right chart), 2.83 vs 0.73.  That chart also points out that law enforcement officers are being killed by minorities at a higher rate as well, it is a nuanced issue that is constantly simplified.  

By using ‚Äúwokemob‚Äù he is making fun of boomer whites (bottom left) controlling and simplifying the narrative.  If you can explain this tweet with a different rationale, I‚Äôm open to hearing it."

And 23.9% of the EV market in Europe 2019-2020, more than just ""viable"". I think the word you're looking for is evidently successful.  


""But saying that they first released BEVs 3-5 decades ago isn‚Äôt making the point you think it is. Keep it up tho""  


It's actually making precisely the point I think it is. Tesla *isn't* the first in this market, rather there are a huge range of rivals who realised that the infastructure for EVs didn't exist 2-5 decades ago and instead invested in HEVs and PHEVs which meant that they were still investing in battery technology but combining it with ICE to give it the versatility that was necessary. 

Pretending that legacy companies have been unnecessarily slow or unwilling to to change is fatuous and false. It might apply to some, but it doesn't apply to huge chunks of the industry. As someone who lives in Europe all I've heard about is innovation and invention in the green automobile space for the past two decades. Hybrids were clearly the better product up until very, very recently."

I never just buy puts or calls as they are relatively likely to become worthless and I'm all about preservation of capital

2021-05-18 08:35:42,wallstreetbets,"Before doing any of this, make sure to be approved for level 2 options trading, unless you only want to do covered calls, then its level 1 options trading.

Example:

Lets say I like AMC.  Today it costs 13.95.  I buy 100 shares of AMC stock from a brokerage.  Cost of 100 shares will be $1,395.

On Fidelity, you can buy the stock and sell a covered call on the stock you just bought in one transaction.

So I buy 100 shares AMC and sell May 21 strike 16 call option for $66 (its listed as .66, but all options contracts are 100 shares so multiple by 100).  You would have gotten more for this, but one day expired already (Monday).  The transaction appears as buy 100 shares AMC and sell 1 options contract (might be referred to as buy/write), but Fidelity has a video on this as does YouTube.  It is a covered call.  You cover the call option with your shares that can be recalled if the strike price of AMC reaches 16 before the end of trading on May 21.  Your shares will automatically be sold, but if this happens, you already gained the $2.05 on each AMC share plus you keep the $66 covered call premium.

Lets look at the put option to hedge against a big loss to the value of the 100 AMC shares. The put for Sep 17 is a good value at strike 12.  It costs 3.38 or $338, but I could go longer term and further out of the money to save initial cost.  I could do I Jan 21 2022 str 10 put for 3.15 or $315.  My opinion is the longer, further out option would be a better value but you risk the stock either going very high to negate the put or the volume dropping enough so your call premiums go down because no one is buying them as much as before.

Total cost for set up...

100 shares AMC $1,395

Jan 21 2022 str 10 put $315

Total $1,710

I then sell $2 out one week covered calls every Monday or Tuesday for roughly $65 to $85

&#x200B;

Edit:  If you like the stock enough, you can forgo the put and just ride the stock with covered call premiums each week.  You can also buy back a covered call you placed if the stock tanked.  It will be cheaper, then sell another covered call that is closer to the stock's current price for more premium again."

2021-05-18 10:31:18,wallstreetbets,"started day trading with 25k beginning of April, was up 30k in just under a month. by beginning of May, my balance was at just over 62k. all sold and cashed out.

Then the fucking market turned around and start putting back to back bear days. Over the following 2 weeks, I lost like 40k call trading in a bear market (eff you Tesla, and SPY dipping to $408). Finally stabilized the bleeding when my balance dropped to 18k (even as low as 15k at some point during the day), and i was about to sell it all. Then thursday and friday happened, up 4k since last Thursday (could have made so much more if i had enough balance to day trade). My balance currently sits at 22k. Now i sit out bear days. I mostly sat out yesterday. 

So overall, I am still down 3k from where I started at the beginning of April. but oh well. the roller coaster was so much fun.  But yeah options trading will age you.

TLDR 25k -> 60k (in 4wks)  -> 18k (10days) -> 22k (4days) where I sit currently"

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Are Commodity Futures Going Against The Mainstream Inflation Narrative? So right now, the mainstream narrative is that inflation is going to run red hot mostly due to a rally in commodity prices. This inflation has the potential to be more than transitory, meaning it lasts more than a couple of quarters at most and will result in forcing the FED to raise rates and crash growth stocks. This is why tech stocks are underperforming while value, or more specifically, manufacturing and mining companies outperform (look at XME for example).

My question is if that is the case, then why are steel futures for U.S. Midwest Domestic Hot-Rolled Coil Steel going down [CME Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html)? Right now they peak in June at $1,520 a tonne before steadily going down for the foreseeable future.

Similar things can be said about other commodities such as copper, which remains relatively steady before gradually going down going into next year [Copper Link](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_quotes_globex.html).

On the agriculture side, major commodities like corn appear to be peaking in the near future as well [Corn Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_quotes_globex.html).

So taking all of this into account, it would appear that the shape of the futures curves would indicate that commodity prices would peak in near future before gradually going down as supply meets demand. Shouldn't this mean that inflation is indeed transitory as the FED predicts? What am I missing here?

**Tl;Dr:** Futures are showing commodity prices going down in the near future which should drag down inflation rates. Are inflation fears misplaced?"
2021-05-17 22:58:09,wallstreetbets,yes
2021-05-18 02:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Futures can change rapidly, I think we still have to wait and see how the CPI/PPI look like next month. 

I think tech right now is in good deal territory because despite inflation I think these will rally all the people that have their money in bonds will flood the stock market once inflation kicks in raising the prices of anything that's undervalued. 

The FED would have to keep the rates higher than inflation in order to make bonds attractive, but I don't know if that's really a possibility, without triggering a full blown recession."
2021-05-18 14:13:05,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. The narrative of runaway inflation is BS. Base effects, supply chain issues, and skewed demand are the reason for runaway prices. Credit is contracting as a fast paced. Prices and employment/economic growth are slowing down. Inflation fears pulled a tremendous amount of demand forward, and it is all slowing now. Disinflation/deflation is coming."
2021-05-17 23:27:29,wallstreetbets,"I agree.  The current issue is a supply side one, not a monetary one.Are most people thinking 'I must build my deck now becasue next year lumber will be twice the price again'  or 'I'll wait and do it next year'.

Obviously some are/have been thinking 'I have time now, I will pay the prices and do it now', but that is transitory.

My point is that inflation occurs when the masses buy everything they can now becasue they know they will pay more in the future.  That is not happening.  In fact bank deposits have been increasing significantly.  That is not inflationary.

People saying the Fed is just printing money are being misleading at best and really just downright wrong at worst.  In addition, the government spending borrowed money has never been more than transitory as far as inflation is concerned becasue in the end the debt load is disinflationary.  Stimulus check are inflationary, but we know they are also transitory.

I hear youtubers say something like 25% of all dollars printed have been printed in the last year.  Well, they are very much misusing the word 'printed'.  Those dollars are not in circulation, they are tied up in the banking system.  How do they get released?  By people and companies borrowing money (one main point of QE - to try to keep interest rates low and give banks reserve assets to lend against to encourage borrowing).

So does everyone want to go out and finance a car at 2% right now becasue next year the rate will be 4% or higher (i don't know what the current rates are, just as an example)?  I don't think so.  Are companies loading up more debt now becasue it will be more expensive next year?  Doesn't seem like it.  In fact the reverse is happening, credit is contracting, or at least not expanding at the rate it needs to.  People are paying off cards and mortgages and that destroys money.

The only thing about inflation is that it is such a big deal that it does present a serious concern.  Hence any possibility of inflation gets everyone nervous.

Burry is obviously long inflation.  But he is also short TSLA.  Now I've never bought into TSLA myself (clearly I was wrong), but I have watched people and funds try to short it since 2013 and it has never ended well.  It does look like it could drop here - but it has done this many, many times in the last 10 years.  One ballsy trade and some luck does not mean you are going to always be right.  Like we haven't seen funds blow up before.

Just my 2c.  I'm not YOLOing a trade based on inflation/disinflation."

2021-05-18 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Crayon Make Pattern, Pattern Make Money - How to Draw and Trade with Channel Line Patterns and Technical Analysis What if you knew where prices would go and when they would get there? It sounds like an impossibility, but there are simple ways to reading a price chart that enable you to come very close to predicting the direction and turning points of a stock. One of the most important ways is through the identification and marking of channel line patterns.

&#x200B;

[ Prices respect the channel lines ](https://preview.redd.it/fqzpk486qpz61.png?width=1067&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5b02809e77b0f9d4f8162cd558a98154a5aad8e)

Channels lines are one of the most important patterns found on a price chart. They enable you to find the broader trend, or overall direction prices are heading, which is crucial towards choosing the direction of your trade. Sticking with the trend - going long on an uptrend and short on a downtrend - aligns you with the higher probability direction, already setting yourself up for a probable trade.

They also enable you to anticipate and profit from areas where the price has a high likelihood of reversing through a ""bounce"" - where prices hit an upper or lower side of the channel and bounce off of the level like a ball, and heading into the opposite direction. These are key areas because unlike a random point in the chart, a channel line presents a point that has a higher probability of doing one thing over another - *this is an example of where ""edge"" comes from - finding scenarios where one outcome is more likely than the other, and betting on it.*

&#x200B;

[ Channel line pattern with bounces circled ](https://preview.redd.it/f0l668a7qpz61.png?width=885&format=png&auto=webp&s=658f753348044acec2cceeaa1dfbf4c6288ae0ff)

## How do you define a channel pattern?

A channel line pattern exists when prices are moving between two parallel trendlines. A trendline is a straight line drawn to connect several major turning points, or swings, in the price chart. When there are two identifiable trendlines that are parallel to each other forming a straight band, prices are *trading within a channel*.

&#x200B;

[ A trendline drawn off of the highs ](https://preview.redd.it/fcfpptc8qpz61.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc81911e78d6e9ee5012760fc53e05f6200513b2)

Trendlines and channels are drawings that highlight the foundational concept of understanding price charts - support and resistance. Support is a level that lies underneath the current price that historically has acted as a cushion for prices, slowing their momentum or causing them to turn right around. Resistance is a level that lies above the current price that historically has acted as a barrier for prices, slowing their momentum or causing a reversal. In this way, support and resistance are one and the same - they are levels that ""support"" or ""resist"", keeping prices within their confines until they lose their power.

&#x200B;

>Prices will often ""test"" support and resistance multiple times and the level will successfully hold, creating areas with a high probability of a bounce - therefore creating trading opportunities.

## How to Draw Channel Lines

So, trendlines connect two or more support or resistance zones, which are areas where prices reversed or showed slowing momentum. Channels are two parallel trendlines. With that, *how can you draw a channel line on a price chart*?

The first consideration is if there is a channel at all. Often, there are ample opportunities to draw trendlines - straight lines connecting s/r. However, it is less often that the chart shows another parallel trendline that price has interacted with. Thus, a textbook ""channel"" with prices neatly filling in the space and bouncing off of the lines is not as easy as it seems to find - **this actually makes the pattern more important, as the discovery of a true channel pattern can lead to very clean bounces and high probability, low risk trades.**

To draw a channel, first find a trendline. Connect important swing lows or highs, and try to find a way to draw a line that connects two or more of the swings, while keeping all of of the other price movement between the swings above the line.

&#x200B;

[ First trendline duplicated and dragged to mark swing lows ](https://preview.redd.it/ss3uggaaqpz61.png?width=561&format=png&auto=webp&s=56e6198235392485a05edaddc3f8d0da4d802d4c)

>A trendline is only as significant as the prices' respect for it - there is no validity to drawing a trendline that connects two swings, while is broken by three other spikes.

Once you've found the trendline, either duplicate the trendline you have just drawn, or if using a channel drawing tool, simply drag the parallel line to see if it can connect two more swings on the opposite side of the price movement.

It takes *a lot* of practice to begin to properly draw channel lines that are valid and are respected by prices. Drawing channel patterns that match historical price charts is hard - and drawing them in a way that can successfully anticipate *future* price movements is even more of a learned skill. This can only be improved by practicing drawing channels on many different charts.

## Types of Channel Lines

The direction of channel lines determine the type of channel pattern. A channel pointed at an upward sloping angle signals an uptrend. A channel pointed at a downward angle signals a downtrend. A channel with a horizontal slope signals a range.

&#x200B;

[ Uptrend ](https://preview.redd.it/s8h4o1xbqpz61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=1df032e442d4dddf112e30748baedcff16656291)

A concept that is helpful in the identification of a channel's direction is the presence of swing highs and lows. If prices are making higher swings high (peaks) and higher swings low (troughs), chances are they are in an uptrend. If prices are making lower highs and lower lows, they are likely in a downtrend. If there are equal or mismatching swing lows and highs, and prices look more horizontal, a range is likely in play.

&#x200B;

[ Downtrend with channel break ](https://preview.redd.it/wovf3mvcqpz61.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0029bb3d64ea2cb1da1b122a2e477cd0ce827d)

In a trending market, sticking with the direction of the trend can put you on the higher probability side. Combined with an entry identified by the channel lines, this can form the basis of a trading strategy.

In a ranging market, where prices are simply bouncing between two horizontal support and resistance trendlines, any time prices approach or touch the channel lines can be a significant reversal area, where there is a higher probability of a bounce than a breakout through the line.

&#x200B;

[Range](https://preview.redd.it/6z1kj65eqpz61.png?width=1019&format=png&auto=webp&s=3196922b3ddd01cd806ca9f100aa01918bf0b766)

## The Midline and Channel Pattern Breaks

Many channel drawing tools can display a midline, or a line 50% away from both trendlines. This line can serve as an important secondary trendline or support/resistance zone, and often prices react to the midline in a less apparent, but still significant way. Additionally, sometimes prices will break the channel line and form a new high outside of the channel. When this happens, the broken trendline can sometimes become the midline of a wider channel that incorporates the new swing.

&#x200B;

[ Upper channel line turned into midline after breakout ](https://preview.redd.it/wz5gw1peqpz61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d55d124e5799ccc86ac01d5f860786ef24d183)

*When prices break a channel line, it is a sign that the pattern is losing validity.* The trend may be losing steam or accelerating, based on if it breaks the lower or the upper line. A channel line pattern is most valid when there are no price breaks of the trendlines. When prices break the countertrend side (the lower line in an uptrend or the upper line in a downtrend), you can anticipate a reversal soon. When prices break the with-trend side, the trend has accelerated, and you may need to redraw your channel line. This can also be seen as an expenditure of momentum which can bring a trend channel back into a range or a reversal.

## How to Trade With Channel Lines

Because channel line patterns offer areas that have *a higher probability of moving in one direction over the other*, trading strategies can be formed around the pattern. After identifying a valid channel, a strategy may look to buy or sell as price touches the with-trend channel line, setting a stop loss level based on volatility, Fibonacci extensions, or a selection of indicators that can identify momentum and turning points. A take profit level could be determined by a significant support/resistance level, Fibonacci retracements, or indicators similar to those used in stop placement.

&#x200B;

[ A channel bounce trade with \>2:1 risk:reward ](https://preview.redd.it/f24xyxqfqpz61.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae05a98cdfdfcfb19552fbff3bbb2b5b4331ba7a)

The key advantage to trading channel bounces is the **high risk to reward** offered. A tight stop loss can allow for a high R:R ratio even with a high probability, modest profit target level. Thus, the strategy utilizes *a high probability turning point, a tight stop loss, and a modest profit target* which culminates into a trading plan with a healthy win rate and risk to reward ratio.

Finally, an overlooked aspect of using channels:

&#x200B;

>Channel line patterns have one final key importance to trading - they let you know when to not be in. This helps to reinforce a golden rule of trading - only look to enter trades when there is a higher probability of one thing happening over the other. By watching your channel lines, you'll know when it's there.

&#x200B;

[ Channels force you to be patient and wait for the turning points ](https://preview.redd.it/d3asavogqpz61.png?width=1063&format=png&auto=webp&s=42024fd0d87b9df76edf37e8c33df58b4675684c)

The EMA (EU medical agency like FDA) announced Myovant and Relugolix as up for review to be accepted for Marketing approval in the EU this week. This is a huge catalyst in the biotech industry, and due to their Pfizer partnership this could result in a 50m cash payment to Myovant as well.

They also have an FDA PDUFA deadline of June 1 for a second application (their first of three was approved in December). If approved this would result in a 100m cash payment from Pfizer.

Alone, these are major catalysts. Right now they stand to go back to back on these catalysts. The last time the company had one catalyst like this, **they were rocketed past $30 a share and gained a strategic partnership from Pfizer.**

Now those are two major catalysts within two weeks, **if FDA decides early, both could happen this week.**

Due to the triple threat data put up in clinical trials and the fact that they had this data peer reviewed and published in the New England journal of medicine, there is strong confidence of approval on the company‚Äôs end.

Last but not least, they have additional catalysts still inbound after. Including Part D and Medicare coverage expected by July 1. All encompassed with a possible buyout from sumitomo.

If you're looking for a good article that covers the basics, you can search the below. Theres also some great posts on reddit and stock twits. I am also happy to answer any questions.

*Why The Misunderstood Pfizer Deal Makes Myovant A Great Low-Risk Investment*

**Quick list of upcoming catalysts:**

THIS WEEK: EMA meets to possibly approve sale of orgovyx in Europe

By June 1: Deadline for FDA approval for a second use case (this could come early and will result in another 100m cash payment from Pfizer)

By July 1: Part d and Medicare coverage: also supposed to be obtained before July 1 for prostate cancer application

Pfizer optionality: Pfizer can opt in to have the rights to sell this in some markets, resulting in a 50m cash payment and royalties paid to myovant. Submission of relugolix for the treatment of endometriosis to the FDA

Catalysts that could happen at any time:  **BUYOUT** from Sumitomo ( aka Sumitovant) or other interested partner (See Urovant history. Sumi has a patent cliff in 2023 they are trying to patch with acquisitions, has purchased 4 of movants sister companies and already owns 53.5% of myovant).

Strategic acquisition of new drug candidates to further myovants pipeline.

**TLDR:**

EU and FDA approvals for drug candidates are expected within the next 2 weeks and could propel this to the moon.

**Positions**: 22.5k shares, 275 calls (mostly leaps)."

2021-05-18 16:11:49,wallstreetbets,"Not really. Because the whole point was sales. And GM isn't buying anything from RIDE.  I did some very minor research into GMs investment. And without writing a book. It was genius for GM. They call handing off a 40 million dollar liability (plant in Youngstown) an investment. When the reality is GM desperately wanted out. And needed to appease both President Trump, and the Auto Workers Union in order to get out .  Putting RIDE in, with another 35 mill on top. Bought GM out of a massive liability.  And comes with a windfall return if RIDE ever becomes successful.  It gives GM the right to buy 3 years of RIDES EV credits at a big discount.  This  ""investment "" by GM was all about a perfect opportunity.  And literally nothing to do with being partnered with RIDE"

2021-05-17 20:14:32,wallstreetbets," Light duty pickups are basically an oxymoron at this point.  A standard V8 4wd 3/4 ton truck is already approaching 7k pounds. And from what I can find a Rivian is only coming in at 6k pounds. With trucks your losing a lot of very heavy steel components when electric. Such as V8 heavy duty trans, transfer case. And 2 solid axles. The weight challenge is actually alot easier than in a standard sedan. Just found a story claiming the new Hummer will weigh in at 9k pounds. Holy shit. But its only about 800lbs heavier than a diesel dually with a similar tow ratings."

GM is not exactly an Oracle. My point, is that the investment at 35 mill plus an unsellable factory valued at 40 was worth it just for the price of getting Union approval to sell the factory. While also not pissing off the sitting  Presidency who promised Youngstown would not close."

2021-05-18 17:51:30,wallstreetbets,"So your point is that GM's investment in RIDE should be discounted because even though GM's better off with RIDE becoming profitable than not because they were able to transfer a piece of property. A piece of property that had intrinsic value.

2021-05-17 20:24:49,wallstreetbets,Good call. Not sure that RIDE is making anything in the 1 plus ton weight class tho. Or how well they'd perform with aftermarket outfitters putting on mechanics beds and hydraulic bucket lifts. Not to mention the drawbacks of being able to charge during mass power outages.

Don't know for sure but last week the float was sitting at 90M today its sitting at 82M leads me to believe buy back is happening now.  With today's volume their buy backs can really start to pick up tomorrow.

currently, there's 12 million shares short currently.  with about 20 million shares open interest with 47 million shares going to 12.5.  Max pain is at 7.5 which we're over now.

2021-05-18 03:07:58,wallstreetbets,"Properties and equities isn't really 'inflation' or an indication of it, especially as far as equities goes it's a very volatile market right now with securities fluctuating by the day. Moreover this is far from the first time the stock market has seen a bubble. By this logic we had hyperinflation in the '01(With a normal 2.8% inflation rate) tech bubble and the '08 housing bubble(3.8%). Both markets crashed from their highs and we did not see the price of commodities go up with their insanity then either.

Housing is particularly scary right now as it's simply prices being bid up at auction by an increased supply of buyers due to low mortgage rates and down payments required being as low as 5%. This is unlikely to persist much past COVID and people paying 30% over ask for homes right now have a high likelihood of being fucked once things go back to normal. It'll be short of a housing crisis most likely as there's no evidence that bad loans are being shit out but there's very little chance that the volatile gains we've seen this year are going to be maintained IMO.

In short, believe the 4% inflation numbers. There's no reason to disbelieve them. You are not paying 30% increased prices on commodities like rice, milk, water, or meats which have remained pretty stable over the last year(Outside of again situations like the housing market where temporary external sources like meat shortages temporarily jack up prices), and housing is unlikely to stay as insane as it is."

Housing is an appreciative asset yes but the asset isn't appreciating by 30% to the year this year just on appraisal. People are buying houses far over asking price just due to high demand which isn't likely to carry forward once mortgage rates return to normal. Also while hosuing is overall an appreciative asset, that doesn't mean housing crashes don't occur, and while I'm not convinced we'll see a housing crash this year or soon, I also don't think housing is going to keep the crazy gains they've seen so far.

People paying 30% over ask I think are going to lose money in the short term.

>In my mind, the reality is that consumers spend way more on housing than rice, milk, water etc, and it's inflating quicker; CPI doesn't bother with catering for this.

They're spending more because houses are just valued for more. That doesn't mean it's going to go up quicker by the degrees we're seeing.

Also, that's not how hyperinflation works. 

If we ever do see real hyper inflation in the states, you'll see it at the supermarket for sure. The jokes here about bread lines would become a very real reality. The weimar republic pictures of dudes out with wheelbarrows full of money to buy food were not lying to you."

2021-05-17 23:28:29,wallstreetbets,"He's not saying today. Depending on his age and what he does with the money, and how much of his active income he saves a 40K wealth injection can easily snowball into early retirement.

If he's 35 40k ain't probably gonna do much for him in 5 years to boost retirement on it's own.

But if he's 25 15 years combined with aggressive savings and a few more yolo wins over the years here and there will culminate into early retirement easy even if he sticks it in boring indexes.

The younger you are the less money you need today to guarantee early retirement and the less risk you need to take to get there. Time is the greatest ally to setting up retirement and FI."

2021-05-18 01:39:14,wallstreetbets,"Saying that Western Digital is the next Nvidia is a stretch. 

Keep in mind that Nvidia has much more going on than just GPUs. To list there is AI, parallel computation (which has very wide applications), specialized CPUs, and with the arm acquisition now IoT/embedded systems. Their foot print in tech is huge and are also the backbone for many next gen technologies.

Western Digital has much room for growth to get to Nvidia's level of operation, storage hardware alone wont get them there especially with competitors such as samsung."

Overall GE has had a significant leadership problem, at the top and throughout. There is no reason they shouldn‚Äôt have been successful with their pursuit of Predix (IIRC), the name of their IOT industrial software.

The amount of float here makes no sense. This is way to thin and easy to manipulate.

The 6% public share is just worth 700million.

They will do share buyback for 300million.

Just that is way too much money chasing too few shares.

Then the owners can cash out at any point once this goes parabolic.

This got listed in March 2020. Shares have been going down since.

This will take off... but crash again faster than anyone can sell. I haven‚Äôt seen anything sold as hard as this stock.

Already tight float with buyback, upcoming index inclusions (forced buying), and outrageous borrow fees (Webull showing 175% fees, 150% maintenance).

There's a reason the CEO won't let go of anymore shares than he has and he's likely giddy at the opportunity to gobble their EPS back up at below-IPO prices.

Buyback is allowed 25% of the previous day's volume, I'm willing to bet Ishbia puts his money where his mouth is tomorrow."

2021-05-17 23:03:28,wallstreetbets,"I've said it every other time you guys try to push UWMC: you're going to lose money. And they always lose money.

It's not a ""to the moon"" stock. It's like a $11 LEAPS stock that has every chance of going sideways if the housing bubble finally bursts. And as ridiculous as housing is right now, I think we should expect to see a government intervention to force that bubble to pop."
2021-05-18 05:23:35,wallstreetbets,What price are you hoping the sock will go to?
2021-05-17 20:24:03,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is deep value play.  If you enjoy the casino then go play with GME/AMC and all the rest of it.

2021-05-17 20:40:02,wallstreetbets,interesting thing but imagine i don't believe that is a fair comparison since they bascially debuted recently. If they TRULY bought all the float it would have been a different announcement and ppl would be dancing in the street as it sky rocketed.
2021-05-17 20:38:14,wallstreetbets,stockbuy back reduces the amount they need to pay out in dividends into perpetuity. It was a good move and the real close thing will be to look at how margins fair for Q2. They were quizzed extensively and responded. Read the transcripts for QA portion specifically.
2021-05-17 21:07:06,wallstreetbets,On earnings calls or they get sued? Yes i read/listen to those very carefully. Or I can auto-accept everything those with the Technoking title tells me. I heard that's fashionable right now.
2021-05-18 00:38:50,wallstreetbets,Wrong class. The available float is only class A. That's the only group that gets the dividend and what we buy. it's the smaller float of about 110M
2021-05-18 10:52:40,wallstreetbets,Thats a bullish indicator!!
2021-05-18 13:39:05,wallstreetbets,Your tin foil hat needs to be bent back into shape.
2021-05-17 20:18:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-17 20:27:06,wallstreetbets,I once knew a man who feasted on his own feces
2021-05-17 22:11:24,wallstreetbets,"You misunderstand, the point is not that CEOs can never be right or have insight, it's that they are a wholly unrealiable source of information. They will spin a crushing defeat in a glorious last stand every day of the week if it'll maximise profit."
2021-05-17 20:24:43,wallstreetbets,This is most assuredly the way
2021-05-17 21:05:58,wallstreetbets,Fair enough.

2021-05-17 22:09:23,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs only true if the increased price is maintained long enough. It‚Äôs been higher as recently as two months ago

2021-05-18 03:58:23,wallstreetbets,">with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$12.00 and the most bearish at US$7.50 per share

It's the next line in the bot article that you posted."
2021-05-17 20:19:29,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-17 20:26:33,wallstreetbets,Every time I open my mouth I make $20. Easiest money ever plus the gravy is free
2021-05-17 22:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for being a dick, the UWMC hate I've seen around here is bullshit though.

I like RKT as a company more or less, but really dig into UWMC's valuation, short interest, open options interest, upcoming index inclusions, buyback retiring shares, already tight float, dividends, the Ishbia ultimatum, the difference between RKT's and UWM's businesses, etc., and you'll see there is absolutely a play here with great risk to reward. UWMC is *very* undervalued.

The UWMC buyback is limited to 25% of the previous day's volume... Tomorrow, Ishbia will have a nice chunk of change for the first time to put his money where his mouth is. You might be surprised. There's a reason he doesn't wanna let go of 90% of the shares to begin with."
2021-05-17 21:17:56,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs always possible for there to be a conflict of interest between executive management and shareholders
2021-05-18 09:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Well that makes $4.875 of the average, the other two are still the missing data points. That means your other two analysts are sitting around $8.50 if they‚Äôre the same. Again, assuming on the missing data points.

And if we go with these numbers, you‚Äôre making my case for me. Only 1 analysts has a price estimate which is more than $.30 greater than the current price."
2021-05-18 04:03:54,wallstreetbets,This is not like 2007 where everyone and their dog could get 3-4 mortgages.  People who are buying homes right now are going through very strict lending requirements. These are AAA loans.
2021-05-17 20:28:05,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about
2021-05-18 11:04:14,wallstreetbets,">Only 1 analysts has a price estimate which is more than $.30 greater than the current price.

Another way of saying this: ""Most analysts have a higher target than the current price""

Also, if you'd listened to the same analysts last week, you'd be jacked to the tits with shares as they thought it was worth twice the price it was.

Maybe people have done a bit more than ""the littlest of DD"""

2021-05-17 21:11:58,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah?
2021-05-17 22:45:56,wallstreetbets,Why would a trade surplus be the trigger point?
2021-05-18 06:26:23,wallstreetbets,Because it's a point of sustainability. Neither party is building up surplus funds. The US current position is allowing China with massive surpluses to go into smaller nations and use those funds to gain significant influence.
2021-05-18 01:15:48,wallstreetbets,The goal is to make the product too expensive and so people will buy American made steel instead. It makes their steel less competitive. To say it doesn‚Äôt hurt them is kind of ridiculous.
2021-05-18 09:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Your first sentence begs the question though. You assume it's ""sustainable,"" and therefore a trade goal. But why is it sustainable, and in what ways? Its circular. Not trying to be pedantic or argumentative,, I'm just curious why people think this way. Is it never beneficial to have a trade surplus with someone than others (comparative advantage, etc.)? I see a lot of people th3 past 5 years thinking in the ""surplus"" terms with no room for movement - that approach seems rigid and ignorant of valid trade considerations. That's all. 

I don't think China has influence over smaller nations due to our trade surpluses. I think they have quite an agenda of their own on that front. I don't disagree that if the world stopped trading with China they would hurt and be less able to overreach. But that is totally different question than just focusing on our trade surplus with them."
2021-05-18 13:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Trade doesn‚Äôt happen if it doesn‚Äôt benefit both parties. A Chinese factory might make 12 cents for every 20 cent dongle they export, but the person buying it will mark it up 2-3x (or 10-20x) again if they plan on selling it. 

By your logic you can then use that profit to go buy influence. The influence is just something that China happens to want so they will spend on it regardless of a trade surplus."

2021-05-18 05:19:33,wallstreetbets,"Does the use of ""Chinesium"" really give them an advantage?     

Even taking out of the equation jingoism and/or the economic ramifications of not using our own supply, Chinese steel poses the problem of being of dubious quality."

2021-05-18 13:29:53,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why this is getting downvoted, it‚Äôs the truth. Lithium mining is one of the most if not the single most environmentally detrimental mining sectors in business. If every single household owned an ev instead of ff, the ff will just switch from powering cars to creating the extra energy needed to charge that amount of cars. It‚Äôs honestly a joke that hydrogen hasn‚Äôt overtaken already, it just needs a few more companies developing the technology and it‚Äôll take over the world"
2021-05-18 16:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Hydrogen is expensive at the moment. 

And EV already has active support from multiple countries. Also a lot of the issues stemming from the batteries are being worked on right now by multiple companies trying to make Solid State batteries as well as sodium-ion batteries. 

Once one of these batteries makes a breakthrough EVs will not only be safer, you‚Äôll be able to charge them faster, and you‚Äôll be able to charge them way less often. 

So i think never say never. EV has a pretty good chance. Is it absolute? Nah. Nothing is absolute."
2021-05-18 17:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Evs used to also be very expensive, until more companies started to develop them. Hydrogen has a lot more potential and instead of moving the source of the environmental damage it almost eliminates it. Electricity will always be primally powered through fossil fuels, the sustainable methods arnt nearly efficient enough to keep up with the increase in demand from a growing population"
2021-05-18 17:06:18,wallstreetbets,"I understand where you‚Äôre coming from. But you can‚Äôt expect to profit from Hydrogen in the stock market for a long time. 

Currently, EV has support from multiple government bodies, numerous car manufacturers, and even has support on a state level depending on where you live. Hydrogen has much less support currently.

You could definitely profit from hydrogen, but it‚Äôs not happening well until the general population realizes that it‚Äôs not entirely green, which will be a long time from now. 

Sometimes you have to go with the crowd in stocks. Not the science. And the crowd right now says EV is next."
2021-05-18 17:29:12,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not saying evs won‚Äôt make money but people are expecting very very large increases, I just can‚Äôt see it happening to a technology that will only be popular for a short time in the bigger picture. You‚Äôll see bigger increases % wise than evs in the long term if you buy into hydrogen now, instead of 5 years time"

By the way, if Canadian mortgages really do work the way you say, you should not call them fixed rates - they're 5-year ARMs, like the ones that brought the American economy and banking system to its knees in 2008.

>Good luck to you, however as a civil engineer I can tell you we don't use concrete to repair bridges and roads.

I disagree with this statement. I'm also a civil engineer :) Concrete roads (which do exist, not all roads are asphalt) will need to be repaired with concrete. Many bridges are also constructed out of concrete (i.e. for the decks, piers, etc). Many bridges at the very least need repair to spalling concrete to mitigate potential issues from exposed rebar.

>*This includes funding to improve air quality, limit greenhouse gas emissions...*

>Concrete is a huge producer of carbon dioxide emissions during manufacturing so that would be pretty ironic...

Your statement about CO2 emissions isn't wrong. However, Cemex has historically received funds from the United States for sustainability goals. So that quote on funding for greenhouse gas emissions research makes me even more bullish on Cemex.

All the catalysts you mentioned were already built into the earnings, which didn't  move the price at all.

Remember, these graphs are relative performance. For sector ETFs like XLF I compare to the SPY. So you could have a green month for XLF but have it be ‚Äúweakening‚Äù or ‚Äúlagging‚Äù if it underperforms the SPY.

2021-05-17 21:36:03,wallstreetbets,"until your heart's content. No one knows the top. If you're good at technical analysis you might pick a number. You might start selling some as we approach ATHs to take profit and hedge the peak. It also depends on your cost basis... if you bought all 490 at $8 you have a lot of room, but if your average is $13 then you'll have to play a risker game from here on out.

At least according to this sub, squeezes can last hours, days, or weeks - I suspect as GME or AMC build past where they are now, FOMO will kick in again. Once a significant dip from the top happens (like 10%-15% or more) then fear will set in, and the price will settle back to valuation and/or however much the bagholders are hoping to sell at to get out of their dead position.

AMC and GME could go on forever at an inflated price, but more often then not they will leverage their high valuation for acquisitions and dilutions to fund expansion efforts until their true value equalizes. Or, the apes here will be satisfied and sell until the only people left are individuals, ETFs, and institutions wanting a piece of a unique business (brick-and-mortar/online gaming-focused store.)"

Yes, it's EXACTLY like that boyband. Except they're alone and occasionally collaborating. Chatting. Playing all sorts of games. You know... the typical stuff you get from boybands.

Better yet: ""'hardcore' idol culture is pretty uniquely asian"" (which, already... at best ""EAST Asian""...) - I'm sure that's the problem. Not that, you know... they're speaking almost exclusively Japanese.

And about that last paragraph... what manner of dipshit are you? ""obsessive white-knight types""? Literally explain how I'm supposedly ""white-knighting"", fucktard. You obviously know fuck-all about what goes on in any typical Hololive stream if you think it's generally about idol culture. It's got nothing to do with ""gatekeeping"". It's got everything to do with you acting like you're some sorta ""Hololive expert"" while having no fucking idea what you're talking about. And aw, you're ashamed saying you like anime in front of your family? Play me the world's smallest fiddle.

But all the info I've dug into leads to me be very fucking confident in the trajectory of how this thing will play out with Nokia's position in the center of growing 5G worldwide. And this recent action is an excellent sign. Look, it's not a goddamn meme stonk. It's not about a squeeze.

2021-05-18 14:46:28,wallstreetbets,"While TSX stocks were shaken last week, many indicators point towards a continued rally. In an era of record highs, it‚Äôs important to find the companies that will continue to provide value in the long term. So, you need to identify innovative companies with a strong leadership team that are part of a rapidly expanding market. One such stock on the TSX is WELL Health Technologies (TSX:WELL). This health-tech company has managed to crush the broader market returns ever since it went public in April 2016. However, as the first Canadian health company to offer compatibility with iPhone and recent expansion into global markets, WELL Health is just getting started. Furthermore, the stock is down over 25% since February making this a golden opportunity to buy the dip. What makes WELL Health stock a top pick? WELL Health stock is valued at a market cap of $1.32 billion. Its management team believes that the Canadian primary healthcare system is under-digitized and the lack of modernization has resulted in inefficiencies. While patients face long wait times, the physicians are overworked and burdened by operational challenges. However, the Canadian government continues to spend heavily on healthcare. For example, in 2017, the federal spending on care delivery stood at $242 billion or 11% of the country‚Äôs GDP, making the industry ripe for disruption and creating massive opportunities for WELL Health.

The company is a primary healthcare operator and a tech innovator allowing it to combine professional healthcare expertise with technology and create an improved outcome for healthcare participants.

WELL Health is an active acquirer of digital assets and primary healthcare services. These acquisitions are highly accretive and the company is now the single largest chain of primary healthcare clinics in British Columbia. Record quarterly results In the first quarter of 2021, WELL reported revenue of $25.6 million, a year-over-year increase of 150%. This growth in top-line was primarily driven by a 345% increase in Software and Services sales. WELL reported a second consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA in Q1 and this figure stood at $1.1 million. In the March quarter, WELL announced the acquisition of CRH Medical. This transaction was valued at US$372.9 million and was funded by a $302.5 million subscription receipts offering as well as a senior secured credit arrangement that was administered by JP Morgan and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility was for an aggregate amount of US$300 million which will help WELL support the growth of its business via future acquisitions. Further, CRH is forecast to generate sales of US$150 million with an EBITDA of US$60 million and a free cash flow of US$40 million in 2021. In 2020, WELL Health‚Äôs total sales stood at $50.24 million. It means, WELL‚Äôs combined pro forma revenue is fast approaching $300 million with more than $80 million in EBITDA on a run-rate basis. What next for WELL Health stock? Bay Street analysts tracking WELL Health stock expect the company to increase sales by 367.5% year over year to $235 million in 2021 and by 40.4% to $330 million in 2022. Its bottom line will also improve from a loss per share of $0.03 in 2020 to earnings of $0.08 in 2022. As WELL Health continues to focus on acquisitions going forward, investors can expect these estimates to move higher as well. WELL Health stock is currently trading 27% below its record highs making it attractive to both growth and contrarian investors. Analysts have a 12-month average target price of $11.35 which is 67% above its current trading price. WELL Heath stock is valued at a forward price to 2022 sales multiple of less than 4x which is very reasonable given its robust forecasts and acquisition-based business model.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)"
