2021-05-28 17:47:37,wallstreetbets,I think drafting a kicker or defense in the first round is a big dick energy kind of move.
2021-05-28 18:00:49,wallstreetbets,12 contracts at $52 strike   avg cost 60 cents   (Bought 10 at 54 cents but bought two more today)
2021-05-28 18:00:13,wallstreetbets,i agree with you bud. i hold DKings too and i’m in it for long haul. this thing will be well over 100
2021-05-28 18:07:08,wallstreetbets,My mind is blown. You’re literally gambling on gambling stocks.
2021-05-28 17:54:07,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about this too mainly because sports should be back to normal in the next year so I assumed betting would go back to sports and maybe less on stocks.
2021-05-28 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,Position?
2021-05-28 17:45:21,wallstreetbets,Yea it seems like it’s ready to go. Got my 55 Calls two days ago
2021-05-28 17:46:53,wallstreetbets,Why you don’t have your position?
2021-05-28 17:56:46,wallstreetbets,I'm in DK as well especially with NY coming on board soon for sports book.  Not financial advice.
2021-05-28 18:26:53,wallstreetbets,All of this is already priced into the stock.

2021-05-28 18:10:16,wallstreetbets,HUGE!
2021-05-28 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,Is it February 30th 2021 again *already*?
2021-05-28 17:17:18,wallstreetbets,I buy things and then I sell them sometimes.
2021-05-28 19:12:46,wallstreetbets,If they expire eod you need to fucking sell that shit immediately if its green. Especially after a huge opening spike.
2021-05-28 18:18:54,wallstreetbets,"“He was hopeful” 
1.hope is not a plan.  
2. He doesn’t need all 3 strikes for same day, next time he should buy the $27’s and the $28’s for the following month (more time higher strike) it should cost the same as he paid for the $28’s or $29’s he bought
3. Buying just b4 a long weekend is a bad idea almost every time, if you want weeklies you get 7 days but 3 of those days the mkt is closed, wasted $$"
2021-05-28 17:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Need to get out gradually. If you are up 100% realize you can sell half and the rest are profit. Takes a lot of pressure off the trade. If you only have 1 contract, you’re playing too big for your account. Take your gains and be happy."
2021-05-28 17:29:56,wallstreetbets,Sell an hour after open...
2021-05-28 17:20:55,wallstreetbets,Just use stop losses. If you've got a massive run up on options on a meme stock why not just set a stop loss for a % of profits.  For instance: You pay .15 / contract and it balloons to .50 then set a stop loss for like .30 and walk away.  If it shits itself like today you make out with 100% profits and if it continues to run then you make more.
2021-05-28 17:22:35,wallstreetbets,"FD or 1 to 2 day expiration are hard to manage...I learned a few lessons, and now look 45+ days out...if you are going to do it, suggest buying Tue to Thur...sell Friday hour after open or so...not a financial advisor"
2021-05-28 17:57:21,wallstreetbets,"What is the difference between a bull and a pig?

A bull believes the stock will rise because reasons.

A pig wants the stock to rise because profits.

The markets abound with good people who need profits and bad people with ultra solid DD. Let that sink in.

If you want to retain your humanity you must always remember that this is the worlds greatest mind game. If you play from your heart you'll go broke real fast. 

Calm your emotions, focus your mind and be satisfied with less."
2021-05-28 17:25:33,wallstreetbets,"When the IV increases and its green, sell."
2021-05-28 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,Close when you’d rather have the cash than the position.
2021-05-28 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,"sell the calls when you get that 'oh sheet, so much money feeling'.  It your still want to take part in any continuation take the profits and buy stock of the underlying.This keeps skin in the game but keeps you from getting completely cucked."
2021-05-28 17:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Imagine the things you can do when you take profit and keep the money... Then imagine yourself where you lost it all... can you handle it? 

Holding a position is a matter of conviction, so if you don't have it and you're lucky enough to make gainz, take the profit and call it a day."
2021-05-28 18:38:13,wallstreetbets,"Ive been a lurker for a while and just being lurker status im sad to see all the ""ape"" bullshit on WSB. jesus christ. Even i know its never been ape.....its retards. Its not bananas. Its tendies. Fuck"
2021-05-28 17:16:08,wallstreetbets,Lol brrrrrrr
2021-05-28 19:35:03,wallstreetbets,"same with my GME call this morning, could have sold it at the top but it never came back up so I got nothin.

its situational, make a decision based on what information you have in front of you. 

Its better to make money than lose it."
2021-05-28 19:36:11,wallstreetbets,This is good info. I’m sure of my $24 put expiring on the 4th now.
2021-05-28 17:20:16,wallstreetbets,Runs on Friday close are highly unlike for AMC. Shitadel would start throwing kitchen sinks at you to keep it low. They are already balancing on the edge.
2021-05-28 17:44:39,wallstreetbets,"I usually sell enough of my contracts to make my initial investment back, and whatever is still going I just let them run on pure profit. It’s always a good day when you have to decide how much money you want to make instead of if you’re going to make money."
2021-05-28 18:05:34,wallstreetbets,Asking for a friend
2021-05-28 19:54:00,wallstreetbets,Options expiring that soon are only for scalping.
2021-05-28 17:49:30,wallstreetbets,Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered. Apes hold and play with their bananas. Choose one.
2021-05-28 18:24:52,wallstreetbets,Don't calls have OCO order like stocks? Asking for a friend.

Theta gang for life."
2021-05-28 18:57:58,wallstreetbets,I only understood the first half of that sentence.
2021-05-28 19:14:19,wallstreetbets,So true. Lesson fucking learned. Chasing more gains and greed fucked me over.
2021-05-28 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,That what I did with my Nokia contracts. Sold half my contracts and got my initial initial investment back. Hope Nokia keeps popping off
2021-05-28 18:56:37,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.  You're never wrong if you take profit from your trades.  If you miss out on the absolute top but still make money then you still win.  Best thing to do is to have a strategy and stick to it, and there's plenty of apes that will sell calls or puts and then put a limit to close out at 50% profits.  People lose money when they act on emotions instead of sticking to their tested strategy.  Being retarded and just YOLOing on a good stonk and then never selling is an entirely viable strategy.  That's what I did with AAPL, MSFT, BIDU, and GOOG back in like 2008 when the market bottomed out and my basis on those stonks is so low that the market could lose 80% of it's value tomorrow and I'd still have made a profit (if that happened I'd actually just YOLO my entire emergency fund into something and keep holding).  Whatever you do, fucking pick a strategy and then never change unless the reasons for choosing that strategy are no longer true, in which case pick a new strategy and stick to it."
2021-05-28 19:52:01,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree with you. I dont know whats with people. Faliure to take profit is a huge problem and admitting is step one. Shaming for selling is what i see everywhere. People with 5000% up yelling hold pushing people to loss.

I draw my triangels today and saved me from bagholding like the last 3 months."
2021-05-28 18:22:00,wallstreetbets,"Stop Losses are a market makers wet dream, you’re essentially saying “drop the bid take my contracts and move back up, plz” they’re good if you’re going on vacation for 2-3 weeks and don’t have access but that’s about all.  Options you must have time to watch closely especially if  they expire in 1-2 days"
2021-05-28 17:23:08,wallstreetbets,That’s a good fucking answer. That ape forgot to do that but lesson learned!
2021-05-28 17:24:04,wallstreetbets,You can sell before open? I wasn’t able to do that today. Even with extended trading it just shows a blank chart.
2021-05-28 19:37:13,wallstreetbets,Amen to that
2021-05-28 18:58:15,wallstreetbets,So fucking true. That greed is a bitch when you see green after seeing red. Need to work on the pull out game

2021-05-28 17:19:58,wallstreetbets,"Damn man, what's it like to make money?"
2021-05-28 17:28:08,wallstreetbets,You guys have money to make AND lose?!
2021-05-28 18:11:04,wallstreetbets,You make and lose money?? We have so much in common!
2021-05-28 19:53:18,wallstreetbets,I heard about that trading strategy. 80% success rate with retards calls expiring worthless. P.S I’m the retard and those were my calls.
2021-05-28 19:56:37,wallstreetbets,"From one Jeff to another, good shit you retard."
2021-05-28 19:36:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 19:10:41,wallstreetbets,Then your stop loss was too tight. A good one forces you to be strict with yourself before you lose it all
2021-05-28 17:40:44,wallstreetbets,And stop calling yourself an ape you fucking retard
2021-05-28 17:40:09,wallstreetbets,I think he’s saying sell friday an hour after open. I tend to do the same but 30 minutes after open.
2021-05-28 19:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Yup, for sure.  That why I convert to stock sometimes.  Especially when I know the fomo is strong and I will end up chasing like a tard if it keeps running."
2021-05-28 18:10:04,wallstreetbets,What if it keeps dipping? 😂
2021-05-28 19:09:52,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-05-28 19:25:43,wallstreetbets,In your example the price was .50 so really any SL would probably trigger an order but if prices are much higher you’re correct.  I’ve never been a fan of them
2021-05-28 17:55:03,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-05-28 19:59:04,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Im so fucking retard I forget sometimes.

2021-05-28 17:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Insight; when I bought these early May, AMD was trading around 79$ 
and while I was unshaken at first but the 72$ dip at first, I started to panic this week seeing the stock to struggle to get past 78...The AMC stuff made me think traders would ditch the stock again for another plunge yesterday + theta was rotting the whole thing day after day...

My good move was avg down to a price of 1.8$ premium with 100 options.

Have I held it another morning, not only would I have recovered my 10k loss today but made maybe 5-6k profit.

I even had a plan made this week to hold until 4th of June but I didnt stick to it.

2021-05-28 19:49:32,wallstreetbets,"I bought 30k worth of options in a dozen companies. They dropped 50% over a month. I held because I still believed but goddamn it was stressful. I got talked into grabbing amc so I sold my options and wouldn't you fucking know it, as soon as I sold, all my options doubled in value and as soon as I bought amc it dropped. Isn't that fucking mind boggling how it happens so frequently to all of us? That's some fucking alien level psychological warfare."
2021-05-28 17:52:43,wallstreetbets,"If you trade long enough, this WILL happen a lot. I’ve lost count of all the shit I sold for a loss at .25 or whatever and see it’s worth 10 a day later. Or you finally claw back to breakeven and bail, only to realize that was the move you were waiting for and you just took yourself out for no reason other than you were mentally exhausted by the trade. Best ways to mitigate this:

1) have a plan before you get in, predefined entry/exit. I don’t recommend setting stops with options. Needs to be based on what levels the stock is holding and how it’s acting around them

2) play small enough that it can go to zero and won’t blow a giant hole in your account

3) get in/out gradually. Both for winners and losers."

According to the law, if the couple remain attached, their movements will counter each other. Consequently, their actions will not change their velocity unless they are affected by another, unattached, object. Some difficulty could occur due to drifting into other objects. If the couple have a combined velocity relative to other objects, collisions could occur."

Eating home cooked level food from a hole in the wall Jamaican deli. One of those NYC spots that you’ll pass by a thousand times without noticing. The kind of place you “settle for” because you’re hungry and you just want to get out of the rain for a bit.

Stewed Chicken with curry rice and gravy stuffed to the brim into the dinky little to-go container. The world doesn’t seem as bleak with a warm, home-cooked mean in your belly."

2021-05-28 15:48:17,wallstreetbets,I was wondering if anyone got any.. I didn’t
2021-05-28 15:58:26,wallstreetbets,I got in at 70 shares. And probably will hold till Tuesday or Wednesday depending
2021-05-28 16:07:22,wallstreetbets,I also put in for the ipo but didn’t get selected but till got in at 29
2021-05-28 15:56:15,wallstreetbets,"I tried. Couldn’t get in. Had a limit at 23$ set, never bought any."
2021-05-28 17:31:19,wallstreetbets,"Im holding off for a bit, IPO's have been consistently dropping over last 6 months. I like the company though, if it gets down to $20 or so im in for a few hundred shares"
2021-05-28 15:47:35,wallstreetbets,I was only able to get a single share at 29
2021-05-28 16:10:30,wallstreetbets,I didn’t get in. Heard it’s up to $30.    Not sure if it’s too late.
2021-05-28 16:34:51,wallstreetbets,"Got 20 shares at $22. Idk how it works, maybe you have to do it as first come first serve. But still stuck with it for 30 days before you can sell, otherwise get banned for 60 days."
2021-05-28 16:41:15,wallstreetbets,Rejected
2021-05-28 16:55:06,wallstreetbets,Tried but I didn't
2021-05-28 17:41:12,wallstreetbets,I got told to kick rocks.

2021-05-28 15:47:59,wallstreetbets,So Robinhood actually filled you at $22?
2021-05-28 16:13:20,wallstreetbets,Thought u vet locked out of future ipos if u sell within 30 days
2021-05-28 16:45:58,wallstreetbets,"same, didn't get in and my limit buy never hit either"

2021-05-28 16:08:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah they did:)
2021-05-28 16:15:53,wallstreetbets,Oh damn that’s right I guess I’m holding
2021-05-28 16:36:04,wallstreetbets,Oh dam.  Nice.

2021-05-28 15:09:06,wallstreetbets,"So.... how to capitalize on massive inflation?

Go buy a gold, a car and furniture now?"
2021-05-28 17:45:33,wallstreetbets,WHAT IS THE NEXT BIG SHORT?
2021-05-28 15:37:20,wallstreetbets,"There has been an awesome interview with Julian Bridgen and Markus Koch this week targeting that topic.

It's a German YouTube channel but the interview is in English

TLDR: Julian Bridgen assumes nearly the same and that's why he is a dollar 🌈🐻"
2021-05-28 15:34:48,wallstreetbets,Physically holding metals or investing in mining stocks???
2021-05-28 15:15:13,wallstreetbets,"Super interesting. 
Would this indicate you should short stocks that would be heavily impacted by inflation, and buy commodities?"
2021-05-28 17:41:50,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing posts about inflation on here but what does that mean for stock prices?


Your money doesn't go as far as it did before therefore you get less shares for the same money so share prices go up. Or do they go down because you have less money to spend on stuff because that money doesn't go as far as it did?"
2021-05-28 15:53:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah.. we juiced the shit out of the economy while things were shutdown. Of course inflation is going to appear when things first open. Give it a year and let’s see where we’re at.
2021-05-28 15:40:42,wallstreetbets,"I would argue the economy is still far from back to pre-pandemic activity, hence it’s hard to say what the current state is “supposed” to be."
2021-05-28 15:41:55,wallstreetbets,It's frightening how spot on burry's prediction is. He's been saying it for about a year now. This guy is a mile ahead.

2021-05-28 18:20:38,wallstreetbets,So we can't have overall inflation and deflation in those sparkily metals? Worst of both worlds? Smooth brain question 🧠
2021-05-28 17:43:45,wallstreetbets,"Is this news to anyone though? FED themselves said they want the inflation to be in 4% range in the short term since it was quite low for a while.  


None of this means FED can't keep controlling inflation going forward. Rates are going to stay near zero probably forever, but so what? Did anyone actually expect them to go back to historical levels?   


And FED doesn't really care about markets, not directly anyway. Their job is to keep economy running (high employment) and inflation manageable. Markets would tend to go up when that is true, but it's not really their goal, just a fortunate side effect"
2021-05-28 16:15:27,wallstreetbets,"Expect deflation this fall with taper talk and yoy/qoq comps slowing.

All of these stories are just that. Follow the numbers and forget the narratives. The market depends on corporate profits accelerating on a rate of change basis. If they are slowing guess what? Market go down."
2021-05-28 18:10:03,wallstreetbets,"Since your M2 supply theory was a lie, I'll just assume the PCE is also wrong in your theory.
M2 data is updated, shows leveling out, probably going to lower

2021-05-28 15:15:44,wallstreetbets,"Or we are in a liquidity trap and deflation is the bigger risk not matter how much the Fed prints. The current inflation is transitory.

Go read up on liquidity traps and think about the current economy... It might give you some pause."
2021-05-28 15:35:48,wallstreetbets,Blow off top
2021-05-28 15:50:47,wallstreetbets,"Stop panicking for a minute, and realize [PCE is just returning to it’s trend](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=EjYN). 

The year over year figures show big gaps because last year’s consumption was wildly low (duh).

Think of it this way: before the pandemic, your mom sucked 5 dicks a day.  During the pandemic, she dropped down to sucking 1 dick a day, due to a lack of demand.  Now she’s back to sucking 5 dicks a day.  That’s not evidence of 400% inflation… it’s just a return to her normal dick sucking.

I hope this helps."
2021-05-28 15:47:45,wallstreetbets,"Buy TBT after the squeeze, it's ultra leveraged to go up with inflation."
2021-05-28 15:14:30,wallstreetbets,Pretty much the best way to fight inflation has to be invest in metals. Historically anyway.
2021-05-28 17:45:38,wallstreetbets,"There is no ""massive inflation"" yet, and it's far from obvious it would actually happen. I wouldn't go short today on anything, but I wouldn't go into gold either."

2021-05-28 16:49:21,wallstreetbets,yes
2021-05-28 17:32:56,wallstreetbets,Divide the sp500 by m2 money supply and you get flat returns. Basically: money printed goes to inflating assets. Parking in stocks is SIGNIFICANTLY better than holding cash
2021-05-28 18:11:22,wallstreetbets,"One crazy thought. Rising inflation in combination with interest rates near zero lead to unbelievable negative real interest rates (nominal interest rates -  inflation).

Under normal circumstances that would be super bullish for our growth stocks we love so much 🚀🚀. The question is whether high inflation will affect the stocks more negatively."
2021-05-28 15:27:26,wallstreetbets,"I assume it indicates not to short stocks because inflation will keep them rising. It means to short the dollar buy buying gold/silver. While those in stocks appear to be increasing their wealth now, if they do not convert to real assets, that wealth will turn in to paper bag holding."
2021-05-28 19:43:04,wallstreetbets,Stocks go up.
2021-05-28 17:46:01,wallstreetbets,Now I am all in silver dude my imho
2021-05-28 16:36:06,wallstreetbets,... And if he keeps saying it for a few more years he'll probably be able to say he got the timing right.
2021-05-28 17:57:45,wallstreetbets,Burry was predicting hyperinflation and this ain't it.
2021-05-28 19:03:18,wallstreetbets,Go read Navigating Big Debt Crises by Ray Dalio. Everything we've seen in the past 6 months was described in that book. Dalio and Burry are both educated in the same set of fundamental economic principles that they are using to make these predictions.
2021-05-28 17:56:43,wallstreetbets,Just pslv
2021-05-28 15:56:01,wallstreetbets,"A liquidity trap does not cause deflation, it happens when deflation is the expected outcome and people would rather hold cash rather than any debt instrument. I think that if rates were raised, people would readily buy bonds, so I do not think we are in a liquidity trap. Since the FED has not attempted to raise rates yet to entice people back into debt instruments, we have no idea what will happen to household savings and whether we are in a liquidity trap, so it seems premature to speculate whether we are or are not."
2021-05-28 15:20:31,wallstreetbets,Where are you living in moon dude ? Even yellen said not transitory will last ?

2021-05-28 16:39:27,wallstreetbets,Sounds gay.
2021-05-28 18:01:15,wallstreetbets,MMMM![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm) So you do not believe that the economy going flip due to inflation? Loads predicting the 2nd housing crash at the 2021Q4 or 2022Q1? Or are we all predicting that the
2021-05-28 17:26:12,wallstreetbets,Only correct answer
2021-05-28 16:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Meh.. I'm not talking about the 'end is nigh' kinda talk. I'm talking about the specifics. predicting inflation and the dead end that will leave no other choich. I'm talking about governments manipulating precious metals so they wont spike. Not to talk about everything he bet on in the last scion management disclosure. Everything went his way. If you can see how accurate he is, you're biased AF"
2021-05-28 16:11:00,wallstreetbets,"The fact inflation aligns with transitory expectations (i.e. supply chain issues that will resolve within the next year  or so) and personal incomes are not increasing (i.e. wage-level not increasing) yet we printed so much money indicates that stimulating inflation will difficult. Generally, raising interest rates reduces inflation, but lowering rates increases inflation, however with interest rates very low and people not buying debt, you probably cannot lower the interest rate to stimulate inflation anymore. Basically, since people are not buying debt, when you lower the rate there is less money being pulled out of Treasuries and stimulating the economy as that money is already just sitting in cash and doing nothing (lowering the rate will not change behavior anymore). Raising the rate would only be done to combat inflation."
2021-05-28 15:38:20,wallstreetbets,Acknowledging a liquidity trap is a disaster.
2021-05-28 17:27:09,wallstreetbets,But they spent less doing it?
2021-05-28 17:31:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s year over year, so this is about April 2020 vs April 2021 specifically.

You really gunna claim that last April 2020 was the highest spending month in history for you and your whole crew?

Gunna go with a no on that one.

No travel, no restaurants, no sports, no live music, no clubs, no bars, all the easiest ways to piss away money were dead right then."
2021-05-28 18:42:30,wallstreetbets,Not that great of an option. Yea debt is inflated away but you have a home in a country whose currency is becoming worthless. Need an easily transportable asset or just own a piece of a company with pricing power as they don't give a damn if inflation goes up as people have to buy the products anyways so they get to set price.
2021-05-28 17:38:57,wallstreetbets,I would say actual in your hand silver and gold. Because there is more stock silver and gold it is more expensive than spot price with “fees” but that is code for there ain’t enough real stuff to match the paper stuff. When you go to sell they will take their cut again. There are places to avoid this by selling it directly to another person. It’s a safe place to store money but you should consider diversifying before this bubble pops. I’m afraid of what will happen to everyone’s 401k if there is a bubble pop. 2008 rerun? I hope not. All that did is put people living in their trailers and or working till they are in their 70’s and even 80’s. That will be shitty. Guess what all the old guys are gonna keep the old guys on payroll because they are all in the same boat.
2021-05-28 18:04:56,wallstreetbets,No just higher inflation 4 % and correction in stocks and silver to moon  ( my imho 74 usd ) for 2021 . 2022 still ?
2021-05-28 17:16:57,wallstreetbets,"I’m in metal manufacturing and the price has already spiked , maybe not at the customer level yet but the sellers at some point cannot eat the increases. Raw prices are already up"
2021-05-28 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,"What you are describing is NOT a liquidity trap according to Wikipedia.

“In Keynes' description of a liquidity trap, people simply do not want to hold bonds and prefer other, non-liquid forms of money instead. Because of this preference, after converting bonds into cash, this causes an incidental but significant decrease to the bonds' prices and a subsequent increase to their yields. However, people prefer cash no matter how high these yields are or how high the central bank sets the bond's rates (yields).”

Basically, if we are in a liquidity trap, the central bank loses it’s control of the interest rates and people will never hold debt instruments regardless of how high the yield is. The central bank has not lost control of the interest rates yet, (since the debt is still serviceable for now) nor have they raised rates to test whether people are still willing to hold debt rather than cash."
2021-05-28 17:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Hell no, been going crazy"
2021-05-28 18:03:16,wallstreetbets,"I wish this stuff would make it to the front page, instead of doom and gloom inflation world ender bullshit.  Thanks for the link."
2021-05-28 18:00:58,wallstreetbets,"Instead everyone bought cars, boats, atvs,  trucks, land, houses.....I still traveled as well.   That’s my small circle I know and not representative"
2021-05-28 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,"What kind of inflation event do you expect? You're acting like inflation in the US will lead to complete and irreversible societal collapse. If, like a normal person, you think it will make your money worth less for a little bit then buying a house is a great way to protect yourself from inflation."
2021-05-28 17:29:16,wallstreetbets,"The person's talking about bullshit paper contracts on metals that supress actual price. SLV and GLD just print shares out if thin air to sell. Not backed by actual metals.

PSLV is backed by silver. Not sure about gold tickers though."
2021-05-28 17:24:19,wallstreetbets,"Was talking about gold. Considering the levels of inflation fear going on, you would expect it to explode."
2021-05-28 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,It's hit consumers too. Big time.
2021-05-28 17:51:22,wallstreetbets,"The elaboration seems flawed in that the Fed has bought and is buying significant amounts of debt which drives down the interest rates. Without the Fed's actions yields would shoot up and it is not clear there would be much demand for debt.

Regardless, we may not be in the idealized version of a liquidity trap but we sure seem in some lite version of one."
2021-05-28 18:07:09,wallstreetbets,Gold is not really an inflation hedge....it's a crisis hedge
2021-05-28 18:53:47,wallstreetbets,This sort of issue was probably more prevalent in Keynes’ time. I am of the belief that this could not happen today with the FED directly controlling short term interest rates and providing liquidity. The bigger crisis is that the US debt may not be serviceable if interest rates do increase to combat inflation (if interest rates were ever over 10% atm the US government would be paying more in interest than their revenue) which would result in default.
2021-05-28 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates can rise as long as the difference between inflation and interest rates (long-term) is not too big. If the 10 Year Yield is under inflation then it should not matter if inflation is 8% and the interest rate is 6%. Just let the debt grow, in real terms it might be shrinking."

2021-05-28 18:10:02,wallstreetbets,"brand new retard ape here buying in at $31. Feel like I've been smacked in my nuts today a bit. I almost had rice paper hands when I checked this AM. Let's go, I'm in for the 300-400 or nothing at all."
2021-05-28 19:15:21,wallstreetbets,I bought 550 @ $32 and it dipped right after that to $25 😢. Is it still going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀?
2021-05-28 15:04:57,wallstreetbets,It's a pity its just a demo account...
2021-05-28 15:16:47,wallstreetbets,Buying the dip for Harambe
2021-05-28 15:17:57,wallstreetbets,Thank you fellow ape to the Moon !!! Fucking for Harambe make this day epic !!!
2021-05-28 15:37:54,wallstreetbets,"holding since march and will continue to hold until i see at least 300, this is boring to watch"
2021-05-28 17:49:05,wallstreetbets,Damn you guys really fuck. I got a 100 shares I technically averaged up because I bought a call and then that paid off so I exercised it to buy at 21 and took out the premium I paid. Holding 100 Shares still Tuesday better make me see stars that's all I know.
2021-05-28 19:14:56,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ you FOMO tards... AMC literally has negative cash flow.  If they don’t announce a 200-300 million share offering Tuesday they are dumb asses that will go bankrupt with their capital structure.
2021-05-28 15:14:47,wallstreetbets,Either you love Reddit karma or youre just dumb
2021-05-28 17:18:08,wallstreetbets,"Why?!? 
Bought at the top"
2021-05-28 17:58:43,wallstreetbets,"I have 50 Shares AMC at 7.50 , I got another 115 , today at 25. .30 , I’m planning to hold for at least to get to 100"
2021-05-28 15:08:49,wallstreetbets,607M shares of volume on the day.. only 460M real shares not sure how this will play out Tuesday..
2021-05-28 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,Yeahahh! I just bought some more! Let’s do it!
2021-05-28 19:52:29,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you buy when the hype is already over lol
2021-05-28 16:56:46,wallstreetbets,"I bought in back in December at an $16.50 average, held all the way down to 5 or whatever then sold at $12 after it went to $14 and looked to be on the downside. I can never seem to time my trades right"
2021-05-28 18:51:50,wallstreetbets,"People being happy today b/c they had already bought in at $8-9 (or below) is awesome, and congrats to all.  People who are happy today because they bought many shares at $25+, since YESTERDAY, is insane and sad.  When you log in and see that a stock blew up 10, 20, 30, 50%... what that means is, you should have bought it, yesterday.  Not today.  Godspeed.  FOMO is real."
2021-05-28 15:49:26,wallstreetbets,Aged like milk soon
2021-05-28 17:39:40,wallstreetbets,The floor on AMC is probably around $6 so we're not going to get to see the -99% loss porn we all crave around here. Should have done options for us.
2021-05-28 15:32:05,wallstreetbets,Also if you really want to help bring amc to the moon you should all go out and watch 1 move every week at an amc theater. This will help big time because the price has been so suppressed due to “19” now they are actually seeing business really pick up. So go enjoy some movies at an amc theater near you!🚀
2021-05-28 15:00:13,wallstreetbets,Fucking shares? GTFO.
2021-05-28 15:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Buying a declining stock over a long weekend, those are balls of steel. Good luck mate. I sold at 30 and made some bucks, jumping back on Tuesday when the stock is at 9 or 8."
2021-05-28 15:20:02,wallstreetbets,Hope you have some big bags.
2021-05-28 15:11:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service - AMC ape
2021-05-28 15:04:55,wallstreetbets,"It’s done, thanks for the ride tho AMC"
2021-05-28 15:29:37,wallstreetbets,"But hey, moon is the other way! 😅"
2021-05-28 15:49:27,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck! What's your exit price target?

2021-05-28 15:12:32,wallstreetbets,Please sell now if you’ve made any money.  You’ll regret it Tuesday
2021-05-28 15:18:49,wallstreetbets,"I lost my ass, I'm done investing thanks for the falsehood here like always"
2021-05-28 15:21:32,wallstreetbets,Went from +50k this morning to -10k this afternoon. Realized and sold. Too pussy to hold over the weekend. I’ll jump back on the bandwagon on Tuesday with you if action looks good.

2021-05-28 16:36:01,wallstreetbets,I’m still holding.  I might never sell. Not for less than $500 per share.

2021-05-28 19:47:30,wallstreetbets,"I have just bought in and have been floores by all this.  Thanks for this!

I do have a question, when it gets time to start off loading, will there be warning flares from this /r?

 Super new.  

*Don't hit*"
2021-05-28 15:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Doubled down on the dip, LETS GOOO!!!!🚀🚀🚀"

2021-05-28 18:45:28,wallstreetbets,Same here just brought in 🚀🌕 to mars 👌
2021-05-28 19:06:32,wallstreetbets,"When moon? Where lambo? $696,969.69 not a meme"
2021-05-28 19:24:14,wallstreetbets,That's going to be pretty heavy.  Or maybe not.  Maybe you just got that kind of money to sling around.
2021-05-28 19:40:02,wallstreetbets,Until xmas 2023 or 2025 if necessary better than having on my savings!
2021-05-28 17:54:19,wallstreetbets,"Just hold. Don't sell. When you sell, you lose. Some of us wait and wait for months or even years."
2021-05-28 16:12:26,wallstreetbets,Because you're buying at the high of the hype
2021-05-28 16:18:56,wallstreetbets,"Watch the charts, watch the RSI, watch the money flow, watch for impulse waves, buy the bottom of them. You may not grab the absolute bottom, but you shouldn't buy the top that way."
2021-05-28 17:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Just buy a $100 FD when you get fomo and call it a day.

Play the share game some other week lol.

Or if you’re rich a thousand or whatever."
2021-05-28 15:00:32,wallstreetbets,A little thing called FOMO
2021-05-28 14:57:28,wallstreetbets,"they hate to hop on a small rise before a dip and only jump in once they see some good movement, but by then its usually too late....but not always brothers"
2021-05-28 17:24:09,wallstreetbets,"This is going to the moon.. join the sub, buy the stock. Thank me later"
2021-05-28 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,Because otherwise it would be a three day run up.
2021-05-28 15:11:13,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-28 18:29:42,wallstreetbets,"Fomo. If AMC runs up on Tuesday premarket, you’re not gonna have chance to buy in Tuesday before it’s already has run up 20%"
2021-05-28 14:58:30,wallstreetbets,"Because I don’t think the squeeze has yet to happen .......IM BUYING THE DIP TO FULL THE SHIP!!

 AMC TO THE MOON !!!! 

#anidiotwithadream!!!!"
2021-05-28 19:11:32,wallstreetbets,Been holding since January and keep buying more all the time. The floor is high so as long as we hold gains will be plentiful
2021-05-28 15:34:24,wallstreetbets,"On a Friday before a 3 day weekend, at that. You can’t make this stuff up."
2021-05-28 14:59:57,wallstreetbets,"I wonder the same thing.  If they had the money before, smart money buys after the initial gain as long as it holds.  This, though, this is dumb money."
2021-05-28 18:17:08,wallstreetbets,"The problem with refusing to buy after a run up would have missed you a lot of opportunities. They don’t always pull back, In this case this mentality ruins the entire concept of forcing a short squeeze. You literally just need the degenerates to keep piling on. Is there any reason to? Not really."
2021-05-28 17:58:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean...is there a law around how many days in a row a stock can go up for? People say don’t buy on green day days...don’t buy after 2 green days...3 days in a row? You idiot...oh shit it went up 4 days in a row. NO WAY you should buy now...

SPY went up like 13 days in a row not long ago. You ride it till it bucks you, or you don’t ride at all."
2021-05-28 14:56:47,wallstreetbets,"It’s nothing about money, it’s all about attitudes!"
2021-05-28 18:06:24,wallstreetbets,This sub fuckin fucks
2021-05-28 19:31:43,wallstreetbets,Was it penis reduction surgery?....I was in at 12
2021-05-28 15:41:38,wallstreetbets,I bought what I could afford (13 shares) because I like tendies and I love all of you
2021-05-28 17:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Relax, lick pussys and enjoy ur long weekend"
2021-05-28 17:41:15,wallstreetbets,Fine line.
2021-05-28 19:52:49,wallstreetbets,That’s the beauty of it. There’s a long weekend for apes to reset and crush them on tuesday
2021-05-28 16:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Its been a wild ride this week, hoping it keeps on ripping next week!  I'm in Uwmc too, looks like its about to take off"
2021-05-28 19:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Holding 1418 im in the rocket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-28 19:14:21,wallstreetbets,AMC on the rocket to outer space baby!!!!  Not selling.
2021-05-28 15:15:30,wallstreetbets,I don't have a choice but to be in.
2021-05-28 15:24:23,wallstreetbets,"All in, with hands and feet!"
2021-05-28 15:27:16,wallstreetbets,it is an important date. only a retard would sell because it dipped on a friday before a long weekend.
2021-05-28 15:14:51,wallstreetbets,IN
2021-05-28 19:54:06,wallstreetbets,I never pull out. My pull out game is weak
2021-05-28 15:40:27,wallstreetbets,STAYING IN!!!
2021-05-28 15:10:49,wallstreetbets,I was wondering the same thing.
2021-05-28 19:09:15,wallstreetbets,The only thing I know for certain from this place is never ever sell
2021-05-28 16:18:44,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-28 15:32:28,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-28 15:36:12,wallstreetbets,Me too brother😳
2021-05-28 15:40:50,wallstreetbets,Same. Most at a massive loss
2021-05-28 15:35:31,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-05-28 17:51:20,wallstreetbets,This is the right way!
2021-05-28 18:47:48,wallstreetbets,this hurt to read
2021-05-28 19:36:43,wallstreetbets,The damn right way!
2021-05-28 17:37:32,wallstreetbets,Why on Tuesday
2021-05-28 16:16:27,wallstreetbets,no worries. 27k chips just for fun. feels like playing Texas hold’em
2021-05-28 17:51:15,wallstreetbets,Puts gonna print?
2021-05-28 18:02:05,wallstreetbets,I couldn’t decide whether or not to sell cash-secured FD puts or not today on GME and AMC. I ended up with all cash and waiting to see how Tuesday plays out.
2021-05-28 16:13:09,wallstreetbets,"#buy high, sell low.  This is the way...🤡"
2021-05-28 17:54:05,wallstreetbets,Any demo accounts for recommend? I really need some demo accounts to cheat my grandma’s boyfriend
2021-05-28 16:14:21,wallstreetbets,This is truly the way
2021-05-28 18:14:54,wallstreetbets,When  will it be at 100? Early summer or maybe xmas?
2021-05-28 15:12:03,wallstreetbets,I predict nothing will happen on Monday
2021-05-28 15:10:35,wallstreetbets,Monday closed ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-28 18:02:41,wallstreetbets,Volume has nothing to do with real shares. A single share could easily change hands 27000 times in a single day.
2021-05-28 16:39:00,wallstreetbets,Real share means?
2021-05-28 16:44:59,wallstreetbets,Did you figure out 607 shares thing ?
2021-05-28 17:06:27,wallstreetbets,What do you mean real shares ?
2021-05-28 19:13:17,wallstreetbets,I’ve got long put to wait 10% 20% 50% down ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
2021-05-28 16:14:08,wallstreetbets,You totally don’t get it Jim Cramer
2021-05-28 16:10:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’ll take that bet. It won’t hit 8 by Tuesday. You must have not been in this since the beginning. Paper handed bitches like you hurt us all.
2021-05-28 16:05:51,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 18:01:34,wallstreetbets,My boyfriend’s wife got plenty of Louis Vuitton bags![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-05-28 15:10:21,wallstreetbets,Haha. Time for you to get out
2021-05-28 15:14:46,wallstreetbets,What if we’ve lost 2k
2021-05-28 15:26:50,wallstreetbets,Should we sell now and take a loss?  This run-up is a dud.
2021-05-28 15:46:39,wallstreetbets,"What falsehood? There were ample opportunities to make money on this, but you’re mad because you fomo’d at the top. 😂"
2021-05-28 16:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Of course you did. There is no ""falsehood"" going on here. AMC could moonshot and it could not. You bought in high because you wanted it to increase 1000% in a few days. A lot of the people here already saw it jump 1000% for them because they bought in $2 a share. 

Also if you were really worried about it you should have put in a stop loss order to protect yourself from a big dip. I bought int at $14 and when it hit $20 I set my stop loss to $15, so if it dips a lot I just sell off and recoup my money. If you're risk averse you can bump up your stop loss floor and end up in green regardless."
2021-05-28 16:01:54,wallstreetbets,Imaging losing 10k on a stock that went up 120% in a week.
2021-05-28 15:36:41,wallstreetbets,Hasn't even begun. They're still shorting.
2021-05-28 19:30:01,wallstreetbets,Been seeing months of red till the other day...
2021-05-28 16:16:54,wallstreetbets,obviously 🙈
2021-05-28 16:34:15,wallstreetbets,"i totally understand you... but is technical analysis even worth to watch for stocks like these which are driven and pushed by reddit users?

i like using tools like RSI and Fibonacci etc. and all signals just say for a few days don't buy...

but watching the comments here on Reddit gives the impression that this is just the beginning..."
2021-05-28 15:16:23,wallstreetbets,FOMO Fridays are the fucking worst.
2021-05-28 15:19:39,wallstreetbets,Well...
2021-05-28 16:40:27,wallstreetbets,squeeze is ending
2021-05-28 16:50:59,wallstreetbets,I bought 10 @ $34 so yeah smooth braining it over here.
2021-05-28 15:54:41,wallstreetbets,Added one more because 14 is better than 13. See you all on the moon 🚀
2021-05-28 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 more today, I reached 78 shares @15.07 average."
2021-05-28 19:19:29,wallstreetbets,Panic sold 4500 shares at 25 and then FOMOed 4000 shares last minute at 26....dee dee dee
2021-05-28 18:59:04,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 17 shares here @ $18. Every banana peel in the fuel tank helps 🍌🦍
2021-05-28 19:27:20,wallstreetbets,Way to go shit hole.
2021-05-28 16:05:02,wallstreetbets,I thought everyone here was retarded?? Wouldn't a retard *hold*??
2021-05-28 17:50:19,wallstreetbets,Exactly damn right
2021-05-28 15:29:53,wallstreetbets,Staying in and pushing the short sellers into bankruptcy.  Going to pass $400 later this summer!  Don’t miss the boat!
2021-05-28 16:09:43,wallstreetbets,You must be the buy high sell low type of investor
2021-05-28 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying sell?
2021-05-28 19:13:46,wallstreetbets,Tuesday is when market opens up after memorial day weekend
2021-05-28 15:12:18,wallstreetbets,Good catch
2021-05-28 18:04:17,wallstreetbets,Would the increased demand not drive the share price up?
2021-05-28 16:47:33,wallstreetbets,No it's the volume of the day at the time of the post... ended the day at 656M .. look at the trading volume when you are looking at the stock all info is provided on your trading platform.
2021-05-28 16:16:42,wallstreetbets,"What am I missing?  I bought 1,700 shares and now going to spend some money at amc theaters to watch some movies...?"
2021-05-28 17:39:41,wallstreetbets,That just sounds cringe
2021-05-28 15:24:40,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-28 15:52:24,wallstreetbets,"People will add after hours puts, expecting a huge dip Tuesday morning. It will go up."
2021-05-28 15:47:15,wallstreetbets,Lol yea pretty much
2021-05-28 16:03:09,wallstreetbets,I made off with 75k. Was shooting for 150 and got greedy.
2021-05-28 15:55:34,wallstreetbets,"What does that mean, and how do you know?"
2021-05-28 19:53:12,wallstreetbets,Yep. Bought at $14 back in January and just watched the red every day for months.
2021-05-28 17:26:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, yeah, by the time the entire front page is full of memes about a specific stock, you've probably missed the best entry lol, but it's not like AMC and GME came out of nowhere."
2021-05-28 17:05:44,wallstreetbets, Ahh the comments on Reddit.  If only they actually knew what they were talking about. Instead of just zombie hoards chasing brains.

2021-05-28 16:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 31 and 33. My portfolio looks like pure pain right now :) 

HOWEVER, my balls and hands are carved from the finest diamonds, so we will H O D L. 💎🤲🚀"
2021-05-28 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,Maybe in a few months of flat trading you’ll go in the money for a couple days again. Unless you diamond hand it again.
2021-05-28 18:27:49,wallstreetbets,"Whoa king retard here, good luck man."
2021-05-28 17:44:48,wallstreetbets,True that sold some bs to get 3 more today!
2021-05-28 16:13:48,wallstreetbets,"The vast majority is. It's the minority selling and being vocal about it, seeking confirmation that they made a good decision.

*They didn't*"
2021-05-28 17:31:52,wallstreetbets,What about 6/2?
2021-05-28 16:34:16,wallstreetbets,"All growth stocks dropped 30-60% from January.  I admit, I’m new to this type of market of meme stocks and day trading but I’m learning to be a retard like you"
2021-05-28 19:25:20,wallstreetbets,Yes. But that doesn’t answer my quaston. I-I ass-askkk-asked b-b-b-b-beee-cause ev-reeeee one111111 I-Is sae-sayin-g I-it wu-w-would Ro-Ro-Rockkketttt!!!111!!!111 :3333
2021-05-28 18:10:10,wallstreetbets,Volume doesn't indicate demand. It just indicates shares changing hands.
2021-05-28 15:46:35,wallstreetbets,I say it’s time to buy more!!! This game will stop some day. But not today!!!
2021-05-28 15:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, at least you’ve paid your tuition for this very important lesson. In the stock market, if you’re not early, you’re more often than not, already late. Learn to look the other way and find something else."
2021-05-28 16:13:13,wallstreetbets,Dude if u believe it’s going to 400 then u get diamond handed n hold. But you just another paper handed bitch

2021-05-28 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to vote with your shares. Makes the unrealized loss that much tastier
2021-05-28 16:29:20,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-05-28 19:45:48,wallstreetbets,I’m holding for you.
2021-05-28 16:33:37,wallstreetbets,Bought the dip today at 34! Just wasn’t done dipping yet but I’ll be laughing at all the paper hands when it hits 300-400 like gme :)
2021-05-28 18:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Lmao thats when i sold... but i only have 3 shares anyway, i paper handed a hundred early on"
2021-05-28 17:00:50,wallstreetbets,"My balls are blue, because I'm waiting for this shit to bust."
2021-05-28 19:28:46,wallstreetbets,Way to go man. You not alone. Bought 305@33
2021-05-28 18:25:48,wallstreetbets,I also pulled the trigger on a spce $35 call @ $3.70....
2021-05-28 18:57:34,wallstreetbets,😂😂
2021-05-28 19:27:51,wallstreetbets,The emotions run strong in this ape
2021-05-28 19:27:04,wallstreetbets,I like where your heads at 🌝
2021-05-28 18:59:50,wallstreetbets,What’s the difference? If a share is traded 27k times in a day. That’s gotta reflect demand one way or another.
2021-05-28 15:54:14,wallstreetbets,"I mean it'll go up again yea? I assumed it would dip because it's a Friday and a longer weekend, just concerned"
2021-05-28 16:15:46,wallstreetbets,Paperhanded means selling at a loss right? I believe I'm still holding
2021-05-28 19:22:13,wallstreetbets,I think its gonna drop like a rock for the next 2 weeks. And a whole lot of sad people gonna be holding some heavy bags. Just like after GME squeezed then fell.
2021-05-28 17:38:41,wallstreetbets,Holding from London UK using Hargreaves Lansdown and I don’t think they allow us to vote for US shares.  Any ideas fellow UK apes?
2021-05-28 16:57:30,wallstreetbets,Ouch? Are you kidding lmao. That’s a huge discount
2021-05-28 16:40:13,wallstreetbets,Houston we’re gonna need a medvac
2021-05-28 17:28:07,wallstreetbets,"I love the enthusiasm! If it does get to 300 or 400 like GME, I wonder how long it’s going to take? I don’t plan to sell any time soon. Just curious why you think that."
2021-05-28 19:12:25,wallstreetbets,You forgot the K in those numbers... 300k-400k 😏
2021-05-28 18:22:34,wallstreetbets,I'd like it too. 52 wk high today followed by closing negative from yesterday's close. With a 24.50 low today.  I hope it's closes 15 Tuesday!
2021-05-28 18:26:38,wallstreetbets,Expiring today? Damn that’s expensive.
2021-05-28 19:19:21,wallstreetbets,"Nope. One transaction could be pushing price down, one pushing price up, over and over. 

Volume alone just says there is a lot of interest in a stock."
2021-05-28 16:24:32,wallstreetbets,You don’t lose till you sell
2021-05-28 15:57:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you'll be alright, buddy. Go see some movies at AMC with friends until Tuesday. Let people add their AH puts anticipating the dip, and let us all come back Tuesday PM to fuck the shorts."
2021-05-28 19:38:57,wallstreetbets,Do you think it’s best to sell by then or just continue holding?
2021-05-28 17:00:15,wallstreetbets,Right!
2021-05-28 17:18:34,wallstreetbets,Im a narrow minded ape
2021-05-28 18:02:06,wallstreetbets,Bought 10 shares at $30 today.

2021-05-28 17:37:52,wallstreetbets,Do you seriously think anyone can answer that
2021-05-28 18:32:30,wallstreetbets,I mean bust...up! Gonna close at $50 on Tuesday.
2021-05-28 18:30:19,wallstreetbets,Nah next Friday so there’s time I suppose.
2021-05-28 17:23:57,wallstreetbets,Understood hahahaha.... I’m holding for you too
2021-05-28 18:04:11,wallstreetbets,"Hello, I meant it more like what’s your thought process for that price point. I wasn’t being literal about a time frame. I’m new to this so I like the convos. 👍"
2021-05-28 18:37:28,wallstreetbets,Well we shall see but I'm excited. People didn't invest in this one to hold they did it for massive profits quickly. Today was the chance to cash in. I wasn't involved though. Best of luck.
2021-05-28 18:31:56,wallstreetbets,Makes more sense. Could happen who knows. Gotta jump big again.
2021-05-28 19:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Warrior I personally am expecting amc to squeeze within the next 2 weeks IF everything goes smoothly, and theses types of things DO NOT go smoothly. 💎🙌"
2021-05-28 18:56:02,wallstreetbets,America!
2021-05-28 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,"You lost me when you said they're not in it for the money, that's a line rich people pull on poor people they think are idiots. A rich guy would never say that to another rich guy without laughing."
2021-05-28 15:05:59,wallstreetbets,"July 15C's, why yes I'll take 1,000"

2021-05-28 18:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Lot of words but this isn't due diligence, it's a (too) long marketing catalogue for investors"
2021-05-28 15:56:43,wallstreetbets,"One of my coworkers who used to do absolutely nothing at work now works there as a senior software engineer. 

That's my DD

Puts on them."
2021-05-28 18:08:45,wallstreetbets,Fisker the fabled designer and failed  CEO is swinging to the fences for a second try with his wife in charge...   Let that sink in before you buy the stock.
2021-05-28 14:48:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the work. I am in. 😜

2021-05-28 14:45:52,wallstreetbets,Looks more like copy pasta from Wikipedia than DD
2021-05-28 14:44:23,wallstreetbets,I’m starting to think due diligence is long for DD or something. What’s this all about again? Can someone add wavy lines or crayons please?
2021-05-28 14:52:47,wallstreetbets,:)
2021-05-28 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,that's enough words to make me dump my live savings into deep OTM calls expiring next week

2021-05-28 15:08:28,wallstreetbets,I LOVE THE STOCK
2021-05-28 15:33:07,wallstreetbets,I met Henrik Fisker at car week in monterey a couple years back after his first company failed. He laid the groundwork for his EV plan and he has followed through with everything since then. I like the stock. I like Henrik. loaded already on FSR. Loading more 7/16 calls now.
2021-05-28 16:52:52,wallstreetbets,Lost me at Vegan leather. Plant bigot!

2021-05-28 16:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Loaded up FSR 20c's for 7/16 because fuck it why not.

2021-05-28 15:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the tl:dr, whew almost lost myself there...awesome DD!"
2021-05-28 15:04:22,wallstreetbets,"Got it, short FSR to zero. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses) Fisker made another bankrupt EV company. Maybe the next one he will be early."
2021-05-28 19:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Is this going to be like, no one will respect his work until many months after he dies? As he considers himself more of an artist?"
2021-05-28 19:09:54,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-05-28 17:18:09,wallstreetbets,Seems legit!
2021-05-28 17:52:13,wallstreetbets,"I talked to one of their offshoot brands at a racecar oriented job fair (not going to go into more detail on that) in college. I’d never heard of them because they were just branching out from SoCal so I asked “what do you guys bring to the table? Do you design and manufacture in house? Are these going to be production vehicles for general use?” And the person behind the table points and says “That’s our car.” And blew me off. 

I come to find out minutes later that it’s a “battery powered” car, but there’s a gasoline generator under the hood that powers the battery. I’m not a fan"
2021-05-28 16:26:54,wallstreetbets,How do you know he didn’t do nothing at work?
2021-05-28 15:00:47,wallstreetbets,"How else u gonna do dd on a manufacturer that has zero cars sold and probably never will. But 100$ target in one year tho lol 

Just wait till fisker starts selling stock. The only dd i am interested in is fiskers daughters dd."
2021-05-28 17:31:16,wallstreetbets,Only red crayons please.   Green give me a headache

2021-05-28 15:16:23,wallstreetbets,“Probably never will” Lol wdym?
2021-05-28 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,They come in green too?
2021-05-28 17:17:41,wallstreetbets,Well he’s probably saying the same thing about you somewhere else.
2021-05-28 16:17:36,wallstreetbets,Well Fisker been known as a scam artist for 5+ years probably has something to do with it.
2021-05-28 18:57:11,wallstreetbets,"That makes no sense. If the guy didn't work then he didn't work. Also, the people in jobs who dont work are even aware of it themselves. Are you perhaps that non working dude that is now in Fisker. You kinda are really critical of ""him""."
2021-05-28 16:25:30,wallstreetbets,Lol known as a “scammer” never heard of that. Where is this source from? What has he done the last 5 years after the karma ordeal that’s labeled him as a scammer?
2021-05-28 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,Charge 700 miles of range in 1 minute? Wheres that at lol. This was 3+ years ago he announced it.
2021-05-28 18:59:39,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, for real!? Not even a Tesla can get close to it. 😂 Damn, Fisker should be the top car company in the world since 3 years ago then."

In my country is very complex buy stock in Nasdaq but i was working all this time to help in the fight. I start in AMC later too, but I’m happy push with my little USD Contribution. I hope more fights to the more judment world and more and more middle class adding here. Congrats you reach an utopic and epic battle where you touched a slipeen heart."

2021-05-28 18:03:57,wallstreetbets,True. The Apes of WSB have had a far greater impact on Wall Street than the Occupy Wall Street crowd ever could.
2021-05-28 17:14:37,wallstreetbets,👏👏 We are the resistence for a better world.
2021-05-28 15:00:32,wallstreetbets,That was the most inspiring thing I’ve ever heard! And I’m Gandalf!
2021-05-28 15:10:53,wallstreetbets,GME to the moon and AMC to the ISS!
2021-05-28 19:47:00,wallstreetbets,"I wanted nothing to do with this, but I bought 10 shares of GME the moment I heard RH wouldn’t let users buy shares. Total BS.  I rode it from 320, down 85%, caught the 2nd bounce and sold at 322.20. Made a cool $20, best ride ever. Let’s see it hit $1k"
2021-05-28 18:49:49,wallstreetbets,Why did AMC go down today?
2021-05-28 17:54:26,wallstreetbets,OoOoOoOo! Are you?
2021-05-28 19:11:49,wallstreetbets,We're coming back for you homie. Hang in there.
2021-05-28 19:47:54,wallstreetbets,Same... down $1k right now at market close... paper hands for the weak.
2021-05-28 14:51:17,wallstreetbets,Holding all 3...heavy! Let's go!
2021-05-28 19:48:37,wallstreetbets,I just bought some $BB today! My first of these three to pick up as I’m just starting.
2021-05-28 15:54:08,wallstreetbets,How about NOK
2021-05-28 18:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Don't understand the BB thesis (9% SI, 29% utilization, 50% Institutional ownership doesn't scream squeeze-worthiness - unlike GME or even AMC) but I support them. It'll have to be a very long battle on that one."
2021-05-28 15:14:41,wallstreetbets,Mine expired. Great job.
2021-05-28 15:37:35,wallstreetbets,"Sir, nobody is selling besides short funds and  🌈  🐻"
2021-05-28 15:25:19,wallstreetbets,It’s short sellers loading up on more short positions. Not selling from stockholders. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/amc-short-sellers-dig-in-despite-rally-lose-billions-2021-5-1030475947

2021-05-28 17:29:48,wallstreetbets,I'm holding amc even through today's bullshit even though I'm up a ton of money but is there any evidence that it wasn't just retail morons paper handing as soon as they saw $30?
2021-05-28 18:40:12,wallstreetbets,Call J G Wentworth.

2021-05-28 19:00:36,wallstreetbets,"If you were part of the group you'd know what the fuck is going on.  

1. We're waiting for the proxy vote to validate the DD.  It costs us nothing to hold and them interest.  They will bleed and we will wait.  Absolute worst case scenario is GME is a great long term investment.  Best case scenario is it squeezes soon after the shareholder meeting or before.  
2. The DTCC (and others) are implementing rules to prevent this from happening again and will, hopefully, lead to a margin call on Citadel."
2021-05-28 16:15:47,wallstreetbets,"If u need the cash get out! You an inch away from
becoming a paper handed bitch."
2021-05-28 18:48:44,wallstreetbets,Forever this. Fuck up their own game.
2021-05-28 19:01:37,wallstreetbets,Yes they are doing great at directly feeding premiums to them.
2021-05-28 16:05:49,wallstreetbets,The white or the grey? Ahhh it doesn’t matter. They both rule!
2021-05-28 19:52:54,wallstreetbets,"Your vote counts fellow ape! All our votes count! Even though you did not want to get involved, you did. You are a patriot! Too bad your still not part of our campaign team. You are always welcome to join us when your ready."
2021-05-28 19:02:19,wallstreetbets,Because some paper handed bitches wanted some hardcore Diamond Handed mofo like you and I to buy up their shares and hold them.
2021-05-28 18:58:52,wallstreetbets,Why do dogs have 4 legs?
2021-05-28 19:10:00,wallstreetbets,Both GME & AMC were ladder attacked simultaneously.  Go look at the charts.  You can't tell them apart
2021-05-28 19:12:35,wallstreetbets,Not selllllin it.  I repeat NOT SELLIN THIS SHIT

2021-05-28 15:31:37,wallstreetbets,I hope your right. My bags have been packed for so long I forgot what I have in them!
2021-05-28 15:55:20,wallstreetbets,"This exactly! When they finally cover their shorts and convert to buyers we are going to see the biggest shift in economic classes since the early 2000's. All of us, ordinary People, who live opressed under the giants', whose profits breach the sky going through the pandemic. Meanwhile, we can barely get by from month to month. Times are about to change. We found their weak-spot and now they can finally feel the anger piling onto their endless buttomline. They double down, banking on fucking us All over, by forcing margin calls for the lower classes with their fucking insane amount of money. The only way we beat them is togehter. They count on us acting as their Nice complacent human moneymaker, but now we are buying and holding like true apes. 

I'm going to buy my family a Nice house and secure the future of my children and grandchildren. I look forward to telling them the story of the digital war between the elite and the rest of the world. 

Thank you for reading.

2021-05-28 16:11:55,wallstreetbets,Autist comment by that guy
2021-05-28 19:00:42,wallstreetbets,I thought it was going to 10 million
2021-05-28 16:21:03,wallstreetbets,Not high enough. My question was asked sincerely.
2021-05-28 16:22:16,wallstreetbets,"It's been so long, tired of nothing happening and all this talk. I didn't sell at 80 when bought at 230+. Why would I sell now. Been 3+ months and hype is dying around it..

People calling me paper handed bitch but I've been holding with you fucks since day one. Way to make me feel welcome and part of the group. Your guys' negativity is just making me want to withdraw at a 0% loss to spite you and make it go down .00000001c. I'm simply asking when shit is going to happen to the moon. You absolute buffoons."

Also he just ditches his party to solo side quests all the time while the party is clearing trash mobs on the main quest

Fuck gandalf"
2021-05-28 16:32:36,wallstreetbets,Grey Gandolph should have become White Wandolph. Keep the alliteration going.
2021-05-28 19:50:38,wallstreetbets,How high is “up”?
2021-05-28 17:01:04,wallstreetbets,"You know I got the $NOK, too!"
2021-05-28 15:36:15,wallstreetbets,"Said another way, short sellers are just adding more fuel for the rocket!"
2021-05-28 19:42:09,wallstreetbets,It’s your money. Use it when you need it!
2021-05-28 18:26:30,wallstreetbets,Do I only sell only the gain Amount or hold?

2021-05-28 16:21:51,wallstreetbets,"Well the sincere answer is yes, it has been doing a whole bunch."
2021-05-28 18:02:59,wallstreetbets,"If you're wondering, be sure to have a look at the GME specific subs (won't post where for mod reasons, but you know where 😉).

Plenty of information on prices, rise and upcoming things there."
2021-05-28 16:32:33,wallstreetbets,"No its not, still one of most looked up stocks, people are just being patient.....so BE PATIENT"
2021-05-28 19:54:08,wallstreetbets,"Sorry homie, if u bought at 230 u cant say u been holding since day 1"
2021-05-28 18:05:33,wallstreetbets,"Hype is not at all dying. If it would, then there wouldn't be right now 337k subbed accounts.  If it would, the OBV (*On Balance Volume*) would have gone down because of people selling., which is not the case.

If it would, there wouldn't be hype videos coming out every day. 

If it would, there wouldn't be AMA's organized 2-3 times a week.

So, in short: I disagree with your opinion, but respect it as your own 😉😘."
2021-05-28 16:35:34,wallstreetbets,Just sell now lmao u sound like a bitch. Don’t play with money ur not ok with losing. Ones gg.

2021-05-28 15:01:23,wallstreetbets,"Noob here. I'm not understanding the picture. To me it looks like you buy for ""AMC $29"" then sell a day later for ""AMC $25"" but gain 2x? Thanks to whoever takes the time to reply lmao"

2021-05-28 15:08:51,wallstreetbets,Just to be clear I took 10kish of those gain and got later exp dates.
2021-05-28 15:02:35,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, you're gonna go to an AMC theater, aren't you ;)"
2021-05-28 15:51:05,wallstreetbets,"But we're not. Thanking them, that is. Those guys have an overinflated sense of their influence over the situation.

2021-05-28 15:56:47,wallstreetbets,agreed but it’s a slippery slop gambling with money that can pay debt. I would not advise it.

2021-05-28 14:27:49,wallstreetbets,That’s high praise.
2021-05-28 15:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Selling a stock that has more than doubled in the past week for huge profit and sitting on it for a little while is never a bad idea.

It’s like you bought your identity at Build-A-Bagholder Workshop. More power to you. How have your positions been? Realized any gains? You’ve certainly had a chance to take profit, if you’ve been holding for more than a few days.

2021-05-28 14:35:57,wallstreetbets,If you're not going to sell at 35 either then it makes no difference. The ones who sold at 9 and moved on have profits. The ones who are clinging on and never do never will.
2021-05-28 14:28:14,wallstreetbets,Is it though
2021-05-28 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,"This just in, no one fucking cares"
2021-05-28 16:35:20,wallstreetbets,It’s like losing weight once you’ve been fat. You used to weigh 260 as 5’9 guy but thrn u lose 40 pounds . Now you get more attention from the ladies who are 5 n 6. But why stop there? Stick to ur weight loss plsn lose all the fat n build muscle to get girls that are 8 n 9s. Making a 1000 profit means shit to me. One rent payment takes that away. But a 100000 profit is life changing .

Here's a reason why these Canadian companies don't have a future.  The grey market in Illinois is larger than the entire Canadian legal market.  The money aint coming from the north homie.
2021-05-28 18:38:47,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Sell that crap
2021-05-28 17:53:46,wallstreetbets,All in on that SNDL game to the moooooooon baby🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,With 5k shares you could sell 50 calls deep otm for like 350 every two weeks. And then you can take that premium collected and reinvest if you're really sure this will pay off. That's what I've been doing anyway.
2021-05-28 18:39:33,wallstreetbets,"If you own the shares to back it up the only way you will lose money is if you sell calls at a strike and underlying price lower than your average or selling more calls than you can back up with stock. For instance having an average of like 3$ and selling an otm call at 1.50$ currently. If exercised you'd lose half the value of your investment. But say your average is like .50¢-1$ if you sell a call at like 1.50$ strike right now on a bi monthly basis(every two weeks) you make like 7 bucks per contract. Keep in mind that it also essentially drops your average cost by the premium sold at. So if I sold covered calls against all of my shares at .07 per contract I net 7$ per contract x 50 contracts= 350$ plus I've now also dropped my average at .50¢-1$ down to .43¢-.93¢

I've been doing that with a much smaller position lately to average down and reinvest the earnings into sndl so I can sell more calls. 

I just try to go deep otm so that way my assignment risk is pretty low. If I were to get assigned on my calls I still make money... But it limits my profit potential. If I set my strike at 1.50 and the price jumps to 3  my profit potential stops at 1.50 whereas the dude who bought the call can keep on riding past 1.50. 

It's not hard just takes a tiny bit of research.

Edit: also... why more people don't sell covered calls baffles me. Make that money you put in work for you dude...

 You can do it with lvl 1 options with most brokers on a cash account and don't have to worry about losing money you haven't personally transferred to an account. You won't be in debt with lvl 1 options in a cash account. But you can turn that bad investment you may have made into a much better one by selling calls against it. Make that money work for you. And then eventually you may break even on the stock price and you can sell a deep itm leap to cash out and make a little extra on the side. 

Btw... Don't forget to withhold some of your profit for taxes. It may end up fucking you at the end of the year if you don't."
2021-05-28 19:00:59,wallstreetbets,"False, I would check again."
2021-05-28 16:41:14,wallstreetbets,"You're attempting to create bagholders to save your tiny little investment in a dogshit company that you did no research on and are sitting on a loss. Keep your immoral selfishness to yourself and accept your loss, clown"
2021-05-28 16:09:08,wallstreetbets,"Of course it has zero exposure. Its federally prohibited from exporting into the US... 

The basis here is the federal nod that business is open will lead to exports from non-us entities...

If you have some ticker you'd like to throw out there like $MJ or something please do. I checked a lot of them in the space and I liked the options chain on these two the best."
2021-05-28 16:09:07,wallstreetbets,Precisely this. Mass amounts of misinformed people and this proves it
2021-05-28 17:06:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah me and my 30 shares at $10 are very worried.
2021-05-28 15:52:03,wallstreetbets,"You're acting like Canadian producers have access to US markets. Most states have producers in that state to avoid the feds and keep it at the state level...

Just learning these fuckers, so i started small, only bought 4 9/17 calls for AMC at about .97 cents each ($390 total), sold this morning over 4k at 1100% profit. Maybe I'm retarded and got out too soon, but it felt good to lock in gains. Live to fight another day!"

2021-05-28 18:50:57,wallstreetbets,I don't like it. I didn't see the rule about only buying way out of the money weeklies
2021-05-28 18:52:30,wallstreetbets,Slither nice
2021-05-28 18:53:42,wallstreetbets,I agree with most things here. Except day trading options works fucking great. Theoretically its the same as day trading shares just with more leverage.

2021-05-28 19:35:29,wallstreetbets,I had 15 calls that expired 5/21 missed it by one week lol
2021-05-28 19:09:12,wallstreetbets,Don’t do that. You’re trading one vice for another. Happened to my best friend and now the dude is literally addicted to weed (it’s possible). Please smoke responsibly fellow ape.
2021-05-28 18:14:54,wallstreetbets,Screw 30 minutes. I'll drop my kids college savings in the first 30 seconds. Yolo
2021-05-28 16:40:45,wallstreetbets,"If you’re up on a call (or put) and don’t have a day trade left, just sell a higher strike call on the same exp date. 

So say, on Monday you:
Buy AMC 6/4 20c for $0.50

Wednesday rolls around, that call is now worth $5.00 but you don’t have a DT

You can sell the 6/4 22c and collect say like $3.00 premium

Now you locked in $2.50 profit. With an additional upside of $200 (difference in the spread) if AMC went above $22

And you don’t use a DT


Works same with puts, but you sell a lower strike

EDIT: in order for this to save you a day trade, you’d need to do it same day as the buy. This does work for locking in profits with a bit of upside also. I use it to make trades free. 
Sorry, brain was extra smooth"
2021-05-28 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,What did you do that got you flagged?
2021-05-28 15:56:59,wallstreetbets,"You can still buy if you’re flagged but not restricted. If it’s a good enough trade, I’ll keep going because it’s worth the profits."
2021-05-28 14:55:53,wallstreetbets,What stock?
2021-05-28 19:06:04,wallstreetbets,"#8 is not a trap, scalping options is totally reasonable and it’s some traders’ bread and butter. These commandments are retarded"

2021-05-28 16:30:39,wallstreetbets,Because life is full of AMCs and GMEs right?
2021-05-28 14:22:50,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I was thinking. 20x my profile in the last week. Calls hit ridiculous returns on moon missions. I don't sell at 2x.
2021-05-28 17:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Also I generally agree with 7, but if the swing is so sharp that you are down 90%+, I find that if the option doesn't expire that day, a lot of the time it's worth it to let it ride"

2021-05-28 16:45:12,wallstreetbets,what if you don't own the underlying share (for calls)
2021-05-28 15:29:08,wallstreetbets,Not reading rules about day trading and being poor.

2021-05-28 19:59:13,wallstreetbets,Haha that the only one I loaded up on 9 calls when it dipped low.  I think I was hammered when I bought those 5/21 and read the expiration date wrong.
2021-05-28 16:53:05,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah mixed that up. This is for the same day, when you don’t have a DT 

But you can also do it if you want to lock in profit and still have some upside"
2021-05-28 19:42:14,wallstreetbets,Ape can’t count. Sun dark sun dark same day
2021-05-28 16:47:51,wallstreetbets,"That’s what the example I gave was for. You own a call option, not shares. You’re essentially turning it into a spread, just in two legs. 

Bc if the underlying goes above the one you sold, you’re buying 100 shares at $20 and selling 100 shares at $22 = +$200 difference"
2021-05-28 15:34:05,wallstreetbets,"Day trading rules are too restrictive IMO, but brokers be brokers. Sucks man, I've been in that position."
2021-05-28 17:11:09,wallstreetbets,Oh really? I didn't know that either. Is it only if you buy and sell the same strike and date within a day? And what happened to your account?
2021-05-28 16:09:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah last time GME ran in January I got flagged on RH so I just started trading left and right that day since I knew I’d be leaving RH. Bought and sold about a dozen calls. Once restricted, I moved everything to fidelity."

2021-05-28 16:59:00,wallstreetbets,"Once you sell the $22c, your upside is capped. Unless I’m missing something, selling your 20c for $5.00 would result in the same amount of profits as selling a $22c for $3.00 without the risk of the underlying dropping before expiry. 

But, your strategy is a good idea for avoiding PDT for 0dte options."
2021-05-28 18:16:38,wallstreetbets,I just think they should let anyone do what they want with their hard earned money.
2021-05-28 18:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Honestly not exactly sure but I believe same strike and exp 4 times in a 5 day period.

2021-05-28 17:13:21,wallstreetbets,Jumping on the bandwagon late here. Been watching all this for awhile and figured it’s fucking now or never so why not? Then I realized after the market closed that maybe I should have chosen a different way to trade- are there ways around trading my meager shares when companies like Square and Robin Hood restrict trading like they did in January? Just seems like they’re gonna lock us out anyway they can.

2021-05-28 15:52:19,wallstreetbets,"Long weekend had a negative effect on all the memestocks, but BB held strongest out of them all for the day. It's still gathering momentum and huge trading volume. Apes will double down even further next week to push the stock. 2 clear advantages:

1. Being that it's a good stock to hold and invest in even if it doesn't balloon.

2. That it can't fall any lower than it is at the moment. There's too much interest and meme value in the stock now, if it did fall lower it would get flooded with buys and apes to try and catch the next big mene stock. There's too much potential gain for it to fall lower, and not much risk at all comparitively. It's the perfect gamble. If it goes down it'll get flooded, if it goes up then it goes up .. so it's all good."
2021-05-28 15:53:01,wallstreetbets,Get shares as well.
2021-05-28 16:27:51,wallstreetbets,You mean when it went up to 25? It's different this time because it will go even higher.

2021-05-28 17:16:11,wallstreetbets,Look up trading options in the stock market. Im not going to explain something google can and what most serious traders know....
2021-05-28 17:17:52,wallstreetbets,Here moron https://youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms
2021-05-28 15:05:56,wallstreetbets,"They don’t expire at market close, just an fyi. They expire a couple of hours after the close. Don’t listen to apes (I mean they are apes, after all) and just google and read. Shit tons of info on this.

If they expire in the money, your contracts will be exercised at the appropriate strikes, so you will end up owning shares (number of contracts times 100) if what expired was call options. 

If they expire out of the money, you loose all the money you already invested in those contracts, ie the premium you paid for them. 

To note here, if you do not have the capital to pay for shares if your contracts are exercised, your broker will automatically liquidate the contracts some time before market close on the expiration date. Edit: they will liquidate via a market order, so it will be filled with whatever market offers at that moment. 

Another important note and why it is important to know that options expire a couple hours after market close is because, as you are (probably?) aware, trading still takes place after market close; therefore, your contracts can go in the money (and out of the money) even after market closed for the week. This distinction is especially important to recognize if you are the one selling options.

Really though, just google shit and learn on your own. You are more likely to get incorrect or incomplete information here because, while there are many people with wealth of knowledge and understanding, there are also many people like you with insufficient knowledge (or no knowledge at all) and some of them, for some reason, will gladly “answer” your questions instead of shutting the fuck up and learning themselves. 

Good luck, mate!"

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cramer on CLNE Good day everyone,

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time."
2021-05-28 12:10:03,wallstreetbets,Studies show you will outperform the market if you do the exact opposite of what Cramer says
2021-05-28 11:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Right when you said Cramer spoke negatively about it I stopped reading, bought some shares, then finished reading"
2021-05-28 12:32:02,wallstreetbets,Carbon negative ape buy inverse Cramer
2021-05-28 13:01:37,wallstreetbets,That does it.  I’m fucking in
2021-05-28 14:11:16,wallstreetbets,"This is extremely bullish. Either way, im long on CLNE. The company is poised to move 100% to the upside within the year end. It just needs a small push, but it is a valid jump."

2021-05-28 18:51:01,wallstreetbets,You’re seriously retarded if you didn’t think this was breaking $20..
2021-05-28 11:18:35,wallstreetbets,Imagine shorting AMC . 🌚
2021-05-28 11:18:51,wallstreetbets,"Got eem! $orry dude, thanks for owning up tho 🤷🏻‍♂️🙌💎🙌⚰"
2021-05-28 16:46:17,wallstreetbets,If you're shorting doesn't make more sense to buy longer dated puts with limited risk? In your way the risk is unlimited
2021-05-28 11:44:17,wallstreetbets,Lmfao why would u short u deserve to lose it all for not being able to read a chart you idiot why are you trying to trade if you have literally absolutely no idea what you’re doing with your money??? Get out of this space...open a dry cleaner. Your brain is too smooth to even be an ape
2021-05-28 14:57:51,wallstreetbets,Bad bot
2021-05-28 13:53:52,wallstreetbets,bought in at 33 not expecting it to drop so hard during lunch

2021-05-28 11:26:37,wallstreetbets,Whats a margarine account?
2021-05-28 13:18:37,wallstreetbets,Is that commission per contract?
2021-05-28 14:35:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm on IBKR, and recently my sell orders have been settling instantly rather than taking the usual two days - any idea why that might be? I don't have margin, haven't changed any account settings, and the commissions seem to be the same as before."
2021-05-28 19:19:28,wallstreetbets,Margin account.  Kinda line of credit.
2021-05-28 11:59:14,wallstreetbets,Gotta risk the biscuit sometimes otherwise you’ll forever be stuck on Reddit trash talking some guy with more money then you for losing some of it.
2021-05-28 12:13:03,wallstreetbets,It’s an account that turn you into millionaires fastest with only one condition if you are a billionaire.
2021-05-28 12:01:31,wallstreetbets,It's an account that spreads like your lady!
2021-05-28 13:07:11,wallstreetbets,It’s an account where you can lose billions and big daddy hedge fund keeps floating you monies
2021-05-28 13:54:16,wallstreetbets,I can't believe it's not butter!
2021-05-28 13:34:58,wallstreetbets,Its where poor people go to become destitute.
2021-05-28 15:16:07,wallstreetbets,it spreads your money to other accounts

2021-05-28 10:31:30,wallstreetbets,I bought calls the same time you bought shares. Watching over half my money disappear in seconds was fun.
2021-05-28 10:41:11,wallstreetbets,"Bought at $33, instantly lost $500. No pain no gain!"
2021-05-28 10:42:58,wallstreetbets,"High of $7000 up, low of $1000 lost... what a fucking rush"
2021-05-28 10:44:13,wallstreetbets,Guys its okay I bought at the near peak so now it will plummet and you can all average down
2021-05-28 10:57:48,wallstreetbets,Just got in @ 29.66 AMC 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 11:16:09,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been holding AMC for months, I got in at $9 a share. Woke up this morning at checked.. had no idea what was going on. And now I know."
2021-05-28 10:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Hell yes, me too, super late, not even fashionably late, but at 33.65 I don't care. I got my vote, I believe in the team, and I'm drunk of fermented crayon. If my paper ass can hold this shit as I nibble the barrel of my .45, then all of us can."
2021-05-28 10:34:10,wallstreetbets,Stay strong guys! We will all celebrate our riches together!
2021-05-28 10:27:21,wallstreetbets,Damn it dumped literally seconds after you bought lol
2021-05-28 11:27:04,wallstreetbets,"This hit $36 today.
No reason why we can’t make $40 🤷‍♀️"
2021-05-28 11:02:32,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low just how we apes love it
2021-05-28 11:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low is a joke guys, not instructions."
2021-05-28 10:32:50,wallstreetbets,Trade is like a reverse Leroy Jenkins
2021-05-28 10:57:38,wallstreetbets,"Hold on, big dawg! It’s gonna be a bumpy ride up"
2021-05-28 12:22:47,wallstreetbets,I'm holding at $30.90. I like movies :)
2021-05-28 12:27:01,wallstreetbets,**price decreasing = circumference of my balls increasing**
2021-05-28 10:37:28,wallstreetbets,You're not late at all. Sure last week is even better
2021-05-28 11:26:36,wallstreetbets,it s not late... we are going to squeeze them damn hard in the next 3-4 weeks... this is a fair discount
2021-05-28 11:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Where tf do ya’ll get all this money from. I put $3,000 in Tilray and thought I was killing it with my $500 profit 😂"

2021-05-28 10:25:55,wallstreetbets,R u sure its wise to do It now?
2021-05-28 15:03:05,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand you dumbasses. If you didn't buy AMC last week, the week before that or any of the weeks prior that it wasn't at all time hight why the fuck do you buy now? Can you guys just tell me your reasoning? It doesn't make any sence to me what y'all doing

I'm selling like 70 $14 and $15 puts for mid June since IV skyrocketed."
2021-05-28 10:33:50,wallstreetbets,See you on the moooooon

2021-05-28 11:19:43,wallstreetbets,I wish I had Ks to drop. My 100 shares have yielded so much I can only imagine what it feels like to have put more money in. Glad to see the returns man!
2021-05-28 11:24:28,wallstreetbets,"Hop aboard, there’s plenty of room!"
2021-05-28 11:47:14,wallstreetbets,"Hold Sofi, Tuesday is the day"

2021-05-28 12:59:35,wallstreetbets,How are you feeling about the investment now?
2021-05-28 13:03:30,wallstreetbets,"Enjoy being punched or tossing punches? Both are rather self destructive like the timing of this position. 

Both equally satisfying. Stay strong 🦍"
2021-05-28 13:06:10,wallstreetbets,"don't worry, we are reloading and will be back for you!!"
2021-05-28 13:13:42,wallstreetbets,Please post the loss porn OP
2021-05-28 13:43:49,wallstreetbets,Sorry for your loss. Hopefully you sold earlier.
2021-05-28 13:49:51,wallstreetbets,Why are we still using robinhood....?
2021-05-28 15:33:34,wallstreetbets,That aged like milk
2021-05-28 16:11:36,wallstreetbets,"Soon, in the not so distant future, that'll be the best +/- $29K you ever spent."
2021-05-28 18:56:47,wallstreetbets,"Welcome fellow ape! Now figure out a way to transfer your shares out of ROBINtheHoOd!

They can do all sorts of fuckery with your shares! Go into Support>Disclosure>Robinhood terms>customer agreement.

Read section 16 in it’s entirety.  “... Robinhood at any time and at their sole discretion....” they can sell your shares because you don’t own them!”

Fidelity or Vanguard are very good options.
Godspeed brother ape, safe guard your investment. 🦍💪🤝"
2021-05-28 12:10:59,wallstreetbets,Now you are holding the bag. :)
2021-05-28 11:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Your never too late to this party, if you love the stock and want to make them pay? You are in good company."

2021-05-28 13:07:16,wallstreetbets,Hope you have a stop loss in place. AMC could jump to $40 or dive to $10. You're better off just taking your money to Vegas at this point! At least they will comp your room if you lose big. :)
2021-05-28 10:38:25,wallstreetbets,"We don’t need no, education"
2021-05-28 11:14:42,wallstreetbets,Keep trying Kenny

2021-05-28 13:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low!!!"
2021-05-28 14:08:04,wallstreetbets,"I scalped my 32$ call at $35 I think. About a $300 gain per contract sold. Felt like a crash was coming. Meant to buy puts on the way down, but life called and I had to answer. 

This is only the beginning though!"
2021-05-28 14:28:35,wallstreetbets,"Not late, this just the beginning of it, 🚀"
2021-05-28 14:50:55,wallstreetbets,Meanwhile I’m over here at TELL which I feel is the equivalent to the kids table at this party...
2021-05-28 15:03:48,wallstreetbets,Other half of your account must be in gme
2021-05-28 15:14:34,wallstreetbets,Your going to make millions 🦍
2021-05-28 16:53:04,wallstreetbets,Lol dang dude
2021-05-28 18:24:21,wallstreetbets,"I seriously don't get why people wait to FOMO until the very top lol.. granted you can't always tell the top, but Moon is not a price target."
2021-05-28 18:54:22,wallstreetbets,I bought at $8 but only purchased 25. Forgot about the account. Just opened it this week like ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-05-28 19:14:37,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-28 19:49:31,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 13 and prayed that fellow apes will come back for me. There's hope friend.
2021-05-28 19:52:45,wallstreetbets,You either buy the high or sell the low....in the same day......pro strategy
2021-05-28 11:17:18,wallstreetbets,Clov will be next squeeze
2021-05-28 14:12:05,wallstreetbets,Listening to the Talking Head Hacks hate on WSB is just pathetic
2021-05-28 11:46:17,wallstreetbets,Made the same mistake hoping it bounces back so I break even b4 the days done
2021-05-28 14:39:39,wallstreetbets,Buying 0 days throughout the day to “average down”. Hasn’t worked so far. I have now begun a game where it’s AMC against my solvency.
2021-05-28 16:07:25,wallstreetbets,Don't follow the WSB trends you need to be in before the hype just gotta accept that you missed out sometimes and not fomo
2021-05-28 10:54:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought up shares at 35.50 (6K worth) and watched it flame out. LOL. I know it is tiny compared to where AMC is going. Much love to all!!
2021-05-28 10:35:30,wallstreetbets,Until it doesn’t 😎
2021-05-28 14:28:49,wallstreetbets,Never buy call options on big green days like these. Rules of playing options. Same with buying puts on red days. Hopefully it's far out though?

2021-05-28 12:15:56,wallstreetbets,"Yep if we're lucky it will be down to $10 by EOD, think how much money we will save"
2021-05-28 18:17:40,wallstreetbets,"I was checking it just once a week for a few months and this week Reddit started going crazy… and I saw how high it had been, oh well, I guess I will keep holding a few more months 🤷🏻‍♀️"
2021-05-28 11:38:14,wallstreetbets,"you bought in at 33.65? how many shares? Almost timed the top perfectly, good work lad."
2021-05-28 13:26:54,wallstreetbets,The effects of fomo are wild
2021-05-28 14:47:16,wallstreetbets,"Compare to what we all look for, 33.65 is nothing!!!! Just relax and we all can do it"
2021-05-28 18:33:21,wallstreetbets,Lol i opened my short position at 33.65. Maybe i sold to you
2021-05-28 10:39:25,wallstreetbets,Get back in and ride it all the way up!
2021-05-28 12:07:17,wallstreetbets,Lmao fomo  buyers think this is the squeeze you guys are selling early for a small ass profit dumbass

2021-05-28 11:28:23,wallstreetbets,they didn't t cover.. they increased their position. Market makers are buying shares to cover their naked calls!! options chain for this week and the upcoming weeks is BOOOMING!!!
2021-05-28 13:43:45,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I will take the window seat if you don’t mind. I want to wave goodbye to all the sellers
2021-05-28 13:42:53,wallstreetbets,FUCKING LOVING THIS ACTION!!
2021-05-28 16:05:35,wallstreetbets,"I hope you brought some chips... there is plenty of dip already. One rule, don’t share your shares!"

2021-05-28 15:50:30,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the party! Enjoy the ride and hold onto the shares for dear life!
2021-05-28 10:27:10,wallstreetbets,Life without risk isn’t worth living

2021-05-28 10:39:16,wallstreetbets,"10 million apes.

Not our first rodeo.

Lower float.

This will dwarf the GME uncertainty squeeze."
2021-05-28 13:07:31,wallstreetbets,Ao what do you say we just lost a bunch of money
2021-05-28 15:16:45,wallstreetbets,Absolutely
2021-05-28 15:03:38,wallstreetbets,And that’s why no one will remember your name.
2021-05-28 17:38:01,wallstreetbets,How much premium did you get?
2021-05-28 15:37:39,wallstreetbets,What are those going for?
2021-05-28 12:14:18,wallstreetbets,More room every minute!
2021-05-28 12:32:28,wallstreetbets,Hold on tight! It’s gonna be a bumpy ride!
2021-05-28 12:30:46,wallstreetbets,1000%
2021-05-28 13:00:31,wallstreetbets,Taking the good with the bad. I went to bed down $2000 and woke up $7000 up... this is what the game is about
2021-05-28 13:05:48,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah!
2021-05-28 13:08:29,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah!
2021-05-28 13:44:45,wallstreetbets,Did you say “sold”? What is that?
2021-05-28 14:04:09,wallstreetbets,True true... bad play on my part
2021-05-28 15:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes, delicious"
2021-05-28 16:13:00,wallstreetbets,Perfect freaking attitude! You just made the Christmas card list!
2021-05-28 10:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Your yolo post was $2,000 in shares"
2021-05-28 18:40:41,wallstreetbets,"If the hype gets crazy and ever other posts is about a specific stock your to late to the party. Its not time to buy, its time to sell else your just bag-holding fool for those that got in early."
2021-05-28 13:19:07,wallstreetbets,HOLD!!
2021-05-28 13:08:11,wallstreetbets,I got my tickets for the rocket ride. Not missing it

2021-05-28 13:11:11,wallstreetbets,I sure hope Clov gets a big squeeze!
2021-05-28 13:42:26,wallstreetbets,Praying for us both bro. Just need a cool 38% increase or so and I'll be fine 😂😂
2021-05-28 15:25:02,wallstreetbets,"Seeing to much of this. And yall retards wonder why its down. If everyone who bought 0 DTE calls today used the money for shares, imagine where we'd be."
2021-05-28 18:05:55,wallstreetbets,This is 100% true. All the stocks I've been following have either tanked or accelerated due to other reasons than the original DD.
2021-05-28 11:03:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah you're safe. My calls expire 6/4. My breakeven is embarrassingly high. I was planning on holding them for like 10-20 mins and then selling for profit and buying shares. Instantly down over 100 and then it just got worse and worse and worse
2021-05-28 17:48:56,wallstreetbets,So buy calls on red and buy puts on green?
2021-05-28 16:07:34,wallstreetbets,"I bought amc calls every day this week today was the first day I didn't get a 80-120+ same day return

I just happened to throw in way more money than I had been all week and lost everything I made and then some."

2021-05-28 19:02:27,wallstreetbets,No he means don’t buy calls on big green says because the They’re crazy expensive already due to the volatility and your breakeven is crazy high and theta crush is always there too
2021-05-28 15:23:02,wallstreetbets,maybe but not today
2021-05-28 12:05:33,wallstreetbets,That is a great ability. Now you just need to let us know so we can use this ability of yours.

2021-05-28 13:09:34,wallstreetbets,It's not real market market cap. It's a gamma squeeze and I think soon enough it'll correct to $15

2021-05-28 16:17:53,wallstreetbets,I will leave it on the rocket ship and you can just open it up on Christmas.
2021-05-28 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,Lmao normally I'd let you borrow it but I need it my man. Bought my calls for 700 each they're now worth a whopping 120  😂
2021-05-28 19:04:50,wallstreetbets,So no calls green or red and no puts green or red?
2021-05-28 16:17:03,wallstreetbets,That's okay. It's got a nice long 3 day weekend to build its energy back up
2021-05-28 13:23:46,wallstreetbets,"sorry, what in the everliving fuck are you talking about? It will go to $90, wait... will correct to $15. You understand the gap there right? PICK ONE"

2021-05-28 18:50:24,wallstreetbets,lol thanks for sharing this
2021-05-28 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,The keyword is “big” green or red days dude. Theta will crush you most likely. And thos contracts expiring worthless is horrible waste of money when it could’ve gone towards shares.
2021-05-28 13:26:15,wallstreetbets,Lol. There's no guarantee it'll go to 90. That's like a 90billion dollar market cap for a cinema company. And in the past when it exploded it fell back down didn't it? Don't get crazy with profits
2021-05-28 10:58:18,wallstreetbets,I bought originally at 12 sat on it for a while then at 31 finally said fuck it and pulled the trigger
2021-05-28 10:59:08,wallstreetbets,Buy back at that $29 dip or nah? Gotta keep to the code.

2021-05-28 11:38:01,wallstreetbets,Also did a call and it instantly dropped lmao
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PTON When you take the time to investigate, use a little ingenuity, and you know how to do math, you will discover just how much PTON Bike sales are expected to Decline sequentially.
1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":
$184.45M x 3 = $553.35M"
2021-05-28 10:12:12,wallstreetbets,Can you repost this with line breaks...
2021-05-28 14:32:33,wallstreetbets,As a peloton owner I love the bike and the service. I think the apparel can make them a ton of money if they become a name brand like under armor or nike. I do not have a position in the stock because I definitely think it’s overvalued in the short term.
2021-05-28 10:29:55,wallstreetbets,TL;DR
2021-05-28 12:23:58,wallstreetbets,I bought the crash and it's up 25% from there so I'm happy

2021-05-28 16:53:24,wallstreetbets,under armor is doing horribly. can i ask you why you wouldnt buy an actual mountain bike and hit the trails? its one of the most fun things to do and it seems way better than being stuck inside a home on a fake bike

2021-05-28 10:19:12,wallstreetbets,"I still don’t get how people don’t get how options work. 

I’ll explain. 

He bought 18 contracts at .59 cents. 
.59 x 1800 (100 shares per contract) resulting in 1 K

The contract was for 17C... current share price let’s say it’s 33$. 

33 - 17 you get yourself 16. 

16 x 1800 = 25 k +

Upvote comment for people to see how this shit works.

Also you can lose money just as fast.

Edit: there’s premiums you pay for the contract itself hoping to be “ITM” as long as your in the money you’re good. Had a work meeting. Wrote it in 5 min and tried my best to ELI5.

Edit 2: Thank you for all the awards. 🙏

Edit 3: There is a lot of stuff online to give you a better understanding of what an option is. Please proceed with caution.

Edit 4: The Black Scholes Model determines the price of an option."

2021-05-28 16:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Buy:  17c @ .59 x 18 contracts (.59 x 100 x 18) = -$1062 (risk)

$17.59 is break-even stock price (strike + premium)

Sell to close: 17c @ 19.00 x 18 (19 x 100 x 18) = $34,200 (reward)

Profit: 34,200 - 1,062 = $33,138

* Also, if a stock is doing well, wouldn't the call options ""go up in price""? Could you somehow use option premiums to figure out nearterm future pressure on stock price?"

2021-05-28 17:40:59,wallstreetbets,There is a pretty large bid/ask spread. You probably need your make your bid to be closer to the ask for the contract to be assigned
2021-05-28 11:27:31,wallstreetbets,"Your own money, you can lose up to the premium you paid, for calls you want the price to go up and vice versa for put, I’m pretty sure you have to apply for them on TD but I’m not sure"
2021-05-28 11:41:03,wallstreetbets,"There are others in this comment section that have touched on it, but I’ll give it a go here for kicks.

Calls are basically contracts that allow someone to buy 100 shares of a stock per 1 contract after the stock reaches a strike price.

So if you see 20C, that means it’s a call with a strike price of 20.  If the market value of the stock is over 20 by expiration, you can exercise the contract and buy the 100 shares at the price of 20 apiece.  

However, there’s a premium you’ll have paid for the right to do this; let’s say it’s .59.  That means you pay .59 per share in the contract (so .59*100=59) and that’s your cost to buy the call up front, is 59.  This means the stock value needs to hit 20.59 for you to come out even from exercising the call option.  After that, you would make whatever the price is -20.59= Your total profit.

Puts are the opposite: you buy a contract that allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. So 17P would be a put that gives you the right to sell a stock for 17 if it happens to go below that price.  Again, it has to go lower than 17-(your premium you paid) for you to make money exercising it.

Keep in mind, you don’t have to wait and try exercise it.  You can keep an eye on what your contract premiums are for that type of contract, and if it goes up in value, you can sell the contract you bought to someone else for a bigger premium than what you paid for it.  This is how a lot of people make their money on options, not from actually exercising them.

Also keep in mind that the options, if they expire without reaching the strike price in either direction, become worthless.  It’s more of a gamble than straight up stocks.

I’m thinking you can figure out what you’re hoping the stock will do depending on which one you bought (and conversely, which one you sell, if you’re offering the option initially, where you’re the one that’s allowing someone to buy 100 shares at a price or sell their 100 shares to you at a certain price).

TD you’ll probably want to visit the good old Google to see where their options buying and selling are.  Options require a decent amount of investment into learning them and how to buy and sell them, so it seems like it would be doing you a disservice just handing you all the info on how to get that set up so that you end up falling into it without really knowing anything about them."

2021-05-28 14:18:36,wallstreetbets,"a Call option gives you the right to buy stock at a specified strike price, A put option gives you the option to sell a stock at a specified strike price.  


For a call option to be in the money, the current trade value must be greater than the strike price. You make money on the difference between values ( Market - Strike).   


A put option is the opposite, you make money when the market value falls below your strike price (Strike - Market).   


Each contract is for 100 shares. Options have an execute date but you can execute them anytime before then, but after they expire you can no longer exercise them.   


You can either exercise the option (so for a call, choose to purhcase the stock) which means you need 100 \* Strike Price to buy them....then you can sell the stock to make your money or you can sell the contract directly to someone else."

1 contract = 100 shares.

2021-05-28 10:45:55,wallstreetbets,"17C is 17 Call option. There is also put which would be written as 20P.

The number is what you expect the price of the share to be before expiration. With a 17C, you want the share to go above 17 before expiration.
With a 20P, you want the share price to go below 20 before expiration.

Usually, the 17C would be followed by the expiration date."
2021-05-28 11:39:13,wallstreetbets,"I see people tried to answer some of this, but didn't break it down to its very basic explanation.

A 17c... Is a call for $17.  The $17 is called the ""strike price."" The strike price is what he is gambling on (the contract allows him to buy 100 shares at $17).  That is, if he purchased the call out of the money, being that the share price was less than $17, the closer that it gets to $17, or if it exceeds $17, the value of the call contract increases.

The price doesn't have to go to $17 to make money, but in the best case world, the share price would exceed $17...as it has.

A call contract is for a hundred shares.  So a 59 cent $17 call actually cost $59 (59 cents * 100 shares). 

The expiration date, is the point at which either the call option is exercised or it expires worthless.  It would expire worthless if the current share price is lower than the strike price.  As an example, it would make no sense to exercise a $17 call if the share price is $15. In short, exercising it would cost you $1,700 to buy the 100 shares, when you can buy it on the open market for $1,500.

You can exercise a call option at any time, which allows you to purchase the hundred shares at the strike price.  

So if the share price is $33, one contract allows the person that owns it to exercise it and purchase 100 shares at $17 each.  The $59 premium is not the purchase price of the shares, that was the premium to have the right to purchase 100 shares. So exercising the call is still going to cost him $1,700 ($17*100 shares). 

The vast majority of people do not exercise contracts.  They buy the contract, and then sell it after it's value increases before the expiration date. Or they buy a contract, and it expires worthless.

The majority of people that play with contracts lose money."
2021-05-28 10:39:58,wallstreetbets,"Your hoping the share price hits 17... the chances of that hitting was slim to none in such a short period of time (June 4th) 
Now that the price has gone up significantly, those contracts are now “at the 17 dollars” plus whatever the stock is. 

The contract was for 17/share

The share price is 33/share

33 - 17 is 16.

16 x 1800 shares is 25K +

To lazy for math."
2021-05-28 10:48:52,wallstreetbets,"17c is the strike of the call option he bought ( he thinks the stock will go up to $17/share)
$0.59 means the option cost $59.00 ea.
Or about $1000 for 18 calls of amc $17 call options 

Does the help a little bit, I’m just learning myself"
2021-05-28 11:43:55,wallstreetbets,It’s 59 cents a share to borrow there’s 100 shares in 1 contract that’s 59.00 for the contract it’s just easy math....!it’s that easy
2021-05-28 12:38:51,wallstreetbets,I don't understand why people just don't simply Google.

2021-05-28 14:10:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-28 14:30:15,wallstreetbets,"This is a great explanation. 

And yes, Google is great, but sometimes I just like to have acquire knowledge via conversation rather than blog posts or YouTube. 

To further understand, I’d like to ask about the typical criteria that I’d fill up when buying options. 

- let’s say a stock is currently at $10
- and I think that in 1 year (or sooner), the price will be $20
- i could buy 100 shares today, and if I’m right, then I’ll double my money when it reaches $20. 
- but that’s also risky, because my confidence isn’t 100%. 
- therefore i choose a less-risky alternative: “call options”
- each “call” comes in bundles of 100, no more, no less. So 2 calls would be 200. 
- i pay a premium of $0.50 per share. For 1 call, that’s 100 shares, each at $0.50 premium, totaling a cost of $50.  The most money I can lose is $50. 
- when buying, I choose the expiration date.  Extending the date is doable, but will cause the premium to go up. 
- so lets say 6 months down the line, my contract is only halfway to expiration.  And the price went up 50% (from $10 to $15). So it hasn’t doubled (yet).  But now I’m getting cold feet and paper hands. I have the right to exercise my option to buy the stocks now at $10/share (even though market value is $15). That is, I do not have to wait for the market value of the stock to hit a certain threshold. I can exercise whenever I want (theoretically, even at a loss if i wanted to). 
- my profit is now 50% of my principal investment, minus the $50 cost of premium. 
- but after exercising the call, im still simply holding stocks, not cash.  In order to claim the money, i need to sell those stocks. 

Do i have all of the correct?"
2021-05-28 14:20:53,wallstreetbets,"It's not about the platform, Questrade's IQ Edge is one of the better trading views, it's the fact that you're using the basic-ass Questrade website for options trading. This means you probably did zero market analysis (since there's none to be had on the browser version) and just chucked $1k at a position and got lucky. 

Also options trading isn't gambling any more than buying shares are, unless you buy 1 week expiries like you YOLO'ed on...you were definitely gambling and got double zero's."
2021-05-28 10:37:31,wallstreetbets,Now go practice on BB!
2021-05-28 12:46:05,wallstreetbets,"I never once said I didn't close out my position. In fact, I mentioned in one of the comments I did.

2021-05-28 18:48:50,wallstreetbets,Thats 101 pretty good
2021-05-28 16:25:17,wallstreetbets,"I only play options when I know a very volatile stock will make a big move. With T35 and T21 occuring this week, calls were all but a guaranteed bet. I turned 2k into 30k on gme this week. And 5k into 15k on BB. I won't be playing again until I have a sure bet, or I'm very ok with throwing away the money. I'll probably gamble as much as 5k of my winnings on something I'm less sure of. But never just play weeklies for shits. That's just playing a very expensive lottery."

If you still don’t get how options work, don’t do it."
2021-05-28 12:40:37,wallstreetbets,This was very useful with the context you provided.
2021-05-28 18:13:04,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, this is very helpful (from someone who has been researching options but had not yet done any)."
2021-05-28 11:53:11,wallstreetbets,"So with a call option the worst you can do is lose the fee for the contract but with a put, short,  you have the potential to lose huge? 

Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm new and just buy and hold."
2021-05-28 12:06:47,wallstreetbets,So u saying most ppl who buy the contract doesn't exercise it but sell it fir higher value... but who are they selling to?
2021-05-28 14:41:13,wallstreetbets,Thank you for sharing this info. So you would only wanna exercise a call option if you knew or had a strong feeling the shares were going to grow to that strike price in a short period of time where you can close your position - basically what this guy did ?
2021-05-28 14:03:44,wallstreetbets,"I have a few questions. 

1. Why would it not make sense to make a $17 call if the stock is 15? Is this because the premium wouldn't be worth the minimal increase in value? 

2. In OP's example, were the 59 cents chosen as a price by the stock exchange, or did they select that price? 

3. How much money do I need to initiate a call?"
2021-05-28 15:25:42,wallstreetbets,"I think what I don't fully understand is let's say he buys the contract at $17 but the stock drops to $15. It's worthless and he doesn't exercise, got it!  So, he loses the .59 x however many shares.  In this case it's a 1K investment.  As long as that share value goes up at any point, he's in the money.  But what gets me is when I see people lose tens of thousands of dollars when the stock goes down, and they keep losing money when the stock keeps going down. In this case, it seems AMC could go to $1 and it wouldn't matter, he would still only lose the 1K.  Is that correct?  If so, why do some make these investments where they can lose so much rather than just make this investment where the loss is just capped at the premium?"
2021-05-28 11:45:18,wallstreetbets,"this is how this sounds in my head

""the 17c strike call topn and bout thinks stock will go to $17 but no, $.59 equals $59 or just about $100 for 18 cents of AMC for $17"""
2021-05-28 13:30:57,wallstreetbets,Ouchhhh
2021-05-28 11:37:36,wallstreetbets,"i only have one question


are contracts always 100 shares?"
2021-05-28 10:44:36,wallstreetbets,Facts.

2021-05-28 10:46:05,wallstreetbets,Can anyone trade with questrade?  Do you need a minimum amount in your account to buy calls? I'm using wealth simple .
2021-05-28 17:36:45,wallstreetbets,I just don’t have the extra money to do it and possibly lose. Lol I would rather buy a share or 5 at price then throw it away trying an option for the first time.

2021-05-28 19:34:36,wallstreetbets,Wow! this is insane to me. I am from Saudi Arabia and I can’t open an account on the commonly used trading apps most of you use. My bank has its own app that allows buy/sell of shares and options in US stock market. But the app is poorly set up and offers little to no help on how to buy options. Also i think it doesn’t allow empty option trading. You actually have to buy the stocks.

2021-05-28 10:36:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes they were OOM on Monday. I believe the share price was around $13-14. I thought to myself, I see the volume and I don't know for sure if it'll go up, but I was willing to part ways with a few hundred bucks if it did go the wrong way. 

Not only did it go the correct way, but it never looked back lol."
2021-05-28 12:36:06,wallstreetbets,Can I get a flair?
2021-05-28 13:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure. I have a few friends on IBKR who told me that as well. I actually don't do a lot of options trading. This was an exception, albeit an incredible one. Also, in this case the fees were pretty nominal compared to the profits haha."
2021-05-28 10:24:53,wallstreetbets,"You’re placing a bet that the stock will reach a price. Each call is a multiple of 100 stocks. Here, it seems he called that the stock would reach 17.25 by June 4 and got 18 calls. That would be 1800 stocks, but instead of buying them outright you pay a premium for each stock, here it was 0.59 per for a total of 1,062. If the stock hits and goes above your call price + premium you would make as much money as you want until you sell or the date passes. If the stock doesn’t hit, you would lose the cost of your premium."
2021-05-28 17:22:39,wallstreetbets,"The theory is roughly accurate, the big point is that the premium will most definitely be higher than that if you’re buying in-the-money calls, so you could (and if it’s a stock with any show of growth, probably would) be paying a $5 premium for that call, so you’d be barely at the breakeven point.

The other point of issue that comes into play with options is that you need to have capital to exercise the options, so if you’re exercising your $10 call you’ll need $1000 available to pay for the shares.  It’s generally not doable to exercise and simply try to turn around and sell the shares to recover the costs to pay for them, it starts breaking liquidation rules.

So what you may do instead is see what those calls are selling for.  Let’s say, people are paying $5 for the premium over your (let’s say) $2.50 initial premium.  You can just sell the option to one of them for a x2 return on your $250, so $500. No requirement to have more cash to settle shares, just money in your account.

You don’t need to have cash to exercise with in this case, and the returns are a lot better than what you’d have made exercising the stocks.  So if you were to buy $1000 of shares, or $1000 of options, you’d have a higher potential return from the options.  They can also crash and expire worthless, which means you’re out the $1000, whereas shares probably will still have value.

Not to be mean mate, but on the learning front, there’s a difference between 

“I could talk for hours about the characteristics of the hornydog bonefish.” 

‘Oh really? I’d like to hear about it.’

vs

“Holy moley guys look at these thousands of dollars in unrealized gains I have on this gamble I took with a risky market tool on a volatile stock.”

‘Hey how do I turn that thing on for my account?’

Being willing to go actively seeking the answers helps ensure people who get caught up in the hype don’t hurt themselves.  This is a subreddit for big gambles after all."
2021-05-28 14:37:25,wallstreetbets,The hell are you on? You don't need market data to yolo on AMC these things run 100% on sentiment lmao. And most people use tradingview for TA anyway.
2021-05-28 14:26:57,wallstreetbets,"Please enlighten me on your market analysis. What analysis would you have done for AMC, a literal meme stock? I'd really like to know. 

Also, I'd really like to hear how you think I would have benefitted from my $1k bet using IQ Edge over the basic platform."
2021-05-28 14:34:01,wallstreetbets,the only thing more retarded than that is acting surprised that someone buying $1k in AMC weeklies on wsb might not be doing a 'market analysis' using Questrade's IQ Edge.

Apparently some people can’t comprehend math. 

I understand options can be confusing, but it is pretty straight forward how I explained it. What I explained is basic fundamentals of options. 

I won’t even be getting into the Greeks."
2021-05-28 11:30:46,wallstreetbets,Some people can’t read... so I got no hate for no one.
2021-05-28 17:24:04,wallstreetbets,Correct. Which puts you negative however much you put.
2021-05-28 19:05:21,wallstreetbets,"> So you can't swing in the negative you just lose what you put up?

You could ""swing negative"" if you're dumb enough to exercise an OTM option (and able to actually do it)."
2021-05-28 14:49:23,wallstreetbets,Before it expires yes
2021-05-28 15:13:46,wallstreetbets,"You can buy options REALLY far out, like 2-3 years out. They tend to cost more but you have more of a chance to make money. They're called Long Calls. If your call ends at the end of the week, you can sell you option any day until the last minute of the trading week."
2021-05-28 18:52:54,wallstreetbets,Only 9 years for me
2021-05-28 16:31:55,wallstreetbets,That's why trading in options is even more like gambling than purely trading in stocks. But the true value in options is being able to hedge potential losses and reduce the volatility of your portfolio but that's a bit more advanced idea.
2021-05-28 17:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Call options aren't too risky you just lose the premium you pay for the contract if it expires out of the money, in this case $1000."
2021-05-28 12:26:57,wallstreetbets,I’m getting tired lol.
2021-05-28 10:45:43,wallstreetbets,"I sold some to get back my initial investment. Don’t blame yourself for making a profit.

2021-05-28 11:53:40,wallstreetbets,So it’s worth .59 per share but the amount that buying is at 100 which makes it worth a lot more???
2021-05-28 12:45:06,wallstreetbets,Thanks.
2021-05-28 11:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I would say that normally the worst you can do is lose the premium when you purchase a call option. I don't know what happens if the call expires in the money, and you don't have the money to buy the shares. But again, most people don't keep options until their expiration date, they sell them prior to realize the increase in value.

I have not played with puts yet, so can't explain them. I'm still busy getting my ass kicked with calls...😐"
2021-05-28 12:22:50,wallstreetbets,"I guess you'd have to put it in the context of how many times did it change hands before it finally got exercised?  How many call contracts are purchased and expire worthless?

I mean, eventually it will get exercise, or expire worthless.

Here's a couple quotes.

""Statistic published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which is that only 10% of option contracts are exercised.""

""10% of options contracts end up being exercised, and 55-60% get closed out before expiration, that leaves only 30-35% of contracts that actually expire worthless."""
2021-05-28 14:52:42,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome

I don't believe I would ever exercise a call option.  But speaking in general concepts, you would never exercise a call option unless the value of the stock increased beyond the strike price, and you were better off exercising the option as compared to buying the stock on the market.  

Let's say you bought a $16 call on a stock that is trading at $16, and paid a premium of a dollar.  That means the call option cost you $100.  But also means that your breakeven point is now $17 a share ($16 strike price, plus the $1 premium).  So if you bought the option, and then turned around and exercised it, you would lose money.  Let's say that the stock price increased to $17 a share.  Now you're at your break-even point, in that if you exercised the contract what you got from each share would total the premium plus the strike price.  But let's say that contract would now sell for $1.25.You would actually be better off selling the contract to close than you would to exercise the contract.  If you exercise it, you would break even. If you sold the contract, you would make $1.25 a share, or $25 profit for every contract that you purchased and then sold.  As you get closer to the expiration date, there is normally less money to be made by selling the contract...but it is still normally better than exercising it.  So as an example, for this $16 call, if the share price increased to $20, the contract would sell for more than $4. So you would be better off selling the contract, as compared to exercising it.

Now just to make sure you understand, exercising a contract is something that you would do after you purchase it. Once you purchase a contract, if you exercise it, you then are buying the shares, 100 shares, at the strike price.  So using my example above, if you exercise this contract with a strike price of $16, you are going to be buying 100 shares for $1,600... No matter what the share is selling for in the open market, that contract with a $16 strike, can be exercised for $16 a share.

If you meant, when you said ""exercise,"" to purchase a call... Yes, you would only want to purchase a call on a stock that you believed was going to increase in value.  If you believe the stock was going to go down in value, you would want to purchase a put.  If the stock trades sideways, you're going to lose money, because the extrinsic value of the call option is going to decrease as it gets closer to the expiration date...being worth zero at the expiration date."
2021-05-28 14:34:52,wallstreetbets,"1.  It's all a gamble. Some people buy in the money calls, some people buy out of the money calls.  Making up numbers, but let's say that the stock is currently trading at $15 a share...and let's say a $14.50 call is $1.60.    In reality, if you buy the call, and then exercise it, it actually cost you $16.10 per share ($14.50 plus the $1.60 premium).  But you are less likely for the contract to expire worthless. The same stock trading at $15 a share, you can buy a $17 call for $0.59.  So the break-even point becomes $17.59.   if the expiration date for this call is 2 months out, and later the stock is trading at $16 a share, now the contract is worth more than 59 cents....so you can sell the contract at a profit.   Better yet, during those two months the stock goes to $33 a share. You could exercise the contract and purchase 100 shares for $1,700...and turn around and sell them for $3,300.  Or you can sell the contract for a gross profit, without exercising it.  

So I guess it comes down to how much you believe in the stock going up in value, and how much you're willing to gamble on that happening. 

2. Contract price is chosen by the person selling the contract. Of course just like a stock, a contract isn't going to sell for a price that the market does not dictate.   That is, nobody's going to pay a dollar for a contract that everybody else is selling for 0.59.  So you could say the market sets the price, or you could say the seller sets the price, but I guess it's kind of a combination of the two.

3. You need to be approved by your brokerage firm to be able to purchase contracts. At least that's how it works for me with Charles Schwab.  I filled out an application, and they still did not approve me for the level that I wanted... So I called them up and the person I talked to played 20 questions with me, once they knew that I understood options, they approved me for the level that I wanted.  I know that doesn't really answer your question, but is the first step to being able to trade options.  There really isn't a minimum or a maximum amount of money you need for options trading.  Looking at amc, the calls that expire a week from now, vary in price from $1.29, to $29 (realize that the $1.29 contract is going to cost $129, and the $29 contract is going to cost $2,900 to purchase).  They vary based on the strike price that you select and the expiration date. If you pick a strike price, and then look at the same strike price that expires at a later date, the price will be higher.  But this starts to get into intrinsic and extrinsic values, that you would probably be better off learning by watching a YouTube video.  Anyhow, the extrinsic value of a call option would decay as the option gets closer to expiring.  So with nothing else changing, the value of the option decreases day by day.  So as a general rule, options that expire sooner, have less extrinsic value..."
2021-05-28 16:02:16,wallstreetbets,"Let's say the stock price is at $16 dollars, when he buys the call contract at $17.  The stock price drops to $15.  If it doesn't get to the expiration date, he hasn't lost all of his money yet. The contract might now be worth $0.25.  if the call contract expires and the stock price is $15, then yes, it's worthless.

The upside is why people invest in options.  In this case he invested $1,000, and made what, $25,000?   The downside, is that most people lose money investing in options.  The number that commonly thrown around is 10%, 10% of options traders are successful."

2021-05-28 19:22:14,wallstreetbets,........
2021-05-28 16:00:54,wallstreetbets,".59 is the per-share premium to buy the contract (this changes like a stock price based on several factors). In this example, $59 per contract gives you the right but, not the obligation to buy 100 shares @ $17 by expiration. For a 17C ($17 strike, Call option), the break-even, in this case, would then be $17.59. (strike + premium) so, if the stock price goes above 17.59 you make money, either by a) selling a 17C and collecting the difference in premiums or b) exercising the option (buying 100 shares @ 17) and selling or holding long stock, that's your choice.  The risk in this scenario is the premium you paid for the contract so, $59. If the price doesn't go above 17.59, you would either c) sell to close at a lower premium and lose the difference or d) let the contract expire worthlessly and you forfeit the max $59"
2021-05-28 18:04:37,wallstreetbets,You're not buying actual shares. It's a premium/fee for the option.
2021-05-28 12:05:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes. The cost of the contract (premium) is .59 per share. But an option contract is always a bundle of 100 shares per contract.

A .59 contract would cost you $59 to buy."

2021-05-28 17:39:37,wallstreetbets,Definitely true that’s why I’m all in on shares but not confident enough to do the options yet

2021-05-28 15:18:40,wallstreetbets,"Get a white board and write down some options you were planning on doing, then figure out how much you would have made/lost. It's not worth losing 1k or more on options because you didn't understand something. If you fuck something up on white board options, you can figure out what went wrong and you can research it more for options down the line.

Remember, with Calls, if you buy a call option for $1,000, you  can only lose that $1,000, but if the price goes over your strike price, you can make unlimited gains.

Same with puts, if you buy a put option for $1,000, you can lose that $1,000 if the price goes up, but if it tanks from $50 per share to $20 per share, you just made a FUCK ton of money.

Each Option is ONLY for 100 shares. You can buy a call option for $1.00, which would cost you $100, meaning the price has to be $1.00 higher than what it currently was at option purchase to even break even. Every $1.00 it goes above your break-even price, you gain $100. Do some research before losing $25,000 because of a dumb mistake."

2021-05-28 12:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Contracts are odd compared to buying and selling normal shares.

That is, you can sell to open a contract, or sell to close a contract. You can buy to open a contract, or buy to close a contract.

So if you're the person with 100 shares, that sold the call contract on the shares (sold to open a contract), you could buy the contract to close it out (buy to close).  You can actually close it out at a profit, or a loss...but you can close the contract out instead of having to sell your hundred shares if it gets exercised (that is you can close it out before it's exercised)...or you can close the contract out to realize a gain that would happen if the value of the contracts decreased."
2021-05-28 15:22:29,wallstreetbets,You're welcome
2021-05-28 16:28:57,wallstreetbets,"In the instance of the call option, yes, the most he could lose is what he used to purchase the option contracts, in this case $1,000.

Are you referring to the hedge funds?  If so, they shorted stocks. That is they borrowed shares of stock, and sold them. They are responsible for returning the same number of stock shares, no matter what the price is.  So let's say they borrowed 100 million shares at $4 and sold them, they have $400 million. They are gambling that the price of the stocks will go down.  No matter what the cost of the stock, they owe 100 million shares to the people they borrowed it from. So if the price of the stock goes down to $3 a share, they give the hundred million shares back at a cost of $300 million, and get to pocket the other $100 million.  

So now let's say the stock goes up in value. If their shares are called, they have to return that quantity of shares no matter what the cost is. A bunch of people buy into the stock, and hold the stock, and are unwilling to sell it, the price goes way up.  So if the price is now $400 a share, they still owe 100 million shares of stock to the entity they borrowed them from. Now they have to buy those hundred million shares at $40 billion dollars and return them. So in this example they are out $39,600,000...and the cost of borrowing the shares.

Hopefully all my math is correct in that explanation."

2021-05-28 11:53:10,wallstreetbets,The positive side of bb is at its current prize it is a good buy regardless of the squeeze situation. If it does not work to shoot it to the moon for any reason you will have your gains in a few years anyway when ivy drops in 2022 or 2023. Not selling before 25 dollars.
2021-05-28 13:16:24,wallstreetbets,"BB Makes way more sense at this price than AMC.

This should be the new rocket."
2021-05-28 13:29:48,wallstreetbets,"Before AMC joined the ranks of GME... Everyone was saying ""gMe oNLy all oTheRs aRe diStraCtion!!"". Then AMC went and did its thing and you guys started saying "" GME AND AMC ONLY! everything else is a distraction!!!""

In a month, you will be saying ""AMC, GME and BB only!!!"" 

Dont follow the trend, see the trend before it becomes a trend.  BB to the moon 🌙 🚀"

2021-05-28 13:58:16,wallstreetbets,"Bought at $11.48 (Canadian) for 2000 shares a while ago.

I was bagholding for a long time and figured I would sell as soon as I get to break even point but now that the WSB retards are on this train, I may as well hold for a little bit longer and wait for the moon or sell when it starts to crash again."

2021-05-28 15:43:43,wallstreetbets,"Only cus of long weekend, small dip to where the stocks gonna get up to. Look at that juicy trade volume for a $10 stock"
2021-05-28 12:03:22,wallstreetbets,"Cyber attacks are the new form of terrorism. Just last week the entire healthcare system in Ireland was attacked by cyber criminals, resulting in delays of MRI’s, surgeries, and a tonne of lost data. They wanted a ransom of 20m euro (which wasn’t paid). This is due to the cyber security being old fashioned. I am confident that many other countries are in the same boat, of having outdated/very little cyber security. Blackberry is one of the big boys in the cyber security sector, so long term blackberry looks very solid."
2021-05-28 12:16:58,wallstreetbets,you are a retard
2021-05-28 14:03:42,wallstreetbets,"Dude I work a 9-5 and do this on the side. I’m putting 1k in due to risk. If I come out with even 200 bucks made, that’s 200 dollars more than I had. If you come out with 20 bucks, same story. The goal is to keep ur head looking at everything and not trying to get lucky only on a bet. Down the line, you will be wiser when you have more money to invest."
2021-05-28 16:24:38,wallstreetbets,When moon?
2021-05-28 10:48:03,wallstreetbets,BB and NOK were the conservative options and realistically valued companies.  I bought them too.  Thats where we went wrong.
2021-05-28 10:05:10,wallstreetbets,Same. My options were all down 90%. Please fly
2021-05-28 10:11:08,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha same broski holding tho

2021-05-28 14:19:46,wallstreetbets,I think this guys already rich if he has a spare million dollars to freely throw into one stock.

2021-05-28 15:42:50,wallstreetbets,The news is that it's the next memestock in line and people don't wanna miss out on huge profits ...

2021-05-28 18:18:09,wallstreetbets,That’s the mindset. I want the stock to be worth 100. So it is.
2021-05-28 15:23:40,wallstreetbets,U just made me feel a tiny bit better about the bag ive been holding since Jan.
2021-05-28 13:29:55,wallstreetbets,Need $16 to break even. Pleas fly again
2021-05-28 18:04:13,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, I had mine set to sell when it got back up to 50% loss. I honestly haven’t been paying attention the last two weeks until I got a trade confirmation from TDA. Didn’t realize it was about to moon again"
2021-05-28 17:16:12,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why its going to the  moon? And what price would the moon be? I bought two shares at 11.35 a long while ago just for the heck of it and then it dropped
2021-05-28 16:19:07,wallstreetbets,because it's a nice idea
2021-05-28 15:47:04,wallstreetbets,"I think the only logical counter argument you will get here is, why not."
2021-05-28 16:23:06,wallstreetbets,"Cus it can't fall any lower and it's the next memestock and it held well today when others were falling. Very low risk of loss, and very small if so whilst high chance of huge gains. Just look at the trade volume. And even if it doesn't balloon it's a good stock to have hold of.

Put it all together and it's the perfect gamble."
2021-05-28 11:27:54,wallstreetbets,Potential for gamma squeeze the next two weeks.

2021-05-28 12:24:26,wallstreetbets,Save the $28 boysssss
2021-05-28 11:54:59,wallstreetbets,Average down if you have the cash.

2021-05-28 12:27:58,wallstreetbets,"Not at all. I would say learn how to trade options though, thats where the REAL money is. When you see someone on here with huge gains it’s more than likely not because they just bought the stock individually. It’s because they purchased options calls/puts on a stock. Best of luck to you 😉"
2021-05-28 19:22:31,wallstreetbets,Don’t learn calls or puts lol

There's good reason to think this is a great long term stock. That's just based on my own DD. It's also a good time to buy because it's most certainly at its lowest since they have this tech actually in use; they're not just a dying company anymore."

You think GME is gonna fall back to $17 any time soon? No because it's meme hyped. And if it fell too low the apes would be straight back on to gamble again. Same here but less extreme, but if it falls too low it will definitely shoot straight back up for the fact that it is meme hyped. Being a current popular memestock gives it a lot of value. You can see that value very clearly in GME and GME and you'll soon see it in BB too when it starts rising faster and an increasing amount of apes jump on the ship.

Will it fall back down to 7/8? Maybe. Will that be within the next year? No chance at all."

This is literally an unironic “can’t go tits up”. That’s absolutely one of the dumbest things I’ve seen on here.

It was literally more meme-hyped in January than it is now, what happened in February and March? 

BB has nowhere near the meme appeal of GME and AMC, and you’re massively overestimating the amount that retail dictates the prices of large caps. People here are lying to themselves if they don’t think whales are playing into the meme hype to enrich themselves.

RemindMe! 3 months “How long did it take for BB to fall under $8 again?”"

2021-05-28 17:42:28,wallstreetbets,"I agree with what you wrote, but what do you think their long term share price will be? I don't see why it would matter if it dips to 8. They already have their QNX tech and others in almost 200,000,000 vehicles. Seems pretty unlikely that 6-8 will be their market value in the future."
2021-05-28 17:46:03,wallstreetbets,"The point is that in can only fall that low again now after a huge gain spike. So there'll always be the chance of profiting from it while the gains are happening. And if it does fall again after a huge gain it will hold at a higher value than it did before because it'll have more memeability. Look at every single meme stock after a gain and fall, they all hold higher still after the huge gain / fall than they did before it. Prove me wrong?"
2021-05-28 17:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: I have a few hundred BB shares.

For me, at this point after watching BB take a hit in the market for months, it comes down to a few main points. 

1. The market does *not* seem to favor BB in the way that it’s lenient to the rest of the tech sector in terms of growth potential vs current revenue.

2. Good tech does not necessarily imply good revenue. BB hasn’t yet fully convinced me that they stand to make a killing off their tech, even if it’s the best in its niche.

3. Opportunity cost. How long am I willing to let this thing trade sideways before it starts reflecting the quality of its tech? What if it hits a valuation in the meme craze that reflects what its valuation should be on fundamentals in a year? Why should I park my money in BB for years when there are potentially better plays in the meantime?

I can’t give you a price target, and anyone here who confidently throws a number out of their ass is completely full of shit. I’d honestly be surprised if it becomes stable at or above $15 EOY on non-meme valuation, but again, it’s impossible to know. 

Personally, I’ll probably dump my shares during the meme hype and pick some back up after the hype dies."
2021-05-28 18:07:46,wallstreetbets,"You’re using a dataset of 1 point (the late January ‘meme’ run) to attempt to predict the future, and you’re expecting me to pretend you’re making a legitimate argument? 

> Look at every single meme stock after a gain and fall, they all hold higher still after the huge gain / fall than they did before it. Prove me wrong?

Biden is proposing to renew them for 10 years. Sunrun has 15% of float short, so if the clean energy bill proposed by senate passes, or they include the tax credits in the infrastructure bill, get ready for fireworks. Notwithstanding the credits, sunrun is a great company, with most PTs in 70-80s. They also recently announced partnership to install ford f150 chargers/sell them solar. That’s general thesis.

2021-05-28 11:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Financial times article on Jim Cramer BYND pump.
Jim Cramer of CNBC Mad Money fame has never been one to shy away from bodacious market calls that appeal to as broad an investing demographic as possible. In his time, he has inspired everyone from Eric Cartman to your granny (probably) to take a flutter on the market.

But, today before US market open, we were struggling to get our heads around this tweet from the dome-headed financial news host.

What on earth is going on here?


One generous interpretation is that Cramer likes fake meat purveyor Beyond Meat’s stock. Why wouldn’t he? After all the $9bn “growth” company grew, err, 11 per cent last quarter making its valuation of 13 times forward revenues seem totally reasonable. Depending on how you spin it, anyway. So perhaps that’s it?


Or perhaps Cramer is not so subtly signalling to the Reddit retail trading army 

To be honest we don’t have a clue.

But if the latter is the case, the tendie-hungry masses seem to have got the message.

In early trading, Beyond Meat’s stock is up nine per cent to $138 on absolutely no news. They did touch $144 earlier.

Cool.

Here’s an idea, though. If we (and yes, that means even FT Alphaville) want to shed the scaly reputation of professional financial journalism perhaps it is better if we don’t go around suggestively egging on the masses into so-called meme securities?

Actually, we’re talking about CNBC."

2021-05-28 14:27:56,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone on WSB actually feel bullish on Beyond Meat? Sounds like he is actually just talking out his ass.   


For the Reddit army to work you have to have the support of the Reddit Army. I'm not seeing that here (if anything, I'm seeing a sorta ""stick it to the man"" mentality where even if people were bullish on it because of Cramer now they aren't).  


Also, I'm curious if the research he did focused on the frequency of the symbol BYND on Reddit or  the frequency of the word ""Beyond""... because there are a lot of ways to use the word ""beyond"" that wouldn't suggest anything good about this company."

2021-05-28 15:21:37,wallstreetbets,"I screwed up and didn't look at expiration dates when I bought calls... saw I was up $1,400 at one point and was about to sell... but it was on a tear... and logged out... It's worthless and I lost the money $7,000 my wife and I were going to use to help start a life with. Back to square one.... Spill one out for me.... stick a fork in me"
2021-05-28 14:13:25,wallstreetbets,"The wife’s BF is gonna have to wait to use her.

2021-05-28 11:12:12,wallstreetbets,Everyone starts from zero. You got this
2021-05-28 13:44:37,wallstreetbets,">I don't have a lot of money to put into AMC, but I bought  4 shares of AMC the first time around, and I shocked to see it finally go from red to green, and then just skyrocket. 

most people cant afford to buy a trillion shares, but hey you still are in the profit! :D"
2021-05-28 11:25:16,wallstreetbets,Congrats lad
2021-05-28 11:18:38,wallstreetbets,Honest work right there~

2021-05-28 11:49:10,wallstreetbets,Not bad for a potential value of 2 million dollars or more 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 09:53:28,wallstreetbets,I only had 4 too but gain better no gain
2021-05-28 10:57:11,wallstreetbets,I am with you on the 4 share train
2021-05-28 09:46:11,wallstreetbets,I did the same and I’m very happy I decided to put anything in. I got 4.9 shares myself lol
2021-05-28 14:14:17,wallstreetbets,"Even if you put 1 dollar it helps a lot so thanks and keep it up , I promise will be worth it"
2021-05-28 14:19:35,wallstreetbets,I got one share @12.50  here’s to 100K $AMC 🍻

2021-05-28 16:35:59,wallstreetbets,Money is money my dude. Bet it made your day. Which is a good thing in my book. Congrats
2021-05-28 17:50:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, wishing I had focused on AMC. +60 on AMC and down more than that on VXRT."
2021-05-28 19:25:16,wallstreetbets,"I have 8 myself, I think I'll grab another 2 and make it an even 10 while it's at $25 right now. To the moon!"
2021-05-28 19:54:03,wallstreetbets,"I started low too, just been adding alittle at a time and now I’m up to 120 shares with an average of 14.03, buy and hold"
2021-05-28 10:31:02,wallstreetbets,Amc dip rip
2021-05-28 12:05:23,wallstreetbets,Relax for sir. Mr. Buffet says time in the market always beats timing in the market.
2021-05-28 15:24:00,wallstreetbets,I kick myself for not buying at 12 but I’m not jumping in late! BB and UWMC are still at decent levels to buy
2021-05-28 10:52:36,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Mars, and fuck the moon, we are landing on the Sun baby!"
2021-05-28 09:47:26,wallstreetbets,not to be a moronic ape... but I've been out the loop for a few months and didn't buy more AMC than from back in March.... what's the DD? this ship finally taking off like they said it was going to back then? or is it a fluke? help my smooth monkey brain develop a few wrinkles
2021-05-28 11:53:34,wallstreetbets,Really $100 a share? Do you think it will go that high or are you having a bit of fun?
2021-05-28 09:44:56,wallstreetbets,💀
2021-05-28 10:28:49,wallstreetbets,Is that really possible?

2021-05-28 15:25:17,wallstreetbets,I really can’t take the credit. One of my bffs hit big on GME and I’m following his lead. Thankfully I have a lot of 💸💸💸
2021-05-28 15:34:45,wallstreetbets,Hold hold hold
2021-05-28 14:45:19,wallstreetbets,What do you have to lose? Well... the money you invest. That’s what you have to lose.
2021-05-28 11:11:04,wallstreetbets,"If your can spare a square, buy a share."
2021-05-28 11:21:58,wallstreetbets,Yup. Up another $50k since then
2021-05-28 14:43:20,wallstreetbets,My vagina is bigger than your dick 💋
2021-05-28 16:40:42,wallstreetbets,"Gains are gains, no shame in that - just remember to take out your amount for taxes later on!

I had shares at 16.50 and sold at 28.5. After months of those shares being down a ton, I'll take my money and run."
2021-05-28 19:54:26,wallstreetbets,There's no shame in selling especially for profit. Ecept in front of a bunch of primates!
2021-05-28 09:45:35,wallstreetbets,Funny thing is I’m newbie. Didn’t even know what an ape was last week 😵

2021-05-28 12:32:34,wallstreetbets,good intention. but factoring in the fees to trade ( $5 cdn on questrade ) .
2021-05-28 16:07:27,wallstreetbets,How does $1M sound?
2021-05-28 16:36:18,wallstreetbets,I mean not everyone starts from zero.  Quite a few of these people are starting from like... definitely not zero.
2021-05-28 12:03:01,wallstreetbets,"Bought 4 shares at the peak back in January, look at me now!"
2021-05-28 10:31:29,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, I guess we all decided we can commit 4 stocks worth exactly"
2021-05-28 11:44:08,wallstreetbets,Will it keep going up today or fall?
2021-05-28 12:08:29,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of Icarus?
2021-05-28 11:22:04,wallstreetbets,"There's no DD. They're parroting the GME DD, claiming high SI and low float. Reality is Citadel et al hold AMC and are using this to kick the GME can down the road."
2021-05-28 10:22:58,wallstreetbets,Ha! What's DD?
2021-05-28 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,Same here~bought 100 shares AMC then the Red Week happened and I lost so much I had to sell my OTCs and Pennyies to pay for margins. But I held my GME and AMC. Still cant Figure out why AMC is taking off but F it nice to see Green again. 🤣
2021-05-28 12:29:23,wallstreetbets,"He's full of shit. The same people that said GME would hit $4200.69. Manage this realistically and you'll make a good bit of profit. And remember that the ones say ""hodl!"" are the ones selling.

Be smart, don't be a retard. You really going to take advice from somebody on the internet? They don't care if your portfolio blows up."
2021-05-28 12:04:12,wallstreetbets,"1k is possible. 100 inevitable. Sell your house, your car, sell you GD shoes and put it all in this is not financial advice"
2021-05-28 12:04:55,wallstreetbets,I don't see why it cant be both
2021-05-28 13:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday's volume was 600m shares.

Yesterday's shares available to borrow so you can short were around 3m-5m (can't remember exactly, but not more than that). It's in everyone brokerage if they look it up.

Shorts yesterday could not have shorted more than 5m at best.

Borrow fee has been 5%-7% for days now, and has not increased at all this week despite the frenzy.

Bottom line is, retail is selling to retail who are FOMOing like crazy. The shorts have nothing to do with all this crap. Everyone tells each other to hold and that the floor is $500k and that they aren't selling, because they are hoping to sell before them.

There will be a lot of bagholders on this, sadly."
2021-05-28 11:25:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean, sure anything is possible.

What you're looking for is probable.

I mean uh, ooh ooh aah aah"
2021-05-28 11:15:55,wallstreetbets,"it's not impossible.. AMC is trading at a volume of 300 million... that means A LOT of people are buying& selling at the moment. if you look at the break down more people are buying than selling at the moment (marginally) if this keeps up it can pop even further but again no promises as to how high.



edit: not financial advice 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-28 11:04:14,wallstreetbets,"No. Too many people posting here that have no idea about stocks. ""Oh if GME went to $400 then AMC will too"""

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they’ve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they’ve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure. 

So I don’t know what to make of this, is it a real possibility or just BS?"
2021-05-28 09:29:41,wallstreetbets,"CVS and Aetna Insurance merged a couple of years ago. Half of Rite Aid is Walgreens, other half was supposed to go to Albertsons but that deal fell through. I could see Amazon/Whole Foods picking up that part of the company."
2021-05-28 09:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Amazon wouldn’t buy cvs. A few reasons, 1) cvs runs all target pharmacy locations and I’d bet there would be a conflict issue there, 2) Cvs is too large of a buy, 3) cvs owns caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager similar to express scripts.  

The only logical buy is rite aid. 1b market cap vs 45b for Walgreens and 113b for cvs"
2021-05-28 10:43:04,wallstreetbets,"All in all Rite Aid is an attractive buy at the present price. Rite Aid is not for the weak of constitution; diamond hands or something stronger. But once the price goes up it can go to the moon. I understand wsb love affair with AMC and GME, but if you really want to see fireworks, wait until wsb gets behind Rite Aid. Much potential for large gains. Also, if you care, research the Rite Aid backstory. It has everything, and like I have said before, would make a good book/movie. The Rite Aid story is interesting on many levels, and should be taught in business schools as a cautionary tale."
2021-05-28 09:58:17,wallstreetbets,Sold me already
2021-05-28 10:34:44,wallstreetbets,"More likely than Amazon buying Rite Aid is one or more activists getting involved with Rite Aid. Several activists have been considering Rite Aid. One was waiting for the political climate to change (Trump to leave office), before making a move. So now that Trump is out, that barrier is removed and they can move forward if they are still interested. The thing about Rite Aid - it's a wild card. You know something good is going to happen, but you don't know when or what. One caveat is it might be a takeover target with a low ball offer like Cerberus made a couple of years ago. Employees and shareholders of Rite Aid deserve better."
2021-05-28 13:03:22,wallstreetbets,"I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company.  However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens.  In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale.  If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over.  WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost

\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels.   So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment."
2021-05-28 11:13:12,wallstreetbets,It would be the quickest way for Amzn to have a legit national presence in the pharmacy market. Only issue is Rad is only in 26 states after selling stores to walgreens...mostly stores on east/west coast
2021-05-28 09:56:46,wallstreetbets,All Amazon has to do is not treat pharmacists like shit and they will dominate competitors.
2021-05-28 09:30:16,wallstreetbets,I thought Rite Aid had already sold to Walgreens a few years back

2021-05-28 10:26:22,wallstreetbets,"I would say possible but unlikely. Amazon has had the chance to buy Rite Aid for years, and at a cheaper price than today, but has not. When Bezos leaves, maybe things will change."

2021-05-28 11:07:30,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your statement that, ""I understand wsb love affair with AMC and GME, but if you really want to see fireworks, wait until wsb gets behind Rite Aid"".

Rite Aid was a WSB meme stock a few years ago.  Should it be picked up and become a WSB meme stock again, the RAD share price would roar higher.   There are only 55 million RAD shares outstanding (that's 15 million less than GME - Gamestock has outstanding).  Also, the RAD float is only about 25 million shares.  With the heavily level of shorting of the stock that is done by hedge funds in Rite Aid, RAD is primed for a squeeze."

2021-05-28 13:21:03,wallstreetbets,Great post! I confess that I had never even considered Wal Mart as a buyer. But what you said makes a lot of sense. I wonder if this Amazon leak will spur some sort of move by them?
2021-05-28 14:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Good idea. I have seen Walmart casually mentioned in the past. It is always Amazon that most people reference, but someone like Walmart might end up being the suitor."
2021-05-28 12:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Still, a Rite Aid acquisition is the only way to immediately establish a 2,500+ retail pharmacy store foothold in the USA for Amazon."
2021-05-28 09:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Walgreens bought half of Rite Aid stores back in 2019 --- a little more than 1,900 stores total.  
  
Rite Aid ( RAD ) still have more than 2,500 retail pharmacy locations in the USA today and did more than $24 billion in revenue last year (---which is amazing when you consider that the market cap based on today's stock price is only $1 billion)."
2021-05-28 09:32:48,wallstreetbets,"They bought about 45% of Rite Aid, but the rest stayed independent. The albertsons thing was a scheme cooked up by Rite Aid’s CEO to give himself a 20 million a year job as CEO of Albertsons. The big shareholders of Rite Aid killed it.

Oddly, that former Rite Aid CEO is now head of the US divisions of Walgreens. So you’d think they’d just buy the other half, but so far nothing has happened."
2021-05-28 09:58:50,wallstreetbets,"That was another thing they gave me pause for thought, I think they spent like $8 billion on that or something? 

Does Amazon actually have the cash on hand to spend another four or 5 billion or whatever it will be buying Rite Aid? 

I know Amazon is a huge company but they can’t have that much cash laying around to just keep buying other companies. Or maybe they do, I really don’t know.￼"
2021-05-28 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid needs to scale up to re-establish a national presence.  The Bartell Drugs acquisition made Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy retail chain in Seattle.   

By growing its national presence in the USA, Rite Aid will continue to improve its cost position and profitability.   It will also benefit the Rite Aid PBM, Elixir, as expansion provides greater opportunity for Elixir to grow its market share by having access to more regions throughout the USA."

Given the Rite Aid backstory, and the shorts, it would be a great thing if Rite Aid would become the new AMC or GME."

Amazon has approximately 500 million shares outstanding.  If they prefer to hold on to their cash, they can offer 2 - 3 million shares to complete an acquistion in the range of $5 - $10 billion.   That would cause little dilution and would create significant value in the AMZN pharmacy business."
2021-05-28 10:06:18,wallstreetbets,Their net profit was 386$ billion last year. An 84% increase over year. They absolutely have that much cash on hand. It's literally incomprehensible.

2021-05-28 19:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Ask any pharmacist and they’ll tell you about cvs. A lot of times they are overworked and understaffed. Imagine having to fill 500-600 prescriptions a day, deal with customers who are mad because they can’t get there prescriptions immediately (stuck somewhere in the queue), consultations, phone calls to doctors because of poor hand writing and then making judgement calls on narcotics. I have friends who work for cvs and they absolutely hate it. 

It’s not physical labor. Just a lot of bs to deal with and not enough staff compared to other chains."

2021-05-28 11:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Agreed --- A buyout would be in the range of $2 - $3 billion, or potentially even higher if a bidding war breaks out between Amazon and Walmart."

2021-05-28 16:43:51,wallstreetbets,"To Amazon would be more. To shareholders it would be 30% on top. You have to remember Amazon would have to either assume the debt they have or pay it off. If I remember correctly, rite aid debt is in 4-6 billion range. So Amazon’s purchase price would be 1.3 plus the debt. Somewhere around 5-8 billion. The shareholders won’t get double or triple price unless there is a run on stock. 

Wonder if Amazon will keep thrifty ice cream if they do buy it."
2021-05-28 16:51:19,wallstreetbets,"Debt is only $3.1 billion now after the sale of 1,900+ stores to Walgreens.

The minimum price to acquire RAD with it’s current 2,500+ stores would be $2-3 billion plus the debt payoff.  Otherwise, Rite Aid would never make the deal.  That would mean a sale share price in the range of $40-$60.  So a double or triple from today’s RAD share price is definitely possible."
2021-05-28 16:54:31,wallstreetbets,You are rite. Didn’t factor it in. They would still have to also assume all payables. Liabilities in the 6b range.
2021-05-28 17:37:05,wallstreetbets,"The receivables and cash + cash equivalents more than offset the payables.  The net long term debt is currently down to $3.1 billion.  So, if the company is bought out for $50 per share that equates to a sale price of $2.75 billion.  Add to that the $3.1 billion debt, and the total cost to buy Rite Aid for $50 per share is $5.85 billion.  Not bad for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue."

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to –4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 419, 418, 415\]

# TA Notes:

Same shit, different day.

* If 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.
* Gapped up but not over 421. :(
* Expecting a slow day, unless memes rocket. These moon missions could destabilize the markets.

2021-05-28 09:02:33,wallstreetbets,Dam to yolo 0 day SPX calls or not is the question
2021-05-28 09:08:20,wallstreetbets,"What quantifies a ""break"" in resistance? At least, what is the price action you look for to spot a break? 0.01 over the resistance level? Holding above the resistance for a window of time?"
2021-05-28 09:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Again, thank you for the wonderful DD. It's the one read I look forward to every morning with my coffee. Have a wonderful holiday weekend."
2021-05-28 09:04:25,wallstreetbets,You know what that 4k is going into a SPX weekly. That movement of the call wall is all the support I need
2021-05-28 10:40:10,wallstreetbets,Well I’m down 60% on 0 day calls. Will add weeklies end of day
2021-05-28 11:43:04,wallstreetbets,"SPY at 421 !

fuck only held for a few seconds 😅"
2021-05-28 11:58:02,wallstreetbets,Just broke  421. Bought some 425 calls next week. Hopefully they print. Also thanks for these dailies.
2021-05-28 14:30:07,wallstreetbets,"I wish I understood your DD fully (sorry newbie here). So you’re saying if SPY breaks 420.73, it’s bullish for next week and if it breaks 417.25 is bearish? Also, are there any resources you can point me to better understand your DD? Thanks!!"
2021-05-28 13:34:39,wallstreetbets,spy is just teasing us today
2021-05-28 16:23:50,wallstreetbets,My 410 6/2 puts are hemorrhaging... 🩸  🐻
2021-05-28 09:12:26,wallstreetbets,<3
2021-05-28 09:15:46,wallstreetbets,Straddle?
2021-05-28 09:20:09,wallstreetbets,It’s moving in the right direction 🤞 theta has been killing my 422 6/4C’s
2021-05-28 10:27:30,wallstreetbets,u/jjd1226.  Missed your post today at the spot. :(
2021-05-28 10:30:47,wallstreetbets,My 6/2c $419 is bleeding. Hopefully we break through
2021-05-28 10:49:01,wallstreetbets,"If we don’t cross the $420.75 mark again, fairly safe bet we get a drop down over weekend?"
2021-05-28 10:49:14,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the good DD and daily updates!
2021-05-28 11:07:39,wallstreetbets,VIX down and in contango love it
2021-05-28 11:38:23,wallstreetbets,? What’s today’s time to exercise options market is closing early. Do I still have to 4pm
2021-05-28 12:00:26,wallstreetbets,We gonna break that $421?
2021-05-28 12:14:55,wallstreetbets,inched through 421.04 on no volume... stalling maybe?  still rising... flat day session could still be a reality?  asking for a friend.
2021-05-28 14:36:40,wallstreetbets,"Basically flat all week, theta gank strikes again"
2021-05-28 12:36:03,wallstreetbets,Hey Wall Street bats apes can we get some help please? I don’t know we are all supposed is or how else to do this but we got a problem with shorters on our ticket ticket. And it’s fucking bad they’re blatantly calling us out on it to can anyone help? BTX ticker
2021-05-28 09:26:34,wallstreetbets,"3.1% inflation.  \*bites nails, readies puts\*"
2021-05-28 11:21:04,wallstreetbets,Wait till Monday. You'll have the whole weekend to think about which calls will lose the most money.
2021-05-28 09:19:00,wallstreetbets,Generally a volume spike to break resistance - this is why I don’t trust pre-market breaks imo. Then holds above for a window of time while volume increases. Indicators need confirm too IMO.
2021-05-28 09:05:33,wallstreetbets,Just wait for the break at resistance. Godspeed :)
2021-05-28 10:43:12,wallstreetbets,Looking like we will be pinned close to 420 most of day IMO. Next week should see more volatility :)
2021-05-28 14:08:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah Im hoping at 3pm it would make a move smh
2021-05-28 09:27:37,wallstreetbets,I think I'm picking up some 0dte 421c lottery tickets
2021-05-28 10:32:01,wallstreetbets,"Sorry. I gto super busy with the kids :)

Slow day AGAIN..."
2021-05-28 10:32:25,wallstreetbets,NLG today.
2021-05-28 10:54:23,wallstreetbets,I think we will be pinned at around 420 - which is the abs gamma strike. Pending any black swan news IMO.
2021-05-28 12:36:14,wallstreetbets,Sorry for spamming I’m just trying to get someone’s attention who can help out
2021-05-28 10:20:04,wallstreetbets,Can’t believe the market hasn’t reacted. Perhaps waiting for infrastructure plans.
2021-05-28 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,"That's actually very normal, and considering that you're measuring from bottom to top, arguably, that's a bit low."
2021-05-28 11:55:37,wallstreetbets,you mean tuesday?
2021-05-28 09:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bud. 

Been following these posts for about a week now. Lovely TA, great reads. Thanks for posting."
2021-05-28 17:41:54,wallstreetbets,Your posts are very helpful. But for SPY and other ETFs  volume should not matter rjght? It should simply track the prices of the underlying holdings.
2021-05-28 09:09:27,wallstreetbets,SPY is above the 420.79 in the PM. We might just make it.
2021-05-28 10:53:52,wallstreetbets,"its only 2 spx call contracts they went to a low of 125 from 400 avg. Was thinking of buying 30 more contracts and sell on the next spike, was too late and missed out on turning that 500 dollar loss into a 3200 dollar gain"
2021-05-28 10:32:55,wallstreetbets,No worries.  Mind if I cross post.
2021-05-28 14:09:15,wallstreetbets,Think I should sell for a loss or do you think we will pop through on 6/1
2021-05-28 13:52:50,wallstreetbets,Ppreciate you.👌🏼
2021-05-28 10:56:01,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I've been doing this for, like, nearly three weeks.  So my opinion is top notch wsb value.  \*\*I am not giving investment advice, I am investment ignorance embodied.\*\* 

I've been buying SPY 6/18 p420  this morning on the molehill peaks and selling on the potholes, but this is a stupid way to make a couple hundred dollars. There was a minute in there with less than 50k volume and the underlying.  Pretty sure I'm just trading options with thetagang."
2021-05-28 12:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure tradition_fee means Monday, just looking out for us and is making sure we play on a day we have a 0% chance of losing money"
2021-05-28 17:58:07,wallstreetbets,"It does when you're trading 0dte options. When implied volatility is high, expect big moves - more money lost or more money won for the day. When we see a break in resistance we should see a heathy volume increase, in relation to the days average, illustrated by the volume indicator"
2021-05-28 09:15:23,wallstreetbets,Needs to hold and we should get 422 imo. Let’s see :)
2021-05-28 09:44:28,wallstreetbets,Not happening it seems like. Another slight green day but sideways movement. Thinking of taking profit on my 419C or should I let greed take over 🧐
2021-05-28 09:55:16,wallstreetbets,Low volatility read today. I’m out personally. Focusing on fubo and crm atm
2021-05-28 14:37:01,wallstreetbets,Any thoughts for spy next week?
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Palantir Awarded $111m Contract to Provide Mission Command Platform for the United States Special Operations Command 
2021-05-28 08:18:43,wallstreetbets,"No no, this one matters. 111 broke a barrier for us."
2021-05-28 09:27:39,wallstreetbets,"PLTR Bears-Priced in, ""only 30,50,100 mil.contract"" , 40 billion valuation etc ... Yeah except PLTR is growing at 50 percent YOY despite the fact they entered the private sector just recently.Also it seems that they are getting those kinds of contracts on a weekly basis. Is this priced in???"
2021-05-28 08:19:53,wallstreetbets,"$111 mil is...ridiculously cheap for something called ""Mission Command Platform"" - especially for the US military - especially for its most elite forces...

I'd say multiply that by 10x and we'll have the first beta-testable version."
2021-05-28 09:44:12,wallstreetbets,"And not down 2% on the news?

Must be Christmas..."
2021-05-28 10:01:03,wallstreetbets,Yes to the moon above 24
2021-05-28 08:18:08,wallstreetbets,prepare for the dip
2021-05-28 08:17:41,wallstreetbets,So it should drop to single digits then
2021-05-28 11:23:01,wallstreetbets,$PLTR to the mooon
2021-05-28 08:49:58,wallstreetbets,"If my extensive research is correct, this should be priced in already. We can expect a pretty significant dip today. About time too, I've been in the green with this stock for days, it's making me uncomfortable"
2021-05-28 10:27:04,wallstreetbets,I thought Palantir was a cannabis stock
2021-05-28 09:25:53,wallstreetbets,To the mooooon $PLTR $PLTR
2021-05-28 11:05:58,wallstreetbets,$PLTR is something special and priced stupidly low rightnow but not for long.
2021-05-28 16:40:35,wallstreetbets,It was up like 6% or so today and just gradually farted out all the gains. I do not understand how this stock is not at $50.
2021-05-28 09:46:59,wallstreetbets,On a per year basis this contract alone would make Palantir the highest paid NFL player. Sorry broke ass Mahomes!
2021-05-28 09:57:51,wallstreetbets,PLTR dropping to 18 was soooo nice of them🚀🚀
2021-05-28 08:17:54,wallstreetbets,Now it’s going to drop
2021-05-28 09:03:44,wallstreetbets,"Palantir relies too heavily on government contracts. You know like Boeing ,Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin . You can’t get a big market cap off of government contracts"
2021-05-28 10:07:14,wallstreetbets,finally some 🚀🚀's today!!    do we have enough gas?
2021-05-28 10:35:39,wallstreetbets,This is a very expensive PowerPoint presentation.
2021-05-28 16:25:01,wallstreetbets,"Palantir has a remarkable, elegant concept for years. Bespoke approach to  very particular challenges.
Worth every penny."
2021-05-28 16:36:14,wallstreetbets,"So in PLTR life, good news means buy puts right?"
2021-05-28 10:03:21,wallstreetbets,"Well, if it dips further. I'll just buy more. This company's stock is seriously undervalued. Plus, with them winning all these major gov and commercial contracts, basically puts them in place for FOREVER recurring revenue streams. Couple that with the fact that they keep beating earnings call reports QoQ, and still being so low. Well, bigger forces at play here, clearly."
2021-05-28 10:57:08,wallstreetbets,LOL at the Palantir employees blatantly exploiting the WSB phenomenon.
2021-05-28 10:10:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok, stock going down. Got it!"
2021-05-28 08:58:23,wallstreetbets,Looks like 1 year with a 2nd year option.  Very nice.
2021-05-28 09:45:14,wallstreetbets,Should I buy ?
2021-05-28 10:36:29,wallstreetbets,See you guys at the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 12:17:51,wallstreetbets,"My average cost is $23.75, hopefully we can get me back in the green today."
2021-05-28 12:26:19,wallstreetbets,111M sounds awesome for a company that has the innovative software to just sit back and make money.
2021-05-28 13:14:45,wallstreetbets,Outside of employee comp- all news has been positive.   They also have a knack for increasing revenue with existing clients. That tells me they deliver!  Holding the line long term!
2021-05-28 19:00:30,wallstreetbets,"Great, palantir going to be down then"
2021-05-28 19:29:57,wallstreetbets,I'm looking forward to buying the dip on this news.
2021-05-28 08:20:23,wallstreetbets,Already priced in?
2021-05-28 11:02:12,wallstreetbets,So the stock is going to tank?!
2021-05-28 13:53:01,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry it will drop 7 dollars now
2021-05-28 12:23:43,wallstreetbets,"None of these contracts are anywhere near the size it would take to move the stock or be worth caring about.  From a gov't contracting standpoint this is a literally drop in the bucket. 

Palantir is a small-ass company, but not small enough that a win like this matters much.  They also aren't going to be locking up Lockheed Martin size mega contracts to manufacture airplanes or something that would be enough to move the price with 1 win."
2021-05-28 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,That’s a dead stock
2021-05-28 14:20:16,wallstreetbets,"That's an upcoming long weekend Pay for the CEO. 


He got paid $1 billion last year."

2021-05-28 10:30:20,wallstreetbets,PTR’s ceo/founder is a bildeburg kuck. No way I’d ever put 1c in there on moral grounds.
2021-05-28 08:59:43,wallstreetbets,Sold its shares and placed it into AMC... most retard decision I've made and caught the 40% increase with AMC 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 12:06:37,wallstreetbets,"Fuck this company.  They're literally mining our data and selling it to the U.S. government to do an end-around of privacy laws and continue all the same monitoring and tracking of citizens that Edward Snowden exposed. I'm sticking with GME, AMC, SPCE, and proof of stake. I want to make money but not by funding evil."
2021-05-28 15:59:45,wallstreetbets,PLTR is a garbage stock and anyone who invests in it obviously hates money and themselves...
2021-05-28 08:19:48,wallstreetbets,Priced in
2021-05-28 09:20:09,wallstreetbets,Maybe we break out past $24 today??? Would setup a nice uptrend next week...

2021-05-28 10:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Obviously

Down 2% tomorrow

🤡"
2021-05-28 10:21:53,wallstreetbets,"First thing that came to my mind too lol

""What is this? A Mission Command Platform for ants?!?!"""
2021-05-28 08:45:48,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I was thinking. Sounds like they got lowballed.
2021-05-28 09:31:47,wallstreetbets,The article says it they are “continuing their work” which just means it was a re-compete and the incumbent captured it. Just follow on to the contract they were already awarded for additional years
2021-05-28 10:14:46,wallstreetbets,It’s a one year contract with an optional second year. $111 million for one year is a big deal dude.
2021-05-28 10:40:41,wallstreetbets,You'd think it's cheap but it's probably the size of a studio apartment.
2021-05-28 11:31:21,wallstreetbets,I work in the field. It is not unreasonable. Then there are ECP's and possibly several other rounds of funding. We should all know that the first award is never the end of it.
2021-05-28 10:31:15,wallstreetbets,All of pltrs contracts are so gd cheap its weird. Like they the only contractor not taking advantage. Other contractors charge 15x as much
2021-05-28 09:31:49,wallstreetbets,"Mmmm... nah, probably not. 

First, SOCOM gets what they want and they don't care about money. Of all the combatant commands, SOCOM is the biggest trust fund baby. These are the dudes who authorize requests for entire palettes of cash and send them to remote locations in like 48 hours because they need to pay off a HUMINT source or buy a bunch of trucks under the table. Or buy up like 1,000 very particular battle rifles because a few team guys said they felt really good on the range, so hey, now they're an option for everyone. 

Second, a ""mission command platform,"" while probably pretty fancy for SOCOM, ultimately is never THAT fancy. It's software. Try googling ""CPOF."" That's what conventional units get. Now THAT'S your government budget shit."

2021-05-28 19:31:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to believe with absolutely no evidence, that Palantir is just wetting everyone's beak a little, playing ""just the tip,"" and once they are all hooked they'll go full hog."
2021-05-28 16:12:16,wallstreetbets,More like missile command for the Atari.
2021-05-28 18:07:04,wallstreetbets,It's not a Microsoft level contract but $111 mil is 10% of last years revenue
2021-05-28 19:17:19,wallstreetbets,It’s just the initial cost of software development right? Or did I misunderstand that. I’d think that most of the money made would follow this step. What do I know I’m just an ape.
2021-05-28 15:56:25,wallstreetbets,"Spoke too soon... good news = price drop. (It's technically up over yesterday, but down a fraction from morning open)"
2021-05-28 09:06:49,wallstreetbets,Prepare to buy the dip

2021-05-28 10:02:04,wallstreetbets,Nope it's actually trending upwards THANK FUCKING GOD.
2021-05-28 10:06:04,wallstreetbets,Narrator voice: the dip was the tip
2021-05-28 11:40:46,wallstreetbets,if they were just awarded a contract why would the price dip?
2021-05-28 10:04:00,wallstreetbets,"For once we're actually having a good day on news ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)

2021-05-28 12:43:14,wallstreetbets,With Biden. All you need is government contracts to get rich. They throw money everywhere. Like machine gun money.
2021-05-28 10:05:35,wallstreetbets,keep buying and avg up until 60 tbh
2021-05-28 11:37:32,wallstreetbets,LETS FLY TO THE MOON TOGETHER SOLDIER!
2021-05-28 14:43:52,wallstreetbets,I don't think it's bigger forces just executives dumping shares
2021-05-28 10:31:32,wallstreetbets,It's literally up above 5% today
2021-05-28 09:46:09,wallstreetbets,My average cost is $25 so I say yeah but if your choice lol
2021-05-28 09:56:08,wallstreetbets,Should I sell my $20 call before things tank 😬
2021-05-28 10:05:48,wallstreetbets,"My average is $27.60, my time horizon for half of the position is 6 months for a swing, and other half my position for another 5 years.It all depends on your time horizon...

2021-05-28 08:22:20,wallstreetbets,Everything is priced in
2021-05-28 10:48:03,wallstreetbets,Amazon didn't turn a profit for 15 years. Let's recall.
2021-05-28 10:34:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes. The way most tech companies go is to move fast and break things - it's expensive acquiring a shit load of revenue growth. The point is to acquire a ton of customers mature, upsell them and then settle in for profit."
2021-05-28 12:30:54,wallstreetbets,where did u get this garbage information lmao
2021-05-28 10:30:27,wallstreetbets,overall market is down
2021-05-28 13:30:13,wallstreetbets,what no way. show proof .-.

yes"
2021-05-28 09:51:38,wallstreetbets,Watch Tom Nash's (not even a fan of his) recent videos about PLTR to understand why Papa Karp is selling. TL;DW He's literally only to it for tax reasons. He's keeping everything over his tax obligation.
2021-05-28 19:24:13,wallstreetbets,Nop
2021-05-28 17:28:11,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow is Saturday
2021-05-28 11:31:58,wallstreetbets,It needs to be atleast 3x bigger
2021-05-28 19:39:37,wallstreetbets,"Maybe theyd be delivering astronaut icecream at that price, it's a start"
2021-05-28 09:22:00,wallstreetbets,Get the contract and then upscale it later
2021-05-28 10:07:50,wallstreetbets,"They were finishing up $60m/yr x 6yr contract, this one is $111m/yr x 1yr"
2021-05-28 17:00:27,wallstreetbets,"One correction, it wasn’t a recompete. The first contract was sole source so I’m sure the follow on was too. Basically they love Palantir so much that they don’t even give other companies a chance to bid."
2021-05-28 14:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Half for each year, 111 is the total."
2021-05-28 11:33:35,wallstreetbets,Long game. Get small contracts now and keep upselling new things and as the insider your systems incrementally improve and you have an eye on the features the end user really need and you charge for that and the ongoing service and maintenance and pretty soon you are making crazy money but you need a finger in every pie.
2021-05-28 12:27:43,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is a small software company.  The big contracts (from a dollar not margin standpoint) go to manufacturing stuff, which is clearly not their game.  

Their business model is a whole bunch of small contracts.  None of this crap is worth getting worked up over."
2021-05-28 17:19:57,wallstreetbets,"A palette of cash is a pretty funny concept.

2021-05-28 09:08:20,wallstreetbets,Only to dip more with more good news
2021-05-28 12:04:09,wallstreetbets,That's just how Palantir rolls
2021-05-28 13:06:25,wallstreetbets,In the past Palantir dropped every time when there was good news.
2021-05-28 10:33:37,wallstreetbets,"lol.  Bro PLTR could discover alien life forms living within the information stored in server farms and these MFs would be like. 
“According to my extensive research the discovery of alien life forms was priced in at offering”"
2021-05-28 12:20:28,wallstreetbets,My man. I was literally like is this guy fucking joking.

2021-05-28 13:37:06,wallstreetbets,Your mom is priced in
2021-05-28 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,how
2021-05-28 14:38:17,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is all about dangling the carrot. Their strategy is basically get a contract for cheap to develop the software, deliver the product, and then customer extends that contract in perpetuity because they are now hooked and cannot perform to the same efficiency or profit margins without that software."
2021-05-28 09:45:58,wallstreetbets,This is how it always works. They'll add features later on that the client will want and pay for
2021-05-28 09:44:36,wallstreetbets,Exactly my thinking
2021-05-28 10:36:01,wallstreetbets,"That makes more sense, thanks!"
2021-05-28 11:26:36,wallstreetbets,Gotta love democrat spending! Get the money bois
2021-05-28 18:15:25,wallstreetbets,"That’s not how sole source acquisitions work. There are specific criteria that need to met before a contract can be awarded without open competition. It’s not “we really like this company” it’s usually, “there is only one company that can provide the thing we need in the time requirement”"
2021-05-28 17:23:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I’m not too familiar with Palantir’s past performance, just a few months into a role with heavy capture and BD. Oddly enough I was reaching out to a few people from there today to set some sync meetings haha"
2021-05-28 13:01:05,wallstreetbets,Not small for long tho
2021-05-28 13:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Don't discount Tom Clancy.  His description of the inside of an Los Angeles sub was so accurate the FBI investigated him to see if he had access to restricted information.


Also, I know a bunch of military guys and a a couple spec ops guys.  The general attitude is that special operations gets whatever they want and even the operators will admit to that."
2021-05-28 15:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Am military, and am friends with defense contractors that supply special forces. What he said is 100% accurate."
2021-05-28 10:56:10,wallstreetbets,Throw all the shade you want. I'm sure there's plenty others in the sub who have a wild first hand story about special operators getting wild shit under wild circumstances.

2021-05-28 16:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Like all defense companies. Was working for one. Nothing got delivered on time or in budget. The customer always needed to push the reserves of the public budget to get close to finish.

Pathetic milking money from the taxpayers scheme..."
2021-05-28 17:06:06,wallstreetbets,Government analysts: Effi...what? I’m sorry we don’t understand German words here.

2021-05-28 19:06:29,wallstreetbets,"I agree it isn’t just willy nilly. I guess you could change my comment to say “we really need this software and no one else can provide it”.

Seems a bit semantic. They obviously do “like” it more than whatever they used before Palantir."
2021-05-28 15:26:55,wallstreetbets,"What's a ""Los Angeles sub""?"
2021-05-28 11:31:37,wallstreetbets,"It isn't as easy now that a lot of the combat zones are being ""closed"" down as US draws down in Afghanistan, iraq and Syria.

20 years of whack a mole is coming to a close.

That and the bigger side of the branches are always pissy about the money spent on Special Operations.

But once PLTR gets inside then PLTR can start showing off the other neat things they can do and pretty soon PLTR is a pretty big line item in the budget."
2021-05-28 13:34:30,wallstreetbets,My BN TF (650 Soldiers) did a couple joint training exercises with the Royal Thai army a few years back. The SF group from our installation came out to train as well. Our BN TF slept on cots with mosquito nets in the middle of the jungle. The SF guys got a hotel.

2021-05-28 11:46:18,wallstreetbets,"That is true. There have been plenty of FW&A complaints from the conventional side. Stuff like finding old connexes full of ATVs or something else that have been sitting around and ""forgotten"" for years tends to have that effect."

 -🚀Mexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook 🚀-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-🚀 Intro to Protein and mRNA type Vaccines🚀 -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-🚀Differences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs work🚀 -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-🚀 Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  🚀-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down 🙌 Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-🚀 Logistics and Storage.🚀 -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- 🚀 Scientific conclusion 🚀  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time.

Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -🚀My Positions 🚀 -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well 🙈 but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

2021-05-28 07:18:10,wallstreetbets,"Biden mentioned them as the next vaccine to get approval. Manufacturing wise they will be producing just as much as Pfizer and more than moderna. Take a look on stocktwits for more DD. AY888 is great resource on Stocktwits. They are going to be one of the largest players in the covid space. Everyone in the biotech community knows of them and they're very well known. They will be providing 1.1 billion doses to Covax, an international effort to get vaccines across the world to mid to low income countries. Along with that they have a lot of contracts with higher end countries and a contract with the EU is expected for 200 million doses. Right now their market cap is going to be what their revenue is going to be next year. So at a minimum of 4X but I expect 7x without a problem personally due to the unique nature of their product having the strongest antibodies and variant protection."

Turn to the 1 minute mark in the link to the video below and listen to the CEOs response at the 1:15 minite mark. That's where he mentions a how long and this was a couple days ago. Always better to get in a little earlier than gauge it late.

2021-05-28 15:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Because of the P3 data coming out and anticipation of approval in July, come mid-june implied volatility will be pretty high on options and price will already be much higher due to P3 results will have been released by then. At that point everything coming together for novavax for approval  as well. So I was saying easy to buy the July $200-250 call options and sell them in June a month from now and collect some nice profits. Then that would give you some nice working capital to go with Jan 300 2022 call options or buy some shares with the profits as 2022 will be a strong year."

My position and DD Chart of contracts priced out into future share price/MC


I originally bought 737 shares for a lil for about $2,992 @ $4.06. I've added a lil over 200 shares since then and occasionally sell 5-10% to buy options. Since the GME Robinhood incident where they restricted selling, I ditched Robinhood and got a Ameritrade account and never looked back. That pissed me off because they also restricted Nvax on the day it biggest gains of the year. Anyway my autistic ass panić sold in the February market crash to rebuy a falling knife and get a wash sale 🙈. I know, I know bonehead move. So my wash sale got added to my position and gonna pay the taxman a nice visit next year. But over all not bad about $6k invested and I'm sitting at $139,720 altogether now with options and stocks. Could be worse could be better but I'mma take it with a chip on my shoulder and get ready for round 2. With all their contracts this will moon to $800 over the next year or so. DD is easy 7x from here so lm not selling untill then.  $1,000,000 is my goal LFG! 🚀🌚"
2021-05-28 06:59:28,wallstreetbets,Just let me know what you want me to explain and I'll go into detail for you.
2021-05-28 08:18:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes CEO said they will be filing early Q3, being July. That's what I originally mentioned in the first sentence of my DD. (Just to clarify) That's a lil over a month away. In about 1 to 2 weeks US/Mexico P3 results are coming out. There's a lot of other catalysts such as EU approval for 200 million vaccines coming. There's a steady stream of catalysts coming, institutions bought and brought up the ownership to 70% in last 3 weeks. A lot going on for this stock. 

Approval getting pushed back 6 weeks is not a big deal, as theres too much demand for the next 4 years for covid vaccines. A lot of people think this is a race but it's really a race to do it right so sometimes taking your time and setting up manufacturing the right way and doing trials the right way will get you past the competition. And to top it off all the approved vaccines right now couldn't even vaccinate the world due to short supplies and too much demand. A lot of people want to think about the US demand is done because the US got at least 50% of people with one shot. The fact is most of the profits are going to be overseas. And we will be the go-to for booster shots due to our superior multi-strain protection. The US makes a very small portion of the revenue. With only 5% of the world being vaccinated there isn't enough vaccines in the next year to cover the world we're going to need a lot more than just nvax. So they will be selling at max manufacturing capacity for the next 4 years. Either way they're still producing vaccines as we speak versus Pfizer and moderna that started producing after they got approval and it took them awhile to get stockpile a ready before they could give out vaccines. So regardless, time-wise it's going to be basically the same in that regard because their stockpiling before approval so when approval comes they can hit the ground running versus when their competitors got approved they  stumbled out the gate with manufacturing.

Also last tidbit they can be stored at regular temperatures unlike mRNA type vaccines. One of the reasons why 1.1 billion doses of Novavax will be delivered to mid to low income countries because they can't afford crazy freezers for Pfizer and Moderna."
2021-05-28 09:37:06,wallstreetbets,"As far as approval we have the best covid vaccine data in the world to date! Better then Pfizer, Moderna JnJ etc. Not only that we have the most comprehensive data they took the time to get the most diverse population which made the trials tougher to show a good result, and still we had the best result vs our competition. The competition just breezed through their trials and brought in a bunch of white people to make it easy. For example we did a phase 2 trial in Africa with Africans and HIV positive Africans, nobody else wanted to do that because they're afraid of bringing their results down. But this is how you build comprehensive data and that's how you get approvals all around the world. This is why it took them a little bit longer to get across the finish line, but for all the right reasons it took longer and will benefit shareholders exponentially more in the future due to that. Because of the diversity of the trials the data is gold, Biden is teaming up with South Korea to send 4 billion dollars worth of Nvax overseas to low-income countries as well. So if the president say that NVAX is coming out.... it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. The vaccine is very much needed right now so there's a big push to get it out there as soon as possible but also launch with manufacturing ducks all in a row unlike Johnson & Johnson who had manufacturing hiccups; that's why we're taking our time to make sure everything's perfect and we don't disappoint our customers like AstraZeneca disappointed the European Union and now they're getting sued and not getting any more orders. 
 There's been scientific peer reviewed papers published on our vaccine by top scientists saying we're first in class and all the analysts agree. Including B.Riley FBR 5 star analyst Mayank Mamtani. Link below on what he has to say

[5 star analyst from B.Riely explains why nvax has the edge the over it's competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-edge-215910558.html)


As far as Viotility goes...it was connected to overall markets. We hit 330 last time we reported data, the same week GME took off. When the markets took a big dip late February and in March we followed just like gme so we went down with the market. Then the CEO was kind of quiet while they were getting manufacturing worked out and we got hit with a lot of shorts like GME or AMC. In the last couple weeks manufacturing has been all sorted out. The FDA has been in communication with us and basically all the ""t's and i's"" have been crossed and dotted. We are about to hand in our FDA submission for approval any week with the anticipation of July approval...or very close to it.

Whenever a biotech is pre-revenue the share price is all over the place. We are finally entering the stage of revenue. Went from being in the negative in 2019 to having two billion dollars in our balance sheet from deposits on purchase orders. So now we have orders finalized, manufacturing finalized. And Governments.... not companies, but governments sending us millions and billions dollars worth of orders that are locked and loaded and some already negotiating for years ahead.

During the last earnings call the CEO said it was just going to be another couple months until approval and everybody got their panties up in a bunch and thought approval was going to be within a couple weeks so there was a sell-off. But there's no reason for a giant sell-off when approval is coming weeks down the road, people just aren't patient these days. That being said we're supposed to start getting approvals from different countries in July. 

All in all this is the moment in time where the volatility will start getting a little bit better and we should be over 250 without a problem as a support. The average analyst price Target is double the stock price right now and target price by analysts will go up once manufacturing starts and countries recieve doses.(nobody wants to hurt their five star rating so they adjust accordingly as developments happen with the company, and we got a lot of developments coming this year)"

2021-05-28 13:12:51,wallstreetbets,It all depends how long it takes put together the package it's a lot of paperwork and they are simultaneously doing it with multiple countries around the world at the same time every country is a different regulatory agency that follows by different rules so it's no easy task obviously they're pushing for us approval but things like getting the UK approval would open up the doors also the other approvals. July has been the most common time frame talked about within the investor community on stocktwits and twitter. They also have agreements for July with the Philippines &  South Korea and Covax will start shipping some of their 1.1 billion vax agreement. So approvals should start rolling in soon. L I think a lot of countries are waiting for the US but there are countries that have their own decently well-established regulatory agencies that can act on their own.  Worst case it's an couple weeks to a month but at that stage in the game I don't expect to see a giant dip in the price because longs are not going to want to sell their shares.

Everything over 50% gain is insanely good. Watch the upward trajectory and set your stop sells accordingly. Most of all cheering apes are usually bagholders that comes back here crying when it's over (I was one once, too). Don't end up like one of them.

Or you know. Do what you want, since this is a casino and all. But at least post your lost porn when you ACTUALLY yolo'd that shit.

If anything actually reaches the Moon, I will still cheer for each and every one of you retards that held on."

2021-05-28 11:10:04,wallstreetbets,ELON NOW ACCEPTING AMC SHARES AS PAYMENT FOR TESLA'S.
2021-05-28 11:38:06,wallstreetbets,"Not doing a write-up as a full post, but here's the current gamma structure of AMC as of open this AM. It's probably shifted some as people jet in and out of options. The spike at open probably corresponded to dealer hedging of all of those calls in the 30-35 range that became in or very near the money today.

[https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8](https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8)

Note that about half of the gamma vaporizes today and with that is a lot of delta evaporating too (about 18% of total delta). And, the dealers at open were holding $3.7B of shares as well according to spot gamma. That value would've climbed up significantly in the open. That means that you may see something more like 25-30% of delta getting dropped from the open to the close, which ends up being more like $1.5B or something.

What does this mean? Well, it means that there will be selling pressure today if this price doesn't break out and fast. There's a gamma ramp down more than up, but more importantly, a lot of calls are expiring OTM today, and as the day goes on, dealers de-hedge by dumping stock they previously bought to protect themselves.

If a gamma squeeze up does happen, it would be hard for the price to go a lot past $40 because the options end there. And, there's a big gap between $35 and $40 in terms of dealer support, which we saw in the fizzle this morning.

You also have to contend with people monetizing ITM calls, but ITM puts will soon balance it, approximately around 30. For values under that, you get a slight buy into the close of people dropping puts instead of being assigned a short, and above that you get a sell into the close of people not wanting to hold a fistfull of AMC from their calls.

It's probably easier to buy this at a low today and hope for next week, than to win today, unless you see a big increase in momentum - the dealer flows will be very significant, and primarily to the downside (unless price well under $30 near close, then you could see buying up as people dump ITM puts expiring today)."

2021-05-28 14:22:24,wallstreetbets,"Daily reminder: Don't let other people tell you what to do with your money. It's your money.

2021-05-28 10:50:23,wallstreetbets,SHFs are giving you one last discount today on GME.  They will do whatever it takes to try and make it close below 250.  Idk if they'll have enough ammo throughout the day to drop it into the 220s but they're gonna try like hell to get it that low.  If you're able to grab some moon tickets in the 220s or 230s today big congrats to you because this might be your final chance at a discount before the rocket takes off.  I'm predicting that the last half hour of trading today will be an epic battle for over/under 250.  Apes get your popcorn ready!!!
2021-05-28 10:50:47,wallstreetbets,some peoples' weekends will be better than others lol

1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF and coat the inside of a 9-inch pie plate, cast iron skillet, or 8x8 casserole dish with non-stick spray (or butter for more flavor).
2. In a large bowl, stir together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until evenly combined.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil.
3. Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until everything is moist. Avoid over stirring. It's okay if there are a few lumps.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared dish and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top and edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and serve."

I felt like I was too late for GME, by the time I started looking at calls it was way too expensive after its second run after that legendary ""would you buy at $40"" shit. But anyway I feel this is the one to get in at the ground and make some serious money. I never liked AMC, I'm not from The US and don't see how cinemas have a future but that's just my own opinion, no offence to anyone who probably knows a lot more than I do about AMC.

2021-05-28 15:54:17,wallstreetbets,Buying more BB shares 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 16:10:40,wallstreetbets,"AMC ended ended at $26 today. That's good. There are a ton of puts at $25 and under. Ideally it ended at $28, as there are about 200k calls at $27/$28. However, $26 is still pretty damn good.

GME was a bit less fortunate. At least it ended above $220, avoiding those 13k puts at that price. There are about 30k ITM puts. It's not THAT much, but still a decent chunk. It would have been nice for it to end the day at $240, ideally $300 or even $270. 

We might see some drop next week on GME before going back up. Either way I'm holding. GME 70 shares@~$270

EDIT: Aftermarket looks good. AMC might end up above $27 and GME maybe above $230. It's only a chance though."

Bet on server (preferably the better player, but if they’re evenly matched it has a high success rate too) to win the first point and double/triple down until he wins a point.

If the server is -190 or stronger odds, it requires a triple down to profit. If they are under -150 double down usually is fine

Do not use on women’s tennis. They’re broken on serves far too often

Who's gonna want to hold the stock over a three day weekend if sitting on gains?  
  
PUT/CALL ratio today has been climbing from around .4 to close to .65 (edit from .6)  
  
Max pain is 21 which could lead to a lot of burned premium.

Today's VWAP is $31.8 so there are sellers ABOVE the market.

Guess what the big bets were against today? GME as you look at the graph yesterday gme didn’t show great volume nor movements up till the end of the day. And right before close you betcha that the bets were coming in against gme and today they made a lot of money. They were ready it’s Friday this was their goal. Do we really want to see them win? Lack of effort today this all started with gme back in January and we looked the other way from the legendary gme."

With that being said get in on the pyramid early by purchasing PLTR calls for next week so you can sell some poor APE your calls for much higher"

Apes strong together because apes know how prisoner dilemma works.

And right now the shear number of apes is so high most apes only have a handful of bananas.

So the value of the reward gained isn't currently worth breaking the trend. And Ape knows this.

And Ape knows other Apes know this as well.

And most importantly, oher Apes know that Ape knows that they know this.

And just like that we have our price floor.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Trainline dip | LSE Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

Also there is the recent insider buying

Definitely bullish on this, it dipped on the news of the new scheme which knowing UK government will be in 5-10 years if ever. Trainline remains the easiest platform to buy tickets in the UK and will recover long before any changes happen. Planning to buy more today!"
2021-05-28 05:42:51,wallstreetbets,I hadn't even considered this ! Just taken a look and i think your on to something! How much it will rise I can't say but I think it will defiantly rise.
2021-05-28 06:11:23,wallstreetbets,I recall using trainline years ago. As I am too lazy do you know how much of their revenue is from commuters vs leisure use?
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Welp. I’ve been selling CC’s on my GME to bring my cost basis down since January. I knew this day would happen lol. Sold 2 calls at $6. Now worth $69 out of all numbers. 
2021-05-28 04:55:00,wallstreetbets,But they are covered calls right?  You aren't down.  You are up.
2021-05-28 05:06:04,wallstreetbets,"I rolled up and out.  I wrote 5/28 $200 cc and rolled to 7/16 $260 for additional premium.  
Figured if it's going to get called away, I wait 50 days to collect an additional $6000."
2021-05-28 04:58:04,wallstreetbets,Why would you collect pennies in front of a steamroller?
2021-05-28 09:46:00,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you. Been selling a CC every week to collect ~$500 in premium. Suddenly I'm missing out on $5k profit and may be out of the ride for good. but honestly, it's been a good ride. With all the premium I collected, I've essentially doubled my initial investment. Not too shabby for a couple months.

Thankfully i have some shares in my Roth, but still a little sad."
2021-05-28 07:01:07,wallstreetbets,"Im in same boat with UWMC, sold $9 covered calls for $35 premium 😩"
2021-05-28 07:12:20,wallstreetbets,"Don't feel bad, I did the same thing but way more extreme. Remember back before the second rally when it was staying flat and under $70 for nearly the entire month? Well, I was selling $70 (and gradually moving up) FDs and collecting mad premium with about 1000 shares/calls as collateral. Then the second rally happened. 

I worked out some things and managed to save 600 of the shares but lost the rest. $100k mistake."

2021-05-28 05:40:25,wallstreetbets,Selling covered calls for a stock with over 150% volatility is bound to end up in tears.

2021-05-28 06:08:22,wallstreetbets,This small increase in price isn’t the gains you should be worried about missing.  It’s what’s to come that’s really gonna hurt
2021-05-28 11:19:10,wallstreetbets,Shun the non believer.
2021-05-28 05:07:52,wallstreetbets,"2 / 10 numbers is ok. dividing a 6 by 2 gives you 3 & dividing 9 by 2 gives you 4.5

not bad.  now you got a 3, 4 and 5. That is 3 numbers which is the missing number before '...69' because 9 minus 6 equals 3. 

math is telling us you should have bought 3 instead 2.

In poker, you are almost straight. Don't get fucked. Good Luck."
2021-05-28 13:37:44,wallstreetbets,Ive been doing the same…..roll it to a January 215 or something

2021-05-28 15:20:49,wallstreetbets,you think it’ll go back up? I bought another 500$ at 250 bringing my average to 215 only to see it drop drop and drop..now at 225
2021-05-28 16:29:11,wallstreetbets,Hahah obviously I want to see it moon but I did roll my position at the highs today and they’ve already dropped 25% in premium since.
2021-05-28 09:14:00,wallstreetbets,"Covered calls don't have a negative delta. You still lose more money than you gain if the price goes down, so anyone bearish who decides that selling CCs is the way to go is a bit of an idiot."

2021-05-28 12:55:01,wallstreetbets,seems like you haven't lost enough capital to know what a gay bear looks like. better learn what a CC is before you post any DDs.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB | Technical analysis | The bottom has fully been formed. I assume that we see a similar price action soon Is it time to pick some juicy berries? 🍇

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

Own calls with strikes below, at, and just above current price levels, with intention of adding."

We've seen this over and over, until bb have a good ER they'll just hover around the 8$ mark. Stop getting your hopes up over little price swings.

2021-05-28 17:54:28,wallstreetbets,So...We by BB on Monday and by Wednesday it Will worth 25$ 🍾
2021-05-28 17:57:46,wallstreetbets,"I like how in the technical chart, it only goes up except for one day LOL"
2021-05-28 18:01:02,wallstreetbets,4 - 69$
2021-05-28 18:01:14,wallstreetbets,What’s an exit strategy?
2021-05-28 18:16:48,wallstreetbets,In since January at almost $20 🧐
2021-05-28 18:29:13,wallstreetbets,I like these crayons
2021-05-28 18:48:25,wallstreetbets,"I have too many $10 September calls.  
I really need them to lighten."
2021-05-28 19:34:51,wallstreetbets,Chen is making deals all over the world.... eventually get an evaluation equivalent to the competition... BB is on the verge.  If next quarter they release a profit its gonna launch
2021-05-28 19:42:31,wallstreetbets,Well then what the fuck did I buy? I bought it because the wife and her boyfriend were on BangBros site. I got to sit against the door and listen while they filmed.
2021-05-28 19:44:57,wallstreetbets,Nice volume on BB today. Next week will be nicer
2021-05-28 08:50:45,wallstreetbets,"PETCO - WOOF, is severely undervalued at $23.00 and has huge short position. This can squeeze even better than AMC of GME"
2021-05-28 09:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Stay focused,  buy AMC"
2021-05-28 13:40:26,wallstreetbets,"Or it just continues the consistent downtrend it's been on for months. As soon as the real memes fizzle, BB will fall fast."
2021-05-28 09:23:06,wallstreetbets,"The only company Ape’s should be buying is AMD.

Everything else is a hedge fund ploy."
2021-05-28 12:18:57,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I bought in and it crashed.

My bad."
2021-05-28 12:43:19,wallstreetbets,I'm unsubbing if you're wrong
2021-05-28 10:48:57,wallstreetbets,We never left.
2021-05-28 10:09:42,wallstreetbets,Go BB!
2021-05-28 10:01:17,wallstreetbets,🍌🦍🚀🙌💎
2021-05-28 10:23:03,wallstreetbets,back again
2021-05-28 10:06:24,wallstreetbets,I always had faith
2021-05-28 10:01:58,wallstreetbets,They brought Butterfinger BBs back?
2021-05-28 11:03:08,wallstreetbets,BB not your parent's Blackberry anymore.
2021-05-28 18:36:23,wallstreetbets,Just in time for my $10 calls 👌
2021-05-28 14:44:12,wallstreetbets,I want my BB back BB back BB back BB back
2021-05-28 15:15:04,wallstreetbets,Me and the bois blasting off... Ape Lightyear- to infinity and the moon 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 15:25:27,wallstreetbets,I want my BB back BB back BB back BB back..
2021-05-28 15:50:59,wallstreetbets,I love doing it BB
2021-05-28 12:41:44,wallstreetbets,"I also don’t own shares of my employer, employing me just tells me they accept shit employees"
2021-05-28 10:29:13,wallstreetbets,What makes BB so good at cyber security?
2021-05-28 09:47:13,wallstreetbets,"I worked for a cyber sec company, I hold exactly 69 shares of that company (RSUs) I hold 200 of BB (purchased)"
2021-05-28 11:25:38,wallstreetbets,Why not go work for Blackberry ?
2021-05-28 12:34:54,wallstreetbets,"I currently have all my money tied up in other bullshit so I can't buy. 

So clearly this is the one that's going to the moon."
2021-05-28 16:15:59,wallstreetbets,"why is Blackberry than NET, DDOG, or FSLY?"
2021-05-28 16:51:30,wallstreetbets,do you not believe in your own company? you don't see it growing?
2021-05-28 17:46:36,wallstreetbets,"QNX is decades old and has never made money. 

The other technology people are crowing about I've never heard of.

I'm in mostly for the lulz."
2021-05-28 10:49:24,wallstreetbets,"That's just proper diversification. In general, you don't want to keep stock in the company you work for."
2021-05-28 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,Agree!!
2021-05-28 13:03:51,wallstreetbets,Letssss gooooooo!!!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
2021-05-28 13:51:42,wallstreetbets,"Please explain why.  From a financial perspective.  One would have thought if they have a product, a plan, an opportunity to capitalize analysts would have picked up on that and more than 2 out of 9 would have a higher SP target and stronger BUY ratings..... I love BB too, held it a lot longer than anyone on reddit.... thankfully sold at $27.  Waiting for it to go to consenus SP target to re-enter.  Unfortunately this little blip has priced me out."
2021-05-28 16:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I also work for a cyber company, not blackberry.

215 shares at an average of $11.79"
2021-05-28 04:58:39,wallstreetbets,Do you think? I'd really like to get in. Are you?
2021-05-28 11:04:22,wallstreetbets,I'd say Minimum of $50/share by EOY but we could see higher especially with the deals they've been landing with all the auto manufacturers re QNX tech especially with future self driving cars/trucks in the future. This stock is at a bargain basement price right now even at $12 USD per share.
2021-05-28 14:53:14,wallstreetbets,Great company news recently also!
2021-05-28 09:54:50,wallstreetbets,I love you buddy!! BB to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-28 06:06:47,wallstreetbets,Give this ape a banana for recognizing the splooge potential taking shape
2021-05-28 09:51:25,wallstreetbets,And dips are to be bought.
2021-05-28 07:46:15,wallstreetbets,the way this is
2021-05-28 09:34:41,wallstreetbets,"bought 11 @ $10, all in my account. preparing for liftoff 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-28 15:18:40,wallstreetbets,"Curious, why is everybody expecting BB to go up? Short term or long term increase? I've had my mind on AMC for so long I forgot about BB."
2021-05-28 08:11:30,wallstreetbets,Been holding for a long while too.  Averaged down the whole way.  I’m here for it 🚀
2021-05-28 09:29:19,wallstreetbets,Did you get your advice to buy in January from this subreddit?
2021-05-28 14:57:27,wallstreetbets,Always take profits! $BB will be at $20-$25 soon!
2021-05-28 08:22:54,wallstreetbets,Average down now under $10 and profit all the way to your bag level.
2021-05-28 09:45:01,wallstreetbets,Why haven't you averaged down by now...? Serious question 😅
2021-05-28 09:40:27,wallstreetbets,"As others have stated, average the fuck down, my guy."
2021-05-28 09:01:35,wallstreetbets,try again next year
2021-05-28 10:24:12,wallstreetbets,We’re coming back for you.
2021-05-28 10:26:59,wallstreetbets,It’s okay I have an $17 average.  Come us you dummies.
2021-05-28 07:01:59,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold only up
2021-05-28 05:37:26,wallstreetbets,What's an exit strategy
2021-05-28 10:19:24,wallstreetbets,I don't think it'll be worth $75 BILLION dollars any time soon (implied mcap if shares hit $150). This is coming from a shareholder and someone that actually understand the AWS and BB partnership
2021-05-28 14:40:17,wallstreetbets,"BS. 

Don't say shit like this. 

This echo chamber of rockets is what forced people in bag holding from when it was $25/share 

There were a few different things that sparked AMCs run. To add to it, there is still no evidence the shorts have covered."
2021-05-28 10:08:55,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-28 14:43:20,wallstreetbets,"No, only up 00.30 since open. Those morning erections in the charts will get ya."
2021-05-28 06:57:00,wallstreetbets,Yes man - welcome on the $BB board 🙌🏻
2021-05-28 08:42:55,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, this is sloppy as hell analysis. If you truly believe in your thesis and analysis and follow up by setting up a stop loss the same day you buy...well that just undermines your very own thesis even before you accept any criticism. Its just sloppy and shows no conviction in the play.

Never enter a new position and be unwilling to accept a red day or two. Rookie mistake."
2021-05-28 10:47:01,wallstreetbets,No you are too smart! HOLD
2021-05-28 17:18:45,wallstreetbets,And it's not even close to being done yet. Tons of room to run and tons of time to write that classic storybook tale!
2021-05-28 06:33:32,wallstreetbets,or they can hold as they see it growing faster as before and dont want to miss big earning if it reaches $40
2021-05-28 05:32:22,wallstreetbets,Only Melvin is worried
2021-05-28 09:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Not an issue, lots of longs with Diamond hands. Apes want to ride long & fast, not short."
2021-05-28 05:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Definitely something to worry about, I know way to many people waiting to dump"
2021-05-28 10:07:58,wallstreetbets,There are a bunch of 2007 holders with real thick averages.
2021-05-28 12:22:51,wallstreetbets,People waiting for 30 to dump is still over 100% gain potential selling at 25 👀
2021-05-28 05:04:33,wallstreetbets,Calls or shares ?
2021-05-28 09:13:14,wallstreetbets,I totally agree with you. The risk/reward is very nice and worth a trade IMHO
2021-05-28 11:46:20,wallstreetbets,"I have to ask..... with all the analysts figuring this stock is worth around $8USD and only two analysts with a BUY rating (NO STRONG BUYS), what do you know that they don't?  Exactly what fundamentals are you relying on???? Having dealt with analysts in the C-Suite on numerous occassions I am familiar with the level of detailed information they get.  I am having difficulty understanding how you would have access to more information and information they wouldn't consider, unless you are an insider with VP level info clearance.  Please advise..... thanks"
2021-05-28 10:02:14,wallstreetbets,Don't tell me what to invest in
2021-05-28 13:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I'm out"
2021-05-28 09:25:13,wallstreetbets,I think we are quite early here. Let's wait for the big moves :)
2021-05-28 11:33:49,wallstreetbets,"You’re already up over $1000 then, I hope you like money"
2021-05-28 13:17:32,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 09:12:14,wallstreetbets,I think this is probably correct. The price started climbing around the same time as GME and AMC this week so I am guessing this will be similar to back in January where BB rises along side those stocks. I have 200 shares and bag holding around $15.
2021-05-28 08:41:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah like that time it just hovered around $8 in January.
2021-05-28 09:43:56,wallstreetbets,So I should sell now and buy more at 8$? But..........
2021-05-28 16:03:50,wallstreetbets,"i'm also hesitant grow my position. ER is not looking good for Q1. EPS estimate consensus  
\-$0.053, down from last quarter. 

Position: 740 @ 12.14"
2021-05-28 11:50:48,wallstreetbets,We are winning with BB
2021-05-28 10:42:43,wallstreetbets,Very nice technicals and we are heading there for sure
2021-05-28 10:42:49,wallstreetbets,BB for the win
2021-05-28 17:17:41,wallstreetbets,"I may not look like I know what I'm doing, but I do."
2021-05-28 16:54:26,wallstreetbets,"Be patient, if it consolidates more, it will pop next week."
2021-05-28 17:19:18,wallstreetbets,Ohh boy that's gonna be a nice one when it hit's $20!
2021-05-28 09:13:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't think so, I think I read around 9% of the float is shorted for BB."
2021-05-28 09:24:43,wallstreetbets,Good choice! I am also here for the real gains
2021-05-28 11:32:41,wallstreetbets,Every share counts !!!
2021-05-28 11:32:29,wallstreetbets,samesies.
2021-05-28 11:45:51,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-05-28 12:57:30,wallstreetbets,I totally agree
2021-05-28 10:50:33,wallstreetbets,At what price?
2021-05-28 12:17:44,wallstreetbets,"Day's still young, they could still expire worthless today. :-/

Edit: and just like that you're back to free money. Or, $32/contract to close out the position early and take the rest of the afternoon off. 

FWIW, I had an order close out my position at break-even (I got my two month bagholder pin a couple of weeks ago) and jumped in with 6/11 calls at 12 and puts at 10 right at open. Sold half my calls to cover around 80% of the money, and I'm just hoping to ride the volatility for a few days."
2021-05-28 16:56:51,wallstreetbets,"10 myself, 15 7/2"
2021-05-28 15:28:52,wallstreetbets,Those 10 going to be worth a lot more than that soon!!
2021-05-28 05:29:20,wallstreetbets,"If you buy, you create momentum!"
2021-05-28 05:04:09,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this stock!!
2021-05-28 04:58:14,wallstreetbets,I assume that we will see a shift into $BB and $TLRY soon
2021-05-28 05:25:50,wallstreetbets,At this price there no fear in holding it if it doesn’t pop. You’ll just become a long term investor
2021-05-28 05:24:10,wallstreetbets,GME to the Moon!
2021-05-28 05:05:11,wallstreetbets,I think it’s going to be sucking on AMC tail pipe today hopefully! Maybe I can finally dump these $20.10 bags I’ve been holding since last January..
2021-05-28 09:48:05,wallstreetbets,That’s where I am at but that is also how I lost out on on GME lol
2021-05-28 06:57:20,wallstreetbets,yeah worried we might soar past the moon and go straight to uranus
2021-05-28 13:56:48,wallstreetbets,Entirely depending on their patent sale progress. If they manage to close the deal then the ER can look very good.
2021-05-28 11:11:32,wallstreetbets,"There isn’t a short squeeze case. Not everything is about short squeezing. If your company is overvalued and shit, that’s the only option. BB is different."
2021-05-28 11:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Businesses can create actual value, you monkey."
2021-05-28 05:11:26,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I am sorry for that. I am not a native English speaker"
2021-05-28 05:19:01,wallstreetbets,get offf myyyy boooaasrrdddddd
2021-05-28 10:18:20,wallstreetbets,Well BBs lower market cap and all their cybersecurity stuff means they're severely undervalued.
2021-05-28 15:28:35,wallstreetbets,What's that? Do not comprehend...
2021-05-28 15:28:20,wallstreetbets,Great entry price considering it was $12 earlier today! It'll get back there Tuesday and rocket ship from there!
2021-05-28 13:57:49,wallstreetbets,"Nah BB is a decent company with lots in the pipeline coming up (Eg. Working with AWS). It's not going anywhere but up. Probably not a rocketship overnight like GME but definitely lots of room to take off and fly, which it will next week!"
2021-05-28 11:31:18,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 14:52:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-28 14:00:14,wallstreetbets,ooh! ahhh!!
2021-05-28 11:59:11,wallstreetbets,"BB's back, tell a friend. 🎶"
2021-05-28 10:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Stop, I can only get so erect!"
2021-05-28 15:59:31,wallstreetbets,"me working in cyber security as well, but on reddit, and just threw 3k on BB"
2021-05-28 13:08:54,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂 👌
2021-05-28 14:39:02,wallstreetbets,"Blackberries are full of antioxidants, antioxidants are great at fighting viruses"
2021-05-28 14:10:09,wallstreetbets,They have one of the top antivirus softwares out there.  Cylance
2021-05-28 14:27:18,wallstreetbets,Marketing
2021-05-28 10:29:23,wallstreetbets,"Nice, of course"
2021-05-28 11:16:48,wallstreetbets,Ehhhhhhh nice 👌👌
2021-05-28 11:49:53,wallstreetbets,It’s like you’re reading my mind lol
2021-05-28 13:08:21,wallstreetbets,"This is a long play for me if I’m being honest, if I can take some profits during then I’ll take advantage to avg down more"
2021-05-28 19:53:28,wallstreetbets,I have… certain words for my own company! Every since they were bought out by an American company
2021-05-28 11:14:59,wallstreetbets,"What's the reasoning behind this? If they go belly up you lose your job and your stocks? 

If my company was publicly traded I'd have a few handful of their shares in my portfolio, nothing crazy. I'd feel obligated. LOL"
2021-05-28 13:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m holding due to the potential. All it’s gonna take is showing consistent revenue growth and they’ll take off. 

They’re ramping up this year an incredible amount and it will interesting to see where they stand next January

You need to remember they had to change from a Damn phone company into a software, iot and cybersecurity company. That takes a lot of time and patience. Blackberry was after its huge decline from the 100+ on track to going bankrupt. And it was reversed. That’s a huge accomplishment in itself and people bash it all the time but they successfully made the transition. Also, blackberry has known to be extremely secure foreeeever, this is well known fact and large part of why they have so many government contracts"
2021-05-28 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,"If the company wasn't called BlackBerry and was called something else, without the past history of BB and all that baggage, this stock would be trading at $30-$50 at the moment with everything coming up in their pipeline. BB will get there eventually but will take time. If this were a new company it would be up there already with more room to grow!"
2021-05-28 15:11:44,wallstreetbets,"u/AqsaAbbasi \- Just looked at this. Lucky you sold at $27 but went back below $8-$10 consensus target price, so don't see how you did not get back in ? As to analysts, maybe BB management don't want to share all the information with analysts, or can't. Analysts are not the most entreprenurial types. Not hard to see BB doing some very neat things and they are partnering with the best in the world. I don't think Chen and Watsa spent all this time (7-10 years) and money NOT to succeed. Plus Chen gets most of his pay when the shares are at $16-$20 USD and $30 USD."
2021-05-28 05:02:51,wallstreetbets,I am in and I also plan to add today
2021-05-28 06:41:57,wallstreetbets,"i am not in currently due to lack of funds, and i think it might take some time so i have time to still get in, but as soon as i gather a fair sum i will defintely go in to BB."
2021-05-28 07:21:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m in. 6,000 shares. I believe they will continue to grow as a security company and with IVY coming to market around February 2022 the potential is huge"
2021-05-28 10:20:17,wallstreetbets,"Memes aside they have a lot of work to do. They are competing with Android for EV os, and while they definitely have advantages, the google ecosystem is probably the first option that comes to mind because of how well you can integrate stuff into it. I'm still long (only 44 shares) because if things go right their valuation will skyrocket. Holding strong until it goes to zero or 100."
2021-05-28 15:23:25,wallstreetbets,I got in about 4-5 months ago at $13.70 or something like that. it was always my long game because I think the company is severely undervalued.
2021-05-28 11:23:00,wallstreetbets,Agree.?dont know about price eoy. But itll get pretty far
2021-05-28 10:00:09,wallstreetbets,❤❤❤❤
2021-05-28 09:49:35,wallstreetbets,this is the way
2021-05-28 09:28:35,wallstreetbets,This is what Twining looks like :)
2021-05-28 10:01:19,wallstreetbets,Me too...except I've been selling calls above my average price. Severely limited my upside if this thing goes into orbit
2021-05-28 10:12:53,wallstreetbets,Of course I did I’m a smooth brained retard
2021-05-28 09:53:39,wallstreetbets,Lol survey says...
2021-05-28 10:58:32,wallstreetbets,I averaged down from $18 a share to under $10. Feels good.
2021-05-28 08:40:45,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 14:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but it fucking *sucks* knowing you have to throw more money at a **massive** loss to make it worth it lol"
2021-05-28 09:45:28,wallstreetbets,I figured it was a dead stock
2021-05-28 11:02:33,wallstreetbets,Can’t average down in an IRA :(
2021-05-28 07:14:48,wallstreetbets,"Got 5 more shares.

Edit. I will hold my 21 shares!"
2021-05-28 08:18:47,wallstreetbets,Press sell at $149.69.
2021-05-28 08:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Wait til rocket hits moon, walk out of rocket."
2021-05-28 05:38:00,wallstreetbets,I honestly have no clue
2021-05-28 09:07:51,wallstreetbets,"There is no exit !

Once you´re in, you´re in !"
2021-05-28 07:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Been holding for many months. Definitely willing to average up with another 700 share buy. Valhalla or Mars, I don’t care."
2021-05-28 08:56:05,wallstreetbets,Yup. Stop loss at 8 when it closed below 10 yesterday means OP doesn’t believe what he’s saying. 20% dip and he’s out?
2021-05-28 19:11:55,wallstreetbets,I believe my girl is on birth control but still pull out.
2021-05-28 07:45:58,wallstreetbets,Shitting their pants they are
2021-05-28 08:28:26,wallstreetbets,Constipated?
2021-05-28 05:20:03,wallstreetbets,Just shares. Thought about calls at 9.50$ expiring sometime before June 4 though... have lots of potential for sure.
2021-05-28 13:29:44,wallstreetbets,Great post BTW.
2021-05-28 14:54:27,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything other than what is publicly available to anyone. Despite wild swings that can take place in a share price, in the end the fundamentals win the day. In the early days it is more subjective. Financial analysts work for IBs and not for the actual company they are researching. Yes sometimes both the company in question (like BB) and the IB are on the same side of the table BUT sometimes they are not. Financial analysts are not motivated to make bold calls or be subjective. They may eventually show up but usually much later, at which point the share price has likely appreciated quite a bit. They generally look for certainty. But one does not have to wait for the money to be on the books to know it’s coming. To make this point, 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. Yet MSFT invested $246 million for a tiny stake valuing FB at $15 billion. This is not a crazy analogy becasue QNX has a user base of over 175 million. And IVY will have the ability to tap that. BB also has revenues. Using $15 billion equates to about $27 USD per share for BB. What if we used 175 million ? At the time many thought MSFT was crazy but today that $246 million would be worth $20 billion or 75x more. You suggest no financial analysts have a buy rating (most are SELL/HOLD). If this is the case, you can ask yourself, or the institutions in question, why are 50% plus of the BB shares held by institutions. Many of these are considered world class and very savvy. Allianz hold almost a quarter of a $ billion in shares when no analysts are recommending BB ? Why ? Because they do their own research (as you, or I or anyone should) and understand that IB analysts and IBs are not working for you and I or them. There are other reasons as well but kind of sums it up. Hope this was helpful."
2021-05-28 19:15:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't trust any of these analysts. With AMC, for example, most analysts were saying to sell, that it's only worth $2/share (when it was at like $8). And I was like well shit, and eventually succumbed to the groupthink and sold all mine for a small loss. If I'd ignored the ""experts"" I would be up pretty big today. 

Same with BB. Last month I sold 75% of my shares after all the analysts suddenly downgraded it from bullish to bearish (the dumb little Fidelity analyst scores on the positions page went from like 8.2 ""GOOD BUY"" to 2.0 ""SELL NOW"" like overnight). I basically broke even selling at \~8.50 but again, if I'd just ignored the BS I would be up like over 10% on those shares right now. 

I'm no longer giving these analyst ratings any credence. Plus it's the financial sector anyway, lots of money at stake and so much abstraction, who knows what fuckery is really going on. Maybe it was in some powerful player's interest for more people to sell the stock so some analysts got paid off to tell people to sell, and vwa-la; share price goes down and they can swoop in and get a free discount on bulk shares. Then later change the rating to a ""MUST BUY"" and watch the price go back up, sell for profit. Maybe that's just overly paranoid on my part but really it wouldn't be that hard to make serious money by just advertising some ""experts"" opinion to sway public behavior on a stock. But that aside, I've already missed out on profits twice now by acting on analysts' opinions instead of my own. Analysts also said GME wasn't worth shit, just about every single one of them was wrong"
2021-05-28 10:12:26,wallstreetbets,Big moves here. +20%!
2021-05-28 11:45:37,wallstreetbets,what are the possibilities here?
2021-05-28 11:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Suddenly, stocks are interesting again."
2021-05-28 10:23:11,wallstreetbets,Honestly i would if i was actually in the green
2021-05-28 17:12:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reassurance haha.
2021-05-28 17:28:38,wallstreetbets,Check back next week to see if I get rotisseried or 🚀🚀🚀.
2021-05-28 10:57:11,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 10.78, at the last rally the price soared to 25$. 

If this wave will be greater, like 2nd amc wave, so there is a lot to expect"
2021-05-28 04:59:58,wallstreetbets,You think so? Also I'm wondering how much more amc/gme will go up
2021-05-28 06:56:37,wallstreetbets,TLRY? That's a ticker I haven't heard in a while. I've been a bag holding ape for a good 4 months now
2021-05-28 05:52:37,wallstreetbets,You didnt average down?
2021-05-28 09:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah I'm worried we'll leave the solar system and I'll never find my way back to earth again.  7,000 @ $12.  I have no doubts I'll be picked up soon for our journey."
2021-05-28 15:48:59,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. John Chen just gives me sus vibes sometimes, so when I see him going full retard on Twitter I don’t know what to believe."

2021-05-28 05:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Calls or shares? If calls, what strike price and expiration"
2021-05-28 14:55:42,wallstreetbets,Huge news. This is why I went all in this morning!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
2021-05-28 13:00:27,wallstreetbets,Wrong - Android only competes on the infotainment system level. Even Blackberry suggests Android has advantages in terms of infotainment. And Blackberry / QNX work along side Android. Beneath the Android infotainment system is QNX. And QNX is beneath other aspects of the cars' critical operations. Android is not. There is widespread misconception about this. Plus QNX has years of experience over anyone else as well as safety certifications that are absolutely critical that no one has.
2021-05-28 11:32:15,wallstreetbets,Well I think we could see it spike to $ 50 and then settle by mid June to the 30's which is where it belongs. I do love it when users say they don't know about this price by EOY when literally there are a ton of stocks who definitely don't deserve the levels they're at but are. I honestly believe that not rebranding BB with a new name is a bad idea. I think when the new CEO comes in soon that they'll do it. Chen has had his run ( since 2013 ) but it's time for him to retire ( he's going to be 65 soon ) and they need to find someone young fresh and more energetic to run the company. If he wants to make his bonus compensation by putting the stock over $ 40 USD he best move faster. BB is a long play but it should pay off especially with their QNX tech and the future of electric and self driving vehicles. It's P/E is 50 vs others in its same field which are much higher.
2021-05-28 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah fucked myself with selling a CC this past tuesday. Good bye my sweet blackberry shares ive had since Jan 11th
2021-05-28 10:44:04,wallstreetbets,😀
2021-05-28 12:36:09,wallstreetbets,Hell yea brother ride it back into green.
2021-05-28 10:46:52,wallstreetbets,"averaging down sounds nice and all, but it’s really just a nice way of saying to throw good money after bad"
2021-05-28 15:43:31,wallstreetbets,So you want ppl to buy that “dead stock” to get you at 25 avg?
2021-05-28 18:51:36,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-05-28 09:59:51,wallstreetbets,"I got 20, I have to buy one more so we are even."
2021-05-28 08:51:13,wallstreetbets,It would make me a BB millionaire haha.
2021-05-28 08:47:26,wallstreetbets,Lmfao that’s the strategy🤣🤣🤣
2021-05-28 09:09:19,wallstreetbets,"Yes, hopefully there will be an AMC cinema house there until then."
2021-05-28 07:03:09,wallstreetbets,Sounds wise 🦍
2021-05-28 09:06:33,wallstreetbets,$8 is time to buy the dip and avg down. Losing $2 per share is an exit strategy? Wow.
2021-05-28 09:45:59,wallstreetbets,"I’m down 27% in my stocks, last week it was 35+% the past few months but I’m still holding. You can’t buy with money you need to live on. I’m new to this but I knew going in that I had to be okay with loosing what I was putting in and being patient. To many people are expecting to get rich overnight."
2021-05-28 08:29:55,wallstreetbets,Shorts they have shat.
2021-05-28 11:07:51,wallstreetbets,"If you believed it was going back down to 8 you’d sell now no matter how in the red you are and buy back in at 8, recouping 3 a share immediately."
2021-05-28 07:02:00,wallstreetbets,Just a matter of time - we will see the awakening of a sleeping giant
2021-05-28 08:25:52,wallstreetbets,This is what the largest issue for some bag holders is.  You can profit on the way bag up if you average down.
2021-05-28 11:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Well, I totally understand why you haven't purchased their stock. 

I work in the entertainment industry/hospitality. Well, that's what they call it. I call it, working in a Bowling Center (to most it's a Bowling Alley). However, my company has 300 locations so I'd buy some shares for the hell of it if they went public."
2021-05-28 05:40:30,wallstreetbets,80% shares. 20% calls with 10.5 strike
2021-05-28 11:01:22,wallstreetbets,"That what i thought. Also, the left over cash I have i dumped into AMC. 

And also ""stick"" for the barkbox merger.

Between those 2 i can eat the BB loss for desert"
2021-05-28 15:11:42,wallstreetbets,"depends. I averaged GME down to $189 from $360; cashed out this week and made like $350 from it (I only had a few shares). I'll go back into GME when it bottoms out again, which I'm guessing will be in two weeks


I didn't like the idea of averaging down but it turned a loss (or a longer wait) into a small profit."
2021-05-28 16:02:11,wallstreetbets,Precisely.
2021-05-28 19:19:51,wallstreetbets,I’ve already contributed my max to my Roth. Can’t average down unless I sell other assets
2021-05-28 16:54:00,wallstreetbets,"I would be a thousandaire

woohoo"
2021-05-28 12:14:53,wallstreetbets,"I heard they used BB tech to to warp one up there, popcorn will be hot n ready."
2021-05-28 15:16:35,wallstreetbets,"Exactly right! Don't buy with money you need to live on. I missed out on gains last year because I had to sell a couple times around the first of the month. Now everything I buy is money I am willing to wave goodbye to, and everything I buy I believe in, so if I am down and can afford it, I just buy the dip and lower my dollar cost average. Long haul baby!"
2021-05-28 08:52:33,wallstreetbets,so much it is even harder to differentiate the shit from the shorter
2021-05-28 11:41:07,wallstreetbets,I’d probably short the company I work for 🤫

Trying to understand here. So in 2008 it was the housing crash. So we should get stocks that’s centered around the things that are driving the inflation costs?"
2021-05-28 12:43:22,wallstreetbets,The TTT & TBT are leveraged inverse. So calls go up when market goes down. I have puts on TLT because its normal. As soon as the fed announces interest rate hikes due to hyper inflation the bonds (debt market) will go down.
2021-05-28 03:52:38,wallstreetbets,"You’re telling me the rates are higher now than they were in sept 2019? In sept 2019, tlt was $147 right now it is 138.66. I’m pretty sure the rates are lower now than they were in 2020 which means the bond should be worth significantly more than the actual posting price, likely because it is heavily shorted.

2021-05-28 13:05:48,wallstreetbets,Its the fact that during inflation interest rates on bonds will rise to compensate for the decrease in value of the bond. Especially in the long term. Buy put options not shares its sure to go down once inflation comes into play

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPCE - we have achieved launch On the 22nd SPCE completed the first of its 3 planned test flights to space.
Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2…. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-€31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

The future is bright, The future is SPCE"

2021-05-28 11:36:32,wallstreetbets,"""Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.""

I posted something hesitant on this matter yesterday that got removed. 

People need to remain advised on the realities at hand, just because the inspection passed for this flight, does not mean the maintenance is now on track for Fall. It was discussed in detail on the earnings call if you skip to 10:00 in. If anything, the past wear could be a sign of accelerated wear which details are being held on, causing the the maintenance schedule to potentially be moved up in between some of these next 3 flights. But oh god, god forbid someone suggests something that would cause the stock to not moon day after day. 

I'm bullish as fuck on this stock. I trust the SPCE team is doing the diligence to ensure a predictable maintenance schedule, but hello.....this is uncharted territory."

They then  decided that the maintenance wasn’t necessary and could wait. Until the original programme in the fall ? I think so.
I don’t believe they would have flown WK2 if there was any doubt that the issues would impede on the test flight programme. 
I suppose we will have to wait till analysis is finished and hear back from VG.

I fully appreciate that there are doubts and given the background of the previous test flights who wouldn’t have doubts. 

Keep the faith SPCE🚀🌗"
2021-05-28 15:08:22,wallstreetbets,I don't think they would have gone with this flight if they thought they were going to delay the next one. They want to get them done in a short time frame.

After all, he’s always said he wants to go up on his birthday, July 18th. This date would also put SPCE ahead of Blue Origin, which plans on taking its first tourist up on July 20th."

2021-05-28 02:50:54,wallstreetbets,No you are dumb they moved to Texas because Texas is a tax haven and they were given credits for moving there. Same reason all streamers live in Texas and a lot of tech start ups. You can basically pay 0 tax on your income in the state of Texas has nothing to do with Mexico
2021-05-28 04:37:33,wallstreetbets,There's a reason Texans go to Mexico for healthcare
2021-05-28 14:01:53,wallstreetbets,What kind of loser is using the public health system?
2021-05-28 09:05:31,wallstreetbets,Get a job you lazy fuck. Health insurance is costs less than a TV if you have a job.
2021-05-28 12:02:08,wallstreetbets,Every streamer I watch lives in Cali but close I guess .. you might be right about taxes in Texas tho.
2021-05-28 02:55:24,wallstreetbets,All streamers?  You sound as dumb as the person you’re responding to.  Sorry but not everyone wants hot and humid.  There’s a reason why taxes are low.
2021-05-28 10:04:52,wallstreetbets,Sure if you have it for 1 month

Source: used to live in Texas. 15 years later and my taint is just now finally dry."
2021-05-28 12:00:57,wallstreetbets,Also seems like Texas has neglected a lot of things like infrastructure etc. sure we want to pay less taxes and we want the government not to waste our taxes but I sure wouldn’t have wanted that disaster related to the power a few months ago. A lot of that had to do with poor management. Not wind power.

2021-05-28 01:34:08,wallstreetbets,I’m curious. I only invested a small amount about a week ago and already doubled it on amc. Would it be crazy to buy more stocks now at $26 in hopes that this really goes to the moon! I’m new 😂
2021-05-28 01:36:59,wallstreetbets,Awesome! That’s what I was hoping
2021-05-28 01:36:13,wallstreetbets,"My understanding...this is the dip, buy now as it will moon"

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Genuine AMC question (related to any short squeeze) So this is something I can't figure out and I'd really appreciate it if someone helped me understand.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

P.s. FUCKING HODL AMC 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎👋👋👋"
2021-05-28 01:02:18,wallstreetbets,Those 700 million shares are counted for each sell and buy transactions so if there are a lot of day traders day trading the same share back and forth that would bring the count up high up quick.
2021-05-28 00:53:52,wallstreetbets,I'm holding
2021-05-28 00:56:45,wallstreetbets,My theory is that these HF elitist snobs just absolutely refuse to believe they have been outsmarted by people who drink domestic beer. They believe there is no way we can stay organized long enough to make a difference.
2021-05-28 01:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Today was likely just a gamma squeeze, with only 17% short float, there's probably not enough pressure to force a short squeeze. If enough people believe the squeeze is coming and buy shares and calls (which causes MM's to buy shares) then it spikes the price. The issue will be when that reverses as MM's unhedge OTM calls (charm pushes delta to 0 or 1 as time decreases). There's a lot of latent selling pressure if the price doesn't continue to rise, which would likely lead to a deflation tomorrow. There's also the possibility that people who are shorting meme stocks are shorting more than one, and may have covered AMC positions to hold on to GME shorts, or vice versa. Most of the heavily shorted stocks popular on here went up today which would support this: GME, AMC, NKLA, SOS, EBON, etc, all went up together which would support this idea."
2021-05-28 00:50:01,wallstreetbets,"Good question, smooth brains are thirsty for knowledge"
2021-05-28 01:19:40,wallstreetbets,Have you ever heard of u/atobitt
2021-05-28 02:27:59,wallstreetbets,"Many factors need to come into play to trigger a short – squeeze, but the thumb rule is you need short interest as a percentage of float above 20%. ( or even higher)."
2021-05-28 01:29:25,wallstreetbets,Stop wondering just stay ape strong
2021-05-28 01:02:26,wallstreetbets,GME reached its peak? GTFOH. I don’t see no moon.
2021-05-28 00:50:47,wallstreetbets,"I think the float data (which is usually 24 hours old) will reflect that tomorrow morning from today. Last I read it was like 20.3% (S3 data) and 140Mil shares. I wish I knew the exact answer myself, really no one does in real time. That 20.3% doesnt reflect the “fake shares” allegedly out there either mind you. The synthetic shares could be 50+ million more. Gonna be a another printing press tomorrow it looks like."
2021-05-28 13:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Look at the charts today for GME, AMC and FUBO. Tell me there's nothing to see there - they're exactly the same. While there was bound to be some deflationary pressure today, there's much more afoot than that."
2021-05-28 01:13:44,wallstreetbets,"If there are more shares than the actual float of the companies, shorts didn’t cover. It depends on how many shares you think are outstanding. To me, when a ticker is trading its entire float in a day, it’s not so much of a sign that shorts “could be covering,” as it is a dramatic indication of just how many shares have been synthesized"
2021-05-28 00:56:37,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget the x3 fake shares they sold not accounted for in any reporting until final count . they have to buy those before they can return real ones .  Not financial advice

Etc...etc..wtf should I do/would you do?"
2021-05-28 07:30:19,wallstreetbets,You are spot on!  The shorts are long gone and you are holding a bag of shit! You diamond hands legends are the last ones left at the party.   The music is about to stop.  SELL NOW!! AND TAKE HOME FAT STACKS!!

I'm eager to learn, so if you got some good info or advices I'll take them!"
2021-05-28 01:03:52,wallstreetbets,I just meant the January peak. Chill
2021-05-28 00:56:50,wallstreetbets,"But even if the synthetic shares were 200M, couldn't the shorts have covered today given the volume of 700M?

Not sure if it's clear what I'm asking.
I'm just confused as to why everyone says that shorts can't have covered yet when the volume of shares traded is so much higher than the float"
2021-05-28 03:58:37,wallstreetbets,"The idea of a short squeeze of shorts covering is pretty irrelevant unless the net short position declines. If new people come in to short positions as the stock goes up, short interest remains the same and short covering is not causing a squeeze.

The only type of squeeze likely is a gamma squeeze where people who sold uncovered calls are buying shares to hedge. Even there a lot depends on ITM calls being closed out and selling the hedges on those.

Basically as to why the volume is what it is and what has driven the upward price momentum is very hard, to impossible to determine. It does appear to be a squeeze, but more likely a gamma squeeze I think than a short squeeze."
2021-05-28 01:18:29,wallstreetbets,"This is true as well! Especially if a lot of retards and apes are diamond handing their shares, it just means there's much more synthesized shares than actual float being traded.

Also I just assumed the actual shares shorted are the ones reported, so just around 17% of the float. But we know that's not true, the data reported is not necessarily reflecting the reality of the situation and the actual number of shares being shorted."
2021-05-28 01:02:18,wallstreetbets,"If we look at the combined volume of the past 4 days, which is when the rally started, it is something like 1.3B. Therefore even if there were 900M synthetic shares, in theory the shorts could have covered (just taking into account the volume)."
2021-05-28 03:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Sam Adams is more than passable! Boston Lager is a fantastic representative of the style and for how much they produce? Amazing they've maintained the quality for so long.

Good reason why their stock is so high too!"
2021-05-28 01:03:51,wallstreetbets,"It’s ok, ape, they brew in Baltimore, MD now too!"
2021-05-28 01:56:33,wallstreetbets,"This is the underlying principle behind maximum pain theory. I've got a spreadsheet going for GME to estimate how many shares are likely going to be unwound tomorrow. It's currently around 3 million. They will get sold off as time passes (charm), if the price drops (delta), or as people take profit on their ITM calls (if they sell the call back to the MM, the MM then sells the hedged shares). It'll be a tug of war between MM's unhedging, paperhands, and dip buyers to see what happens. I'm personally betting on unhedging and paperhands, which is probably not welcome here."
2021-05-28 02:37:00,wallstreetbets,Premarket in Germany is up 7% so I’ve heard. So it may jump up. It’s just as likely to plummet though.
2021-05-28 02:35:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't know dude. I just know that based on the tables AMC has about 28m shares held to hedge options. It's just a latent selling pressure that will impact the situation. 28m out of 700m of volume may not be much, but you'd have to factor it relative to the number of people who bought new shares and weren't day trading and we can't know what that volume was. If unhedging causes a dip and people decide to sell and get out, that'll be the real cause of the drop.

Edit: my numbers were only counting 5/28 options. Once you add in the next 3 expirations (oi drops off after that) it's more like 70m shares. And we can expect about 3-4m shares to unwind per dollar drop in price."
2021-05-28 01:41:54,wallstreetbets,"People see GME going up, they buy calls and shares. Susquehanna (who is probably on the other side) then buys shares equal to the call delta to hedge the position. When the price goes up from these buys, it pushes up the deltas requiring more hedge shares, which feeds back on itself until the options are hedged and the MM is delta neutral. They also combine shares with other options (bought from yet other MM's) to gamma hedge, which they are probably doing a better job of this time around which is why the spike was smaller than January."
2021-05-28 04:11:52,wallstreetbets,"You can see the OI on options, then you can calculate the deltas and add everything up across the next several expirations. I don't have a good way of pulling the data live so I've just been having to hand enter it into an excel sheet to calculate. Best guess right now will be 3-4m shares per dollar drop in price (plus whatever calls get sold). I think the downward pressure from unwinding will just be the primer that triggers the retail selloff. Those who aren't totally drinking the koolaid will recognize that if there are more ape shares than short shares, then the only way to get out with a profit will be to leave another ape holding the bag."
2021-05-28 01:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Read his DDs on super stonk, they're quite good. Really helped me understand the situation"
2021-05-28 01:16:53,wallstreetbets,Who you telling to chill. We stay frosty up in this bitch. 😄😄😄
2021-05-28 01:36:56,wallstreetbets,"With AMC there are too many shares and the float is too large.  Your logic is sound.  GME is the real rocket because the float is so small and the amount of shares available is so small.  Full disclosure I had 220 amc contracts for 2022 and 2023 8 and 15 call.  I sold them all today.  I made good money on them.  I will then buy more gme.  I like seeing amc successful, but in my opinion gme and amc are not the same despite some of the same references being used."
2021-05-28 09:12:44,wallstreetbets,They haven’t even came close to scraping the short pile hold to $500k

2021-05-28 02:36:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm not worried about paper hands as much, but the unhedging is how it works and those that don't have money to exercise the calls will sell them back into the market creating the situation you described.  Let's just hope we can stay over 250 which will keep that strike price hedged. 😊"
2021-05-28 03:35:53,wallstreetbets,If today volume is bad are we apes dead? I m afraid of dead apes
2021-05-28 02:14:17,wallstreetbets,So you believe that amc will go down tomorrow. I already sold today for a really fat gain(for my small ass account any way).  I feel the call prices are way to high rn. I want to buy the $40 strike for June 18 something fishy is going there
2021-05-28 02:02:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the advice!

Any particular one you suggest me to look at?"
2021-05-28 01:19:22,wallstreetbets,You're actually right 😂
2021-05-28 09:25:13,wallstreetbets,"True, huge parts of their portfolio. Last I saw it was something like 40% or their sales?"
2021-05-28 02:43:41,wallstreetbets,Im willing ro bet that most of these people don’t have the money to exercise their options.
2021-05-28 03:52:21,wallstreetbets,"If there are only 100m short shares, and apes are holding way more shares than that, then where do you think the money is coming from when people decide to exit? It's coming from other apes who don't believe the squeeze happened. The only way this CAN end is with a ton of bag holders."
2021-05-28 02:39:25,wallstreetbets,"When a ticker goes nuts like this, the implied volatility shoots up. Options become more expensive when IV shoots up because there’s even less certainty about which way the stock will go. In other words: the sellers of the options get a higher premium since there is also more risk as the ticker could swing wildly either way."

I'll be able to exercise next weeks, but after that I'm gonna have to sell those July's unless I can get my house refinanced.  Crossing my fingers we moon before that so I can exercise them during the squeeze.   Lol"

I'm extremely bullish"

Synthetic longs would be exposed, create a short squeeze while still being able to raise funds through the bonus issue

&#x200B;

When OSTK did this their shares went to triple digits.

&#x200B;

Adding extra text to get around the dumb robo script which wants to check length. It also wants to check against brevity. Further it is synonymous with red tape. It would actually just want to cut ribbons than get on with it."
2021-05-28 00:50:57,wallstreetbets,"OSTK’s digital dividend definitely helped, but there are several factors that caused OSTK to hit $100+. That said, I think OSTK will hit $200+ within the next year."

2021-05-28 09:20:21,wallstreetbets,"Synthetic positions are just a 2 leg options play mate. You don't ""buy"" synthetic longs or shorts, you buy a call and sell a put to create an 100 delta position which effectively mimics 100 shares with their price action (hence the ""synthetic"" part of the name). 

But they aren't something that's floating around and pretending to be a real share, that's a *massive* misunderstanding of what it is.

Edit: If you don't believe me, then just read this https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic.asp"

2021-05-28 02:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. From long share perspective, doesn't matter if the share is real or not. If the broker allowed you to buy the share and it shows up in your account, then they are the first entity that is on the hook for paying you cash when you sell the share. If they can't, then they will margin call someone else to get the money."

And I mean, I'm not calling you a liar or anything, but I am starting to think that somebody, at some point, completely misunderstood something and misappropriated the term ""synthetic"" in a financial context and then a bunch of people believed then because it sounded good, or something along those lines.

Just like ""short ladder attack"""

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blue Apron: Hero or Zero This isn’t what you think. I’m not going to pitch a shit short interest play or prattle on about some pipe dream. No. I’m going to introduce you to an ultra-high-risk micro-cap play that, very well might be on the precipice of greatness.


What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it’s debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the “high affinity core users” would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You’ll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They’re in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they’ve struggled). They’re sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn’t be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it’s worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that’s working. You can’t sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I’m long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I’m buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I’m stupid."

2021-05-27 23:44:13,wallstreetbets,My wife and I absolutely LOVE Blue Apron and have added a lot of recipes (or parts of) to our repertoire.  I think the biggest hurdle is coaxing people to cook.  My marketing ideas would revolve around convincing young couples to discover the joy of cooking.
2021-05-27 23:29:22,wallstreetbets,I’m listening…
2021-05-28 00:08:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at their quarterly earnings, and I'll listen to their earnings call, but there is a lot to take concern about. I also need to read the 8K about their new debt covenant, and one or two other things. I did notice one or two things I liked, however. 

With the market cap of this company as small as it is, any meaningful shareholder appreciation in a very quick manner will lead to new share issuances, diluting existing shareholders, for one. They need the cash, and they need it badly. 

Another thing i noticed, is that they are all about being positive EBITDA wise, but that doesn't help when we're talking about net income. And I don't see even how they become Cash Flow Positive on an EBITDA basis anyways.

With that said, they have a lot of money in inventory, and in pre-paid expenses, so they have a bit of runway still.

I'll update with my observations tomorrow, probably."

2021-05-28 10:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Blue Apron trades at 0.2x revenue versus HelloFresh trades at 4x revenue. I'm not saying Blue Apron deserves the same revenue multiple as HelloFresh right now, but if they can figure things out quick this could be a 30 banger over the next 5 years.....or it could go to $0. Lots of upside but highly risky. I like it."
2021-05-28 15:18:53,wallstreetbets,"Taking a look here and yeah, this is risky. Even if you just bought shares, you could end up losing everything. Blue Apron is not a healthy company BUT a turnaround would be an enormous cash in"
2021-05-27 23:28:55,wallstreetbets,Everyone I knew took their promo and cancelled after. Can’t say no to free food
2021-05-27 23:42:39,wallstreetbets,"I think blue apron and companies like have passed. Grocerers have been developing and pushing ready to cook/heat meals for 3 years now. The 159 billion spent annualy (2019) on RTH/RTC meals is expected to grow by 5.5%. Its cheaper for the consumer, easier to prepare and easier to get now that more companies do curbside pickup and delivery. 

I think blue apron came 5-10 years too late."
2021-05-28 10:29:14,wallstreetbets,"I have puts on APRN from when it was $8. I am betting its going to zero. The cash flow is drying up. Their customer base is hardly growing. All they announce are new meal recipes which really don't do anything. Look, this isn't a turnaround play like GME. GameStop was actually undervalued. APRN is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. I could give you more reasons why, but really if you read the 10-K you can figure it out for yourself."

2021-05-28 06:03:20,wallstreetbets,Isn't almost all of their new user acquisition through marketing? This seems like capped upside with massive downsides.
2021-05-28 14:12:38,wallstreetbets,"This is going into the tank.  Purely anecdotal : the middle class suburban moms on my street tried this and Hello Fresh during promo period, then quit, because it's way overpriced.  A couple liked the recipes, but we have The Internet so that's not really a thing.  When the recession hits, the few remaining customers are gonna dump this like, some analogy for dumping something extremely fast."
2021-05-28 00:47:16,wallstreetbets,I agree. I was basically an idiot in the kitchen. We did Blue Apron for like 3 months...switched to Hello Fresh lol. Then just stopped because I had enough kitchen skills at that point to just shop for myself and now my wife basically eats at a decently nice restaurant every night.
2021-05-27 23:37:24,wallstreetbets,Me too🐋
2021-05-28 07:13:25,wallstreetbets,"I’ve read all of their 8Ks, listened to their past several earnings calls, and I keep a model. I typed this on my phone so unfortunately so I didn’t get to be as detailed as I wanted.

They previously had EBITDA covenants which they breached. I believe they refinanced last year for this very reason. In fact, they’ve already breached their current covenants by going under $20M during 1Q. That’s why it’s been revised down to $15M.

The company enjoyed a pretty strong pull-forward in demand last year, but it wasn’t positioned to capitalized on it. They were already in a state of making the business lean and they didn’t have the resources to drive improvements in retention, rates. They were also hit by labor shortages, which caused increases in opex and further prevented the realization of operating leverage.

I don’t view dilution here as a major negative. When you bet on micro caps, you’re essentially betting a person is going to drive a turnaround in a broken business, and that’s what this is. We need flexibility to be able to focus on the growth initiative without being saddled by that debt. Oh, and before you waste time on the 8K, it’s $15M at all times and over 320K customers. There are also a bunch of warrants associated with the offering (dilutive), at $0.01 per share. Again, bad signs.

Look at HelloFresh. It started smaller than Blue Apron and it’s now a $15B company with high top-line growth rates. The negative risk factors for blue apron, low competitive moat, low switching cost, etc extend to them, so a campaign focused on low margin customer acquisition would be effective.

Regarding timing, I’ll save you some extra effort, as it’ll also have to be soon. They’re within the danger zone assuming their current cash burn remains constant. They’ve resolved many of their labor cost issues that drove expenses last year, so they estimate $2M at least will drop off the burn, but we’ll see what actual impact it had in August. Anyway, they’re coming up on headwinds from reopening reducing demand with more people wanting to travel and they’re also facing the worst seasonality for margins given the challenges of shipping perishable goods across the nation during the warmest months of the year.

This isn’t a “wait and see what happens” deal, it’s a near-term event where it’s either going under, or they’re going to find a way to continue on. I think it’s likely that, if they can continue to grow the customer base, they’re able to successfully execute on a strategic alternative. The fact is, I don’t think they’re going to be able to refi the debt or issue enough equity as the current conditions stand. Maybe they can find someone to do a PIPE offering, or ATM, but I think they’re going to be in a position where they sell to a better capitalized business. A big reason I believe this is that they’re so close to that cash covenant (again), but they’re still full throttle on growth. Usually a company in this stage would be aggressively trimming costs down to the bone, unless there was a reason not to be concerned. If you see any off-cycle sell-side research from Maria or Brian (or better yet a new analyst) that’s also a good clue that banking activity is up.

IMO- you can’t use traditional fundamentals to judge a micro cap stock. That’s how it got here. At this point it’s more prudent to use mosaic theory and anecdotal evidence as to how it can come back and what form that would take. The fundamentals totally point to bankruptcy, you’re right, but look at their announcement in Feb 2020 and compare it to their actions today. You’ll see the prior reflects a company preparing to die and the more recent implies something different."
2021-05-28 07:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Hey, the big guys are allowed to go on CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox Biz, Cheddar, etc and talk their books. No reason I can’t share my idea. This is a high-risk trade and I don’t try to hide it at all, but I know this business well and I want to share my research. Absolutely do not buy this without researching it yourself, but there is no shame in sharing ideas."

2021-05-28 09:55:46,wallstreetbets,lol the stocktwits crowd has been trying to make this happen for over a year
2021-05-28 12:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. You get it. High chance of bankruptcy, but if you’re fine losing a few hundred bucks, worst case, then you could end up with close to $10K. Pretty solid risk/reward model, especially since I think they’d try to sell the business (might not be at an ideal price) before they go under, which means you wouldn’t likely be completely shit out of luck."
2021-05-27 23:30:49,wallstreetbets,"That’s what they should be doing. Again, I’ll repeat myself, look at hellofresh. That approach works. The old method of trying to increase high affinity user KPIs was wrong. Giving away food to attract new customers and gain adoption works."
2021-05-28 07:19:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to say it for a 60th time. HelloFresh proves the business model works. There is a question as to whether or not Blue Apron can turn around, but there isn’t as to whether or not meal kits are viable. I cook for myself all the time. It’s one of my favorite hobbies, so I’d never use this, but clearly people are buying hellofresh when you look at the trends in sales growth and margin expansion- even pre pandemic."
2021-05-28 03:26:18,wallstreetbets,"Idk if they came 5-10 years late so much so as the pandemic pushed everything up 5-10 years sooner. 

So many large grocery chains dragged their feet on competent grocery ordering online, but tell them that people can't come into their stores for a month and all of a sudden WalMart, Meijer, Kroger etc. All have user friendly grocery delivery and pickup. 

I'm not mad about it either, it fucking rules and is EXPONENTIALLY cheaper than these. The only people who I see this being for are those who have absolutely zero interest in researching what to cook but wanting to still cook instead of RTC/RTH meals"
2021-05-28 12:17:40,wallstreetbets,"GME is not a turnaround play either, it’s a large scale pipe dream that is entirely unproven. I’m not comparing these, but, to play devil’s advocate. It was also a micro cap bet and that’s essentially how these work."
2021-05-28 12:52:31,wallstreetbets,I don’t use hellofresh either and they have killed ebitda margins and strong net profit with lots of room for expansion from added operating leverage. That isn’t the best way to look at stocks.
2021-05-27 23:24:29,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you. I hate this shit, but the business model works. HelloFresh is essentially a proof of concept. Right now, this is trading at a third of sales. You get this up to 1x and you keep growing the subscriber base, and you’re looking at a nice return."
2021-05-27 23:39:48,wallstreetbets,“I personally can’t use the service this business offers so investing in this business must be a bad idea”
2021-05-27 23:23:52,wallstreetbets,Just buy AMC or oil stocks instead
2021-05-28 07:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Historically, yes, that’s played a role, but more recently it’s been a mix between that and R&D.

Upside, intrinsically isn’t capped. The downside is capped at the capital invested. At $80M, it’s pretty safe to say the downside is limited compared to the potential in the event of a recovery."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail) This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions."

2021-05-28 00:05:41,wallstreetbets,I have 10 shares @23.79 if you would like to buy them for say 25 each
2021-05-28 00:56:36,wallstreetbets,"I don't know the details with Alex Karp, but for those trying to understand the tax treatment here, what the author is saying is he received nonstatutory stock options.

Tax-wise, when the option is exercised (i.e. he buys the shares) he has regular ordinary income on the difference between the current share price and the strike price. For example if the strike is $10 and the stock price is $22 he has income on 22-10=12.

Two things to keep in mind... One, he has to come up with the $10 per share, which he can simply get via selling enough shares to cover the $10 cost and two, he needs enough money to pay tax on the $12 income, which may force him to sell another large chunk of those shares.

If his plan is to hold the shares, then to the extent he does not need funds to cover the strike price it is beneficial for him for the share price to be lower as his tax burden is less. BUT, as he needs money to cover that strike, obviously a higher price might be better.

Going back to my example above, if he exercised 100 shares worth, he would need $1,000 to cover the strike, which at $22 per share would be about 45 shares. In addition to cover taxes (assuming 40% x $1,200 = $480) he would need to sell another 22 shares, leaving him with 33 shares net. If the share price instead was $15, then he would need to sell 67 shares to cover the strike and the tax (40% x $500 = $200) would need another 13 shares, netting him with 20 shares. Bottom line, he benefits from the stock price being up if he needs to cover the strike price.

This is all forced activity as the alternative may be to lose the money.

Not sure how my explanation plays into your thesis but it is what it is.

I am bullish on PLTR."

[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on “Rhodium” that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism.

One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone’s guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we’ll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let’s all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees “a year” to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he’s ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn’t enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don’t know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he’s going to crash up there.

2021-05-28 00:46:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean...are you serious with this question?

Maybe I'm grounded in science too much, but there is no way to answer this question as written. I would need answers to a dozen questions before even starting to assess what they number might be. 

If you don't know what number is a life changing amount of money for YOU, and you can't pair that up with a price target and do some division...you're probably in the exact right place to be getting financial advice. 

What country to you live in? What part of the country? How much is cost of living there? How old are you? Do you have debt? How much debt? Do you have any expensive medical conditions? Do you have children? How many and will they be going to college? Are YOU wanting to go to college? How much is college in what ever country you live in? Do you want to travel the rest of your life or are you happy living comfortably in a modest home for the rest of your life...how ever long that might be? 

Life changing money might be $5,000 for one person who is 21 and just needs enough to pay for the last 2 quarters of college and finish a degree (potentially changing their life) while they live at home, or it might be 5 million for someone else who is 40 or 50, owns and runs multiple businesses, and just wants to shut it all down and walk away but not lower their quality of life. Or maybe it's 10 million for someone who works making 200k a year, but they are trapped in a job with great health coverage and their little girl has an illness that is covered by their health insurance, but it would cost 100,000 a year in medical if they quit their job. So they would need 10 million to be able to safely live off a safe 3% dividend stock and not be risking their kids life by quiting their job."
2021-05-27 23:49:33,wallstreetbets,How much would it take at $50k a share to be life changing. $50k is my floor at minimal for AMC.

2021-05-28 00:54:52,wallstreetbets,Ahhhh very good questions 🧐. Well I’m in Texas so cost of living is low. I’v been struggling with how much more I can afford for time being until the squeeze and then once there make enough gains to buy one or many businesses to sustain the wealth with new home and new vehicles and private schooling for. Currently I’m at 614 shares. A month and a half ago I was at 918 but then realized I over spent so I needed to pay bills and feed my daughter so that’s how I got down to 614. I’ve just been struggling to decide if I need more or if I’ll be able to accomplish my goal with where I’m at with 614. I know it’s a dumb thing to ask on Reddit but but yesterday and today have me extremely anxious now and even though I have 614 FOMO is really fucking with me.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC!!!!!!! What is going to be decided on June 2?  

Greeting to All my beloved Apes!

I just watched some Korean youtube channel talking about AMC stock that on June 2, $500 million of paid-in capital increase will be decided according to the vote result.

But, I heard somewhere that even if this happens, Adam(CEO) will not going to make it by 2021 which is a clear sign that he is on our side.

But I was not able to find the official remarks or sources that he claimed it.

Is there anyone who is keen on this? If you have any resource dealing with this, please let me know. Thanks."
2021-05-27 22:48:00,wallstreetbets,There is no dilution - the ceo took it off the table. They sold the remaining 43m shares they held which was snapped up instantly and pushed the price up
2021-05-27 22:29:51,wallstreetbets,I vote price goes up!
2021-05-28 00:06:38,wallstreetbets,Stiil holding amc? Good idea to buy more?

2021-05-27 22:29:18,wallstreetbets,June 2 is when the proxy vote starts. You need to be the shareholder on record as of market close tomorrow (Friday may 28) to be eligible for the proxy vote.

2021-05-27 23:12:40,wallstreetbets,"Ford came out swinging with a dig at their competition; a low price matching Tesla, and a huge new focus on fleets with a standard package price matching lordstown.

What will actually happen: $75k average price with deliveries starting mid 2022, as was anticipated a year ago...  Their ICE models lose margin once production is reduced, so it will be a slow shift to EV.

GM is offering early EV reservations for current customers, too.  Those prices are close to $100k, so I think Ford has over promised, or is banking on cost reductions before production starts."

I think with GM working with LG to put an EV battery plant across the street from the lordstown plant, they may have their eye on reclaiming production there. They already own 10% of the company so it’s probably a win win for them. I do believe tho that this company is not Nikola and Hindenburg ran the same play for an easy short payday.

2021-05-28 02:25:17,wallstreetbets,He mentioned ICE vehicles getting 3-5 and said “if Ford raced”.
2021-05-28 09:53:06,wallstreetbets,"You mentioned that Lordstown has a 64 mile max range total. If that’s true then the low end 39k Ford lightning would have 20 miles per charge less range than Endurance. So by your logic, the Ford Lightning has only a 44 mile range.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkrw5i/expi_why_its_a_buy_60_price_target/

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants."

Not saying you're off the mark, or on the mark. Just information I would want in order to build a more complete picture. I like expi long term as well, but currently sitting on $83 of available margin left to use. So...gunna have to wait to make any more plays."

This should place the company squarely in a 100-200 range in a very short time

2021-05-27 22:56:14,wallstreetbets,"My realistic year end price predictions over the next couple years:

2021: $30 - $40
2022: $60 - $80 (or buyout)
2023: $100 - $200 (or buyout)

What are these valuations based upon:
- Continued increasing quarterly sales and patient enrollment of Orladeyo for HAE, with possible +EPS quarters successively to come later this year.
- Starting pivotal trials for BCX9930 (Factor-D) in 2H for PNH patients, resulting in blockbuster results in 2022.
- FDA approval for use of Factor-D for PNH patients by early 2023.

These estimates do not factor in other drugs in their pipeline. Those will be added to the valuation if/when they mature.

These are just my personal price predictions and not investment advise. Please do your own DD to determine what investments meet your financial goals."

At anytime they could stop spending on r and D and operate at outrageous profit margins and be profitable instantly...tomorrow 

but they don’t because that’s the definition of stupid. They need to continue to innovate and gobble marketshare"
2021-05-28 00:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the way biotech companies work is why I hate almost all of them. Currently, they are still unprofitable, and I dont like it. I can see the attraction tho"
2021-05-28 00:34:01,wallstreetbets,"how long did amazon run at a loss? Uber still runs at a loss..shit have you read shoe dog? Nike was unprofitable for over a decade...just piled every dollar back into the company for growth.

There’s a difference between operating at loss and not being able to be profitable. bcrx could be profitable starting now...it just doesn’t make sense to know push growth."
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I am an idiot. Wife doesn't know yet. Yolo'd into GME at the peak hoping to correct this loss.

2021-05-28 01:45:34,wallstreetbets,You know how sometimes you get really super psyched about a stock and then after a while you realize what a piece of shit it is and what the fuck you were even thinking throwing any money into it in the first place...then you just resent it and wish it would die?! - That’s how you’re wife is going to feel about you. But hey brother the good news is there are other stocks in the sea.
2021-05-28 02:04:18,wallstreetbets,"I hope you recover. Please be careful not to get caught up in the thrill and jeopardize your own finances. In the end, it’s your money, and not others’ comments, that matters."
2021-05-28 02:23:53,wallstreetbets,Look at it from the bright sight: your loss is someone else’s banana!
2021-05-28 02:23:58,wallstreetbets,How much do they pay you to post this low energy fud.

2021-05-28 08:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Seriously just sell asap

It might go up... Maybe


Is it worth risking it again?"
2021-05-28 10:43:18,wallstreetbets,Really hope it works out for you.  I know so many guys that don't tell their wives.  I guess they want to surprise them.  Either way it works.

2021-05-28 03:37:43,wallstreetbets,"this is what many people who didn't study statistic don't understand.

Stock price can go up or down, so the chances are 50%; if you double down again after it went down, there are 100% chances of it going up.

Simple WSB maths"
2021-05-28 11:44:38,wallstreetbets,Stock go up?

2021-05-28 12:49:34,wallstreetbets,I will survive either way. Just more depressing than anything. I can pick up extra contract work over the winter.

2021-05-28 10:27:07,wallstreetbets,"Bro it’s not that deep. Think of it like this, a stock can only go down 100%, but it can go up unlimited %"
2021-05-28 18:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Why are you making calculus out of geometry? There is no statistics or any finite state automaton. If you cancel out all the variables, we derive at the following common denominator. “Stonks Go Up!” 🤥📈"

2021-05-27 21:26:16,wallstreetbets,Holy. You’re right. Not sure how I could have been so duped. I would be lucky if it even went to 500. Guess I need to buy more to make up the difference.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is the Atlis Motor vehicle pre-IPO round of investing real? I saw an ad to invest in Atlis Motor Company. Its not yet publicly traded and I was thinking of throwing some money in with the hope that it will either get bought out by a larger manufacturer or the share price will increase when they go public. I like how their vehicles look and this seemed interesting to me.

Then I thought about it and thought it was a little weird that a company would advertise to invest in it to the public? Then I thought I remembered someone  told me that the general public cannot invest in a pre IPO stock because they aren't considered a sophisticated investor. Then I thought this might be some type of scam.

Gonna post the link at the bottom.... if anyone knows anything about this please give me some insight. Thanks.

2021-05-27 21:45:01,wallstreetbets,Did they sneak in at night and hang a sign ?
2021-05-27 23:12:55,wallstreetbets,"There’s some posts on Reddit about this, it’s real . However, their chances of success are low. Some have compared them to Tesla and how much money it took for Tesla to succeed, and these guys don’t have that kind of cash flow. Maybe through this they can build that cash flow. If you have money you don’t care to throw away then $8 per share is not that crazy . Their real challenge is being able to create a battery that can charge in 15 minutes."
2021-05-28 02:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Just another ape here, but my tiny brain that only thinks about the nanners is saying stay away. They're a battery company that's trying to shift into the vehicle manufacturing business. Looks legit because their ads show 2-3 models from what I've seen, but they haven't produced any mock-ups. Very risky unless you know something I don't. As I said, just another ape, haven't deeply researched the company, but that's the few things/thoughts I've seen thrown around about the interwebs."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,2k —> 18k AMC leaps 
2021-05-27 20:32:07,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-05-27 21:25:57,wallstreetbets,This is the way. This is what I strive to be. You have more balls than me and a lot of others. See you on the MOOOOON!!!
2021-05-27 21:36:24,wallstreetbets,I’m holding January 20 2023 $4 LEAPS. loving the gains so far. Let’s see if we can keep it going. If it hits GME levels I’m going to be filthy rich.
2021-05-27 23:54:31,wallstreetbets,"When leaps are this deep itm- sell them, buy stocks, start selling calls (weekly)."
2021-05-27 21:12:03,wallstreetbets,Man leaps were the way to go sheesh
2021-05-27 20:54:59,wallstreetbets,"As someone who’s never hit that big on leaps, how easy is it to sell them now? Doesn’t there need to be a buyer in the other end, and who would actually pay that much knowing the price won’t stay this high long term?

Not criticizing just genuinely curious"
2021-05-27 21:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Wow, when did you buy these? Your cost basis is amazing."
2021-05-28 10:02:39,wallstreetbets,What’s the green? Isn’t it meant to be a minus and in red?
2021-05-27 20:42:37,wallstreetbets,Sell that. This isn’t ending the year above $10.
2021-05-27 20:36:03,wallstreetbets,Holy shit
2021-05-27 21:12:16,wallstreetbets,"Such a good play, congrats man!"

2021-05-28 00:34:45,wallstreetbets,I'm new at options but obviously you would sell ur calls way sooner if it jumped to GME status in the next couple weeks right? Forgive me!
2021-05-28 01:23:34,wallstreetbets,How many contracts did you buy?
2021-05-28 09:49:47,wallstreetbets,There are 70 million GME stocks and around 6 times as many AMC. Hitting GME levels would that mean 1/6  the price of GME?
2021-05-28 02:11:03,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t be too smart to buy the stock at these levels lol this is a short squeeze...
2021-05-28 10:58:33,wallstreetbets,Why do you need the stocks to sell weeklies? You are just increasing your risk to do the same thing.
2021-05-27 20:59:54,wallstreetbets,I honestly have no idea. Wen mooning i will exercise.
2021-05-27 21:37:36,wallstreetbets,"I had no issues selling half (2) of my GME leaps during the last spike. No issue when there’s a lot of volume. On a slow moving, low volume, stock I’m sure it’s quite difficult to offload them."
2021-05-28 01:50:50,wallstreetbets,"A market maker will buy them for slightly below market value. Part of being a market maker is providing liquidity, and they are required to do so, per their legal agreement to be an MM."
2021-05-27 21:32:22,wallstreetbets,I think in March
2021-05-27 20:43:35,wallstreetbets,🧢
2021-05-27 20:53:27,wallstreetbets,Your right realistically it will end up above 99.00 by the years end.

2021-05-28 15:40:47,wallstreetbets,fuck you? fuck me.
2021-05-27 21:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Im working on it. I have to start small and work my way up as I don't have much I can put in, but with today's AMC gains, I went in the green finally today after being red for a month. Feels good."
2021-05-28 11:45:23,wallstreetbets,Only buy if you want exposure to the name...
2021-05-27 22:24:28,wallstreetbets,Don't exercise. You give up all the extrinsic value. Better off selling the option and buying the shares.
2021-05-27 21:00:46,wallstreetbets,Um oh ya I forgot you can just exercise rather than sell to close. I’m tarded
2021-05-28 02:09:52,wallstreetbets,There’s always a MM to buy at the ask.
2021-05-28 08:06:42,wallstreetbets,"Do you know anything about finance or economist?

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them."

2021-05-27 23:07:49,wallstreetbets,"Also you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions."

2021-05-27 20:28:03,wallstreetbets,Well on paper they’re unprofitable because of stock compensation. They’re cash flow positive meaning they stack cash in the bank every month due to more profit than overhead. Shares are created at 0 cost to pltr but cost the shareholders.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tesla might be a bad future investment. (long read)  

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

so if you take these reasons ( and they are not all, i have a few more ) into consideration tesla now might be a good stock with nice returns but now that synthetics are becoming more and more possible i am starting to think they might actually be our future. like i said I'm pretty new and relatively dumb on the mentality of other investors please leave your opinion below."

2021-05-27 20:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Your argument is based on ""all or nothing"" theory about what types of cars will be around in the future. Gas, EV, and other types of vehicles can all coexist for the foreseeable future. It doesnt always have to be only one type of vehicles over the others.

As for investing, you do you based on your research. No need to try to persuade others and create FUD. 

Also, Tesla is not just an EV company. There are other parts of the company that you seem to overlook. Similar to what other investors said when they were betting against Tesla for the last 10 years."

IMHO, there is going to be room for a number of renewable options and EV's are here to stay, but Tesla is going to finally start facing some real competition from other manufacturers.  They will continue to be #1 to the Musk fan boys but we're going to start seeing some real great options from Audi, Mercedes, Porsche, Ford and others. The market will continue to grow, but Tesla's share of that growth is going to shrink. If Musk was truely concerned with the environment he would be also pushing green hydrogen tech.

2021-05-28 00:01:46,wallstreetbets,"1. Traditional ICE engines and drivetrains have limited lifespans and will cost more to make than EV's.
2. No one is ""replacing"" their ICE cars, rather as people are in the market for new cars, many opt for EV's.
3. EV's with million-mile batteries, will last 20 years, versus about 10 years for ICE vehicles (also see point 1 for why EV's will last longer). This will mean total cost of ownership is substantially cheaper for an EV. Further, it will ensure a robust used car market where you can buy 5-15 year old EV's for less than comparable ICE vehicles.
4. Tesla's are built fine. There are some minor panel trim issues that should be resolved with the new builds from Texas and Germany (once the factories are up and running). Inherently the new cars with front and rear single casts will be built to tighter tolerances than any other car out there (it is an inherent property of casting, so going to be hard to beat the quality of those Tesla's if you don't use single large castings as well).
5. Weight will go down significantly with the single casts and the 4680 structural cell. This means more range, better handling, and less wear and tear on wheels and suspensions.
6. Not sure the relevance of other industries if batteries are just better for EV's (recall Mr. Diess of VW has agreed that pure battery is the way to go).
7. The switch to electric seems to be going as fast as Tesla can make them. Tesla is also making home battery packs and solar panels which are increasingly being rolled out which help make the grid more robust and support more EV's.
8. If you can switch to synthetics now, than might as well, but no reason it should stop the move towards EV's. Further, the idea that you can make synthetic fuel efficiently is based on having access to green energy, but you point (#5 in your list) says the electric infrastructure is not there... The thing is, making hydrogen takes about double the energy you get  out of it, so to go to synthetics you need your grid to be double what it needs to be for BEV's, which is where I will stop with this, as trying to think through the apparent contradictions this raises is causing my head to hurt.

Basically, Tesla will have incredible growth and any attempt to move to synthetics will likely result in a massive failure as it makes no sense to build vehicles that use that if you can make them BEVs instead."

I think hydrogen and synthetic fuels will become viable for long-distance freight carriers (think semi-trucks and freight planes) where only a small number of refueling stations are needed with a steady demand to make production viable. 

For personal transportation I would bet on full electrification with major improvements in battery technology and charging infrastructure just a few years away. Tesla may play a part in these industries if they can keep their customer fan base loyal like Apple does and willing to tie themselves to their eco-system. But I see them as maybe having 10-30% market share in the future just like Apple does. Huge but not dominant. Definitely not justifying their current valuation (worth more than many of the other major auto-makers combined)."

2021-05-28 12:13:29,wallstreetbets,">If its green H2 (which everyone is prepared to process) who cares about efficiency.

Because H2 will inevitably be supplied (right now it's 95% of H2 supply) by natural gas the through steam-methane reforming process. This requires both high heat and high pressure--energetically expensive, and must be factored into the efficiency.

This is guaranteed to be the predominant force in H2 production, should it ever reach a matured market because oil majors have the most money to buy politicians with. This is a law of nature that also must be factored into the calculation. This analysis cannot fail to take into account Big Energy's grip on policy, just by virtue of the system of legalized bribery--in the US and everywhere else billionaires run the country.

So there's the energy to get H2 from NG. The by-products: H2O, CO, CO2. Transport costs to the gas stations, more GHG into the system. Then the efficiency of the burn and power losses over the course of a regular ICE engine--this is the biggest efficiency loss. There are a tonne of steps in this process, it's energetically expensive, and therefore, produces more GHG by-products. 

Don't be fooled. H2, if it ever becomes viable, will be another tool of the big oil majors. They control the multi-trillion dollar extraction and processing infrastructure already. They will use it any possible way to squeeze every possible shekel out of it until it breathes its last breath, and they don't care if they turn the entire planet into the Sahara Desert in the process.   

Until we have home electrolysis units producing fuel safely from our homes, or otherwise cut Big Energy interests out of the equation, H2 will remain a gimmick."

Even then, H2 fuel replacements will just be a transition away from the consumer ICE marketplace. 

Given the same price, would you rather have a vehicle that burns fuel and needs oil changes or one that doesn't do either, which do you want? I know which one sounds more appealing to the average person.

The advent of EVs throws the efficiency question out the window for ICE vehicles. They simply can't compete with upwards of 70% efficiencies from EVs, plus the low maintenance, no oil changes, extension of battery pack life, etc. 

These other fuels do have a place in the transportation needs of the future--drones, aircraft, industrial machinery, all will continue to use liquid fuels for combustion, but the retail ICE market will be displaced by batteries and nothing will stop that now."
2021-05-28 13:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Hey I added another link.  The path is simple if you are dedicated to making them work.  Think of it like solar with batteries.  The fuel cell is your battery.  But also, the H2 you get can be used as gas for stoves and fireplaces and what not.  

I love my ICE car.  I'd love to run it on H2.  Personally I dont trust BEVs and every Li-ion battery I've had didnt last after a few years (I know car batteries are more robust).  Infact I had a cell phone battery nearly blow up, the casing was bulged out like a balloon.  If I could I'd remove all the computer dependency out of the car I'd do it too.  There is no way I'd want to spend a third of a day charging a car if I wanted to do any distance driving.

People think about H2 in small passenger vehicles all wrong.  Forget efficiency for a moment.  Once we get away from gas reforming and H2 is made off peak hours from the grid.  It'll be freely sourced from water or waste.  Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear will make the H2 free too.  It'll be abundant and clean the air by using it.  They have materials in development that can store H2 4x as compact as traditional tanks and contain 5x the fuel.  Couple that with ultra capacitors or batteries that dont rely on rare earth metals or toxic lithium and the benefits out weigh any efficiency arguments to me."

This is all understandable as an emotional response to the changing market, but ultimately this approach ignores the raw reality that BEVs are vastly more efficient and lower cost of maintenance than anything else. By a longshot.

There's no motivation to put a tonne of money into H2--especially into large-scale production of consumer level electrolysis--because BEVs already solve every problem with *higher* efficiency. People and companies have better things to spend their money on than a problem that's already solved. They'd end up spending a fortune for a final product that's less than half the efficiency with current BEV tech.

Who's taking that deal? Someone with a large marketing budget.

>They have materials in development that can store H2 4x as compact as traditional tanks and contain 5x the fuel. Couple that with ultra capacitors or batteries that dont rely on rare earth metals or toxic lithium and the benefits out weigh any efficiency arguments to me.

First, storing H2 is incredibly tricky. Even the most water-tight storage containers can leak H2. Secondly, the battery materials problem is largely solved or solvable. LiFePO4 batteries have cut Co out of the equation, increased battery life by tens of thousands of cycles over LiO, and solved the thermal runaway problem. You've got outdated info."
2021-05-28 14:09:06,wallstreetbets,"No man... they might have better efficiency wheel to wheel, but thats only part of the equasion.  How can a city support charging all BEVs.  It'll cause massive power outages.  The electricity needed to charge everything comes at a cost too.  Maybe green power will be enough, but judging from the winter storm this year and how the grid failed.  I have my doubts.   Massive infrastructure will need to be put in place.

Also, there will be major supply issues with sourcing batteries and disposing them.  Unless something revolutionary in the battery tech comes along.  Elon has been promissing that.  He also said he'd have a truck and semi.  So far other auto manufacturers filled that market.  Ford F150, Hyundai Semis.  Some big companies talk of going all electric but its just lip service, there are way too many ICE for the time being.

It's the most important part of the equation. Ignore it at your peril. 

>How can a city support charging all BEVs. It'll cause massive power outages. The electricity needed to charge everything comes at a cost too.

The national grid in the US needs serious upgrades. Perfect time for a ""New Deal"" for the American people, no? Maybe a new deal that aims to be energy efficient and unchained from the uncertainties and waste of the petroleum economy--what do you think?

Besides the obvious benefits of cheap, clean energy by a massive investment in PV, wind, etc., there are vast amounts of good paying jobs that can largely absorb the employment force of the oil/fracking companies and create thousands of private companies as well. 

A lot of people are still holding onto the petroleum model, but we're already past that as the primary energy source. Nobody wants to touch another drop of oil if they don't have to. Is that where you're coming from? Nostalgic for dragsters and muscle cars and the smell of burning fuel? I get that. Really. Been wrenching on bikes mostly, but it relaxes me to take experiment with carburetor jet sizes to get the right burn. 

But the battery tech is undeniable. And it's a decade ahead of H2. Plus, the EVs don't need extensive infrastructure investment compared to H2. The wires are already run, just need the charging stations. Not cheap, but not anywhere near the expense of H2 storage/piping/transport.

Seems we have to agree to disagree, but my money is where my mouth is. Dinosaur tech will produce questionable returns when there's an obviously better tech at price parity."

Today $BB is at 10$, just sell put at 10$ and with what you earn you buy call at the same strike and at the same expiry time, in practice you finance call with put.

This way if $BB stays above 10$ you always gain and you only lose money if $BB falls below 10$."

2021-05-28 17:11:19,wallstreetbets,"So help me understand this, I started learning about options today. The $0.93 is the contract price right, so how much did you actually pay upfront? Is it just $0.93 times 1034? (With a minimum of 100 contracts you have to buy) The strike price is $40 so this means you can buy BB for $40 a piece between now and Jan 20, 2023?

So this yolo basically means you are gambling on the chance that BB will increase by way more than 300% within the timeframe to be able to buy them at $40 which is a discount by then?"

The breakeven is the price the stock needs to be at close the day of expiration. Most people do not hold till expiration. You can sell before that.

2021-05-28 04:39:57,wallstreetbets,Technically yes.  I say Technically because I don't know if commissions (cost paid to beoker for fascinating the trade) is being paid and if it's being factored in the calculations.  If he is paying commission then the True break even price includes entrance and exit commissions which would cause the breakeven price to be slightly higher.  Its great hough that this is not like the good old days of high commissions trades.

The tutorial I watched quickly glanced over this aspect so I'm still unsure. So could you theoretically sell the contracts before June 12 at BB $15 and get a 157% return?

Does that mean you are selling your (now more valuable) contract to someone else who is willing to accept and continue the contract which now has a higher probability of profit?"

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time)."
2021-05-27 20:00:18,wallstreetbets,I’m in!
2021-05-27 20:19:00,wallstreetbets,"You should adjust your price targets for the 8:1 reverse split that will cause some head winds. Although not fundamental it does irrationally put pressure on prices.

Also worth mentioning that the decades of creative accounting have built a legacy of uncertainty. Nobody knows what problems will surface because of that. This was the reason I sold in March because I did not want to be exposed to this risk longer term."
2021-05-27 20:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Wow GE to the moon. I think with Joe Biden all them value/older companies are going to do well under him. F, GM, GE, KO, WBA, etc are all up. Old money going to follow old companies by older people. I'm going to join you on this."
2021-05-27 21:36:36,wallstreetbets,"1996 (yes, a quarter century ago) called and wants its GE stock price back. I had that stock when I was a kid through a few years ago. Finally sold that cuckold of a stock. Good luck to you."
2021-05-27 23:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, I enjoy me some deathbed stocks. But I don’t like that it’s at a nearly 3 year high. Makes me not wanna buy."
2021-05-27 20:21:12,wallstreetbets,"GE stock, I too am currently & have been very optimistic about it for months now.  Jet engines wind turbines and huge healthcare presence, it’s all there!
↗️👍"
2021-05-27 20:46:38,wallstreetbets,"I rolled into a covered call on a small position. I’ll bag my profit and cast a line into a different pool when I’m out

If it doesn’t land right, then I’ll CC. Lower costs then clear the table, order a vodka nest and wait for the next play

Not a wealthy man. Just doing it one step at a time."
2021-05-27 22:28:27,wallstreetbets,Bringing up some good points
2021-05-28 00:19:02,wallstreetbets,I am an engineer and I used to work for 2 different divisions of GE:  Plastics and Water Technologies.  Both were sold off as GE ventured further into the financial side of the business.  That ultimately blew up in their face but they continue to hold some of the strongest industrial businesses.  If infrastructure and the economy grow in favor of lower carbon sources; GE will do very well.  I’m watching it.  I like the stock.
2021-05-28 00:56:24,wallstreetbets,I think it’ll close above 15 as early as tomorrow. Like this DD though I’m in
2021-05-27 20:09:27,wallstreetbets,When you are talking big turbines makes me wonder who is making the turbines used for direct air capture of co2. That’s the trend not hydro. Since we are running out of water. Dams are cool but no water and wind and co2 turbines make more sense.
2021-05-27 20:22:51,wallstreetbets,Why are you buying calls. The whole play is about shares. And you got the ticker wrong. It’s GME.
2021-05-27 20:58:09,wallstreetbets,"GE has been losing money for decades, nice try boomer!"
2021-05-27 21:48:08,wallstreetbets,I bought in at $13.70 before it dropped below $9.00
2021-05-27 22:32:40,wallstreetbets,Fuck GE. I ate nothing but spaghetti for 3 months as a kid when my dad was caught in a round of layoffs at his GE plant. Had been there 2 decades.
2021-05-28 00:30:27,wallstreetbets,Sold my ge to buy more gme
2021-05-28 14:13:30,wallstreetbets,Im in!!! GE to the moon! C’mon apes!
2021-05-27 22:08:56,wallstreetbets,thanks!
2021-05-27 22:11:17,wallstreetbets,"I think that my timing on price targets should be good (split adjusted of course). Those are dates leading up to quarterly releases and I expect that to be the general trend line.

As for the accounting stuff - totally get that. I addressed that a bit and from what I've been able to find the new management team has done a thorough job finding all the skeletons and resolving their outstanding litigation liability. Overall I'm confident that the significant free cash flow (high single digit billions quarterly) that they look to be on track to achieve late next year would allow them to weather most storms while paying down debt"
2021-05-27 22:12:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm quite a bit younger, I was still in elementary school then. I totally understand you may have some bad memories but I'd ask that you read my DD and let me know what you think about it. Am always open to new information and if you know about stuff I don't that makes me change my mind I'd thank you for it."
2021-05-27 23:26:47,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! We are right in the middle of a rally. I think we hit 15, maybe as high as 16.50 before it pulls back after earnings (buy the rumor sell the news). So I def think you can wait for a consolidation but I'm riding this wave."
2021-05-27 23:27:01,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
2021-05-28 09:28:32,wallstreetbets,"thanks! so on my price targets - I'm not saying when I think the stock will cross a threshold, just where it'll be on that day. I expect it to run up (hopefully to 16 or 17) into earnings and then pull back."
2021-05-28 06:13:06,wallstreetbets,"And you guys wonder why mods are strict with GME.

Stop acting like invaders and maybe you'll be treated better."
2021-05-27 22:13:28,wallstreetbets,"I totally understand your perspective and from a historical perspective it is spot on. However, if you read my DD above I think I lay out a pretty solid argument for why we are at an inflection point and the stock has a lot of room to grow over the next few years. I'd appreciate any constructive criticism or counter arguments."
2021-05-27 22:04:01,wallstreetbets,GE has a large renewable division as well.  They are pretty well positioned on that front domestically and internationally.
2021-05-27 22:15:40,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure what you are referring to. I'm not aware of any systems that use turbines to capture CO2 directly from the air (carbon removal). I know there are many companies and academic teams trying to develop something to do that at scale but I'm only aware of solutions that rely on using various chemical processes.
2021-05-27 22:05:27,wallstreetbets,So have GME and AMC but that aint stopping anyone there now is it
2021-05-27 22:16:22,wallstreetbets,I'm a millennial and I'd ask that you review my DD and let me know what you think I got wrong. Thanks!
2021-05-27 22:17:33,wallstreetbets,I've laid out my price targets above. I've been following this story for a while now and been on point since it bounced off the bottom making some money along the way. I'm finally focused on trying to time this thing out and make a big chunk.
2021-05-28 02:51:49,wallstreetbets,"Okay so your DD was actually really good (and amusing, not in a bad way). From a valuation standpoint, you’ve had a good year but does it deserve to be a $126bil company? Tripling in a year and a half is ambitious. I would stay diversified with your options. From a fundamentals standpoint, I grew up hearing from my dad (a classic engineer/CEO) about GE’s business leadership and pedigree, but years of disappointment in their leadership and focus slowly soiled my dad’s lofty opinions of GE in my mind. I always had those same great expectations that my dad had and that you have of what GE could do with energy and aerospace and it’s only been steady over time. Sure there has been and is potential but how mired is it in the remaining legacy businesses and debt. I’ve been hearing the same implicit and explicit promises from GE for literally decades. I don’t think GE is terrible but I do think there are too many other opportunities or companies with better product and personnel leadership. Every dollar invested has an opportunity cost. And I think every dollar invested should be treated as if the invested company has pitched you for that dollar that they’d put it to work better than anyone else. Is GE still cleaning up their dirty diapers or are they grown ups again. I don’t know. If Larry Culp and Elon Musk sat with you for an hour asking you to invest in them and their companies, would you really pick Culp over Musk? Okay, so I’m a Tesla fanboy but I don’t think it’s coincidence that the top employer that engineers want to work at is Tesla. There are other good companies too, it’s not all about Tesla, I’m just wondering if GE is in the upper echelon of companies and opportunities. And will money managers look past GE’s rough recent past? They really want GE in their top 10 holdings list? Sure you can date the hot chick turned hooker that you’ve tamed and cleaned up but at the end of the day do you want to introduce her to your parents? Anyway, your DD was indeed diligent though and I hope your calls pan out. I should also say that I have not stayed current with research or news on GE since I lost interest in them, so be aware I am not current on this, and I can be entirely wrong."
2021-05-27 23:34:03,wallstreetbets,"my counter argument is that tesla is going to be disruptive to the energy sector, but then I discredited myself slightly due to my bias. I feel the energy sector is going to be completely different in the next decade, and I don’t see how GE naturally fits in. This is also a general answer, have not included my research. I’m convinced though, and thats all I really care about!"
2021-05-27 22:25:05,wallstreetbets,It’s just came online within the last year. Google Occidental petroleum and CO2 direct capture. I am not sure who is making the turbines but they are massive.
2021-05-27 22:19:31,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been long only because I’ve been down, but I’m totally long on this stock"
2021-05-28 09:34:27,wallstreetbets,"thanks! I 100% understand your thinking and honestly that is part of what I am banking on, that a lot of people haven't been watching too closely because it has been such a dog for so long. I believe GE has turned the corner and adults are once again in charge. I don't think it is the same company it was before things got bloated and ridiculous but I do think the new GE is lean and positioned REALLY well.

Do I think that if GE was fairly valued it should triple? no not at all. However GE's valuation got SO low that even after doubling (which I was along for the ride on) I expect it to continue going up. Right now it is rising on the turnaround story part and over the next year as they continue to aggressively shed debt AND their FCF grows and they start making real profits each quarter the fundamentals will keep the stock moving higher.

As for diversification this isn't the only thing I'm in, just only showed that part of my portfolio.

And I am a huge Tesla fanboy myself. If you were going to give me one million dollars worth of stock from either Tesla or GE I'd take the tesla stock but right now I'm looking to identify shorter term plays that I can profit on using calls to leverage my buying power. And I am very confident on the timing of this particular story. I could totally see Tesla dropping 50% over the next year only to explode later, or not. Who the heck knows? I did make a good chunk on Tesla's run up pre split."
2021-05-28 00:21:55,wallstreetbets,Well to be fair my bull case only runs through 2023
2021-05-28 10:15:38,wallstreetbets,"Cool, yeah, those are all good points. I just assume everyone on WSB is all in on one company, so I assumed these were all or at least most of your calls/positions. They’re not terribly out of reach, you did the $20 Jan ‘23 calls not the $45 where you think it’ll be, you’re probably totally fine and likely will make money. I’m too personally scarred from GE but you’ve convinced me to invest your money in it 😜, it’s probably a good play. Best of luck with it! There’s probably some government infrastructure impact on it too with the energy side, we know how failed Cali’s infrastructure is and recently Texas’s so yeah, probably more positives than negatives with this play."
2021-05-28 11:48:18,wallstreetbets,yeah totally! and while I fully believe it'll be at $45 plus I'll still make plenty of money if it comes in shy of that :)
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Up 2.5k from 5 calls and 60 shares of AMC with an initial 2k investment. Profits into shares or more calls?

2021-05-28 04:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Hello , newbie here. Does low volume mean a possible downward trend of price?"
2021-05-27 20:02:44,wallstreetbets,Tastyworks
2021-05-28 09:55:16,wallstreetbets,That’s a solid plan.
2021-05-28 07:22:26,wallstreetbets, Not necessarily. But high volume in a meme almost always means buyers driving up the price.
2021-05-28 09:56:07,wallstreetbets,"So I actually did do it. It’s not a lot of cash though, only 5000 ( I’m a relatively poor college student ) so far I’m Down 100 bucks but up 7k on my calls so😂"
2021-05-27 22:41:14,wallstreetbets,That’s probably why it will rise. When the shorts start covering it’ll take off
2021-05-28 07:23:20,wallstreetbets,"So, low volume can mean sideways to downward? Because of lack of action?"
2021-05-28 11:20:35,wallstreetbets,1 share or a million. We are a team!! The fucking A-Team !!!
2021-05-27 22:48:13,wallstreetbets,"The shorts,  the aliens. Its just a shitload of herd mentality and record setting volume. Its not shorted enough for a gamma squeeze."
2021-05-28 07:35:25,wallstreetbets,Generally. But not always.
2021-05-27 22:50:23,wallstreetbets,Not yet
2021-05-28 07:38:38,wallstreetbets,"Okay, thank u!"
2021-05-27 23:07:58,wallstreetbets,Or ever. 20% shorts will lose a shit ton of money. But there won't be a gamma squeeze when 80% of the floats out there. Swing back and forth 700 million times in a day. There no shortage of shares.

Either way I’m sure this latest squeeze fucked many a hedge fund."
2021-05-27 22:33:51,wallstreetbets,Well. I bought about 10ish shares as a joke in January. At like $9. Happy to say this is my first big return. So far I've already gained about $150 from it.

Debit calendar spreads are a magnificent thing

So-I’m not saying that short interest isn’t happening or there aren’t real losses being incurred, but without context the numbers are pretty difficult to really dial in on."

2021-05-27 23:02:27,wallstreetbets,This might be a dumb question but how does the average joe reap on short seller losses? Do their losses push the stock price higher? Would people sell the high? I’m not interested in making $$ on someone else’s diamond hands.
2021-05-27 23:03:57,wallstreetbets,So I have no idea what is going on. I bought a few shares just because I thought it would go up after pandemic. And I don’t want to see my local theater close. Now I see these gains and wondering should I buy more or sell.

2021-05-27 23:25:20,wallstreetbets,"The relentless four-day winning streak in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is drawing even more blood from short sellers.  
  
The movie theater’s 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.  
  
AMC Entertainment shares have more than doubled so far this week  
Retail investors have cheered gains in the cinema chain while hashtags like #AMCSTRONG, #AMC500k, and #OccupyWallstreetAMC trended on Twitter. The stock has consistently been the most referenced asset on the social trading platforms like StockTwits lately. Thursday’s rally cost shorts another $634 million, according to S3 Partners, bringing losses to just below $2 billion for the year.  
  
While some shorts have been covering their positions, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics, he believes the pain could get even worse for skeptics. The company, along with retail investor favorite GameStop Corp., ranks high on S3 Partners’ “Squeeze Score metric” with each scoring a 10 out of 10.  
  
“This signifies that both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,” Dusaniwsky said by email. Roughly 20% of shares available for trading for both companies are currently sold short, S3 Partners data show."

2021-05-28 09:12:29,wallstreetbets,"Genuine question: what do y'all make of AMC's debt and how it will affect the share price? I have 123 shares in AMC that I've been holding through all the ups and downs and I'm *thinking* about selling just enough to cover my investment (particularly if it hits say... $50 bc my situation calls for money rn).

And then I'd hold the rest

I want it to hit 3 or 4 or even 5 figures. It won't hit 4 or 5, I know, but a dumb ape can dream. But I'm not entirely certain what it's realistic ceiling is or how the debt might affect the company."

2021-05-28 09:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Fun story. For like 3 months my average AMC share price was 7.77. I wrecked one day by buying 3 more shares. The 3 shares took me to 7.80. So, when the hedgies crash the AMC stonk down again I will be rooting for 7.76. If that happens, I will buy 3 more shares and see if I can average back to 7.77. It seems like it would work but math isn't my strong suit and I'm just a retarded ape. 
It's fun to hold at $35 amiright?

2021-05-27 21:38:38,wallstreetbets,This short squeeze is not over until we over $100
2021-05-27 23:01:37,wallstreetbets,It would be a better long term play to maintain the price and bleed them with interests costs than try to squeeze more. The problem with squeezing is that more funds will pile on top with higher positions.
2021-05-28 00:01:27,wallstreetbets,Bought 22.5k more at $29. We need a full one day double up (100% gain). Once that happens be ready for take off. We have seen very very modest gains overall still. A full double up in a day especially at current market price will trigger some margin calls and it will go bonkers from there.

2021-05-27 23:40:49,wallstreetbets,"> AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. capped its best trading session in four months, pushed higher by eager retail investors who celebrated vaulting the company’s market value to a record $13 billion on social media.
> 
> Shares soared 36% to $26.52 as 691 million shares changed hands, in the busiest day since January for the Leawood, Kansas-based company. The four-day rally more than doubled its stock price, pushing its year-to-date gains to 1,150%.
> 
> AMC’s revival has been fueled by individual investors eager to save the movie theater industry after it raised more than $1 billion in financing to avoid bankruptcy over recent months.
> 
> Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron has embraced the Reddit-fueled rally and talked to new retail investors on conference calls. The stock has roughly tripled since AMC reported quarterly results on May 6, adding $9 billion in value. Thursday’s milestone stands out against a market value bottom of $216.8 million which was hit in April 2020.
> 
> AMC Entertainment's market value has soared to a record amid retail mania
> While Chad Beynon, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, is waiting for AMC to continue to shed debt and lease obligations before getting more constructive on shares, he acknowledged the mania individual investors can create.
> 
> “The Reddit crowd is strong, the volumes have been off the charts lately, so there’s clearly demand that wasn’t there pre-Covid,” he said by phone. The company’s ability to raise cash at over $10 a share earlier in the month “marked the first time the company was able to financially benefit from the Reddit rally,” he said.
> 
> The cash AMC has raised through the sales of hundreds of millions of additional shares is a key driver for the massive run-up in market value despite the stock actually trading down more than 25% from a 2015 peak. More than 490 million shares of AMC are currently available for trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show, almost ten-times the 52 million shares outstanding at the start of last year.
> 
> Number of AMC Entertainment shares has soared as the theater raised cash
> More Capital
> Debt tied to AMC has rallied alongside shares, setting new highs in recent days. The company’s bonds, which were trading at a low of 5 cents in November, are inching close to par, according to Trace trading data. That debt carries a hefty coupon of 12% for the notes due 2026.
> 
> AMC’s bonds were among the top performers in the U.S. high-yield market on Thursday, extending gains from earlier in the week.
> 
> The company said previously it might seek more financing, and some investors have suggested it sell more shares to pay down or look to refinance its more than $10 billion debt load.
> 
> The cinema chain “will carefully examine the raising of additional capital in whatever form we think is most attractive” and is focused on de-leveraging, Aron said on a call to discuss fourth-quarter results in March.
> 
> AMC's bonds reach record high amid Reddit rally
> The company’s latest resurgence at the hands of individual investors has pushed the market value to more than double its April 2017 peak of $4.17 billion prior to this year’s trading. Put a different way, AMC has consistently added more than $1 billion in each of the last three sessions -- more than double its value at the start of the year.
> 
> Mark-to-market losses for investors betting against the movie theater chain topped $1 billion this week alone, data compiled by S3 Partners shows.
> 
> The movie theater company’s ability to post strong box office numbers as it reopens in key markets like New York and California will be important, B. Riley Securities analyst Eric Wold said by phone. Wold downgraded shares to neutral from buy on Wednesday citing valuation concerns."

2021-05-28 10:03:52,wallstreetbets,"AMC’s Four-Day Surge Slaps Short Sellers With $1.3 Billion Loss
Movie theater has surged 120% this week to a four-year high
Mentions on social media have soared with #AMCSTRONG trending
The relentless four-day winning streak in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is drawing even more blood from short sellers.

The movie theater’s 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.

AMC Entertainment shares have more than doubled so far this week
Retail investors have cheered gains in the cinema chain while hashtags like #AMCSTRONG, #AMC500k, and #OccupyWallstreetAMC trended on Twitter. The stock has consistently been the most referenced asset on the social trading platforms like StockTwits lately. Thursday’s rally cost shorts another $634 million, according to S3 Partners, bringing losses to just below $2 billion for the year.

While some shorts have been covering their positions, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics, he believes the pain could get even worse for skeptics. The company, along with retail investor favorite GameStop Corp., ranks high on S3 Partners’ “Squeeze Score metric” with each scoring a 10 out of 10.

“This signifies that both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,” Dusaniwsky said by email. Roughly 20% of shares available for trading for both companies are currently sold short, S3 Partners data show."

They sell a put, presumably the options market maker buys that put, and then the options market maker sells some naked/synthetic shares into the market to remain neutral as bonafide risk arbitrage.  Eventually that option expires, and the options market maker needs to unwind the arbitrage position to maintain the minimum net capital, as that naked share will count as a liability that is un-resolved.  They don't have to buy immediately, but under the net capital rules, the short positions unresolved after delivery are debited at an increase of 25% of the current market value every 7 business days - this is the premise for the 21 day cycle we are seeing."
2021-05-28 18:08:37,wallstreetbets,"And this also ignores the calls they bought previously in case it rocketed.

Those big OTM sweeps are them covering their ass as they short sell more."
2021-05-27 22:37:38,wallstreetbets,"After the Archegos saga, which bank would be liberal enough to grant such large margins?"
2021-05-27 22:50:07,wallstreetbets,"They can also hedge the worst of the short position by buying high calls.  They can then deliver on the short positions from the calls.  The problem with that is they do further encourage a gamma squeeze by doing so, but its bette than getting hammered with a naked short position."
2021-05-27 23:55:46,wallstreetbets,"There's no way they have the buying power/margin for that.

To offset these kinds of losses they would have to sell an insane amount of contracts, what you collect per contract is way less than the margin required."
2021-05-28 00:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but wouldn’t that pour more fuel on this dumpster fire? Ofc selling naked puts, brokers would have to hedge their risk by buying the underlying stock."
2021-05-28 00:16:51,wallstreetbets,If I had to guess they probably want to trigger a big sell off before making a move like that
2021-05-28 00:45:08,wallstreetbets,"1. They probably are

2. You need a lot of cash on hand in case the put goes belly up for you, so the broker knows you can cover. So if they're not doing this, they don't have the cash on hand because it's all tied up in other assets"
2021-05-28 00:48:58,wallstreetbets,Delete this ..no helping them.
2021-05-28 08:13:18,wallstreetbets,"I think they bought long, drove the price up on purpose, made a shitload of cash, then they sell, and cover their shorts."
2021-05-28 02:22:46,wallstreetbets,You know there is nothing stopping them from doing this.  Again.  They got in zero trouble for doing it before.

2021-05-28 00:59:08,wallstreetbets,I got stock in AMC awhile back because I knew that movie theaters would reopen and they would make money. I think it's silly to believe otherwise.
2021-05-28 00:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Wait for dip, I bet you can buy under $25"
2021-05-28 00:31:18,wallstreetbets,Eh. My opinion is that AMC is overpriced at this point. No doubt in the long run it'll settle around 15 but short run looks like it might hit 35. You are likely to lose big as this price was inflated by retailers and once they lose interest the stick will drop like before when it peaked at 17. Only put in what you're willing to lose and not your months rent and you should be fine. Not financial advice. Am not smart in stocks.
2021-05-28 08:14:54,wallstreetbets,It hit 33 overnight in euro trading. It's just consolidating before open. I fully expect now to hit 33 by next week. Not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor.
2021-05-28 01:33:59,wallstreetbets,Don't lol you already missed it.
2021-05-28 05:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Buying in now is pure FOMO imo. Unless you're gambling on a quick flip, wait for the price to come back down in the next week or so and buy in before the next run up"

2021-05-28 02:59:13,wallstreetbets,"Nowhere near the peak my friend, however there will most likely be a huge dip at $50 to try and con us into thinking the squeeze is over, this won’t be the case because apes are too diamond handed...

It’s up to you what you do with your money and there is a small chance the price shoots from where it is now up to 50-60 today. If you do invest don’t paper hand... Whether you wait for the stock to be forced into a big dip and invest or invest now, you’ll make big tendies and you’ll be one of us 🦍🚀🚀🍗🍗🙌💎🙌

2021-05-27 23:17:40,wallstreetbets,Shorts haven't begun to cover. This is bullish momentum and a gamma squeeze so far.

2021-05-28 00:36:50,wallstreetbets,Buy GME.

2021-05-27 23:12:51,wallstreetbets,"Before the pandemic, cinemark was priced at around 45. The highest AMC has been in the last 5 years was $35. 

I'm holding out for higher prices, but what do I know? I eat my French onion dip with paint chips."
2021-05-27 23:08:19,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I think we're 50/50 on it going to $100. Gamma squeeze can do that alone (I think it's partly responsible for what we've seen so far).  
12.5 % chance that it goes to GME January heights or better on the back of a squeeze. Short squeeze has not started yet.  


Would not be surprised if we consolidate and dip tomorrow, but would be shocked if this was the eventual peak."
2021-05-27 23:44:44,wallstreetbets,I am buying more

2021-05-27 21:48:10,wallstreetbets,I sold at $19. Felt like an idiot today (though I did make a small bit of profit).
2021-05-27 21:59:42,wallstreetbets,"It won't do a GME. It's not shorted nearly enough and was pretty fucked before covid just like gme except they really can't pivot their business model like gme is trying to do. Amc is a company that has an absolutely insane amount of upkeep to essentially sell popcorn on weekends. Ironically of course the fundamental business has almost nothing to do with the short-term stock movements. I had some calls that I sold yesterday for profit but that was just a meme movement play. As for how high it goes, depends on how long the high rollers want to play chicken. I wouldn't hold it much further up personally but I also wouldn't be surprised to see it keep mooning short term. Take your preference of risk tolerance."
2021-05-28 01:40:16,wallstreetbets,Ask that when we get to GME numbers.
2021-05-28 00:59:57,wallstreetbets,They still shorting because once the pull the plug and admit defeat they’ll have to explain to their board members how they fucked their annual 15% ROI

2021-05-28 08:41:20,wallstreetbets,"Margin Maintenance Requirements

This is Schwab’s minimum equity requirement to maintain a stock position in accounts that have and use the margin feature.

     AMC

     AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc

     Margin Maintenance Requirement

     Special Maintenance: 150%

If you have a special maintenance requirement on your account that is greater than the equity-specific requirement, then the account level maintenance requirement will supersede the equity-specific requirement.

Margin requirements are subject to change at any time. You must meet initial deposit requirements on all trades.

Stocks trading for less than $3.00 are not marginable.

Typically, the ongoing maintenance requirement for most stocks is 30%, but it can be much higher for volatile or lower-priced securities.

Special maintenance requirements are set at Schwab's discretion and are intended to reflect a stock's volatility and to ensure that your account maintains sufficient equity to cover large price movements. Some stocks are so volatile or illiquid that they cannot be margined.

Margin requirements may be changed due to concentrated positions, non-diversification, changes in market conditions or at Schwab's discretion.

This value is not applicable for portfolio margin accounts, which utilize a different set of calculations."

2021-05-28 03:42:20,wallstreetbets,Porn is illegal in Singapore- even a Maxim will get you lashes. There is a legal red light district though if you are okay with STDs that will make castration look like the east way out.
2021-05-27 22:25:38,wallstreetbets,Shanghai too lol
2021-05-28 02:44:56,wallstreetbets,Didn't the Chinese owners sell a huge chunk of their shares in AMC a while ago?
2021-05-27 22:30:45,wallstreetbets,Is that good??
2021-05-27 23:39:17,wallstreetbets,"I sold one of those today. Couldn't believe I'd bought it in the first place, I don't remember buying it. Made cash money, took profit.  FOMO'ing back in, of course.  day tarding fun"

2021-05-27 23:06:08,wallstreetbets,"You mean the same news that says GME is down 50% from its all-time high, despite being up like 6,000% from a year ago? Or that AMC is ""only"" up 500% from that same mark yet they're conveniently shining the spotlight on it? Hm I wonder why that is.

You're implying the news is actually useful."
2021-05-27 22:58:43,wallstreetbets,"Until they fail the margin call. You can get margin called and live. Basically their broker or bank says get more money in your account or we will liquidate your shit and close out your positions because we ain't holding that bag, ~~son~~ boy from Bulgaria.

They got margin called in January by the DTC and halted buying for retail."

They aren't getting fucked until they fail their margin call. These are paper losses for the paper hands who sell."

2021-05-28 00:26:49,wallstreetbets,"And the time it takes to report. Oh, don't forget about the self regulatory organization know as FINRA.

That's like a cop who is accused of a crime and gets investigated by his department and finds no wrong doing. (There are good cops, don't get me wrong. But historically speaking internal oversight shouldn't be the standard operating procedure. Should be like car insurance. Should be external audits and recommendations.)

Lastly, punitive damages with jail time. If I commit fraud and make hundreds of thousands, I'm going to jail and getting someone's banana in my crack. But when a financial institution does it and makes billions and pays settlement with millions, that's baked into their cost of business.

Here's that number put into perspective. 1 million seconds 11.5 days. 1 billion seconds 31.7 years. 

I'm no math person. But I know when I'm getting fucked. Those numbers are insane and laws should be revised or enforced to ensure maximum penalties to deter these behaviors."

2021-05-27 20:48:40,wallstreetbets,At least mvis went up.
2021-05-27 21:04:29,wallstreetbets,MVIS will do you good.  Having both is fucking great!

2021-05-27 22:10:00,wallstreetbets,Wouldve been a good play is you bought at 12 and sold at 20ish then reinvested
2021-05-27 23:14:32,wallstreetbets,I bought half AMC half MVIS so I guess I'm semi retarded
2021-05-27 22:46:30,wallstreetbets,Just remember that the most successful trading accounts reported by Fidelity are the ones that's been forgotten about. Basically HOLD!!!! If you must buy something else do so without selling your other positions.
2021-05-27 21:50:16,wallstreetbets,I hold both 50/50
2021-05-27 22:48:39,wallstreetbets,I hold both
2021-05-28 01:35:09,wallstreetbets,I didn't even realize but there's people that have been holding MVIS for over a decade before I bought in. Feels like I reserved a spot at the retirement center bingo night
2021-05-28 02:38:38,wallstreetbets,Got fucked on the MVIS train too. Bought some contracts and was up 1500$ in an hour and I let it ride through the weekend and Monday opened worthless.
2021-05-27 22:26:04,wallstreetbets,Still haven’t found that sell button
2021-05-27 22:00:37,wallstreetbets,😬
2021-05-27 22:15:45,wallstreetbets,Sold AMC 14 and 15 calls on Tuesday ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-27 22:25:45,wallstreetbets,I had a whopping 5 stocks in AMC so feeling mixed feelings. Wish I'd had more money to invest at the time but still made double buying in at 10 bucks so there's that.
2021-05-27 23:07:51,wallstreetbets,"I had an amc put (just one, left over RH money). For once I’m happy I’m wrong. Hope these fuckers become millionaires and join us over at GME to roll it into a billion."
2021-05-27 23:09:21,wallstreetbets,"You and me both, but I was able to get back into AMC at a lower basis than I had originally. I took a bath, but this recent surge has covered it."
2021-05-27 23:31:48,wallstreetbets,I sold at $14 2 weeks ago. FML.
2021-05-27 23:47:30,wallstreetbets,So buy now ya fucking ape.
2021-05-27 23:55:58,wallstreetbets,Switch it back ;)
2021-05-28 00:23:27,wallstreetbets,i bought AMC @ 10 and sold all of it for 19.85 on 26/May.. you can imagine my feeling now. Fuck myself for being paper hand. dont be a sad ape like me!!
2021-05-28 00:47:06,wallstreetbets,Lmao people upvoting ya so that others can watch and learn

2021-05-28 04:56:45,wallstreetbets,"i bought it at 13,50 in january and sold it 2 weeks ago at 11,50 because i thought there was no hope. it was only 10 shares so i lost 20€, but seeing it now pisses me off, too"
2021-05-28 09:25:25,wallstreetbets,$14.25 for me. I already counted it as a loss so I’m holding forever.
2021-05-28 07:04:06,wallstreetbets,Well done ape

2021-05-28 11:52:22,wallstreetbets,I was watching it when it had gone down after the first big drop when it started getting under $10 and was going to buy in but then forgot and didn't start looking at it again until it had gotten over $14 again.
2021-05-28 07:04:50,wallstreetbets,Tried to buy more after hours but wealth simple restricted trading.

2021-05-28 07:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Why do you care what people do with their money, and who owns what companies?

And if karma is coming, it’s been a long time coming and all going against the ultra rich hedge funds. They decided to short businesses to try to take massive profits off of a company going bankrupt, causing thousands of people their jobs.

2021-05-28 02:24:26,wallstreetbets,This means i could sell today and buy monday again? Maybe even more?
2021-05-28 02:27:04,wallstreetbets,"So their unrealized losses are so large that accepting failure guarantees financial ruin?

2021-05-28 10:44:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean both GME (and probably AMC) prices are obviously not anywhere close to its (much lower) fundamental value. Eventually it *will* go back down, it's just a matter of timing it right."
2021-05-28 02:37:51,wallstreetbets,"I have to imagine some funds are already at implosion levels of unrealized losses, so their only hand to play is to keep going and hope apes paper hand."
2021-05-27 21:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Curious what makes you put that timeframe to it? I think we are going to see a correction of some extent like we did earlier this year, but why <7 days?"
2021-05-27 23:11:13,wallstreetbets,What are you willing to bet?
2021-05-28 00:08:57,wallstreetbets,"They can downvote all they want. You’re right, you think Wall Street is going to fall for this twice .... we are about to see a reversal"
2021-05-27 21:58:29,wallstreetbets,"Plus who doesn't miss going to the movies?  I've been inside gaming for a year, let's go to the show!"
2021-05-27 22:11:50,wallstreetbets,Loook you are not wrong but I think it has more to do with the price of the stock than the value of it.
2021-05-28 07:31:05,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, no"
2021-05-28 08:41:50,wallstreetbets,Lol bunch gme haters couldn't stand their show pony being talked about that way lmao!

2021-05-27 22:33:12,wallstreetbets,It will happen after it does. You can tell by the way it is.
2021-05-27 22:47:56,wallstreetbets,I dunno if you should be downvoted. The squeeze will be over only after the shorts have covered. Even after today those cocky fucks shorted MORE. The short interest went up on AMC today. Buy what you can and hold when you can’t.  There’s no date and there’s no price limit. Escape that idea.
2021-05-27 22:49:13,wallstreetbets,If you’re looking to learn I suggest watching Matt kohrs. Live everyday that the markets open and teaches newbies what’s going on using real data and the lingo and explains it a newbie friendly way. He made 169k on amc today.
2021-05-27 23:09:57,wallstreetbets,🦍
2021-05-27 23:04:57,wallstreetbets,Another guy had the idea of using the premium from selling the puts to buy calls and more or less freeze their losses in position to ride it out.
2021-05-28 01:10:50,wallstreetbets,"I put 150 in (10.7 shares) the end of January, cause I was like, people are gonna go back to the movies eventually right? But this is really just super fun. Long term betting, but, at least, educated (kinda betting). I wish I knew more!"
2021-05-27 22:26:04,wallstreetbets,"And my guess is even if they did sell puts, their losses far outweigh their gains from selling puts."
2021-05-27 23:15:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah no, it’s plenty liquid.

Hell the volume was 700m today ...

The number of shares outstanding is 500m"

2021-05-27 22:56:21,wallstreetbets,"Well none of us work for a HF (that are willing to share info) so we can’t possibly know for sure. 

IMO it’s hubris. They think they can just wait us out of shake us off. 

My other theory is they are so beyond fucked that if they tried to close they know it would quickly get out of control and bankrupt them. So they are purposefully making the problem bigger so someone bigger and more important downstream from them goes bust too and gets bailed out by the government. They try to get some of that money through whatever bullshit means."
2021-05-27 23:03:11,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, sell puts, buy calls, to essentially freeze their losses and avoid being forced to buy to cover."
2021-05-28 03:08:54,wallstreetbets,I think they were even praised for it lol. They got free publicity.
2021-05-28 01:21:27,wallstreetbets,are you me? I also grabbed 6 at $10 back in march.
2021-05-27 22:28:26,wallstreetbets,"40 @ $12, holding forever"
2021-05-28 01:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Hey, it has to start somewhere. :D

Not every 'stick' has to have dozens of zeros behind it. :D

Should this, or GME, go up the way many believe it might, then there's some decent $ to make, and if it doesn't... lunch money is easy to spend, easy to recoup and easy to let go :)"
2021-05-28 02:53:17,wallstreetbets,"Big hits are awesome. But death by a thousand cuts still works, too. For every ape buying 1000 are thousands of small timers buying 3-50. That’s nothing to turn your nose to."
2021-05-28 01:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Finally, i found my people! 2 baby shares of GME and 10 of AMC. It ain't much but it's honest work."
2021-05-28 02:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah massive dip coming at £50 I reckon, they’ll try and lead us into thinking the squeeze is over, but even smooth brain ape knows this isn’t the case."
2021-05-28 08:41:41,wallstreetbets,"No way it goes that high... right?

$100 peak? If we're lucky?

I have 250 shares. I'm scared to get my hopes up lol"
2021-05-28 05:23:05,wallstreetbets,How do you know the shorts haven't begun to cover?
2021-05-28 00:43:06,wallstreetbets,I'm poor.

2021-05-27 23:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Didn't AMC issue a shit ton of shares, so $35 now is huge compared to $35 then, as in, not realistic in the long term?

Idk if its up because of the squeeze or the FOMO, or both."
2021-05-27 23:36:59,wallstreetbets,lol a/s/l?
2021-05-27 23:40:28,wallstreetbets,"That's very interesting, what makes you think AMC will be worth 27.5 billion dollars?"

AMC is 1000% shorted! To the moon."
2021-05-27 21:53:40,wallstreetbets,What's an exit strategy?
2021-05-27 22:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Ohbwow, i was thinking at 500 id sell 1 share to cover all I bought  at $9.90 and then ride the rest. 

19 bucks was your bailout point?  Huh."
2021-05-27 22:37:49,wallstreetbets,it’s may not be shorted as much but it as potentially over a BILLION synthetics that all need to be covered
2021-05-27 23:12:32,wallstreetbets,"1. GME's squeeze in January had nothing to do with their restructuring or pivot.
2. GME's January short interest is a unicorn. It'll never happen again. Not even with GME.
3. That being said, AMC's short positions are much greater now than back in January, it's a higher platform, and from the data, shorts have not begun to cover (probably will see some covering in the next 2 days).

It doesn't take January GME #'s to short squeeze."
2021-05-27 22:13:03,wallstreetbets,Gme business model is hopelessly fucked. We’re just riding hype dog. This shit is worthless but I’m buying it anyways.

2021-05-27 23:38:24,wallstreetbets,That’s cheaper than the loss if they can somehow make it crash or wait until it dips etc. that’s why there’s all the misinformation threads about selling gme to buy amc.
2021-05-28 04:52:49,wallstreetbets,"it's a laughably low interest rate, I don't know what it is for AMC, but for GME it's 1 or 1,1% of the share price."
2021-05-28 04:58:53,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure they dont, the brokers arent going to wreck them when they need to pay the bill afterwards themselves...."
2021-05-28 05:15:12,wallstreetbets,They’d have to lodge more collateral - so yes more interest.
2021-05-28 08:19:43,wallstreetbets,The interest rate is 6.5%….per year
2021-05-28 09:01:25,wallstreetbets,Interest based on demand not on price of asset

2021-05-27 23:01:29,wallstreetbets,from what i understand a sweep isn't biding on a price your taking everything available at current price. from what i can tell that's typically a large institution.

2021-05-27 23:05:42,wallstreetbets,"DTCC said in the recent congressional probe that they lifted the margin requirements for RH and RH stopped buying on their own. 

And if they survive the margin call, which really we only find out after it’s resolved anyways, the show continues too. They wanted to illegally kill these companies so I’m not done until they are the ones who are killed but legally and because of their own miscalculation."
2021-05-27 22:55:32,wallstreetbets,It's not entirely 2 ways. Being long is limited loss and has a dead end. The road of losses from short selling is a circle.

2021-05-28 00:32:38,wallstreetbets,"What you are witnessing is perfect gambler's territory now. Just like when game stop re-squeezed to three twenties with bulls profiting on the way up, experienced short sellers 
 identify ideal place to short, and go in for the short at the highest yield time. No matter. Bulls will come back on for the re-run to the top. And so on the cycle continues. As long as there is more buying than selling... This reducing the current shares outstanding available to public market and making them more valuable, then yes, whatever short selling comes along will merely be a divit. My guess, as soon as people stop seeing it as the ideal casino, more selling will take place."

2021-05-28 01:04:46,wallstreetbets,"I always look at it from my actual gain sale. Even if it goes up after I sell I don't feel bad. 

You just have to tell yourself ""I won't sell until I profit $(x amount)"" and stick to it. If you are serious about your investment and keep informed on the company you shouldn't feel bad if you miss out on that last uptick before you sell if you're not investing long term."

2021-05-27 23:44:09,wallstreetbets,I’m super looking forward to the MVIS squeeze. Will be epic. 34 million shares shorted . Percentage wise higher than AMC .
2021-05-27 23:01:22,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I sold most of my stocks to get into AMC over the past few months, but still have PLTR, MVIS, and 1 GME stock too.

It may not dip, or just barely dip (i could very well be wrong about a significant sell off). You could miss the dip, or possibly miss out on a huge run up.

2021-05-28 10:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Because the call you are selling also has an absurd price. This offsets most of the price of the call you buy.

The prices aren't as good as they used to be but still really good.

For example, 255/260 spreads for next week run about $1.50. For something as volatile as GME you'd expect the odds of it expiring past that to be closer to 50%. Yet it's priced at about 30% chance instead."
2021-05-28 10:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Right, but considering it's been MONTHS now of this state, pricing the % chance of it dropping back down at like 10% per week seems horribly incorrect.(this is pretty much what the options pricing implies, at least on napkin math)"

If the strikes vary then you can collar your gain/loss. BUT, you either come out of pocket for more premium, take risk of further share price appreciation or give up the benefit of your short.

Realistically? No.   
And I say that as someone with 90% of my positions in AMC (mostly because I don't know where to find the sell button for that stock). The 100k figure is mostly a meme, but also to show investors what is technically possible. When you believe that 100k can happen, even if there is a .00001% chance, then it's a lot easier to believe in 1k and be diamond-handed."

2021-05-27 22:40:18,wallstreetbets,Very possible. I'm no gme zealot. I only own a few shares of gme that I bought purely for comedic/entertainment value. Just pointing out why I think amc is even worse and is risky to chase right now.

2021-05-27 23:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they waived the requirements but each broker had discretion. RH and other brokers have a legal out so don't expect much. How they handled their internal risk was initiated by the DTC increasing collateral requirements.

The DTC is in cahoots with these guys. They've been accused of allowing naked shorting for a very long time. They only acted in self preservation. If the brokers go tits up, their banks, clearing house, and lastly the DTC are on the hook.

It wouldn't surprise me if decades down the line, we get the truth that some billionaire called in a favor at the DTC to orchestrate the halting of retail buying pressure.

It's unprecedented that buying stocks with cash were halted for retail. While we were locked out, HFs got to reposition and or make profits.

Separately, these crooks dropped the stock price by 77% with 8 million volume. There is material damage done to retail.

We got fucked in the ass without dinner or lube.

Also, lots of people got margin called or lost $ from stop losses."

2021-05-28 08:15:06,wallstreetbets,"Why are you such a curmudgeon?

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/maintain-short-position-delisted-stock/
A company doesn’t go bankrupt JUST because of short selling, but short sellers(large firms not everyday retail) have a damn good reason to make shareholders continue to sell off, ultimately hurting the company via stock price. Then the short sellers have no shares to buy back. Free money basically. 
As seen with GME and AMC, shareholders investing in a company can bring them out of debt and completely turn a business around. Now the massive firms betting on their demise have become opposite bag holders and want this stock to fail. 

How’s that for a brain dead take?

Regulations are being put into place as we speak by officials. You think I, a nobody, have any say in a financial system that has been taking advantage of stocks for decades? Firms have been fined millions of dollars and it’s nothing compared to the billions they make. 
And I am doing what I can by holding these stocks and helping my new found friends fight back. 

I’d say anyone taking the time to discuss their opinion on an open forum cares enough to be heard. I’m listening, and I’d love to hear a real reason as to why you oppose this. If millions of people lose money, what’s it to you? People, collectively, lost more than that last year."
2021-05-28 03:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Stop crying, bought my first at 17,80 and bought more and was able to avg down to 9,54 with 108 Shares. Not one share sold till now."

2021-05-28 10:44:03,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what will happen.  They get our money one way or another so just keep rushing and repeating apes.  We will get it back.  It’s the circle of retardation.

Too bad I can't go wild on these spreads due to not enough buying power"
2021-05-28 10:49:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm not arguing against that. For all I know it could take many months or years until people get bored and start exiting."

2021-05-28 03:13:41,wallstreetbets,Nah. Most people were playing options or long equity prior to all this. Literally nobody was talking about opening short positions. Even folks doing options strats weren't selling naked calls.
2021-05-27 23:57:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes,however, they weren't using illegal loopholes and tactics and smear campaigns."
2021-05-28 00:07:46,wallstreetbets,Very few people here have an broker that would allow them to open naked short positions. Most can only buy some puts or sell call credit spreads if they want to inverse a particular stock.
2021-05-28 02:45:32,wallstreetbets,Ah you still have faith in the system.
2021-05-28 02:25:25,wallstreetbets,Little bit of exaggerating. Maybe. We don’t know cuz the system is so completely rigged. The truth will come out eventually though. If I’m rigjt the magnitude that hedge funds went to will be close to if not market crashing and they’ll have to cover.... what is that stock again... oh GME. Yeah that. Everything will tank and GME will sore. Do your own DD though.
2021-05-27 22:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Just my opinion of course. This is not financial advice.


I believe this isn’t the shorts covering. I believe this is more of a gamma squeeze rather than an actual short squeeze."
2021-05-27 23:50:01,wallstreetbets,"Because no shorts covered their position, short interest is actually higher on the day so they just shorted it more. All this price action is pure FOMO and sentiment."
2021-05-28 00:45:27,wallstreetbets,Because the people invested in it are literal apes. They might lose all their money than sell it. This is what heavy retail investment does IMO.

Speculative, but these PFOF brokers sell your data with their overlords.  It's a possibility they know where retail stop losses are and can hypothetically short the shit out of a stock when buying pressure is completely turned off and those stopped losses are activated.  Losing $.

There are many lawsuits coming out.  However, I wouldn't expect anything from them.  The DTCC gave brokers a legal out when they increased collateral requirements.  Even though we were told they were waived months later.  The brokers had to evaluate their risk and acted accordingly.  They had full discretion.  

In short, they would have failed their margin-call, gone ding dong down, so in order to protect their business, they restricted/limited buying on certain securities.  They'll spin it like this.  In order to protect their customers (not retail, but institutions), they had to limit buy on certain stocks because of volatility."

2021-05-28 02:14:29,wallstreetbets,What’s a gamma squeeze?
2021-05-28 01:27:17,wallstreetbets,They actually borrowed another 5 million shares against amc just today. The trend we've seen the last few days seems to be continuing even into AH. If the price went all the way up to almost tap $30 then I'm sure most people will see the current price as a sale. After the morning paper hand people will see other people buying still and jump back in. As long as apes protect the high then the fomos and day traders will continue to hop on board imo.
2021-05-27 23:07:19,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, we saw the same thing last time, this is just a gamma squeeze"
2021-05-28 11:11:22,wallstreetbets,Wanda doesn’t own amc anymore dumbass
2021-05-28 11:58:46,wallstreetbets,You are the man
2021-05-28 05:56:18,wallstreetbets,What brokerage app do you use? The trailing stop percentage is an option to sell in that tab. You might have to click on advanced or a drop down if you're only getting prompted to sell all shares at market price.
2021-05-28 06:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Ok, say you bought 10 stocks at $10. Now that stock is $20 but is volatile. You're sitting on your $100 profit and don't mind letting it ride for a little while to see where things go.

To protect a chunk of those gains, you can set various parameters. The easiest one to understand that will protect the most gain is the trailing stop loss. What is does is set a limit you are willing to lose until, but the trailing part is important. It keeps increasing as the stock goes up. 

If you set it to 20% (there is an option for dollar amounts but I find it easier to pick a percentage) it won't just sit at a 20% loss at $20 if it goes up to $30. Your limit will now automatically move to a 20% loss of $30, capturing all the gains you made up to that point. That's why it's a trailing number, since it follows the stock up.

Now if it shits the bed and goes down to $8, your 20% limit let you get out at $16, protecting some of your gains. 

The biggest choice you have to make is what profit you're comfortable losing, and what you stop loss is set at. Too high, like 10% on a fluctuating stock, and you screw yourself out of gains if it just touches it and rebounds up 12% unless you are on top of it. I don't have time to watch my investments all day, so I set alerts and orders.

I know diamond hands are coveted around here, but there are a lot of bag holders who buy stocks high and then ride them all the way to the ground with zero protection."
2021-05-27 22:47:32,wallstreetbets,Weird. That's how long I've been on Imgur. Maybe I did set this up at the same time and don't remember. I just used my Google account to login today and it asked me a bunch of questions about what I liked and wanted to follow. I assumed it was brand new account today.
2021-05-27 22:16:52,wallstreetbets,Short interest is self reported to a self regulated party. It is rarely reported honestly.
2021-05-27 22:16:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't know or really care to look. The data will be weeks old so not totally reliable, and the stock market is heavily skewed in favor of the market maker and big money investors.

To be honest I had almost forgotten I even held AMC in my portfolio until Yahoo told me it reached my target price yesterday. It's only up 110% beyond my initial investment which is kind of pathetic when compared to the magic internet money everyone around here seems so afraid of.

It is worth noting the Volkswagen short squeeze in 2008 occurred with only 12% of the float shorted, however."

2021-05-27 22:55:04,wallstreetbets,Is it possible they have just been covering part of their shorts and will stop to let the price fall and then buy again? There was a pretty solid upward curve for a good part of the day.
2021-05-27 23:39:51,wallstreetbets,"Keep going, I'm almost there"
2021-05-28 08:07:54,wallstreetbets,They are absolutely getting margin called everyday on this. There’s no way a clearing house is letting this ride to see what happens. If they have negative liquidating value they better have it covered by next morning or they’ll get cleaned out.
2021-05-28 11:08:53,wallstreetbets,"That isn't how margin calls work.  I could have 100B AUM and get margin called on a 10M position.  Margin calls are about liquidity, what made it obvious a margin call was going on with GME was that the stock was booming as the overall market was falling.  Institutions were liquidating other positions for liquidty, further driving selling by automatic trigger points.  This brings the market down as a whole.   Which is why stop losses on anything are a risky bet if a short squeeze is going on.  You can get stopped out of a position becuase institutions need liquidity."

2021-05-27 22:47:32,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, but if the short interest starts to fall sharply there's a good likelihood that its because someone got margin called."
2021-05-27 22:49:04,wallstreetbets,It probably won’t be public knowledge until way after they’ve been margin called. Similar to the Archegos situation.

2021-05-28 04:00:17,wallstreetbets,Brokerage link is a hell of a drug.
2021-05-28 04:23:40,wallstreetbets," Be my sensei, so I too can have 401k in 4 years when in turn 26."
2021-05-28 05:33:01,wallstreetbets,This is riskspreading at its finest!

2021-05-28 06:50:56,wallstreetbets,That looks like a 401k of someone retiring at 27!
2021-05-28 08:06:43,wallstreetbets,That's what up
2021-05-28 08:19:00,wallstreetbets,Wish I could invest in stocks with my 401k. Could be a lot wealthier by now and probably retired!

2021-05-28 09:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Whatever you can afford.  I’m thrilled to see young people thinking about their retirement. When I was in my 20s, anytime I mentioned saving for retirement, the older guys just told me to not worry about retirement, just work.  That’s what I did and didn’t start saving for retirement until my early 40s.  It’s a heck of a lot easier if you start young."
2021-05-28 10:12:52,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 11:04:21,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap, this is almost identical to my 401k"

2021-05-27 23:49:01,wallstreetbets,"AMC moved 300% in 4 days, remarkably this isn’t the norm...still think the Fed’s are going to crack down on “influencers”, this freedom of speech will get regulated at some point soon, so be careful."
2021-05-27 23:56:54,wallstreetbets,0% fucks given
2021-05-28 00:15:06,wallstreetbets,Need to add a bit more AMC for tmrw :)

2021-05-28 06:47:24,wallstreetbets,Dangerously under exposed to SPCE
2021-05-28 10:14:46,wallstreetbets,I commend you young lad. I had that much around your age but lost it all on margin. Remember October 1987? Of course you don’t. Please don’t make the same mistake.
2021-05-27 20:45:32,wallstreetbets,I need to find out where he suck dicks to make so much money so fast.
2021-05-27 20:54:14,wallstreetbets,The key is to have the government lock you into your home and all your coworkers quit so literally all you can do is work overtime everyday and never see or feel the presence of another human being outside of a job you hate.
2021-05-28 04:43:22,wallstreetbets,It’s ok he might only have half this by next week with such amazing diversification here ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
2021-05-28 01:41:20,wallstreetbets,"I just turned 34 and haven't had money until this year so yea, this tracks."
2021-05-28 17:31:48,wallstreetbets,All you had to do was invest in GME when you were in your 20s. Probably
2021-05-28 10:18:36,wallstreetbets,"Wealthy parents, if your parents have money you most likely not only have access to that money but you are also not going into debt trying to do things like buying a car or going to college."
2021-05-27 22:41:12,wallstreetbets,Why are you impressed people got money from their parents?
2021-05-28 07:34:39,wallstreetbets,Living at home with your nice parents helps save a lot of money
2021-05-28 12:55:04,wallstreetbets,"How much did you have in a 401k? I'm early 30's, and this guy has way more than me. I must be really late to the party..why am i poor."
2021-05-28 16:52:22,wallstreetbets,"I’m 22 with about 30k, I still feel broke asf and super far behind.."
2021-05-28 17:15:35,wallstreetbets,"I work construction, electrical to be exact and the PW jobs I’ve been on for 3 years put 4K a month into my 401k, it’s all in the S&P500 but I’ve accumulated like 150k over 3 short years"
2021-05-28 00:07:53,wallstreetbets,AMC. Got to diversify. Am I right.
2021-05-27 22:27:45,wallstreetbets,What do you mean maxed 250k? Like is there some age cap on 401k balance I need to be aware of?!
2021-05-27 22:31:23,wallstreetbets,"If your 401k has brokeragelink available, you still need to sign up for it.

I think I was able to do it over the phone quickly. I can get up to level 2 options trading in mine"
2021-05-28 02:53:57,wallstreetbets,"It's company dependent.  Some companies have different rules.

Source: former Fid employee"
2021-05-28 03:05:50,wallstreetbets,It’s so you can’t gamble your money away and lose it all; wtf would you want to risk your 401k money for?
2021-05-27 21:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Oof, sorry man.  I reduced my IRA contributions once I realized I was outperforming it in my brokerage account by enough of a margin to actually make money by paying the taxes."
2021-05-28 10:23:20,wallstreetbets,"The goal for 401k is long term gains, safe retirement. You should have *some* flexibility with the funds, but generally they are all blended assets which are stable and safe, and I don't know anything, but I'd recommend target funds (they're structured based on 5 year increments for your target retirement date). 

First you should absolutely hit the annual $19.5k pre tax. And second the Roth IRA (or traditional converted depending on income) max of $6k (which you can put into your own Fidelity account and play with stocks and options if you so choose). Thirdly, invest post-tax money into your 401k. This isn't available at every job. The max per year is $57k."
2021-05-28 01:05:14,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice, and is fact, terrible advice. 

What --> I <-- would do personally is cash out the 401, take the tax hit, drop the money in the biggest turnaround company of all time. 

If Gamestop doubles at any time from here til your retirement, you will have covered your taxes and then some. 

Maybe even and then some and then some and then some more.

Can you take out a loan against it?"
2021-05-27 20:09:14,wallstreetbets,But 401 kilos is probably obese
2021-05-28 17:51:33,wallstreetbets,What would you think of a 26 year old with 200k in his 401k?
2021-05-28 17:53:44,wallstreetbets,What would you think of a 26 year old with 200k in his 401k?
2021-05-27 20:14:13,wallstreetbets,Have good paying job and allocating lot of paycheck towards 401k and probably reduced spending on other things. The crash & exponential recovery last year probably also helped. And finally MEMES
2021-05-28 15:21:13,wallstreetbets,I have 90k in my 401k and I’m 25. I’ve been maxing my yearly contributions since getting a good job 4yr ago
2021-05-28 09:21:58,wallstreetbets,Most engineering jobs.. 60k a year with 5% 401k allocation would put you at about 40-50k in 2-3 years. Assuming some company match.
2021-05-28 09:59:29,wallstreetbets,"Buy $1000 worth of DOGE 2 years ago, cash that out and live on that while maxing 401k contributions."
2021-05-28 17:51:17,wallstreetbets,What would you think of a 26 year old with 200k in his 401k?
2021-05-27 21:39:07,wallstreetbets,But how much money do you have outside of the 401k vs OP?
2021-05-28 17:53:18,wallstreetbets,What would you think of a 26 year old with 200k in his 401k?
2021-05-27 22:05:53,wallstreetbets,Math does not check out
2021-05-28 14:28:02,wallstreetbets,Sus af
2021-05-27 21:14:38,wallstreetbets,All depends what your company wants to have in your 401k. Your company pays the brokerage house to create options that will be available to you.
2021-05-27 20:12:25,wallstreetbets,I would like to know this too!
2021-05-27 22:17:55,wallstreetbets,"My qualified retirement account is with an independent broker- Principal. I had to move it there, and that’s where the flexibility is. However last March I requested 3x leveraged bear ETFs, they wouldn’t let me"

lot of farmers have second jobs even if they don't need the money because it gives them a challenge."
2021-05-28 00:10:02,wallstreetbets,My hobby is pottery and I could have all the time In world and then I’d need more time.

2021-05-28 00:22:18,wallstreetbets,"I just told my boss I have 2 months left and applied to a Forest Ranger program. Thanks to this sub and GME, I lost most of my savings and realized I was a fucking retard with a terrible job and might as well switch it up, so now I’m taking out a federal loan.

YOLO?"
2021-05-27 21:22:50,wallstreetbets,Please know you’re not alone.
2021-05-28 17:06:25,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right.
2021-05-28 18:18:49,wallstreetbets,Right?!  Lol hindsight!  I sold all my AMC not long ago and look. Lol.
2021-05-27 20:28:03,wallstreetbets,"4 year college degree starting at 18, Job at 22:  $19k * 4 years is $76k before gains.  This just seems like good planned investing."
2021-05-27 22:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Put 15% of your pay toward your 401k, if you can. It adds up quick"
2021-05-27 20:31:07,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely possible. I’ve been at my current job for 2.5 years and my 401k is already up to $96k and it is only invested in a target date fund.
2021-05-27 23:06:35,wallstreetbets,"Because I don't instantly think the negative. Try it, it'll really help you health. Not kidding or being sarcastic."
2021-05-28 16:57:23,wallstreetbets,Zero. I didn't have any savings until late 30s. The caveat is that I have a pension sitting in the background.
2021-05-28 17:00:53,wallstreetbets,"You're not broke or behind. What you are is falling for social media (including Reddit) and the images that make you *think* you're less than you should be. You're doing well. Keep it up and be sure to pay your good fortune forward, my friend."
2021-05-28 17:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm moving everything into index funds (once I lose everything on gme lol). I don't want to daily manage shit."
2021-05-28 05:29:27,wallstreetbets,diversify in the current climate and reality just means GME on more then 1 broker.
2021-05-27 22:38:27,wallstreetbets,I think he means his peak was at 250k
2021-05-27 22:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Was pretty sure this wasn’t a 401K thread for a 26 y/o in GME and AMC of which I have zero.  1998 (28 y/o) Everything I could gather in one core position — finally it paid —- Network Solutions NSOL young man.  Most brilliant thing Ever.  

If only anyone anymore could still imagine a single company that you had to pay to get a .com, rather to be on-the-line…owned the right to put you online.   Unsung slice of history I happened into

Then diversified not so well and was crushed out with a lot of folks at the end.  Glance at a chart from 1970 to current and tell me what you see.  Rhetorical and cheers.  Good memories!  

This guy will work out.  It ain’t gonna repeat 2000.   I’m good.  Not a life peak. Just happy for this kid."
2021-05-27 20:13:25,wallstreetbets,What is the company advantage for this? Do they get more of a tax break?
2021-05-27 22:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Same with Principal as well, except instead of TD we get some bullshit boomer broker called “Wealth Investor” or something."
2021-05-28 03:06:55,wallstreetbets,"Because it's my money. If I wish to donate it I should be able to. 

I didn't say I would take all of it out. I just said I have 50"
2021-05-28 10:25:57,wallstreetbets,"Damn, nice!"
2021-05-28 12:21:33,wallstreetbets,Am I on the correct sub?
2021-05-28 01:07:35,wallstreetbets,"I can't just take it out unless I was unemployed. Only way to take out any funds that make a difference is i was buying a house , medical bills tuition , paying light bills and they all require to submit paperwork .

I can take a loan up to 5k which I thought about doin"
2021-05-28 17:53:01,wallstreetbets,What would you think of a 26 year old with 200k in his 401k?
2021-05-28 09:29:40,wallstreetbets,"
>	60k a year for an engineering position

Most engineering jobs pay 70-90k starting salary

>	5% 401k would put you at about 40-50k in 2-3 years

5% of 60k is 3k, double that for the match. That’s 6k a year, 10% gains (average), so $6,600, $7,200, $8,000 for the 3 years. That’s still only ~$22,000"
2021-05-28 19:02:07,wallstreetbets,I clearly was born to the wrong parents

2021-05-28 09:24:35,wallstreetbets,Not with that attitude.
2021-05-28 06:00:45,wallstreetbets,Leverage could make it work in some weird way? idk
2021-05-27 20:21:12,wallstreetbets,Just joking brother!  😂 I’d surely find ways to entertain myself without working

2021-05-27 23:51:47,wallstreetbets,You are right. I need to get a Cock Sucking (CS) degree.  Genius!
2021-05-28 04:20:50,wallstreetbets,What is CS?
2021-05-28 16:40:32,wallstreetbets,Yea except when you marry a succubus who takes half your $$ when you divorce her after she's been spending 75% of your money on clothes and makeup. FUCK! I'm aight tho.
2021-05-28 00:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Confirming. Banker in LA, Cali making about 120k yearly. At 27 I also am about 75k in 401k and 60k in personal savings/investment in mutual funds"

2021-05-27 22:37:41,wallstreetbets,not having debt out of college goes a long way towards being able to max out 401k contributions annually...
2021-05-27 22:02:08,wallstreetbets,Bold of you to assume he doesn’t live with his parents
2021-05-27 21:05:45,wallstreetbets,"$19k is high for a 22 year old to put in. The average college grad is probably making $45-65k a year and paying $1000 a month in rent.

They could be in finance or software engineering and pulling $120-150k in SF or NYC. 

Consulting at MBB as an analyst in say Chicago (extremely hard to get these jobs) is probably the next best paying gig after I banking and software and that only gets you $75k + 15-20k bonus I think.

But 19k with a 60k salary and 6% match is really hard to budget."
2021-05-28 02:04:26,wallstreetbets,How do you do that when max contribution is $19k a year? Unless you’ve had 100% gains?
2021-05-27 21:14:56,wallstreetbets,How much are you making to have that much in a 401k in only 2.5 years dayumm. Do you have more than that in your regular brokerage account?
2021-05-28 18:30:47,wallstreetbets,Well thank you so much! I most definitely will.
2021-05-28 07:34:48,wallstreetbets,Diversify can also mean lose money in every sector if you're talented enough
2021-05-28 17:03:02,wallstreetbets,Can you simulateously trade with several different brokers? Is that legal?
2021-05-27 22:52:44,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense! I was worried there was some random cap rule that I hadn’t heard of!

I’m not quite as invested as the OP here, but I’ve got a healthy chunk of shares that could turn into a massive amount of money in my 401k as well... I also have the option to do Roth in-plan conversion. Even 100 on AMC would be massively life changing money for me, and anything north of that is icing on the cake.

My problem is it’s all in my 401k and I’ll need to figure out the most cost effective way to cash out =\"
2021-05-27 22:35:43,wallstreetbets,"Probably works for a bank, where they have “insider information”"
2021-05-28 08:24:14,wallstreetbets,They send guaranteed business to the broker in exchange for better rates elsewhere.
2021-05-27 21:38:17,wallstreetbets,You can always fund your own separate stock portfolio instead of through 401k
2021-05-27 20:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Mind blown when you find out about the Roth 401k option with the same $19,500 limit as the regular pre tax 401k option."

I think you're mainly addressing this point.   
   

>It's smarter to put away retirement savings at the current tax bracket you are in and not pay taxes when you withdraw at retirement.
  
Ok, so this assume Roth 401k. 
 
One of the ways Roth is good is if you expect your withdrawals to be about or greater than your salary (with some leeway because who knows what tax rate is when withdrawing). 

But if your retirement income/401k withdrawal is significantly less than your salary, then traditional may be the way to go."
2021-05-28 00:03:42,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how marginal tax brackets work? In all seriousness.

You only get taxed more on the extra money you make. You won't make less money if you somehow do end up in a higher tax bracket."
2021-05-28 00:08:45,wallstreetbets,"But you're not going to be paying more taxes when you retire though. You'd be withdrawing say, 20-30kish per year and you'd be taxed on that as income. That's way less than what you'd be making at the height of your career. Not understanding what you mean."
2021-05-27 20:41:53,wallstreetbets,"Happy cake day. 

The idea with pre tax contributions is that when you pull it out (😜) you’re retired, aka not working, and in a lower tax bracket. You can also opt for Roth 401k contributions which means you pay into the 401k with post tax money."
2021-05-28 03:13:26,wallstreetbets,"I would assume to mitigate your risk since it’s your retirement.  Like I have a 457(b) plan through my job and it’s just a certain set of funds that can be invested in, but I also have a Roth IRA and a general investing account for spitballing outside of that."

2021-05-28 11:09:22,wallstreetbets,Actually not sure about that.  I think matches are employer dependent because I'm pretty sure Vanguard said matches would still happen with post-tax contributions on my plan (but could be wrong).
2021-05-28 02:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Planning for retirement is very individual. Because taxes and inflation increase constantly, I personally don't think utilizing a 401k as my main retirement income source is wise. I am anticipating maintaining my current lifestyle and I do think I will be spending more than I am now. I won't be working so I anticipate a socially active lifestyle is going to cost more than my current lifestyle. If you consider that you only have the weekends to be social when working, then in retirement you will have the entire week to plan social activities."

2021-05-28 01:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I think you have to look at it as an individual.  I make good money. I plan to sustain my current way of life till I die. So I calculate how much I spend then add in increases in taxes and inflation. Then I add in maintenance of my forever home, vehicle costs and quadruple my current medical expenses. Taxes and inflation don't go down. If you think you are going to ""withdraw 20-30kish"" when you are retired then kudos. You decided for yourself that you are going to live your retirement years modestly. My mother lives on $2100/mo and is struggling. She is constantly asking for monetary help. That's $25,200/yr. I don't know how many years you have till retirement but I know how many I have. And I'm not going to follow in my mother's footsteps and struggle financially in my retirement. Good luck to you in your retirement."

2021-05-28 03:27:08,wallstreetbets,"It’s a 401k plan sponsored through your specific employer, though."
2021-05-28 00:23:15,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand for a Roth IRA (I have never heard if a Roth 401k) you can contribute $6k/yr post tax, then at age 50 you can contribute $7k/yr till retirement age(the social security administration says this is at age 67). So if u started putting these amts into your Roth IRA at 22yrs old till retirement you will have $287,000 that you can withdraw at retirement without having to pay taxes. If you invested it wisely you will pay capital gains tax on gains when withdrawing above and beyond the 287k. 

A 401k allows you to pre tax withdraw up to 50% of your income and if you are lucky your company matches a bit. My company match is 6%. 

I pull 10% of my income through the 401k program. I thankfully have a nice job that pays well so I contribute the measly 6k into my IRA and the rest into my personal investment account with post tax $ . With any luck the capital gains tax won't go up by the time I start cashing in my investments to pay for my retirement."
2021-05-28 04:58:59,wallstreetbets,And who decides the rules for my 401k?
2021-05-28 08:13:59,wallstreetbets,you don't need to pay capital gain tax on Roth IRA if you don't withdraw early.
2021-05-28 08:45:21,wallstreetbets,"You might want to re-read up on retirement accounts, it sounds like you'll be paying more taxes long term with your current strategy.

You won't pay any tax on Roth distributions.  That's the point - you already paid tax on the contributions, so your burden is covered.  That's why a lot of high income earners do backdoor Roth IRAs.

I do both traditional and Roth accounts for tax diversification.  I do pre-tax 401k because I expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket when I retire, so it makes sense to defer tax payments for me (and pre-tax means more principal invested).  I only do post-tax brokerage investments after I've maxed out all my tax advantaged accounts.

Choice of accounts is highly dependent on everyone's individual situation, but it's not a bad idea to have some diversification.

Also, some of the things you said vary based on company (e.g., my current company allows 90% of income toward 401k, my last allowed 100%)."
2021-05-28 10:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes - good info. 

Unless you're pouring everything into rental properties, or something like that, which would cause you to be in a *higher* tax bracket in retirement, pre-tax now is a good idea."

2021-05-27 20:33:11,wallstreetbets,using the decimal for thousand separators is def retarded but what amazes me is that you are trading in pounds which also uses the correct commas but somehow you managed to not use it here in this US sub.
2021-05-27 20:10:05,wallstreetbets,Nothing really. I took a gamble because people had been talking about it here so I thought I would dive in. Just got in and got out when it hit 28. An easy 9k

2021-05-27 20:05:57,wallstreetbets,What will mom & dad say when I come home from the summer and they happen to notice my ROTH IRA is jacked to the tits in PLTR
2021-05-28 00:17:51,wallstreetbets,"As someone who actually used Palantir overseas, and was part of the initial switch to it in the Marine Corps, I can honestly say it is an amazing company. I’ve been big on Palantir for a while because I’ve used it first hand and it beats the shit out of the other programs the intel communities were using before."

2021-05-27 22:05:35,wallstreetbets,I have less money than you and made more in GME and AMC
2021-05-27 21:41:10,wallstreetbets,"I just got one contract for january at 30 bucks, counting on you to do the rest!"
2021-05-28 00:05:42,wallstreetbets,Why do you like palantir so much? What is so special about their software?
2021-05-27 23:56:03,wallstreetbets,"160 @ 27, and that's with me having averaged down from around 30-32 lol"
2021-05-28 03:51:05,wallstreetbets,1750 shares? that's alot broo
2021-05-28 00:12:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 18:46:41,wallstreetbets,I agree!! by then we'll be 5 times plus were we today
2021-05-27 21:54:16,wallstreetbets,Theres a shit ton outstanding shares. There is 1.8B shares outstanding... that’s a lot of shares. Enjoy it at these prices. The suits are loading up.
2021-05-27 20:47:58,wallstreetbets,Lol PLTR has more potential than any of the shitty meme stocks and it's still treated as a turd
2021-05-27 23:20:01,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you should have studied the company deeper than ""data is the future breh"""
2021-05-28 01:33:33,wallstreetbets,Everything priced in. A lot of sell pressure from insiders
2021-05-28 08:45:28,wallstreetbets,"If they had bought in last Thanksgiving in the mid $20's, couldn't they have sold in the mid $30's or lower $40's for a nice profit in late January or early February? They could have reinvested those profits back in during the dip. I don't know about you, but most of my family would give thanks for a stock tip that generated a short term return in the 30% to 60% range."
2021-05-28 02:48:48,wallstreetbets,AMC is dog shit so I hope not.
2021-05-28 18:52:45,wallstreetbets,same here but we just have to wait for PLTR's turn to run the tables!
2021-05-28 10:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Nope, went through all the pain. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat)"
2021-05-28 08:42:42,wallstreetbets,Looking good all around.
2021-05-28 18:38:15,wallstreetbets,I'm holding 1250 averaged down to 23.42 so I think there is a lot of us holding here. I'm not selling till mid 30's...don't know if thats weeks or months but either way this is going to be a winner!
2021-05-28 00:51:52,wallstreetbets,This 👌🏽
2021-05-27 20:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, and it doesn't make sense why that's so.  PLTR has several legit reasons why it should at least steadily grow,  but it's been hanging around $18-22 for months it seems,  despite news of new and renewed big money contracts.  Maybe it's not counterculture enough for the YOLO crowd."
2021-05-28 03:57:15,wallstreetbets,"PLTR dances with the government. People don’t trust the government. People can’t trust PLTR, even with getting a new private sector contracts every week."
2021-05-27 20:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Top of my head, it's $35-40 billion US.  You can look it up and tell me the correct answer if you like."
2021-05-27 21:36:11,wallstreetbets,We’ll then I have to get off and jump on my AMC rocket to the moon
2021-05-28 19:34:47,wallstreetbets,Honestly if it hits and holds at mid 30s why sell? I can’t think of any other small cap stocks that are projecting this much growth the next 5 years.
2021-05-28 00:44:59,wallstreetbets,"For whatever reason, I guess valuation matters more for palantir than gameshit or ass munching cinema"
2021-05-27 21:55:57,wallstreetbets,"42. I just think it’s gonna be hard for it to double up or really rocket. 
I was holding for a while. It’s not fun. Now I just have some leaps and such"
2021-05-27 21:30:23,wallstreetbets,"I’m waiting for a slight correction which I think will be slightly below where we are at now in the next two weeks or so. If not I’ll just buy some weekly puts and hedge. If it goes down I win, more shares, if it goes up, still win."
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,RKT Porn as so many of you DMd me about. 
2021-05-27 23:42:49,wallstreetbets,At least someone is making money on RKT
2021-05-27 20:07:30,wallstreetbets,"lol i bought $18C 5/28 this morning for .06 ; went about my day then phone started blowing up as it started to moon, dumped em for .90. Was great. I also am long shares and lots of Jan 2022 20.89 Leap calls so it was a good day for the good kids"
2021-05-28 02:59:57,wallstreetbets,Nice dude. Whats your price target? Close of gap?
2021-05-27 20:52:56,wallstreetbets,We got steve liesman over here
2021-05-27 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,That is literally what this subreddit is about.
2021-05-27 21:24:03,wallstreetbets,For future reference.. you only want to see “gains” when position is sold. and “yolo” when position is currently open. Yes?
2021-05-27 22:12:38,wallstreetbets,"I share my winning and losing plays. Not what’s in my bank. If that’s a problem, ban me."
2021-05-27 21:25:47,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-27 22:13:34,wallstreetbets,He’s asking how much you’ve made not how much money you have.
2021-05-27 21:56:34,wallstreetbets,"Ah so if this position was open still, I’d do yolo.

Okay thanks for clarification."
2021-05-27 23:27:32,wallstreetbets,I don’t have a number what I have made… been trading since 2008

# TA Notes: 

* Bulls broke the small 419.64 test that was listed in prior posts. Found support until SPY tested 20 SMMA . We got a nice green candle after close 👀.
* However, SPY still could not break 421.

# TA Notes:

Theta has caused a rinse and repeat of targets the last three days.

* if 420.73 breaks, look for bullish 🎯 : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish 🎯 : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.
* **Best case for bulls is that we gap above 421 tomorrow.**
* **Best case for bears is we gap below to fill small gap @ 419 and test new resistance.**

Short-term Ascending Triangle Continuation Pattern?

* Uptrend continuation pattern
* Bullish bias
* Bullish 🎯 : 423.81 - 425.15
* Need resistance to break and hit 423.81for pattern to hold true.
* Pattern is null if support breaks.

2021-05-27 20:37:17,wallstreetbets,Selling that call aged badly
2021-05-27 20:41:28,wallstreetbets,Lmao feels bad man... no biggie though... I always cut my losses if I’m down 10%. It would’ve been hard to predict it’d shoot up based on the price action today. I’ll be on watch to see if it tests the 420.70 resistance again tomorrow and look to buy there... Inflation data could change everything tomorrow morning.
2021-05-27 21:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I buy an option and 5 mins later im down 10%.."
2021-05-28 08:35:20,wallstreetbets,Bad inflation news but still not sure what to do
2021-05-27 21:53:45,wallstreetbets,Are you still holding? I don’t play really short-term calls btw. I play with about two months out.
2021-05-28 10:02:00,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking about dipping my toes at pivot point (420.70).
2021-05-27 21:55:09,wallstreetbets,"I don't as well, It was mainly a joke, although my lotto weekly calls yah usually instantly -10%"
2021-05-28 10:04:33,wallstreetbets,Seems plausible but it’s a Friday three day weekend. People might take profit
2021-05-28 10:19:44,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’ll be waiting how it plays out near close before doing anything. Not so convinced the res broke
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Ford reaping in +289%. Blessed the options priced in low volatility 
2021-05-27 20:17:44,wallstreetbets,"It was indeed a great day for Ford (a great week for that matter; so far). It’s nice to see a stock with some solid revenue on the rise, and I’m really really impressed with their new CEO."
2021-05-27 20:28:23,wallstreetbets,"The options on Ford just a few weeks ago were dirt effin cheap. I'm a small fry, but made some money off them. Got a 2022 $17 call riding for the long term too."
2021-05-27 20:30:28,wallstreetbets,Congratulations on the ongoing success. Enjoy the winning feeling and stay sharp!
2021-05-27 20:14:04,wallstreetbets,"You’re just getting into it, don’t think with emotion, think with facts and trends. I’ve held onto 1000% gains because the time wasn’t right and ended up with more."
2021-05-27 20:31:28,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
2021-05-27 21:06:01,wallstreetbets,"Ya, shoot. 30% sounded good in the beginning. Hurts to “lose” 200% but really gained in the big pic. Feels more like a loss tho."
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I hope Jim Cramer is right about BYND 
2021-05-27 23:29:54,wallstreetbets,I just think he likes watching meat rise.
2021-05-28 14:11:17,wallstreetbets,"This reminds me when the news told us to get out of GME and go all in the next WSB hotstock: silver.

It was a lie, obviously, wonder who paid them to say that.

All this tells me is that short sellers are fucked.

If you're gonna buy anything, buy AMC. don't let them fool you with this same old trick. 

I find it hilarious how this is playing out exactly like the start of GME. The difference is that now we *know* that buying and holding works, it was experimental with GME."
2021-05-27 20:55:21,wallstreetbets,"APES like BYND.  That’s the new Hedgehog 🦔battle.

2021-05-28 02:39:24,wallstreetbets,If you go to any grocery store you will see that new imitation meat products are coming out at a fast rate. I'm not even vegan and I buy Beyond meat burgers because I like them more than real burgers. I expect them to do very well and the market they are targeting is definitely growing. A lot of people are starting to see red meat as bad and plant based diets as the holy grail.
2021-05-28 11:37:05,wallstreetbets,its a great play
2021-05-28 11:37:52,wallstreetbets,AGREE! I have 30k+ yolo on 2023 calls. DIAMOND HANDS

2021-05-27 22:06:20,wallstreetbets,It was 2nd out of 3 in the list of stocks with short interest on his show.  I personally think it has too high a market cap for anything to happen to it.
2021-05-28 08:54:01,wallstreetbets,7th was actually sleeping with that thing that thought you smelled good.

2021-05-28 11:56:50,wallstreetbets,What about AMC ITM calls that expire in Sept? Is it better to take profits now or to hope the price rises and holds?

2021-05-27 21:53:47,wallstreetbets,"You’ll get there! I finally turned a fairly decent profit this month with my AMC calls. My cheap practice calls with other stocks would either expire or would only profit a few dollars. Now I’m in the thousands finally! Going to load up on more soon. 🤞

Just make sure you invest what you’re ok with losing."
2021-05-27 23:13:02,wallstreetbets,I always look at buying stocks/investing like throwing money in a trash can.  Only willing to invest what I’m willing to throw in the dumpster.

2021-05-28 07:57:59,wallstreetbets,When the short interest goes up past 20% that’s when I would expect shorts to start buying back. Currently it’s on 6% .
2021-05-28 11:11:41,wallstreetbets,So true
2021-05-28 08:56:19,wallstreetbets,Thought it was around 20% not 6

2021-05-28 00:37:44,wallstreetbets,Makes sense. What about specific stocks? I know everyone is hard about AMC GME BB and such. Is everyone just trading those? I don't have the capital invested to dodge PDT so I can't do dailies but I feel like everyone else started somewhere.

2021-05-28 14:43:28,wallstreetbets,I bought these when it was at $12
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TLRY looks squeezy. Nice setup in an industry that's growing 30% YoY. TLRY has been cooling off since the January excitement. Good technical reversal spot. RSI is creeping up to squeezy levels. Their industry is projected to grow 30% every year for the next 10 years. So it's a good long term bet. It's also a good short term bet because it gets really nice big spikes. I'm in this position. Exits for me are laid out in the chart. Assuming I reach a TP I will exit part of the position and then when it cools off for another month or two I will enter again when the technical setup looks good. I plan on doing this a couple times a year for a few years if this pattern keeps up.

Good luck to all.

2021-05-28 10:27:44,wallstreetbets,You’ll be fine by this time next year
2021-05-28 15:13:24,wallstreetbets,Strongest - I’m holding so much as Cannabis is the next frontier.  It’s had its pops a few years ago and again in Feb.  $TLRY will ha e annualized revenues over $1B in 2022 with high growth multiples.  I believe their market cap will be in excess of $20B in 2022.   That translates to a 3X return for me.
2021-05-27 21:22:33,wallstreetbets,"I agree - I think the week cycle is gaining traction.  $TLRY is the leader in the sector and the upward trend will happen. $SNDL is barometric of the sector - and if that gets above $1, everything accelerated.  Long and strong!"
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Natural Gas Summer Blitz $CRK With a rare natural gas price uptrend beginning right before summer, Commstock Resources is well placed to make a big move higher.

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

[$CRK Poised to Regain It's Former Glory](https://preview.redd.it/dglghbon4q171.png?width=1625&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd79d88fb18d87001e268178c90e87239bd6b0c)

With NatGas prices charging higher we can expect to see a nice upswing in Commstock's beaten-down share price, as investors continue their rotation away from massively overvalued assets (TSLA, CryptCurrencies, etc) into deep value plays.

&#x200B;

[Natural Gas Exploding Higher Today](https://preview.redd.it/ps8mj4qc4q171.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3bde298236cb1108ea2d62891f6728be131c63)

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

I only hold 80 shares, currently in the Red, but plan on buying more. Small fish in a big pond. So do you're own DD, cause I'm retarded!

TLDR:

$CRK go \^ when it stonking hot outside.

Fair Value Price Target: $12+. Rocket boosters take it to the moon."
2021-05-27 20:42:09,wallstreetbets,I think natural gas will have a solid upward trend over the next 5 years but I would recommend TELL as the natural gas company to go with.

2021-05-27 20:50:14,wallstreetbets,"That looks pretty good too. 

Paying 4x the price for options tho, ATM. Looks like an option sellers market for now, until its IV settles down and its customer base reaches critical mass. 

Not a bad long term play at all. I'll be watching."
2021-05-28 03:23:14,wallstreetbets,"Well played sir. 

It's burning up the charts."

2021-05-27 21:39:12,wallstreetbets,Real talk tho. BB has wide institutional holding in Canada. One man by the name of Prem Watsa holds a very significant (~20%) stake. They publicly said that they couldn't sell last run up because they were restricted. I don't think they're restricted anymore. I'd be careful with this one...

Using the app that shan’t be named (RH)I’ve put in 120, I’ve made over 200 on dogge and currently have about 431 invested. I’ve taken some profit out but really have just kept reinvesting. Now I have 70 in buying power and I think ripple looks good, thoughts? Also I have 3.99 shares in AMC at avg 5$ cost. Should I keep it in? So far my thought process has been to stay in cause I’ve already beat my overhead but it’s cost me...didn’t sell NKLA at 90 when I bought in at 10( that one really hurt) and sold my original dogge that if I had held onto would’ve made me 11k.

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,HIOXEX exchange Hello everybody. Does anybody of you know anything about a chinese trading app called hioxex exchange? It is kind of strange since I couldn’t find anything about them online. Did someone of you use the app in the past? I downloaded it and it seems professional but also kind of shady because you can’t find it on the app or play store. They have a working help desk but they don’t answer every question I have about them. I’m not sure if it is safe to trade or to put money on my wallet there. Maybe someone of you did already work with that app. I’m really curious about the origin of that trading platform. Any info would be helpful.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SpotGamma Analysis - AMC RKT Gamma Squeeze: “Escape Vol-ocity!” "" AMC, RKT and other meme stocks are ripping higher due to an options gamma squeeze. As traders buy call options, options market makers must buy stock to stay hedged. We believe this hedging flow is whats causing massive stock moves.""

""AMC is up nearly 140% this week alone. As you can see the stock hit “escape vol-ocity” in the past 2-3 sessions as short dated call option volume spiked.""

 ""Below we have a snapshot of the current options volume in AMC. As you can see in the red box the days options volume is massive – and it heavily outpaces open interest. This is particularly true of the 25 and 30 strikes in which volume is near 150k for today.""

"" If traders are buying large amounts of calls, then market makers are short calls. To hedge these positions, market makers must buy AMC stock. Call buyers forcing market makers into purchasing stock is the essence of the options gamma squeeze.""

""To start the day our EquityHub options model was telling us that nearly 30% of total AMC gamma expired tomorrow, 5/28. We think that number shifts to 50% based on the wild volume taking place today. Because so much gamma expires tomorrow we think that AMC will likely consolidate as call options decay kicks in, which allows dealers to unwind some of their long stock hedge position.""

2021-05-27 23:49:01,wallstreetbets,"Since we're talking about short interest again, here's a reminder:

If you have a margin account (you get instant settlement, instant deposits, you have to follow PDT rules), and not a cash account (trades must fully settle after several days), then your broker lends out your shares and collects the short interest premium on them.

You agreed to it when you signed up for a margin account. You have a certificate of ownership of the shares, but the shares are in their custody and contribute to their margin pool. Typically brokers let you short from the broker margin pool for free, but if none are available, they can source shares for the rate if you ask.

RH, TDA, Tasty and Webull works like this. Most others do too. If you're buying and holding shares, you aren't starving shorts. I guess you're driving the price up if you take an ask, but if your transaction is merely helping a bona fide hedger dynamically hedge an option, you aren't reducing the share supply."

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **100.21** which gives us a total value of:

The recent move in **AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC**) has nothing to do with a short squeeze, Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  
  
What Happened: 680 million shares were traded Thursday, yet AMC Entertainment only has 450 million shares outstanding, Greenfield said.  
  
**""If hedge funds wanted to get out of their entire position, if they were short, they could do it within minutes,""** he said, adding that the AMC Entertainment price action does not point to big institutions or hedge funds being squeezed."

She said don’t touch them too hard. I didn’t touch them. I also said oh why do you need to be on birth control? She said she was still wet after she ttook a shower. I said want me to get you another towel? And the last autistic moment was she climbed on top of me while watching one punch man, and I just looked at her and continued to watch one punch man. I did not hit. But slept in the same bed. I’m not joking about any of this either lol

Honestly I've had enough of this bullshit.  Whenever AMC or GME rips we see these articles about how the Reddit crowd is buying again hurr durr...the recent squeezes were *not* started by Redditors.  Somebody with a lot of fucking money started jamming a few meme stocks higher using options and forced dealer delta hedging.  Obviously Redditors are jumping on board but AMC (e.g.) only started being mentioned a lot here recently *after* it starting exploding.

There are professional traders out there like Hwang that are hunting shorts.

2021-05-28 00:32:15,wallstreetbets,"So I know the current price has nothing to do with fundamentals, but I can't help but be irritated that AMC became a thing.  

No matter how much money they raise from investors, they lose money simply by operating.  I want to keep this simple...  It doesn't matter if they are open again.  Being open just costs them money and, as a business, all they do is destroy shareholder value.  They have a current ratio way on the wrong side of 1.  They have more debt than assets.  They lost $550 million in the 4 years prior to the pandemic.  They can only put cash on the balance sheet by borrowing it or selling stock.

This ain't GME.  There's no turnaround coming and management has no plan.  Aside from selling popcorn for $40 per bag."

Options are expiring tomorrow and it is a long weekend. You guys are definately making money but do not let your gains be washed. Buy back on Tuesday would be smarter. At the max you might miss some small gain. Act smart, you might not be the smartest one everytime. I am wsb and GME fan"
2021-05-28 04:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Let’s be honest: GME was a $4 stock before it exploded and now has a floor of $150ish it has sustained for months.  Just based on the hysteria around here, AMC likely will end up with a floor of $30-40 even if it doesn’t “squeeze” (considering how much larger its float is).  It’s still cheap enough for the everyday man to buy, and enough people believe in the squeeze and are holding that the float keeps getting smaller and smaller.

What I’m saying is, buying the highest strike OTM calls at open today that expire at least two weeks out is not a totally retarded idea.  At least that’s how I’m going to justify it to my wife when she asks where our kids’ college fund went."

Quoted from Press Release, Opinions on this one Please!

Simply Wall St;

  
Thu, May 27, 2021, 5:03 AM  
There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Seanergy Maritime Holdings (NASDAQ:SHIP) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital."

2021-05-27 23:08:13,wallstreetbets,Inflation is very real retard. Jpow put us in a pandemic bubble. Equity market will probably crash 50% once EU and China dump bonds. Once bonds fall equity markets will follow

2021-05-28 03:47:14,wallstreetbets,It’s a cycle of raging boom then bust capitalism that is getting more frequent. In reality we never recovered from the 2008 bank crash in any meaningful form. This cycle allows the wealthy to get wealthier and so is perpetuated by them. We are sucker fish trying to attach ourselves to the whales as they feed.

2021-05-28 05:54:11,wallstreetbets,"It’s all just based on dollars and volume. If you have 1,000,000 apes investing $200 in an hour, it’s the same as 1 institutional investor investing $200,000,000 over the course of an hour. Institutional investors obviously have more power because of the amounts that they play with, but get enough apes reasonably hyped up and organised using wonderful platforms like Reddit and we can have a similar pull"
2021-05-28 05:52:16,wallstreetbets,No these movements were started by retail but just looking at the volume there is no way this is normal or retail

2021-05-27 22:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, exactly. No fucking way Redditors bought $350 million in AMC calls *at ask* over the last two days. A single person bought $2.4 million in GME FDs at ask this morning. No way anyone on Reddit is starting this."

2021-05-27 22:06:52,wallstreetbets,Only thing that sends market down is interest rates. Anything else no one could give a fuck about
2021-05-27 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,Inflation will work its way down once supply chains catch up and COGS go down. No more fuckin stimmies though. Agreed for sure on spending increase. Feels like we’re overheating right now
2021-05-27 22:00:58,wallstreetbets,"There are no rules, son. We go up"

2021-05-27 20:31:10,wallstreetbets,If these Apes could read they would be very enlightened
2021-05-27 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,Imagine the people saying they are buying calls after a stock has ran that much. GME was a unicorn. Not every squeeze can produce the same results.
2021-05-27 23:26:36,wallstreetbets,Imagine NOT buying amc and watching it go up ANOTHER 40%
2021-05-28 01:47:33,wallstreetbets,29 and 19 barely even odd..

2021-05-28 04:48:56,wallstreetbets,Hundreds of different languages and you chose to speak facts
2021-05-28 07:39:04,wallstreetbets,"There is a difference with GME though, AMC's float is huge. It can go to 50$ I think but even 100$ would be a miracle imo"

2021-05-28 01:27:32,wallstreetbets,Depends on how you define losing. I think pltr will do better than AMC in the end and thus win the race.
2021-05-28 03:01:49,wallstreetbets,Shut up Cramer. We are on an amc moon mission and we don't have time for fake meat tendies right now.

2021-05-28 04:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares then buy puts to hedge on the shares so you can exercise. Absolute tendies regardless of which way it goes. If stock goes up you make tendies on shares. 

I tried puts out of the gate and they got evaporated. Eliminated my bearish sentiment and now playing both sides. 

Just hedge yourself 🤝"

2021-05-28 06:01:12,wallstreetbets,"Just don't even think about it. Don't get yourself hyped up on a number you may never see. Expecting being up $500 to then be only up $300 will actually crush you regardless of being up cause it wasn't as much as $500. Just know you have potential tendies and go chill and do something else for the time being.  


Just go make some coffee, jerk off and wake up to tendies at market open.  


SPY got retard bull strength for no reason"
2021-05-28 06:12:14,wallstreetbets,"It closed at $0.33. 

Your theta was ~$0.22 to hold 17.5 hours over night. So if there is no underlying price change, your option would be worth $0.33-$0.22 = $0.11.

Your delta is $0.33, and your gamma is $0.23. 

 Your example calls for a $1.70 prince increase. This would be 1.7 units of delta, and .7 units of gamma.

So if it moves $1.70 to the upside, your call would increase in value by $0.33 (first delta) + $0.23 (second partial unit of delta) + $0.16 (gamma) - $0.22 (theta) = $0.50.

You would get a nice bagger."

International Consolidated Airlines, SAS, and Lufthansa (The latter two becuse they are historically low and have been promised government bailouts if they go tits up). My hope is that the revenue statements from June-Aug are going to blow everything out of the water, since loads of Europeans have saved up their holiday last year and are wanting to take two this year."

2021-05-27 23:12:31,wallstreetbets,"I love your visualizations! Was wondering if you could graph mentions vs stock price since you seem to have time stamped data.

Headlines are so definitive that reddit is driving the price vs reacting and responding to the price movements. Of course everyone was talking about AMC today! It was up 50%

Would love to see some data supporting that price moves before reddit mentions. Or be proven wrong. Either way would be interesting."

2021-05-27 20:59:24,wallstreetbets,Just roll it to a further out date call at the same strike price. you may actually make money. After this is over just close the position with a higher buy call. once it drops 30 calls are going to be really fucking cheap.
2021-05-27 21:04:24,wallstreetbets,"I have to get paid first to do that, which isn’t until Monday unfortunately. I’m still making a good profit, it’s just sad to see those potential gains I could have made. I just didn’t see the price exploding this week (did anyone?), but who hasn’t been there at one point? At least it’s not an actual loss, and I’m sure whoever bought those calls this week are happy people. 

I’m glad everyone else will be getting their tendies though! I’m still more in GME than anything and I’m not selling calls of those, so I’m not going to miss out."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Long CNHI CNHI is doing well.  Tractor sales, farm equipment, and construction equipment are all up.

Ag commodities had pulled back but are going up again.  Corn and Soybean cash bids and futures prices are up between 30 and 40 cents per contract today.  Higher prices translate to higher farm income and farmers are notorious for spending increased revenue on new/more expensive equipment.

Titan Machinery Inc (TITN) just blew away earnings and is up about 24% today.  As of posting this, up $6.14 to $31.70.  Titan is a large Case New Holland dealership and is indicative of CNHI sales and service/parts revenue.

2021-05-28 10:18:56,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t be so sure about that, it reached close to 60 after only announcing a test flight with zero results. When it was canceled, the price plummeted. What we’re seeing now is the result of a positive test flight. So if no results meant 60, imagine what we could be looking at now that we had a successful test flight"
2021-05-27 20:00:33,wallstreetbets,"All I've heard to this point is they have handed all the data from the flight to the FAA for their analysis, cause after that they will receive a license they're waiting on. Then they'll schedule the next test. However a June flight is highly probable for the next, and you could almost bet sir Richard Branson will fly his birthday weekend which is July 18th..."
2021-05-28 10:51:25,wallstreetbets,"Hitting 60 again right now would be life changing for me just trying not to get to hyped up about it, cause 40 would still be huge in my book.🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝💲💲💲"

2021-05-28 19:51:10,wallstreetbets,You pay the per share price x 100 and receive the shares. So in this case 1900 dollars for 100 shares at the 19 dollar strike price. Which is a big discount when the stock trades at 26 as of close Friday

2021-05-28 07:29:37,wallstreetbets,"At that price, I think it would be all the shorters liquidated holdings. It would probably create a general market downturn from the sudden forced selling and piling of all capital into AMC."

2021-05-28 01:24:31,wallstreetbets,"You do know that they could have covered yesterday considering the volume right? They do not have to return the shares untill 2 days after buying them. Which means the SI% on ortex can be much lower in 2 days. 

They also might not have and this will be obvious on monday. But saying that they did not cover anything is misleading."

2021-05-27 23:54:26,wallstreetbets,"But that doesn't make sense. If they are covering tomorrow why would they intentionally push the price up? The volume has been insane, they could've covered today at 25, why push to 50 to cover?"

2021-05-28 00:53:39,wallstreetbets,">they could've covered today at 25

How?

They need *enough* people to sell.

Did you sell today?

I didn't.

Edit: They're **buying up to sell at 50 and cause a big dip and cause panic.

Edit2: They're not hoping for you to sell at 50, they're hoping you sell *after* they create a dip. The idea being to aim for pockets of stop losses and drive the price down with a waterfall and get out of their shorts with minimal loses and even increased profits."
2021-05-28 16:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Apparently many are selling. I’ll jump in Monday morning with $18,000. Unless it drops through the floor, in which case I’ll wait for an uptick."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Had to jump on the gain train 
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this."
2021-05-27 23:20:03,wallstreetbets,Sell it now....buy it again if it breaks above the FEB highs and short it below the double bottom around a 1000. It is dead money for a long time to come

2021-05-28 01:35:53,wallstreetbets,Is the AMC runup over or will we see GameStop levels?
2021-05-28 01:50:17,wallstreetbets,Till when do we hold

2021-05-28 07:41:57,wallstreetbets,"Any idea What the price we are looking at today?? 
Will it rally same as yesterday, lost the opportunity yesterday. Hoping to make some money today"
2021-05-28 08:12:59,wallstreetbets,"I don’t use option but thinking about going long on AMC, what u guys think ? #seekingknowledge"
2021-05-28 08:39:30,wallstreetbets,If people continue to hold the price will continue to raise in the long run. Rumours are saying hedge funds are deliberately doing this to buy back some shares. Trying to prevent what’s happening with GME.
2021-05-28 09:47:03,wallstreetbets,Update

2021-05-28 10:04:34,wallstreetbets,I bought at $100 4 months ago. Nice to see some gains. What triggered this sudden EI up? Would be nice to get some Calls in place before this happens.

2021-05-28 10:20:54,wallstreetbets,How much did you need in your account to fulfill that call of 2500? I don’t understand how options fully work. I know you need money to fulfill but how much if your profiting already by the stock surpassing your SP.

2021-05-28 05:59:09,wallstreetbets,"It never was a meme, investing in GME/AMC (not that they are both the same, mind you) is hyperrational. I don't know if you trust strangers on the internet, but if you invest a few hours to read up on everything you can, check for yourself and do your own research you will know where to invest. I'm personally up 150% on my entire portfolio since last year.

2021-05-28 13:57:26,wallstreetbets,Thats That's lot of Risk for a 15% return.

2021-05-28 08:00:57,wallstreetbets,I'm with you. My fiancé thought I was crazy when I said I was buying AMC at $5.57 early February. Now she says her boyfriend needs new Lambo. Smh.
2021-05-27 20:58:55,wallstreetbets,No! The squeeze hasn't even started yet!
2021-05-27 20:54:01,wallstreetbets,"mods said I couldn't update it anymore, I'll post a new one next week (but is it really a yolo when we know where we're going?)"

2021-05-28 12:02:12,wallstreetbets,I prefer it green
2021-05-27 21:01:04,wallstreetbets,You sure ?? How many shares do i need to buy to make decent amount ? How high will it go?
2021-05-27 21:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Looking at previous squeezes if it drops all of a sudden it isn’t sqooze. I’m holding until we get a sustained squeeze. VW maintained about 2 weeks near the high. That is what I’m watching for now. Those other dips are paper hand getting out and taking profits. Price consolidation. I’m patient and my AMC & GME is just fine, red doesn’t scare me, green makes me want more.."

2021-05-28 11:05:48,wallstreetbets,what broker are you using?
2021-05-28 14:02:10,wallstreetbets,Could have fooled us by WSB deleting GME posts
2021-05-28 17:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Ain’t that the truth. I held. I watched WSB jump around, which was the original intention of the group. A place to make money. I was all in though and some of WSB acted like anyone holding AMC or GME were morons. I have always been a vocal person, but I listen to both sides of the story and I try not to be disrespectful.

We will never always agree, but we can be respectful. Apes shouldn’t shit on apes. We are one in the same. 

Let’s do the damned thing. 

Got a question though. What if stocks don’t squeeze in unison. I a not a smart ape. Let’s see some DD for post squeeze, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th squeeze plays."

2021-05-27 21:32:25,wallstreetbets,It can make a hundred  if shorts cover.. Jimmy could have made a thousand plus if the buy button wasn't took away.
2021-05-28 02:29:44,wallstreetbets,10% is a great annual return if your principal amount is $1 billion lol.
2021-05-28 08:39:31,wallstreetbets,So instead you gambled it all
2021-05-28 02:28:31,wallstreetbets,Then this guy must be one of the luckiest guys ever (or an absolute genius).  The timing had to be almost perfect on those FDs.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"This is my EV play. DD on BB, SONY, VW, Volvo. Hey all - I am a huge auto enthusiast and been following the industry closely. This is how I’m betting on EVs.

BB:
60 $30c 01/2022 at $0.27
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don’t want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
🚀🚀🚀


I wouldn’t call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren’t a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it’s actually a good thing that there’s a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That’s some fat margin.

Now, you’re probably wondering…wtf, I’m here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you’re right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you’re sitting? Well that’s probably a Sony camera…or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean…my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it’s a tiny slab of glass and my family can’t sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they’ll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who’s probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I’m not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what’s interesting about Ford’s EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means…even if Ford can’t sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that’s VW’s home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder…what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren’t that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It’s kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That’s cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there’s that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs…Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don’t mean Volvo Cars. That’s bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I’m taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It’s not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there’s Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

All my opinions only, not financial advice. Currency amounts all written in USD.

Obligatory rockets 🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-28 02:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m not bullish on Daimler because they seem stuck in the past. I’ve owned 3 Smart Fortwo in the past, 2 of them EVs so I’m an early adopter to EVs. Daimler was well ahead of the game, and in fact used Tesla batteries in the smart ELectric Drive and B class ED (and they even owned a bit of Tesla hence Tesla Model S switchgear and buttons come straight out of a Merc B class too). 

But for the past 5 years, they are stuck at that stage and haven’t moved much after cutting ties with Tesla. They even managed to botch the EQC launch, and eventually cancelling for US. Their brand is aging quickly too.

I don’t think Daimler will die…brand is too valuable so somebody will scoop them up. But I think they are fit for a dip and need a merger to survive at some point in the next 5-10 years, unless they course correct quickly."

2021-05-28 02:34:30,wallstreetbets,"I know, I own a fiew shares of qs, the point is that VW is the automaker and qs ur the batteries maker, doesn’t mean that owning VW you own QS too 😂"

So instead I buy the stocks that I like rather than ARKK/X/etc. Except for ARKG which I just don’t know enough about so I got some. 

On a related note, a lot of people think Tesla is done it’s bull run, but if you have a long term horizon (5 years or so) you can’t go wrong owning it. I see it as buying Amazon when it was close to 1,000PE.  Tesla is 5-10 years ahead of the competition and companies like Ford trying to compete with it reminds me of IBM trying to compete with AAPL. It just won’t work. I can see Tesla becoming a 1-2 trillion mkt cap company in the next 5 years, and that’s without lvl5 FSD."

576@24.02

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

📷

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

Average target price $38.21"
2021-05-28 08:53:14,wallstreetbets,So what your saying is we should YOLO?
2021-05-28 12:23:06,wallstreetbets,"Damn this is quality research, thank you! Too bad nobody's gonna see it because of AMC+GME popping off. I love the WSB only-DD filter, lol, there's some gems buried under the memes. A few weeks back someone did high-quality DD for $INO and I've made +40% returns on my option plays since then. Gonna throw some of that into $CHPT and see what happens!"
2021-05-28 02:13:01,wallstreetbets,Wtf how long did it take you to write this? Are you a writer or PhD student?
2021-05-27 22:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Charge point fucking sucks. It literally takes 8 hours to charge my Tesla

Yeah let me just take my Tesla on a quick road trip. Only have to stop for 8 hours every 150 miles"
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,The actual reason AMC soared: I made you all millions. Please just cover my loss 
2021-05-27 20:01:29,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
2021-05-27 22:20:11,wallstreetbets,I heard on CBNC today that 40% of all AMC contracts were put options out of 3.3Mil+ contracts traded today. You just so happen to be ballsy enough to show your loss.
2021-05-28 08:27:06,wallstreetbets,Never understood why people choose to make money Betting on something to fail. To me that's just bad karma waiting to happen. You can easily make money betting On companies to succeed  instead of hoping they tank. Good luck.
2021-05-27 21:42:53,wallstreetbets,Meh kinda wanna buy some more amc left it after cashing out couple months ago is there any DD to see if it’s a good idea or is this the cap

2021-05-28 11:06:59,wallstreetbets,"Guys stay realistic. Its so simple to predict whats going to happen into close.

private investors have driven this insane run. There is a 3 day weekend ahead who wants to hold his life savings in this period when actually Im able to sell with a gain.

Take your gains and come back next week Tuesday for the next run"
2021-05-28 11:12:23,wallstreetbets,Why did you buy puts ? Even I’m not that retarded to bet against AMC

2021-05-28 00:57:17,wallstreetbets,🏳️‍🌈🐻
2021-05-28 07:42:19,wallstreetbets,WOOF - Petco is severely undervalued at $23.00 with super earnings. Big short position makes this a short squeeze candidate. Even more so than AMC or GME
2021-05-28 08:43:02,wallstreetbets,Lol you’re one of those apes. I’m happy you loss money. Any amc doubters should kick rocks.
2021-05-28 11:05:54,wallstreetbets,AMC TO THE 🌙  BUY NOW!!
2021-05-28 11:08:40,wallstreetbets,Everyone put 10 k in amc lets get that squeeze!!!
2021-05-28 01:26:46,wallstreetbets,He sold the dip.
2021-05-28 06:36:57,wallstreetbets,"update, almost 33 lul"
2021-05-28 08:17:24,wallstreetbets,It will likely be zero this morning but options don’t trade in pre-market or AH.

2021-05-28 09:20:06,wallstreetbets,I did not get the memo.

2021-05-27 20:22:25,wallstreetbets,OP is irrelevant and didn't do shit but lose their own ass. Just they want us to hear about their Itty bitty account getting washed and now here we all are.

2021-05-27 22:19:20,wallstreetbets,"OP thinks he’s a banker now and deserves handouts, little does he know he’s just an ape."

2021-05-27 23:13:39,wallstreetbets,It takes time bro to learn and hold they’re in good hands just hang in there

2021-05-28 11:53:42,wallstreetbets,"I *tried* to buy puts this morning. Fuck that noise, everybody and their brother was foaming at the mouth to buy them - Delta was near 1 and gamma near zero all the way out to $10-12 out of the money. My limit order was based on yesterday's Delta/Gamma and was so far off my broker was passing it around to everyone in the office so they could get a good laugh."
2021-05-28 11:31:49,wallstreetbets,It's harder to understand why someone would bet against this ticker specifically knowing the backstory and potential for loss by doing so.
2021-05-27 22:45:26,wallstreetbets,"Sorry bro. Bad move.  Back out ASAP
I’m not a licensed professional but been
Doing this 30 years I thought I hit it big when I sold my Amazon for almost 200 bucks"
2021-05-28 11:14:09,wallstreetbets,Just put 10 k lets push it up
2021-05-28 11:17:53,wallstreetbets,It’s been going down since January
2021-05-28 11:23:38,wallstreetbets,Holding brother!
2021-05-28 11:24:38,wallstreetbets,Yes for sure absolutely
2021-05-28 11:58:11,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze is not here yet, don't fall into a bear trap."
2021-05-28 11:52:21,wallstreetbets,That is the nicest comment I’ve got here. Thank you
2021-05-27 23:01:30,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
2021-05-27 22:47:39,wallstreetbets,Not necessary. Be nice. Poor bastrd will learn

2021-05-28 00:44:48,wallstreetbets,WE GET OFF ON THAT SHIT HERE WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU
2021-05-27 22:54:39,wallstreetbets,"Good for you be careful. Next time may not be so easy. Option market is turning casino 
That’s not what stock options are for. 
However the hedge fund managers did start all this. If you do have the brain for this take advantage while you can because it won’t last long I just know this"
2021-05-28 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,He bet against it lol. He must have not been using his brain
2021-05-27 20:26:46,wallstreetbets,Poor people have poor ways bro.  Just tell your kids about him so they don't turn out the same.
2021-05-27 20:45:02,wallstreetbets,Money comes and goes. Make some lose some.
2021-05-27 21:02:21,wallstreetbets,It’s the thought that counts. Thank you and may you recover your loses
2021-05-27 21:43:15,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-05-28 00:24:16,wallstreetbets,I can be if they ask?
2021-05-28 01:21:37,wallstreetbets,Ugh I have fomo. I always do this lol smh
2021-05-28 10:20:29,wallstreetbets,"Because he bought put options, meaning he shorted the stock, meaning he’s not a true ape."
2021-05-28 10:19:36,wallstreetbets,Yea a put option means an investor thinks a stock will tank and it also shorts the stock.
2021-05-28 11:23:34,wallstreetbets,You will be rich don’t worry
2021-05-28 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,Yes following for a while. Its a trainwreck. Imagine the value that fallen to 1 nok last year. Basicly they need to raise capital but cant sell in that price so lets «adjust» the price to 60 nok buy reducing the amount of shares. Its still worthless but who cares. Now you get to buy millions of new worthless shares on discount while they bag your real money. Boom norwegian is OTC penny stock now. You got played by the big boys. For the love of god stay away from it.
2021-05-27 20:25:43,wallstreetbets,"Money doesn't multiple,  you just dip your hand into someone else's account. 

OP got dipped by many hands today."
2021-05-27 20:23:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this isnt ape. 

Apes literally aren't this dumb."
2021-05-27 20:46:21,wallstreetbets,The way the market has been since February you were NOT surprised AMC shot up and stayed up?
2021-05-27 21:01:31,wallstreetbets,No gme
2021-05-28 03:20:56,wallstreetbets,Bad night at the tables. It’ll get better. We all feel like that sometimes.

2021-05-27 20:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Man, if I could learn how the hell these puts and calls worked, I might actually come out ahead once in a while.

Do you have a resource that helped you learn?"
2021-05-27 20:20:32,wallstreetbets,I will never understand any of this shit...... i bought in at 11$... wtf are calls?!?!

2021-05-28 08:50:20,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny, 2 weeks ago all of you amc haters talked sooo much shit. Now all of you are watching amc like a hawk. I fucking love this. I don’t care if y’all fake af. As long as you keep adding to your position. But seriously, this is making me laugh so hard. Fucking 🤡’s"
2021-05-27 21:16:20,wallstreetbets,"What's a call? I have 25ish shares in amc and planning on selling at opening, but maybe there's room for other profits? I'm new and willing do to the work to learn. If you can point me to a resource 🙏🏽 ty!"
2021-05-27 22:21:27,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah?  That's badass!  If I can find what time I placed the order I'll let you know lol
2021-05-28 14:57:38,wallstreetbets,I was definitely up today 🤣  Oh wells. If the stock dips into the teens then I'll buy more shares.
2021-05-27 21:26:57,wallstreetbets,Apes not hold they bananas they eat them . :)
2021-05-27 22:53:27,wallstreetbets,"As someone who's new to this, can someone explain why so many people seem legitimately furious at this guy for not having/losing an astronomical amount of money?

I get that there are numbers larger than 5k but what is the deal with getting so butthurt about someone being upset at losing 5k?"
2021-05-27 21:08:59,wallstreetbets,I believe the technical term is auto-erotic asphyxiation.
2021-05-27 21:30:25,wallstreetbets,"$3,760.17 to be exact"
2021-05-27 22:39:39,wallstreetbets,"How bout loosing 60k because ya got jacked 
Up night b4 and slept in. Wall st. Is real  
Never brag about the good girl next door 
Stay quiet and enjoy. Am I wrong?? I just thought people were missing movie theater 
Like vacation. It’s a no brainer and rare opportunity.  Bout time rite"
2021-05-27 20:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you should take a break from fucking because AMC just fucked up your shit bad. 

Maybe you aren't good at this.  Have you tried food service or washing windows?"

2021-05-28 08:32:28,wallstreetbets,And he can change his username to 'deepfuckingretarded'

2021-05-28 03:00:52,wallstreetbets,"Aye, I'm holding for sure."

2021-05-27 21:08:55,wallstreetbets,"Bruh its going to 1k+ we’ve been trying to tell you apes for months but keep getting downvoted. Now you doubters are getting wrecked and I love every second of it.

Get fucked"
2021-05-28 02:42:03,wallstreetbets,"I think people are much more likely to paperhand AMC than GME. GME is the OG ""short squeeze"" play and holders seem to have way more conviction."
2021-05-28 11:19:12,wallstreetbets,It started trending up in January dude. 🖍
2021-05-28 00:17:15,wallstreetbets,Emotions got zee best...son of an APE!... 🥲
2021-05-28 02:35:16,wallstreetbets, Patience is virtue that’s what we are taught when we were young. What drives the market is greed and fear it’s just money on paper we got nothing to lose by holding out
2021-05-28 14:56:53,wallstreetbets,Too much drinkin for me I do apologize. I’m a new guy. My woman tells me if you don’t have anything nice to say shut up. So I don’t say too much around here
2021-05-27 22:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Lol, sure, if you've been living under a rock for the last six months. There has been DD explaining that these kinds of run-ups and evens MSM is onto the volatility."
2021-05-28 01:44:05,wallstreetbets,Losing money is never fun
2021-05-27 23:39:43,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the kind words, I will be cautious for sure. I've already backed away from a risky position in options for AMC, I'm no just positioned to make money on moves of 5% or more over the next couple months, pretty sure this thing isn't settled into a stable price whether too low or too high right now."
2021-05-27 22:35:20,wallstreetbets,Lol I bought more at 28
2021-05-27 23:24:31,wallstreetbets,Don’t be silly sellers as Jim Cramer says https://youtu.be/aIeWY3JWYl8 lol
2021-05-27 21:32:10,wallstreetbets,I really didn’t see amc passing $15 and hitting $30 without resistance coming. Lol.
2021-05-28 00:44:57,wallstreetbets,Same thing here. At one point I was up 20% and like a dumbass I held.
2021-05-28 03:06:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah I managed to make money off of my 15$ puts yesterday because the volatility was so insane at some points.
2021-05-28 08:54:48,wallstreetbets,Kramer’s on talking about it now
2021-05-27 21:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Watch InTheMoney on Yt he breaks it down pretty well. 

But the basics are buying calls means you think the stock will go up and buying puts means you think the stock will go down. That’s the gist but there’s also stuff with greeks and Implied Volatility is also pretty important"
2021-05-27 20:36:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm still hella learning (and lost about $300 last week) as I just started some options, but I'm getting the hang of it.  Can understand a bit better when looking at the options chain, and I used this https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp and kind of just trying it out to at least get a better understanding of how calls work.  Haven't tried puts yet, but similar.  Unless stock goes to 0, you can only lose so much money which is nice."
2021-05-27 22:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you learn by losing it all and then some! After you lose it all, it helps getting that retard badge cause you know your one step closer to losing it all over again and then, only then you might see some gainz."
2021-05-27 23:43:13,wallstreetbets,Might as well increase the risk. See how much you can really loose
2021-05-28 05:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Resources: googling 'how do options work', reading options for dummies, going to nyse/cbot website, signing up at a brokerage and reading the endless material they will have on this simple simple 8th grade topic."

2021-05-28 09:57:02,wallstreetbets,"I've had AMC since 2020, so idk what you're talking about."
2021-05-28 03:06:36,wallstreetbets,Espan-yolo!
2021-05-28 09:34:26,wallstreetbets,"And the Spanish word for sell, in English is buy. I'm not a linguist and this is not language advice, but I do enjoy using my tongue."
2021-05-28 06:54:34,wallstreetbets,"The buyer puts his tendies into the seller. Hence the ""puts"" part. Someone else wanna explain calls?"
2021-05-28 10:21:03,wallstreetbets,"I think OP intended to make a joke about his losses but it didn't go so well with most people because they're taking it serious, plus he bet against most of the people who are on AMC or holding heavy bags for AMC for a long time at a loss.  Poorly executed joke set up to get flamed."
2021-05-28 03:18:31,wallstreetbets,Maybe because of his title?
2021-05-28 08:56:41,wallstreetbets,"The title is supposed to be a joke. People often say things like “just bought SPY calls you’re welcome bears it’s definitely going to tank now,” making fun of their complete inability to predict the price."
2021-05-28 02:31:07,wallstreetbets,"Deciding to short this is almost as bad, or i guess in hindsight even worse then deciding to short GME.."

2021-05-27 22:32:49,wallstreetbets,"There isn't any way to actually see that, is there?"

2021-05-28 07:50:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think you’re right"
2021-05-28 11:19:49,wallstreetbets,When it fell from $19 to $8?
2021-05-28 02:06:22,wallstreetbets,This sub has truly become something else
2021-05-28 14:58:14,wallstreetbets,I’ve been doing this too long and still don’t know crap but I have been very lucky lately
2021-05-27 23:18:35,wallstreetbets,Resistance was the previous hi 20 once it went through went to the moon no more previous highs nothing to hold it down
2021-05-27 21:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Me either. I thought amc at $12 a few weeks ago was absolutely absurd. This thing will pop at some point, who knows when."
2021-05-28 08:49:15,wallstreetbets,"I have a Greek friend, think he can help me?"

The nature of short squeezes is that it goes straight up, and then when the shorts are done covering, straight down."
2021-05-28 07:34:36,wallstreetbets,You have gotta be the most level headed ape. Lose that money and still happy for others. We need more people like you. Did you at least grab a few shares when it started climbing?

2021-05-28 14:05:57,wallstreetbets,"The closer the expiry and the more OTM (out of the money) the strike price, the less chance the option has of being worth anything, and the lower option will trade for. 30 by 6/8 feels very risky to me, especially after the meteoric rise earlier this week.

Your trading app should show you cost basis (the amount you bought the option(s) for) and the current price of the options. If the option is in the green, you may want to sell for a profit unless you're very confident that the stock will be above $30 + the amount you paid for the option if you bought it OTM (since the extrinsic value of an option drains away as it reaches the expiration date).

Congrats on just risking $20 for your first option instead of risking a huge amount. It might even be worth watching the option's value for the next couple weeks to see what happens when the price goes up/down, and how time value decay reduces the option's value as it gets closer to expiry.

With options, remember you're trading on the likelihood of the contract expiring in the money (and then the profits on the contract once it's ITM). Sometimes a bonkers options contract that realistically won't ever be ITM will go up in price because the likelihood of ITM at expiry has increased from 0.001% to 0.01%. That's why you may see far OTM options gain value for a short time if a stock rockets up."
2021-05-27 20:37:26,wallstreetbets,I only purchased one contract at $20 just to learn and gain experience. Could I sell my current call right now and still make money?
2021-05-27 20:48:00,wallstreetbets,What did you buy it at?
2021-05-27 23:04:08,wallstreetbets,FUBO was at like $22

Not financial advice just what I'm planning to do. Sold a couple today too recover my initial and then some extra. Just in case... But the rest is sitting there until the week of the expiration.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,MYOV-Very Undervalued given its deal with Pfizer MYOV Market Cap is about $2 Billion.  Pfizer recently did a $4.2 Billion partnership deal with MYOV for essentially 50% of their drug for which they now have an additional approval for women's fibroid.  This is a very undervalued stock and will be a very nice long term bet IMHO.  Do your own due diligence.  They have lots of cash and will likely add another $250 million by end of this year from milestone payments.  Both MYOV and Pfizer will be selling their drugs.

2021-05-27 22:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Not... everyone
My AMC buy was $16.14 but my GME buy was $341

I put equal buying weight between them so I'm up just 10% after holding all this time... so far"
2021-05-27 22:29:00,wallstreetbets,Bag holding @ $11.92. I should have averaged down then i could have cashed out and dumped more into the rockstars!
2021-05-27 22:29:04,wallstreetbets,Just bought more BB today after close 😂
2021-05-27 22:32:11,wallstreetbets,I wasnt losing money fast enough so I sold my shares and bought options.

2021-05-27 23:03:21,wallstreetbets,"I totally was going to go into BB in February, but for some reason I took AMC instead. But I do think BB is worth it long term."
2021-05-27 23:06:37,wallstreetbets,"BB to the moon, please help $27 average"

2021-05-27 23:39:21,wallstreetbets,Yep. Still bagholding BB from near the top. But I got to sell my much smaller AMC bags today for a profit so that was nice I guess.
2021-05-27 23:56:58,wallstreetbets,I sold my Blackberry like a week and a half ago and bought AMC. Was a great choice
2021-05-28 00:11:05,wallstreetbets,BB Is bae $500 a share coming soon

2021-05-28 00:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Besides my free Go Pro stock, I have 100% invested in either BB or GME like a true retard"
2021-05-28 01:42:46,wallstreetbets,"I sold all my BB to put into AMC literally on Monday, I just didn't have the cash to afford both. Im grateful I made the right choice but hurt I'm going to miss that BB surge. I had 35 shares at 11 dollars since March"

2021-05-28 06:31:26,wallstreetbets,Yep! Went all BB to avoid exchange fees in Canada and do BB.TO. In at $14 so not bad. Lol. But I still believe it’s a good long term play.

Thinking about cashing out at the end of the day because I think it will go down on Monday like it usually does.

I don't see this stonk as being worthy of holding like AMC, GME and NOK, just a side hustle really."
2021-05-28 11:00:17,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna buy BB later today.

2021-05-27 21:26:09,wallstreetbets,At $20 too and still holding. Am I doing it right?
2021-05-27 22:08:56,wallstreetbets,Mine is 14$ bucks. Hang in there Ape. BB time will come. AMC and GME is where most Ape family is.
2021-05-27 22:09:43,wallstreetbets,Bought in and holding @ $19. That was fun.
2021-05-28 00:41:56,wallstreetbets,Same story here brother. Stay strong and remember it's not a loss until you sell.

2021-05-28 11:44:41,wallstreetbets,70 shares at $15. Trying figure out what to do with ITM AMC calls that expire in Sept.
2021-05-27 20:31:57,wallstreetbets,"Unless you NEED that money, just hold. You'll get it back."
2021-05-27 21:16:43,wallstreetbets,You have to think about opportunity cost. If there's another play that you can potentially make it back on...is it really worth it to baghold?
2021-05-28 14:31:20,wallstreetbets,"Average down, and hold BB. 

Out of all these stocks, BB is the only one with legit, material growth potential due to it's business model anyways"
2021-05-28 10:25:02,wallstreetbets,Was working for me with AMC but about to get shares called away when things finally got juicy again. Made money but less
2021-05-28 10:53:59,wallstreetbets,I agree. They are headquartered in waterloo surrounded by tech industry like google and university funded accelerator centers. If this stock shoots up they have more than ample opportunity to find new ideas and tech to pivot about.
2021-05-27 20:11:14,wallstreetbets,"I hit that shit at like $25, I'm dead inside"

2021-05-27 21:29:25,wallstreetbets,"I moved the few shares I had in NOK to BB instead. NOK was trading far too flat for me and I didn’t see any massive changes in their distant future that could make a big difference.
BB on the other hand I could see potentially growing in the next few years if all the build up work for electric cars eventually pays off."
2021-05-28 00:30:20,wallstreetbets,Monthlies expiring Jun 18. I’m about to scoop of some leaps when market opens. Should still be decently cheap
2021-05-28 00:42:05,wallstreetbets,🤔. Hell yea. Finna print

2021-05-27 21:42:26,wallstreetbets,"If I knew of a play that could make me 100% I’d take it, however trading options isn’t that simple when your life savings are depending on it"

2021-05-28 00:10:05,wallstreetbets,same at 14
2021-05-28 01:20:21,wallstreetbets,There's something mind boggling about buying bb at 18 but not when it was at 8.

2021-05-27 20:37:33,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the only way people end up winning big on the stock market is through options. Everyone always preaches this buy and hold bullshit, but the real money is in options. The real loss is in options too which is why I don't play them."

2021-05-28 03:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Curious how many time you've blown up over the years.  I know chasing momo didn't work too well for me, going back to the tech bubble days.  If everyone chased momo and got rich, we'd all be rich but clearly that isn't the case.
Plus, fading 6 sigma moves like the current AMC becomes very high probability setup.  Got limit orders to short at 32-34 range."

I escaped with $800 or sometimes it was pretty sad…I did learn not to let dating affect life choices/events though finally. Costly but worth it in my opinion."

2021-05-27 21:32:52,wallstreetbets,AMC changed people's lives up until the insane hyperinflation we're about to experience negates all of these gains and everyone becomes a poverty stricken millionaire.
2021-05-27 22:14:56,wallstreetbets,I did $10 call last month 50 contracts for 8500 bucks LOL if I did it longer than a stupid week and I put it out for a month and a half how much would that have turned into do you have any idea I ended up losing half my money and got out
2021-05-27 20:21:10,wallstreetbets,The 39s  went from .04 to $2 then just under $1 today.
2021-05-27 20:02:46,wallstreetbets,I think it's even more nuts your medical school loans cost that much then me winning that.

2021-05-27 21:13:50,wallstreetbets,"It ended up being 500,000 with the last 200 shares I was lucky enough to get the top. I'm okay with it though you never can get the bottom and hit the top perfectly."

2021-05-27 22:44:37,wallstreetbets,I bought calls saying the price was going to go up $2.80 in 3 days. Then I sold those after a couple hours when the price went up to 15 and bought $18 calls. Basically betting more money that the price was going to go up another $2.50 in 3 days. Luckily for me it went up 10 more dollars
2021-05-27 22:49:05,wallstreetbets,Na. Post pandemic me is more like the world of Warcraft guy from South Park drinking a mountain dew.
2021-05-27 22:51:18,wallstreetbets,Really I feel like covered calls is harder to understand than buying calls.. when you buy calls you don't need to collateral like when you sell them.. so if you buy $100 of calls that's the most you can lose.. you can win Infinity amount theoretically. The high risk reward.
2021-05-27 22:55:36,wallstreetbets,If shorts cover your golden... Even if it doesn't squeeze tomorrow hopefully Tuesday will open strong with good box office numbers from the memorial Day weekend.
2021-05-27 23:10:15,wallstreetbets,Sold when AMC hit 29.50
2021-05-27 23:08:08,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Maybe AMC will be up tomorrow
2021-05-27 23:15:42,wallstreetbets,Yes because I couldn't fit all on a screenshot. What you see on the bottom is the cashing/closing  of the first two plays. So between those two plays I bought it for 10K cashed out 19 those two combined.. I then rolled the 19k into the 15.50s.. then from there I rolled 38k into 460 k profit.

2021-05-28 07:19:17,wallstreetbets,Go to Sell / Trailing stop / pick a dollar amount you can live with losing and if the stock ever goes down that much it sells. In hindsight I would have had the stop loss on 5 of them it would have sold the 5 and kept 5 that went on to 30 this AM I would have made 58.5K.  just look at a 15 dollar call for today they are 11.70 × 5 = 58.5k but It sold because it dipped passed my stop loss so I is what it is.  sometimes you sell it goes up.  sometimes you hold it goes down.
2021-05-27 22:16:59,wallstreetbets,Poverty millionaires. I like the sound of that.

2021-05-27 23:05:53,wallstreetbets,"Ok that does make sense. I got so much to learn. I think its more of a gamble to buy calls though whereas selling covered calls does require me to own 100 shares its kind of hard to lose money with it. I think its also harder to predict if buying a call will make me money.

2021-05-27 23:01:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks I’m new to this but did some research and something about there trying to make it look like a short squeeze so they can get there shares back cheap. Also this is just a rumor but there saying that Amc could be 50$ to 100$ a share in weeks
2021-05-27 23:17:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah that makes waaaaayyyy more sense lol 😂
2021-05-28 11:11:39,wallstreetbets,the AMC $50 by the end of the day is that just a wild guess or you are based on some fundamental analysis or other indicators

2021-05-28 01:37:04,wallstreetbets,"I bought an AMC $11 LEAP like a month ago and sold poor man for $16 strike, bought the CC back for like $200 bucks and let it ride.  Just sold CC again for $32 when I saw the IV was 700% lol.  The CC premium for 6/4 covered my initial investment so if I lost the LEAP i'll be up $2100 which is fine with me.  Much better than when I blew my account up buying 100 call credit spreads and put credit spreads each on a day the market moved 2%."

2021-05-27 21:07:29,wallstreetbets,Can you explain this in more detail? Eventually some one is going to lose money.
2021-05-28 08:04:53,wallstreetbets,And if it’s as simple as multiplying 11.70 times 50 I am going to cry. So apes cry?
2021-05-28 07:58:43,wallstreetbets,Alright so if I did a 10 call at 1.74 for 50 contract for $8500 AND did it for 6 weeks(I did it one 4/27 and yesterday 5/27 it went to 29. If I sold those 50 contracts at 25 yesterday do you have any idea how much I possible could have made on that option call? Holding my breathe
2021-05-28 08:03:35,wallstreetbets,"Just commented and asked question in response to your help but did not put in reply. Can you look below your comment? I bought 50 contracts for $8500 on 4/27. It was expiring 4 days later. I messed up and if I did for 6 weeks. It was a 10 call plus 1.74 so break even was 11.70.  The stock was I think about 12. I it went do to like 10 something and I sold and lost half. If I did for extended time would my money have come back yesterday when it went up and if I sold at 25, any idea how much that option call would have turned into that I purchased 50 contracts at that time for 7500 bucks. Holding breath. Also how do u figure that number out? What are you multiplying?"
2021-05-27 23:54:43,wallstreetbets,Basically venezuela
2021-05-28 05:46:55,wallstreetbets,how much would you make if you sold at 30

2021-05-27 23:00:19,wallstreetbets,You must be new to Wall Street bets in the past 6 months because these posts are literally what Wall Street bets is... Big gains and big loss open on stupid plays.
2021-05-27 23:09:26,wallstreetbets,It is a gamble to buy calls. High risk reward but 90% of calls and worthless. Got lucky. Selling calls you can have a 90% success rate if they're farther enough out of the money
2021-05-27 23:11:41,wallstreetbets,The run-up is just people fomo buying. They're still over 100 million shares short and they need to buy it back still... So if retail can keep the pressure up it's costing hedge funds hundreds of millions of dollars a day.. if they break or get margin called it could definitely go to 50 or $100. They're able to hold it off expected to stay in the twenties and slowly lose excitement and go back down to the teens
2021-05-28 11:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Where did I say it was going to 50? I mean I think it can if shorts start covering. I don't know 100% if and when that will be though. I did buy $8,000 worth of $31 calls expiring today though."

2021-05-27 21:44:14,wallstreetbets,The market responds based on my purchases.  I buy puts and the stocks increase.  I buy calls and the stocks decrease.  I am all powerful.

2021-05-28 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,"Investipedia/google and youtube taught me pretty much everything i know. There's so much solid info on YouTube, I'd just Google options basics, or options greeks and just start reading and watching."
2021-05-27 20:34:34,wallstreetbets,In like 20 years
2021-05-28 13:45:17,wallstreetbets,"No, Google/Youtube will teach you. Look up basics of options or something similar"
2021-05-28 13:46:22,wallstreetbets,I think you meant to write r/ not u/
2021-05-28 14:10:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you won't make the same gains, you'll probably make more. You have a slim chance of succeeding with FDs, and an even smaller chance of making a lot of money. 

Statistically you're going to lose money with FDs, someone else has to take on the risk of assignment to give you those calls. Why would they risk losing a lot of money unless the chance of that was very small?"
2021-05-28 14:10:35,wallstreetbets,I view it as a form of teaching
2021-05-28 15:01:00,wallstreetbets,"You generally don't want to exercise, especially far from expiration. Part of an option contracts value is based on how much time it has left until expiration and the current Implied Volatility (IV) of the contract. These 2 things are known as extrinsic value, and are completely lost when the contract is exercised. As you get closer to expiration time value decays more and more until it hits zero at expiry. Basically you very rarely want to exercise contracts, especially ones far out in expiration. 

Some of this time value (often called Theta) goes away faster and faster each day closer to expiration, and really speeds up the last 30-45 days before expiration. This is called theta decay and it's a reason you often do not want to hold your calls until expiration unless you're very confident it'll go up even more.

So I'd generally recommend selling at least 30-45 days before expiration, and preferably when your contracts Implied Volatility (IV) is high. IV estimates how much the underlying stock will move in the future. If it's really low then not much move is expected and it's less likely your contracts will get ITM. If it's very high then it's expecting the possibility of very large moves in the underlying, which would make the contract more likely to get ITM. 

Now of course a super important metric in rather you should sell or not is the stock price. AMC is very weird because it's unpredictable. It might spike even higher tomorrow and you could make way more, or maybe it'll drop back towards where it's been, which would crush the IV and lower the value a lot. In my opinion i would sell considering you're up like 500% which is insane gains honestly. But I'm better at learning theoretical stuff than i am at actually trading, and with how wild AMC is, it's very hard to judge. I just think greed is very hard to get passed, and when you see huge gains your brain likes it and wants more. Basically you have to decide if the risk of keeping it is worth potentially losing all of these gains.

Another thing you could do is sell one of the contracts which should recoup the amount of money you paid for both contracts, so even if the other call becomes completely worthless you already covered your entry fee and hopefully made a little profit as well. 

Last thing, you can roll your calls. If you think they might be worth even more but you want more time value you can sell your calls and in the same trade buy 2 new calls further out in expiration. This works best when IV is high, because the further out in time the lower IV goes, so you'll sell your contract with a high IV and buy back a new one with lower (but still high) IV. For example, right now you could sell the Sept 17th 15c for 15.45 and then buy the Dec 17th 15c for 15.88, so you get 3 more months and more time value for 42 dollars. 

What I would do is at least sell one to recoup what you paid, and then do whatever u want with your ""free"" contract."
2021-05-27 20:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks for the tip. I'm still young and my serious long term investments are in a separate account. The $500 I started with was ""hey I heard about this options thing, let's give it a try."" Made $3k on my second trade buying Tesla calls last February and I've been addicted ever since. 

Though after my second day trade ban and not being able to trade for 90 I realized just how much the addiction was screwing with my mental health. So I decided to stop buying calls and start trading deep ITM credit spreads as that seemed less risky but then Amazon and Apple had a few bad weeks and I was down thousands."

2021-05-27 20:24:18,wallstreetbets,Dude the more I learn about options the more confusing it gets lol. The reason I never got into them was because of how easily they can be manipulated and having to worry about expiry dates etc.. too much hassle.. maybe one day I’ll get seriously into it but I know people who have lost a ton of money when they got “assigned” and blew up their accounts because of a bad option trade so it just always turned me off.. funny thing is u hear about winners here and there but no one really ever posts the losses which I’m confident outweigh the winners .

2021-05-28 00:17:35,wallstreetbets,"This is why I prefer percentages.  If OP only risked 5 or 10% of their total assets, that's a lot more believable than so many other people where 10k is 100% of their account.

What if for example it's less than 1% of their assets?  Not very exciting is it?  You can perform that risk 100 times on whatever meme is currently trending as oppose to once."
2021-05-27 21:22:00,wallstreetbets,I’m not even sure the probability even works out like that. If it’s a 2% chance of a “win” then let’s say 2% of the people taking the bet win. But the next bet you take is independent of the outcome of the first bet and so it doesn’t matter how you performed in the last bet

2021-05-28 19:12:20,wallstreetbets,"you're definitely not an idiot, everyone starts somewhere, and the only way to be knowledgeable is to at one point be ignorant.

Now, if you want to expand that knowledge and learn more go on youtube and just watch some videos on options or Google it if you prefer reading. Search for ""options greeks"" and also just look for a video on the basics of options. Once you get this you can watch so many videos about different options strategies like covered calls, spreads, cash secured puts, etc. 

 Best thing in my opinion to follow this up is to sign up for TDAmeritrade and download Think or Swim (TOS). If you then sign into paper trading It allows you to trade stocks and options just like you would normally, but the money is fake, so you can practice any strategy or test trades you think are good to see if you're right.

Casinos have millions of people playing, if your game, roulette for example, pays 36 times your bet but there are 37 numbers, this means your expectation of return is 36/37 or 97%. This means that on average, every time anybody plays, they get 3% of the bet. It will fluctuate over short timespans, but long term, they get their 3% guaranteed."

Like I want to learn, I really do, just to throw in 100 bucks whenever I can and casino this bitch but I ""kind of"" understand some terms but then when I try to apply it I don't see how to properly read an option or whatever.

Lets take his screenshot, one of the transaction says:

Buy to Open 692 contracts AMC May 28 2021  18 W calls @ $0.55 and a limit with the same amount after the @.

Im guessing THAT means something but just cant see it :c

cause if 692 contracts means how many stocks he bought, that means 692 x the stock amount, right?

so that doesnt add up in the slightest


edit:

So on further investigation, those 692 contracts were actually ""5 dollar calls"" basically saying he ""bet"" the stock was going to go up 5 dollars. And since the stock did, his actual amount of stock got like multiplied? how do you know how much it will multiply?

Sorry I suck at learning if im unable to bounce questions back and forth even if I sound dumb"
2021-05-27 22:12:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean so much depends on how much a stock is likely to move, the timeframe and your goals. It is really hard to just have one criteria. 

OP had a huge, consistent gain over a short period of time. If he'd bought the first option weeks ago those barely OTM would have expired worthless and been expensive. If it stayed flat you'd just watch your initial investment fade. 

So if you had say, projections of what the stock would do, you could plan it out, but nobody does exactly. This worked out extremely well but we're seeing the best stories and outcomes here (and the worst). Biggest thing is have a plan and figure out if you want small guarantees or if you really see something and think it'll happen within X."

The reason the options were as low as 0.55 when he bought, no sane person would INVEST in the **bet the price would go up** to $18 *in hours*. This autist, however.

Friday May 28 if AMC wasn't over 18 (or 18+0.55) his $38,000 buy would crater to $0.00 come Saturday."

2021-05-27 21:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. So, the amount you would pay isn’t the 15*100shares, it’s actually a premium that you would pay per 1 share (I can see rereading my original explanation that it could be misleading)

But we can run with the AMC example: AMC is at 26.51 at the writing of the comment, and a call option expiring June 4th @ 15$ is currently sitting at 12.05 per 1 share, BUT typically options are sold together for 100 shares, so buying 1 option contract would cost 1205 (12.05*100). Now your break even point would be sitting at 27.05 (15 strike price+12.05 premium)... the moment you’re above 27.06 you are making a profit. But you’re right in partially where you could exercise at 27.06 and make profit ((27.06-27.05)*100) to arrive at whatever your profit would be.

I’m using arbitrary numbers so also a rule of calls (which makes them particularly attractive to some) because your profit is virtually unlimited because the price of a stock could be infinite (theoretically).

I hope that makes more sense! Feel free to PM me if you need anymore explanation; sometimes there could be an ELI5 for finance but def do your own research because the stock market is inherently risky and options have a significantly higher level of risk! Be safe and do the DD!"
2021-05-27 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhhhh now I get it! I thought it was like a $0.35 charge per stock which made it look really a ttractive, but it’s a high stock premium. That’s why the numbers didn’t add up, it’s expensive lmao.

So let’s say I made the call for 15 and the stock lowered to 9, a call is the right to buy it so the only thing I’d be losing is the money for the call right? I’d be down maybe 500$ as opposed to 600$ 

Yikes that does sound kinda risky now that I typed that"

2021-05-27 22:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that was bad explanation on my end! Sorry for any confusion. 

And you’re correct in your thinking, it provides the OPTION vs an OBLIGATION... so, you can exercise the option at any time, but you’re not required to. If the call with a strike is at 15, but the stock drops to 9... you would be considered ‘out of the money’ meaning you wouldn’t be making any money by exercising and your max loss would be the (premium of the contract*# of contracts), and wouldn’t make sense to exercise using a call to buy a share @ 15 when you could buy it for 9 without the option! 

Options are a great way to make a lot of money... but also a great way to lose a lot of menu. I’m not a financial advisor but most will tell you that you want to ‘play’/invest money you’d be okay with losing because nothing is guaranteed (even when the market is pretty hot/has been hot)"

Let me explain how insane that is.

AMC has a market cap of almost $12billion dollars

With 450 million shares 

12 billion market cap divided by 450 million shares gets you your share price of $26


You need an extra $11,000,000,000 (billion) dollars invested to reach a price of $51 

You need  $225,000,000,000,000 (trillion) to reach a price of $500k per share.

2021-05-27 20:06:48,wallstreetbets,Okay so I’ve had my amc shared for about 6 months now bought them during the GME squeeze when do I sell? It’s up at 20 a share pretty much I bought at 6-7 a share should I call it and take the gain or should I wait? Maybe it’ll keep going up?
2021-05-27 20:12:20,wallstreetbets,Well done
2021-05-27 20:39:16,wallstreetbets,"Good luck! I’m in for $40,000 average cost $14.08. Don’t sell Friday!🦍🍌🚀🌚"
2021-05-27 20:41:51,wallstreetbets,I got in at $11....for 100 shares.  Wish I'd bought 50k more :D
2021-05-27 20:58:50,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand the comments. This is not nearly the top. GME was also $25 at one point.
2021-05-27 21:03:30,wallstreetbets,"I bought 500 more shares today on the dip, will do the same at open if it opens below $25. Cost average $17 now"

2021-05-27 20:03:32,wallstreetbets,I know you haven’t lost big to the point where you can’t recover yet. Because an event like that will instantly put a stop to an investor’s all-in yolo plays. Nevertheless I hope you win big. Just be super careful and good luck. To the moon! 🚀🌙💰

2021-05-27 23:30:30,wallstreetbets,My friend when amc tanks before the big short squeeze don’t sell. Hold that shit and let your emotions go. Putting all your savings into a stock can get rough when it starts going down. But this is part of the plan the game is set in motion we wait and we hold and buy. Because this is the ape market. Diamond hands!
2021-05-27 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,Bought 27 shares when it went up to like 17$ dollars.. I’m glad I took my advice and bought high and sold low. I’m doing it again
2021-05-27 23:37:16,wallstreetbets,You aren’t supposed to buy high
2021-05-27 23:37:41,wallstreetbets,Reckless lol

2021-05-27 23:56:40,wallstreetbets,Awesome!!!! Now transfer to Fidelity or Schwab so you dont have any shenanigans with Robinhood once it squeezes. Just my opinion.

2021-05-28 00:56:52,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $14 back in February when Robinhood was blocking us from buying, and I bought it once it was available. I kept on losing money for MONTHS, so I told my shares this week once they hit the same price so I broke even, and I’m kicking myself now."
2021-05-28 01:04:10,wallstreetbets,Damn I bought into AMC in January and sold sometime in Feb when price went down... I feel bad

2021-05-28 03:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Good luck and may Hecate bless, but please remember not to invest any more than you can afford to lose!"

2021-05-28 17:05:41,wallstreetbets,"Well we're movin' on up, To the AMC side. To a deluxe lambo in the sky. Movin' on up. To the AMC side. We finally got a piece of the pie. Fish don't fry in the kitchen; Beans don't burn on the grill. Took a whole lotta GME. Just to get up that hill. Now we're up in the big leagues.  Gettin' our turn at bat.  As long as we live, it's you and me baby"
2021-05-27 20:49:17,wallstreetbets,Hope you sold
2021-05-27 23:32:41,wallstreetbets,You will need luck because you are gambling
2021-05-28 07:44:45,wallstreetbets,WOOF - Petco is severely undervalued at $23.00 with super earnings. Big short position makes this a short squeeze candidate. Even more so than AMC or GME
2021-05-28 02:37:30,wallstreetbets,"I asked my boss if he was in. 

He bought in the 8’s... but sold. Hahahaha

I’m so done working for someone else."
2021-05-28 01:38:58,wallstreetbets,"I fucking sold all my AMC and GME on Monday.. literally right before this... In an idiot lmao

Moved it into SPCE so I guess it wasn't the worst decision I've made"

2021-05-28 02:55:34,wallstreetbets,Same - I bought 1100 shares back then. 😳
2021-05-28 04:38:11,wallstreetbets,If you forgot you had 500 shares lying around I dont think you are in desperate need for money lol.
2021-05-28 17:46:30,wallstreetbets,Oh look a regular Daddy Warbucks over here.

Happy now that I didn't cut my losses"
2021-05-27 22:01:00,wallstreetbets,My average is $19 😬😂
2021-05-27 22:51:35,wallstreetbets,My cost basis is 20.50 per share...
2021-05-28 05:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Wow. You're more than 100% up and you need a confidence boost? 

Apes need to CHILL."
2021-05-27 21:48:10,wallstreetbets,"$16.14 for me, what's made it more emotional is that my son asked about what I was doing and put his birthday money (2 shares) in along with my buy

Felt crappy when it tanked, but feels great now

He's told me if it 2x es and starts going sideways to dump one and get his initial investment out, but if it shows steady growth not to sell until 5x  

He's probably more likely to end up in profit than me who'll probably never even sell due to fomo lol"
2021-05-27 20:31:31,wallstreetbets,What do you use to invest?

2021-05-27 21:14:26,wallstreetbets,Where do you expect the stock to go?
2021-05-27 21:06:03,wallstreetbets,700k shares is not long. Thats a laughable position that will get eaten up in 5 mins with AMC's type of volume from someone like Citadel.
2021-05-27 21:08:24,wallstreetbets,Hasn't even happened yet
2021-05-27 20:51:42,wallstreetbets,I want to throw all my money into forgotten stonks. That’s where the real money is. Seriously tho

2021-05-28 01:08:39,wallstreetbets,"Your math is a bit off. He said 500 shares bought at $3 but the current price for each share is $26.51 . So he forgot he had over $13,000 worth of stock laying around ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|surprise)"
2021-05-27 20:11:36,wallstreetbets,"Me too mate, Im happy that Ive kept it in GME, but wish I'd bought less fucking coffees and bought AMC instead."

never to late to jump back in retard! 🦍"
2021-05-27 21:24:04,wallstreetbets,I sold mine back at $15. Kicking myself meow for it
2021-05-27 20:23:12,wallstreetbets,Honestly? Because movies are coming back in a big way. Their revenue is going to continue and there’s not the push for new theatre tech like 3D and shit and won’t be for a while. Their overheads are low in the medium term.
2021-05-27 21:18:21,wallstreetbets,$13.59 and I felt like I paid too much. Now I  glad I jumped on.
2021-05-27 21:52:18,wallstreetbets,"I think you mean ""meme like a Chimp"""
2021-05-28 03:59:25,wallstreetbets,"I got in at $17.

Ohhh...you‘re talking about $AMC not $GME. So yeah, crazy times. Hahaha"
2021-05-28 01:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Same here ,I'm selling them today"
2021-05-27 20:01:17,wallstreetbets,7.70 here!
2021-05-27 20:21:38,wallstreetbets,Proud holder of 5 shares at $9. I will never sell! Lmao
2021-05-27 20:10:45,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah! I grabbed 150 at $20 this morning. Might grab some more tomorrow.
2021-05-28 07:30:02,wallstreetbets,"I’d sell at least 25% after open. It is likely to rise on buys quickly and the revert back down. It might squeeze, sure, but it also might not—each stock you sell now is 5x gain, which is too good to pass upon though"
2021-05-28 07:14:12,wallstreetbets,*what the fuck*
2021-05-27 21:11:58,wallstreetbets,THIS.
2021-05-28 08:23:25,wallstreetbets,Too bad no matter what I do Fidelity won't give me level 2 options
2021-05-28 08:54:25,wallstreetbets,Their beta approach Fidelity is looking pretty nice now as well. Much cleaner than it used to be only a few months ago. It’s nice that they even have a big button so users can submit suggestions for what they want to see with the app.
2021-05-27 22:14:48,wallstreetbets,"You're thinking of Mike Brown.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael\_E.\_Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Brown)"
2021-05-27 23:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Considering AMC had been trading sideways for months since the spike in January and has been shambling at 9-11 bucks or so for sooooo fucking long. 

And now people wanna yolo when it's spiking again when a better time would've been before the current spike. 

My only regret is not buying more when it dipped to 9."
2021-05-28 10:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Pretty amazing run AMC is having, but it doesn't change the fact in the last 3 months it was half the price and OP could have doubled his position. Either way, I'm glad he didn't get burned, I'm surprised that comment got so many up votes"
2021-05-27 21:19:51,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t mean it’s not fundamentally overvalued at the current price.
2021-05-27 20:56:51,wallstreetbets,But you did
2021-05-28 00:28:44,wallstreetbets,You have an interesting investment strategy
2021-05-27 20:25:06,wallstreetbets,Also sus
2021-05-28 00:12:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah I started trading with a few hundred bucks just to practice and not get burned and this is an early lesson. I finally made back what I lost but I would’ve doubled my money if I had just let it be lol
2021-05-28 01:58:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh, so the best way is to buy when it’s low, then sell when it’s high?

Wow thanks for this information."
2021-05-28 09:15:43,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty fiscally irresponsible to just “forget” where you put a month of rent
2021-05-28 01:59:27,wallstreetbets,"I meant, like, while it was still at $3."
2021-05-28 00:13:05,wallstreetbets,I literally held shares because a stranger on rocket league said it might be good idea
2021-05-27 20:49:22,wallstreetbets,She said yes multiple times to me.
2021-05-27 21:36:40,wallstreetbets,All she said to me was mmfrnnff!
2021-05-28 07:27:32,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness, one of best quotes I heard last week was this praise thrown at a successful investor: “he knew when to make the toughest move: not doubling down, but doubling up, and further investing in winners as they continue rising”"
2021-05-27 20:12:53,wallstreetbets,I feel like an idiot bought 90 shares at 5 sold at 10
2021-05-27 20:29:59,wallstreetbets,Bought in at 16 4 months back and just held because you only loose If you sell.. glad I didn't sell
2021-05-27 21:25:40,wallstreetbets,I wish I bought more even at $13.59. Only have 20 shares.
2021-05-28 02:13:12,wallstreetbets,"It’ll stop whenever I buy. Thought about buying in at 10, 13, and 17 a couple days ago. If I go in at 26 tomorrow it will instantly drop. I’m cursed I swear."
2021-05-28 09:34:12,wallstreetbets,Ameritrade did some FUD with GME in the past.
2021-05-28 14:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Zero fees for OTC trades, plus TD places restrictions, Fidelity didnt"
2021-05-28 04:12:28,wallstreetbets,lol most brokerages also blocked buying not just Robinhood
2021-05-27 21:05:25,wallstreetbets,"Me too, I sold today at +105%.
I put in the sell at $26 thinking ""There ain't no way..."""
2021-05-27 21:53:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah volume was nuts. Great to see this back in discussion and more so, in Green!"
2021-05-27 22:01:27,wallstreetbets,"Sure, that’s true, but it isn’t overvalued In my
Opinion."
2021-05-27 20:58:01,wallstreetbets,I officially reclaim my award.
2021-05-28 09:19:53,wallstreetbets,"Think about it... you might be buying and selling in a portfolio that is 200k, 500k, 1M...

It’s not some huge deal that you dropped $1500 on a meme gamble and forgot about it, it’s not like it’s some real investment, it’s a meme war with shorts and the amount is entirely relative to how much you have."
2021-05-28 00:58:38,wallstreetbets,"Theres been a MURDER, in SAVANNAH"

2021-05-27 20:06:22,wallstreetbets,It’s never enough
2021-05-27 20:35:10,wallstreetbets,Close to same. My biggest regret is not buying more at that price
2021-05-27 22:09:52,wallstreetbets,I first got in at 7 something then at 11. I bought more today at 18.99 and just put in another 2100 at 26 something. Hope this shit takes off!! Good luck to all!
2021-05-27 20:44:01,wallstreetbets,You need to call them sir. ASAP

2021-05-28 11:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Agree with what you said there but just an observation that at the moment GME is down and AMC up strongly. Just not sure how linked they are at this point. Also wonder, based on this observation, if folks are going to ring the AMC register and reload on GME."
2021-05-27 20:49:37,wallstreetbets,Why so urgently?
2021-05-27 22:48:15,wallstreetbets,"I mean, they have bots posting all over about where to sell.

They're in the process of damage control.

There are a lot of different hedge funds and they are obviously not all trapped.

But *someone* is, and they're trying to dictate where the ceiling is."

2021-05-27 21:07:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol or not, I mean it’s only been over 2 weeks, right? I started my transfer last week and it completed today. It was suppose to be completed yesterday but RH told fidelity that I had transactions pending on my debit card (which is complete bs I haven’t used that debit card in over a month) so it was going to delay the transfer till next week Wednesday but woke up this morning to the transfer being completed. 

I think they were trying to buy my shares at a cheaper price before transferring my account but realized this baby isn’t going down anytime soon so they aborted mission and just transferred my account while it was still at $17."
2021-05-28 05:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Nice, my  5 shares are waiting for the moon"
2021-05-27 22:12:50,wallstreetbets,I was only asking. Didn’t know if it was something on Fidelty’s end.
2021-05-27 21:21:19,wallstreetbets,So you have no idea wtf you're talking about but you're spewing shit about voting
2021-05-28 00:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Oh ok. Yeah no, it’s most definitely on RH end. You should call fidelity and ask to see what the issue is."
2021-05-28 00:12:02,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-05-28 04:55:04,wallstreetbets,I think they were transparent about not being sure. Do you know how I can vote? I think that info would help the cause.

This bonehead, tried picking it up and cut his hedges with it, but he didn’t have a snazzy pole like this. Well it cut off his hand, or something like that. He sued the maker of the mowers and in the end. He won and got paid. And All the lawnmower makers added that little sticker.

2021-05-28 09:35:57,wallstreetbets,I have to apologize. I was going for a comment chain where people keep commenting successively higher numbers that it can hold.  That backfired. To be honest I have no idea about the bars.  But my general thoughts looking at it now are that tensile force isn’t going to be the same on the entire bar so we’d have to get into how strong it is in that particular scenario.

2021-05-27 20:19:15,wallstreetbets,How do you push out the expiration?
2021-05-27 22:29:09,wallstreetbets,"It's not being caused by shorts covering. It's primarily the result of T35 FTDs on Monday, followed by T21 FTDs on Tuesday. There's also gamma ramping, and then you can sprinkle some fomo at this point too."
2021-05-27 20:22:25,wallstreetbets,Buy to close and sell to open.
2021-05-27 20:03:20,wallstreetbets,"What if it goes nuclear then settles at $1,200 range, post squeeze, based on the e-commerce model?

How would your bet play out then?

That’s how i see this playing out."
2021-05-27 23:30:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes those FTD's are causing forced buying but this amount of price movement I don't think is just them.  It is much more a huge influx of new buyers.  On the days GME surges there are too many trades for it to just be FTD's, IMO.  I'm curious what the new data will show but it has been trending down over time.

In any case GME just has to not be above $300 for an entire month for my bet to pay off.  As I said, longs can make money and so can I at the same time in theory."
2021-05-27 20:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Si is self-reported, though.

I wonder, does the fine for misrepresenting the SI cost more or less than being squeezed out of >100% SI?

Isn’t it obvious that these firms would rather pay the fine than expose their shorts?

That said, I think you’re play has legs. Godspeed."
2021-05-27 20:21:59,wallstreetbets,I lose 50k.
2021-05-27 21:54:03,wallstreetbets,"Worth adding though, IMO that is basically impossible in a one month span from B&M retailer to ecommerce giant."
2021-05-28 07:59:39,wallstreetbets,"It's a bold move, but you're right about longs making money and the potential for you to as well. At some point the bear spread is going to work. 

Of course if you'd bought shares with that 50k you'd already be up about $9k or so. Your max profit with your spread is $7600 and potential loss of $50k. Good luck."
2021-05-27 20:25:20,wallstreetbets,"I think even if it were quite large it might even help my bet.  Instead of a slow squeeze, after the recall it will be very high briefly, then crash like Jan or the VW squeeze.

There is room for a long and short play here IMO."
2021-05-28 00:14:40,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your view. The point of playing this way is to let most of the diamond hand retards let them expire past temporary peaks. 

I get risk mitigation but this is Wall Street bets not Wall Street income gains."
2021-05-28 08:01:02,wallstreetbets,Fair. You seem to have calculated this move as best you could. I hope it prints for you.
2021-05-28 08:25:02,wallstreetbets,"This is true.  But the problem with the long situation, at least for me, is that it's very hard for me to gauge when it peaks.  It could keep going, it may not, how to set an exit price for something when fundamental valuation is irrelevant?  So while it's true that in hindsight I would have made money I had no idea how high it could go and I have to accept that with my style I'm going to miss a lot of things like dog coin, BC, etc.

I feel like longer the time horizon though, the more likely it becomes that things settle down and generally I feel confident about overall direction.  I still have the option to simply move the expiration forward and actually increase total premiums gained."
2021-05-28 01:07:31,wallstreetbets,😂 you have a point.

The websites were mma websites so I'm not sure the thoroughness of the sources. But the explanation on all the sources are that It is not exactly known what disorder Hasbulla Magomedov has that caused his stature to resemble that of a child. The most common cause behind the occurrence is Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD), popularly known as dwarfism.

I did have a handful of co-workers (going back two years) who were Afghan—interpreters moved to The States mostly—who would joke about the not-fully okay good life of settling into an apartment in Tajikistan where the rental would be cheap and a nice, uh, housemaid would come with it.  They didn't raise any issue about understanding her.  That's even though the guys in question were all Dari/Farsi-literate but really native speakers of Pashto.  Their perspectives may have not been fully informed, or maybe something upstaged communication for their main focus. Friendly guys for sure; not the most notorious for their respect for women.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"

2021-05-27 23:42:22,wallstreetbets,"Ok actually, if the price of GME goes to infinity, it's capped by the asset balance of short holders divided by the number of shares that are short.

Basically you can't force a hedge fund with 100 million in the bank that's short 1,000 shares of GME to buy those shares at 100,000 dollars each. The math doesn't add up.

The money to buy those shares needs to come from someplace."

2021-05-28 08:12:11,wallstreetbets,Around 1.5M per share would wipe out the entire wealth of the US. 10% of US wealth would be around 145k/share. But people will sell before the peak and after the peak so it is possible that someone could sell at peak for something crazy 10M+

There were like three congressional hearings, some billboards, negative Robinhood reviews, and that’s about it. Now the entire public is on notice that the rules of the game will be changed again if a squeeze looks likely to happen. No one who isn’t a bagholder is going to have any sympathy this time around. We’re just patiently waiting for the cultists to die out or see the light.

The Etoro math is a fantasy btw, so the entire premise of there being some popular uprising by millions of shareholders is flawed."

The union aspect is a poison pill and while there are enough votes to get it out of committee, there don’t appear to be enough to pass it through both houses. If the Democrats are willing to waive it, it might pass quickly, but if not then it will take a while. I’m sure Harry is counting the votes currently.

I wish the legislation was aimed at supporting the new big 3 (TSLA, GM, F) as it would gain more support than just targeting GM who’s EV’s are either too expensive (Hummer) or shit (Bolt). Just drop the union element and raise the sticker to $100k."

2021-05-27 21:49:42,wallstreetbets,"Possibly unpopular opinion on here: if you're new to investing, your smartest investment is index funds for steady long term gains that build wealth. 95% of what I'm in right now is FLCNX in my 401(k) or VUG (vanguard growth ETF) for individual. Even experienced traders have difficulty beating index funds. Seeing massive gains in here can be misleading because of survivorship bias: they often (with exceptions) also have massive losses from high risk trading strategies like buying options that can average out to a loss. Focus first on investing in the overall market to study patterns in it and help you become a better investor.

What OP used were stock options which act like a multiplier on gains, or losses. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp  
  
options have larger risks, if the option is not ""in the money"" at its expiry date, it expires worthless. This is unlike securities which you can just hold until they regain their value."

2021-05-27 20:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Much lower than I’m suggesting? Don’t think so. SNDL has a ton of assets mark to mark that are undervalued just like equipment isn’t marked at liquidation value, obviously. Sundial has passive equity and preferred debt stakes in many weed companies that aren’t accurately priced since 3/31/21. Everything I said is 100% correct. Sundial will heavily reward buyers at this level imo. Do what you want"

2021-05-28 02:29:21,wallstreetbets,"VW (at least in Germany) is being viewed as the bad guy. Many big celebs have moved away from them. Also, there was a Report in some newspaper that their technological progress in terms of batteries and EVs in general is worse than the progress of their counterparts (Mercedes, Toyota,..). They are making cool EVs now (ID.3 is I think pretty successful) but i personally doubt that they can continue the leadership they held in the past. 
Also, they still have lawsuits to deal with because of their diesel scandal here in the EU. In general, their reputation here in Germany is significantly damaged. 

I could be wrong, I now. History has told us that you should never underestimate VW but this time, I don’t know."

2021-05-28 00:57:37,wallstreetbets,"It's 15"" smaller than Corolla. So wtf are you talking about? And European models have smaller engine and make lower power. It makes a ton of difference on acceleration to merge into traffic."

And then I bought some more as they were about to announce the flight. The flight got delayed and stock crashed🤬🤬! If i only waited a couple of more weeks, I could buy in low 20s! With premiums from puts and calls my average cost is below $40... this time I am playing more conservative 😀"

2021-05-27 20:59:19,wallstreetbets,"They're at least buying calls to hedge their positions. That puts them on a time limit according to the expiration date.

People like the stock, but it had serious downward momentum. So once it kind of bottomed out, and hugged resistance, buyers returned.   


It's also interesting that the bottom was roughly right around a market cap that equals the sum of their cash on hand and short term investments.... So basically, it found a bottom and bounced. And hopefully, it continues."

2021-05-28 02:16:22,wallstreetbets,I have a hard time understanding expensive multiples... Like how does $SHOP justify its insane premium if not expected future cash flows. Even then it’s tough. Granted it’s a meme stock but $TSLA would have to make do like 30% CAGR on EBITDA for like 25 years to justify.
2021-05-28 08:01:17,wallstreetbets,It's two different things.  First is what the company is worth or will be worth in x amount of time.  This is based on their market cap vs earnings.  Second is just straight up what someone is willing to pay for them.  The difference is the premium.  Premiums can be justified by your investment time frame but can be effected by the hype or fud around the company.

I'm just not wrong here. If I had said ""this is the very top and you bought at the very top,"" I'd be wrong. But that's not what I said. I said ""this is a really bad spot to enter."" And one green day doesn't make me wrong on that. I still believe yesterday was a terrible, terrible time to enter AMC.

You gotta stop thinking intraday and actually start considering the big picture. 

If he sells today and makes money, good on him. But I'd wager good money that he'll end up selling for a loss, because he picked a really bad time to enter AMC. It's nearing the top of a euphoria bubble."

2021-05-28 07:59:27,wallstreetbets,">I’m not in AMC but all you seem to do is talk down on AMC and GME and not provide any counter DD as to why or show positions on shorts or puts.

Because I've made a lot of money shorting both. Everytime it rallies like this week, I short and make money. Every time.

It's my current strategy. And this is a stock market sub, so I post about my strategies.

>I’m not in AMC but all you seem to do is talk down on AMC and GME and not provide any counter DD as to why or show positions on shorts or puts.

Uh huh, and 99% of this sub does the opposite, posting AMC and GME and emojis, with no DD. Do you go stalk them as well, telling them their comments aged like milk every red day? 

You don't, of course, because you're just biased. Just say that, it's easier. 

I think that's all the time I have for this conversation, weird guy who went through my post history to respond to a comment from yesterday."

2021-05-28 08:20:08,wallstreetbets,That you’ve made all this money shorting AMC and you time the markets perfect. If you short after a run and told this guy that 19 was a bad entry point then surely you shorted at 19 if you were bearish?

this data shows that in 2019, there were 39 fatal crashes involving a Tesla, Cadillac CT6 shows 5 for that same year (GM supercruise), Mercedes-benz cla and gla class show 8 (distronic plus), nissan propilot vehicles would be too young to be on the 2019 data.

There are probably also more teslas tooling around than the rest, so i should probably do a statistical analysis on that.

2021-05-27 20:37:42,wallstreetbets,"This.

Workday is leaps and bounds better than what we transitioned FROM. Personally, I think it's intuitive, user friendly, big stupid buttons (tiles), and I've never once needed to consult HRIS analysts or help documentation to find something. Going on 4 years managing staff and hiring via Workday.

Those who hate Workday, please tell me what you've used that's so much better and what makes it better."
2021-05-27 21:17:58,wallstreetbets,At my company we can’t get mid management to learn how to use it.
2021-05-28 00:36:35,wallstreetbets,Boo! CB rocks!
2021-05-28 04:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Before workday we submitted timesheets as excel spreadsheets. That was better. The app is slow, and it feels clunky."
2021-05-28 08:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Jira is just slow and sometimes clunky. Overall not the worst app on the planet, but they feel 5 years behind at least when compared to top-end engineered products.

Like how you transition ticket statuses or try to change an issue's type and the screens can just refresh randomly.

Or try doing a bulk or certain action on items and Jira takes you to the completely wrong screen afterwards.

Good luck when stuff doesn't work the way you want or expect, or you made some kind of error by mistake. Atlassian's response to the majority of issues is really, truly lacking from a support and UX side."
2021-05-27 22:33:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, have had colleagues that can’t figure it out (don’t even try) but then bitch about how bad it sucks. Like just fucking put in Minimal effort. Fuck man"
2021-05-28 07:05:31,wallstreetbets,Oh man. U want me some deviled eggs!!
2021-05-28 10:53:19,wallstreetbets,"That's really odd. Verifying time for my workers takes 30 seconds each, submitting my own time for the week takes 30 seconds.

Two clicks from the home page and I'm on my time sheet for the week, click Actions drop-down menu on the right, Auto-fill from Schedule, check off any days that are holiday or I'm taking PTO, and a few more clicks and my time is in for the week.

Granted some of my employees are required to be more granular to allocate 1hr towards this project, 4hrs towards another project, but I also have salaried employees like myself that just do the 8hrs/day Auto-fill from Schedule option.

So, from my perspective, I'm not sure how the process is any worse than an excel spreadsheet.

If it's a shared spreadsheet, isn't it susceptible to others mistakenly overwriting areas they're not supposed to, or submitting time on someone else's behalf when they think they're on their own line for their submittal? If it's individual spreadsheets that sounds like a mess of files to weed through.

Edit: I can't even imagine what trying to recreate that allocating hours towards projects part would look like in Excel. You would have to define a drop-down to select from projects, and in our case that's a list of over 50. Not to mention the ability to report you worked X hours from another state which is important to Payroll. Excel may be fine for a company of 50 total employees, but when you start venturing into the thousands of employees... it really doesn't get any better than Workday."
