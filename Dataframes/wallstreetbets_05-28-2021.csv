2021-05-28 17:47:37,wallstreetbets,I think drafting a kicker or defense in the first round is a big dick energy kind of move.
2021-05-28 18:00:49,wallstreetbets,12 contracts at $52 strike   avg cost 60 cents   (Bought 10 at 54 cents but bought two more today)
2021-05-28 18:00:13,wallstreetbets,i agree with you bud. i hold DKings too and i‚Äôm in it for long haul. this thing will be well over 100
2021-05-28 18:07:08,wallstreetbets,My mind is blown. You‚Äôre literally gambling on gambling stocks.
2021-05-28 17:54:07,wallstreetbets,I was thinking about this too mainly because sports should be back to normal in the next year so I assumed betting would go back to sports and maybe less on stocks.
2021-05-28 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,Position?
2021-05-28 17:45:21,wallstreetbets,Yea it seems like it‚Äôs ready to go. Got my 55 Calls two days ago

2021-05-28 19:21:02,wallstreetbets,Is it February 30th 2021 again *already*?
2021-05-28 17:17:18,wallstreetbets,I buy things and then I sell them sometimes.
2021-05-28 19:12:46,wallstreetbets,If they expire eod you need to fucking sell that shit immediately if its green. Especially after a huge opening spike.
2021-05-28 18:18:54,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúHe was hopeful‚Äù 
1.hope is not a plan.  
2. He doesn‚Äôt need all 3 strikes for same day, next time he should buy the $27‚Äôs and the $28‚Äôs for the following month (more time higher strike) it should cost the same as he paid for the $28‚Äôs or $29‚Äôs he bought
3. Buying just b4 a long weekend is a bad idea almost every time, if you want weeklies you get 7 days but 3 of those days the mkt is closed, wasted $$"
2021-05-28 17:48:12,wallstreetbets,"Need to get out gradually. If you are up 100% realize you can sell half and the rest are profit. Takes a lot of pressure off the trade. If you only have 1 contract, you‚Äôre playing too big for your account. Take your gains and be happy."
2021-05-28 17:29:56,wallstreetbets,Sell an hour after open...
2021-05-28 17:20:55,wallstreetbets,Just use stop losses. If you've got a massive run up on options on a meme stock why not just set a stop loss for a % of profits.  For instance: You pay .15 / contract and it balloons to .50 then set a stop loss for like .30 and walk away.  If it shits itself like today you make out with 100% profits and if it continues to run then you make more.
2021-05-28 17:22:35,wallstreetbets,"FD or 1 to 2 day expiration are hard to manage...I learned a few lessons, and now look 45+ days out...if you are going to do it, suggest buying Tue to Thur...sell Friday hour after open or so...not a financial advisor"
2021-05-28 17:57:21,wallstreetbets,"What is the difference between a bull and a pig?

A bull believes the stock will rise because reasons.

A pig wants the stock to rise because profits.

The markets abound with good people who need profits and bad people with ultra solid DD. Let that sink in.

If you want to retain your humanity you must always remember that this is the worlds greatest mind game. If you play from your heart you'll go broke real fast. 

Calm your emotions, focus your mind and be satisfied with less."
2021-05-28 17:25:33,wallstreetbets,"When the IV increases and its green, sell."
2021-05-28 17:33:21,wallstreetbets,Close when you‚Äôd rather have the cash than the position.
2021-05-28 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,"sell the calls when you get that 'oh sheet, so much money feeling'.  It your still want to take part in any continuation take the profits and buy stock of the underlying.This keeps skin in the game but keeps you from getting completely cucked."
2021-05-28 17:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Imagine the things you can do when you take profit and keep the money... Then imagine yourself where you lost it all... can you handle it? 

Holding a position is a matter of conviction, so if you don't have it and you're lucky enough to make gainz, take the profit and call it a day."
2021-05-28 18:38:13,wallstreetbets,"Ive been a lurker for a while and just being lurker status im sad to see all the ""ape"" bullshit on WSB. jesus christ. Even i know its never been ape.....its retards. Its not bananas. Its tendies. Fuck"

2021-05-28 19:35:03,wallstreetbets,"same with my GME call this morning, could have sold it at the top but it never came back up so I got nothin.

its situational, make a decision based on what information you have in front of you. 

Its better to make money than lose it."
2021-05-28 19:36:11,wallstreetbets,This is good info. I‚Äôm sure of my $24 put expiring on the 4th now.
2021-05-28 17:20:16,wallstreetbets,Runs on Friday close are highly unlike for AMC. Shitadel would start throwing kitchen sinks at you to keep it low. They are already balancing on the edge.
2021-05-28 17:44:39,wallstreetbets,"I usually sell enough of my contracts to make my initial investment back, and whatever is still going I just let them run on pure profit. It‚Äôs always a good day when you have to decide how much money you want to make instead of if you‚Äôre going to make money."
2021-05-28 18:05:34,wallstreetbets,Asking for a friend
2021-05-28 19:54:00,wallstreetbets,Options expiring that soon are only for scalping.
2021-05-28 17:49:30,wallstreetbets,Bulls make money. Bears make money. Pigs get slaughtered. Apes hold and play with their bananas. Choose one.
2021-05-28 18:24:52,wallstreetbets,Don't calls have OCO order like stocks? Asking for a friend.

Theta gang for life."
2021-05-28 18:57:58,wallstreetbets,I only understood the first half of that sentence.
2021-05-28 19:14:19,wallstreetbets,So true. Lesson fucking learned. Chasing more gains and greed fucked me over.
2021-05-28 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,That what I did with my Nokia contracts. Sold half my contracts and got my initial initial investment back. Hope Nokia keeps popping off
2021-05-28 18:56:37,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.  You're never wrong if you take profit from your trades.  If you miss out on the absolute top but still make money then you still win.  Best thing to do is to have a strategy and stick to it, and there's plenty of apes that will sell calls or puts and then put a limit to close out at 50% profits.  People lose money when they act on emotions instead of sticking to their tested strategy.  Being retarded and just YOLOing on a good stonk and then never selling is an entirely viable strategy.  That's what I did with AAPL, MSFT, BIDU, and GOOG back in like 2008 when the market bottomed out and my basis on those stonks is so low that the market could lose 80% of it's value tomorrow and I'd still have made a profit (if that happened I'd actually just YOLO my entire emergency fund into something and keep holding).  Whatever you do, fucking pick a strategy and then never change unless the reasons for choosing that strategy are no longer true, in which case pick a new strategy and stick to it."
2021-05-28 19:52:01,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree with you. I dont know whats with people. Faliure to take profit is a huge problem and admitting is step one. Shaming for selling is what i see everywhere. People with 5000% up yelling hold pushing people to loss.

I draw my triangels today and saved me from bagholding like the last 3 months."
2021-05-28 18:22:00,wallstreetbets,"Stop Losses are a market makers wet dream, you‚Äôre essentially saying ‚Äúdrop the bid take my contracts and move back up, plz‚Äù they‚Äôre good if you‚Äôre going on vacation for 2-3 weeks and don‚Äôt have access but that‚Äôs about all.  Options you must have time to watch closely especially if  they expire in 1-2 days"
2021-05-28 17:23:08,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a good fucking answer. That ape forgot to do that but lesson learned!
2021-05-28 17:24:04,wallstreetbets,You can sell before open? I wasn‚Äôt able to do that today. Even with extended trading it just shows a blank chart.
2021-05-28 19:37:13,wallstreetbets,Amen to that
2021-05-28 18:58:15,wallstreetbets,So fucking true. That greed is a bitch when you see green after seeing red. Need to work on the pull out game

2021-05-28 19:53:18,wallstreetbets,I heard about that trading strategy. 80% success rate with retards calls expiring worthless. P.S I‚Äôm the retard and those were my calls.
2021-05-28 19:56:37,wallstreetbets,"From one Jeff to another, good shit you retard."
2021-05-28 19:36:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 19:10:41,wallstreetbets,Then your stop loss was too tight. A good one forces you to be strict with yourself before you lose it all
2021-05-28 17:40:44,wallstreetbets,And stop calling yourself an ape you fucking retard
2021-05-28 17:40:09,wallstreetbets,I think he‚Äôs saying sell friday an hour after open. I tend to do the same but 30 minutes after open.
2021-05-28 19:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Yup, for sure.  That why I convert to stock sometimes.  Especially when I know the fomo is strong and I will end up chasing like a tard if it keeps running."

2021-05-28 19:25:43,wallstreetbets,In your example the price was .50 so really any SL would probably trigger an order but if prices are much higher you‚Äôre correct.  I‚Äôve never been a fan of them

2021-05-28 17:10:49,wallstreetbets,"Insight; when I bought these early May, AMD was trading around 79$ 
and while I was unshaken at first but the 72$ dip at first, I started to panic this week seeing the stock to struggle to get past 78...The AMC stuff made me think traders would ditch the stock again for another plunge yesterday + theta was rotting the whole thing day after day...

My good move was avg down to a price of 1.8$ premium with 100 options.

Have I held it another morning, not only would I have recovered my 10k loss today but made maybe 5-6k profit.

I even had a plan made this week to hold until 4th of June but I didnt stick to it.

2021-05-28 19:49:32,wallstreetbets,"I bought 30k worth of options in a dozen companies. They dropped 50% over a month. I held because I still believed but goddamn it was stressful. I got talked into grabbing amc so I sold my options and wouldn't you fucking know it, as soon as I sold, all my options doubled in value and as soon as I bought amc it dropped. Isn't that fucking mind boggling how it happens so frequently to all of us? That's some fucking alien level psychological warfare."
2021-05-28 17:52:43,wallstreetbets,"If you trade long enough, this WILL happen a lot. I‚Äôve lost count of all the shit I sold for a loss at .25 or whatever and see it‚Äôs worth 10 a day later. Or you finally claw back to breakeven and bail, only to realize that was the move you were waiting for and you just took yourself out for no reason other than you were mentally exhausted by the trade. Best ways to mitigate this:

1) have a plan before you get in, predefined entry/exit. I don‚Äôt recommend setting stops with options. Needs to be based on what levels the stock is holding and how it‚Äôs acting around them

2) play small enough that it can go to zero and won‚Äôt blow a giant hole in your account

3) get in/out gradually. Both for winners and losers."

None of this means FED can't keep controlling inflation going forward. Rates are going to stay near zero probably forever, but so what? Did anyone actually expect them to go back to historical levels?   


And FED doesn't really care about markets, not directly anyway. Their job is to keep economy running (high employment) and inflation manageable. Markets would tend to go up when that is true, but it's not really their goal, just a fortunate side effect"

I think that if rates were raised, people would readily buy bonds, so I do not think we are in a liquidity trap. Since the FED has not attempted to raise rates yet to entice people back into debt instruments, we have no idea what will happen to household savings and whether we are in a liquidity trap, so it seems premature to speculate whether we are or are not."

2021-05-28 16:11:00,wallstreetbets,"The fact inflation aligns with transitory expectations (i.e. supply chain issues that will resolve within the next year  or so) and personal incomes are not increasing (i.e. wage-level not increasing) yet we printed so much money indicates that stimulating inflation will difficult. Generally, raising interest rates reduces inflation, but lowering rates increases inflation, however with interest rates very low and people not buying debt, you probably cannot lower the interest rate to stimulate inflation anymore. Basically, since people are not buying debt, when you lower the rate there is less money being pulled out of Treasuries and stimulating the economy as that money is already just sitting in cash and doing nothing (lowering the rate will not change behavior anymore). Raising the rate would only be done to combat inflation."

2021-05-28 18:42:30,wallstreetbets,Not that great of an option. Yea debt is inflated away but you have a home in a country whose currency is becoming worthless. Need an easily transportable asset or just own a piece of a company with pricing power as they don't give a damn if inflation goes up as people have to buy the products anyways so they get to set price.
2021-05-28 17:38:57,wallstreetbets,I would say actual in your hand silver and gold. Because there is more stock silver and gold it is more expensive than spot price with ‚Äúfees‚Äù but that is code for there ain‚Äôt enough real stuff to match the paper stuff. When you go to sell they will take their cut again. There are places to avoid this by selling it directly to another person. It‚Äôs a safe place to store money but you should consider diversifying before this bubble pops. I‚Äôm afraid of what will happen to everyone‚Äôs 401k if there is a bubble pop. 2008 rerun? I hope not. All that did is put people living in their trailers and or working till they are in their 70‚Äôs and even 80‚Äôs. That will be shitty. Guess what all the old guys are gonna keep the old guys on payroll because they are all in the same boat.
2021-05-28 18:04:56,wallstreetbets,No just higher inflation 4 % and correction in stocks and silver to moon  ( my imho 74 usd ) for 2021 . 2022 still ?
2021-05-28 17:16:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in metal manufacturing and the price has already spiked , maybe not at the customer level yet but the sellers at some point cannot eat the increases. Raw prices are already up"
2021-05-28 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,"What you are describing is NOT a liquidity trap according to Wikipedia.

‚ÄúIn Keynes' description of a liquidity trap, people simply do not want to hold bonds and prefer other, non-liquid forms of money instead. Because of this preference, after converting bonds into cash, this causes an incidental but significant decrease to the bonds' prices and a subsequent increase to their yields. However, people prefer cash no matter how high these yields are or how high the central bank sets the bond's rates (yields).‚Äù

Basically, if we are in a liquidity trap, the central bank loses it‚Äôs control of the interest rates and people will never hold debt instruments regardless of how high the yield is. The central bank has not lost control of the interest rates yet, (since the debt is still serviceable for now) nor have they raised rates to test whether people are still willing to hold debt rather than cash."

2021-05-28 17:29:16,wallstreetbets,"The person's talking about bullshit paper contracts on metals that supress actual price. SLV and GLD just print shares out if thin air to sell. Not backed by actual metals.

2021-05-28 18:44:41,wallstreetbets,It's hit consumers too. Big time.
2021-05-28 17:51:22,wallstreetbets,"The elaboration seems flawed in that the Fed has bought and is buying significant amounts of debt which drives down the interest rates. Without the Fed's actions yields would shoot up and it is not clear there would be much demand for debt.

Regardless, we may not be in the idealized version of a liquidity trap but we sure seem in some lite version of one."
2021-05-28 18:07:09,wallstreetbets,Gold is not really an inflation hedge....it's a crisis hedge
2021-05-28 18:53:47,wallstreetbets,This sort of issue was probably more prevalent in Keynes‚Äô time. I am of the belief that this could not happen today with the FED directly controlling short term interest rates and providing liquidity. The bigger crisis is that the US debt may not be serviceable if interest rates do increase to combat inflation (if interest rates were ever over 10% atm the US government would be paying more in interest than their revenue) which would result in default.
2021-05-28 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates can rise as long as the difference between inflation and interest rates (long-term) is not too big. If the 10 Year Yield is under inflation then it should not matter if inflation is 8% and the interest rate is 6%. Just let the debt grow, in real terms it might be shrinking."

2021-05-28 15:21:11,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs do or die right now to get this shit back over 27 so they don‚Äôt cover their 10.7 million PUT
2021-05-28 15:34:34,wallstreetbets,I too joined back it the fight. I can‚Äôt afford too much loss but fuck the fundamentals thus shit going to 100/share
2021-05-28 17:37:14,wallstreetbets,"I still have my shares, average @ 24.1glad to see alot of others holding strong üí™"
2021-05-28 19:40:27,wallstreetbets,Still a great entry price tbh... next week I think we‚Äôll see a bit of consolidation and a rip
2021-05-28 15:29:07,wallstreetbets,"u/Janto_2021 Man, look at this shit. üòÇ"
2021-05-28 17:17:28,wallstreetbets,Why man just buy discovery at this point
2021-05-28 18:13:20,wallstreetbets,You had months why do it now lol
2021-05-28 18:16:20,wallstreetbets,Did you tho?
2021-05-28 18:10:02,wallstreetbets,"brand new retard ape here buying in at $31. Feel like I've been smacked in my nuts today a bit. I almost had rice paper hands when I checked this AM. Let's go, I'm in for the 300-400 or nothing at all."
2021-05-28 19:15:21,wallstreetbets,I bought 550 @ $32 and it dipped right after that to $25 üò¢. Is it still going to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ?
2021-05-28 15:04:57,wallstreetbets,It's a pity its just a demo account...
2021-05-28 15:16:47,wallstreetbets,Buying the dip for Harambe
2021-05-28 15:17:57,wallstreetbets,Thank you fellow ape to the Moon !!! Fucking for Harambe make this day epic !!!
2021-05-28 15:37:54,wallstreetbets,"holding since march and will continue to hold until i see at least 300, this is boring to watch"
2021-05-28 17:49:05,wallstreetbets,Damn you guys really fuck. I got a 100 shares I technically averaged up because I bought a call and then that paid off so I exercised it to buy at 21 and took out the premium I paid. Holding 100 Shares still Tuesday better make me see stars that's all I know.
2021-05-28 19:14:56,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ you FOMO tards... AMC literally has negative cash flow.  If they don‚Äôt announce a 200-300 million share offering Tuesday they are dumb asses that will go bankrupt with their capital structure.
2021-05-28 15:14:47,wallstreetbets,Either you love Reddit karma or youre just dumb
2021-05-28 17:18:08,wallstreetbets,"Why?!? 
Bought at the top"
2021-05-28 17:58:43,wallstreetbets,"I have 50 Shares AMC at 7.50 , I got another 115 , today at 25. .30 , I‚Äôm planning to hold for at least to get to 100"
2021-05-28 15:08:49,wallstreetbets,607M shares of volume on the day.. only 460M real shares not sure how this will play out Tuesday..
2021-05-28 15:16:43,wallstreetbets,Yeahahh! I just bought some more! Let‚Äôs do it!
2021-05-28 19:52:29,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you buy when the hype is already over lol
2021-05-28 16:56:46,wallstreetbets,"I bought in back in December at an $16.50 average, held all the way down to 5 or whatever then sold at $12 after it went to $14 and looked to be on the downside. I can never seem to time my trades right"
2021-05-28 18:51:50,wallstreetbets,"People being happy today b/c they had already bought in at $8-9 (or below) is awesome, and congrats to all.  People who are happy today because they bought many shares at $25+, since YESTERDAY, is insane and sad.  When you log in and see that a stock blew up 10, 20, 30, 50%... what that means is, you should have bought it, yesterday.  Not today.  Godspeed.  FOMO is real."
2021-05-28 15:49:26,wallstreetbets,Aged like milk soon
2021-05-28 17:39:40,wallstreetbets,The floor on AMC is probably around $6 so we're not going to get to see the -99% loss porn we all crave around here. Should have done options for us.
2021-05-28 15:32:05,wallstreetbets,Also if you really want to help bring amc to the moon you should all go out and watch 1 move every week at an amc theater. This will help big time because the price has been so suppressed due to ‚Äú19‚Äù now they are actually seeing business really pick up. So go enjoy some movies at an amc theater near you!üöÄ
2021-05-28 15:00:13,wallstreetbets,Fucking shares? GTFO.
2021-05-28 15:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Buying a declining stock over a long weekend, those are balls of steel. Good luck mate. I sold at 30 and made some bucks, jumping back on Tuesday when the stock is at 9 or 8."
2021-05-28 15:20:02,wallstreetbets,Hope you have some big bags.
2021-05-28 15:11:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service - AMC ape
2021-05-28 15:04:55,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs done, thanks for the ride tho AMC"

2021-05-28 15:18:49,wallstreetbets,"I lost my ass, I'm done investing thanks for the falsehood here like always"
2021-05-28 15:21:32,wallstreetbets,Went from +50k this morning to -10k this afternoon. Realized and sold. Too pussy to hold over the weekend. I‚Äôll jump back on the bandwagon on Tuesday with you if action looks good.

2021-05-28 19:40:02,wallstreetbets,Until xmas 2023 or 2025 if necessary better than having on my savings!
2021-05-28 17:54:19,wallstreetbets,"Just hold. Don't sell. When you sell, you lose. Some of us wait and wait for months or even years."
2021-05-28 16:12:26,wallstreetbets,Because you're buying at the high of the hype
2021-05-28 16:18:56,wallstreetbets,"Watch the charts, watch the RSI, watch the money flow, watch for impulse waves, buy the bottom of them. You may not grab the absolute bottom, but you shouldn't buy the top that way."

#anidiotwithadream!!!!"
2021-05-28 19:11:32,wallstreetbets,Been holding since January and keep buying more all the time. The floor is high so as long as we hold gains will be plentiful
2021-05-28 15:34:24,wallstreetbets,"On a Friday before a 3 day weekend, at that. You can‚Äôt make this stuff up."
2021-05-28 14:59:57,wallstreetbets,"I wonder the same thing.  If they had the money before, smart money buys after the initial gain as long as it holds.  This, though, this is dumb money."
2021-05-28 18:17:08,wallstreetbets,"The problem with refusing to buy after a run up would have missed you a lot of opportunities. They don‚Äôt always pull back, In this case this mentality ruins the entire concept of forcing a short squeeze. You literally just need the degenerates to keep piling on. Is there any reason to? Not really."
2021-05-28 17:58:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean...is there a law around how many days in a row a stock can go up for? People say don‚Äôt buy on green day days...don‚Äôt buy after 2 green days...3 days in a row? You idiot...oh shit it went up 4 days in a row. NO WAY you should buy now...

SPY went up like 13 days in a row not long ago. You ride it till it bucks you, or you don‚Äôt ride at all."

2021-05-28 15:27:16,wallstreetbets,it is an important date. only a retard would sell because it dipped on a friday before a long weekend.

2021-05-28 15:10:49,wallstreetbets,I was wondering the same thing.
2021-05-28 19:09:15,wallstreetbets,The only thing I know for certain from this place is never ever sell

2021-05-28 17:51:15,wallstreetbets,Puts gonna print?
2021-05-28 18:02:05,wallstreetbets,I couldn‚Äôt decide whether or not to sell cash-secured FD puts or not today on GME and AMC. I ended up with all cash and waiting to see how Tuesday plays out.

2021-05-28 16:44:59,wallstreetbets,Did you figure out 607 shares thing ?
2021-05-28 17:06:27,wallstreetbets,What do you mean real shares ?
2021-05-28 19:13:17,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got long put to wait 10% 20% 50% down ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
2021-05-28 16:14:08,wallstreetbets,You totally don‚Äôt get it Jim Cramer
2021-05-28 16:10:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôll take that bet. It won‚Äôt hit 8 by Tuesday. You must have not been in this since the beginning. Paper handed bitches like you hurt us all.
2021-05-28 16:05:51,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 18:01:34,wallstreetbets,My boyfriend‚Äôs wife got plenty of Louis Vuitton bags![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-05-28 15:10:21,wallstreetbets,Haha. Time for you to get out
2021-05-28 15:14:46,wallstreetbets,What if we‚Äôve lost 2k
2021-05-28 15:26:50,wallstreetbets,Should we sell now and take a loss?  This run-up is a dud.
2021-05-28 15:46:39,wallstreetbets,"What falsehood? There were ample opportunities to make money on this, but you‚Äôre mad because you fomo‚Äôd at the top. üòÇ"
2021-05-28 16:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Of course you did. There is no ""falsehood"" going on here. AMC could moonshot and it could not. You bought in high because you wanted it to increase 1000% in a few days. A lot of the people here already saw it jump 1000% for them because they bought in $2 a share. 

Also if you were really worried about it you should have put in a stop loss order to protect yourself from a big dip. I bought int at $14 and when it hit $20 I set my stop loss to $15, so if it dips a lot I just sell off and recoup my money. If you're risk averse you can bump up your stop loss floor and end up in green regardless."
2021-05-28 16:01:54,wallstreetbets,Imaging losing 10k on a stock that went up 120% in a week.
2021-05-28 15:36:41,wallstreetbets,Hasn't even begun. They're still shorting.
2021-05-28 19:30:01,wallstreetbets,Been seeing months of red till the other day...
2021-05-28 16:16:54,wallstreetbets,obviously üôà
2021-05-28 16:34:15,wallstreetbets,"i totally understand you... but is technical analysis even worth to watch for stocks like these which are driven and pushed by reddit users?

i like using tools like RSI and Fibonacci etc. and all signals just say for a few days don't buy...

but watching the comments here on Reddit gives the impression that this is just the beginning..."
2021-05-28 15:16:23,wallstreetbets,FOMO Fridays are the fucking worst.
2021-05-28 15:19:39,wallstreetbets,Well...
2021-05-28 16:40:27,wallstreetbets,squeeze is ending
2021-05-28 16:50:59,wallstreetbets,I bought 10 @ $34 so yeah smooth braining it over here.
2021-05-28 15:54:41,wallstreetbets,Added one more because 14 is better than 13. See you all on the moon üöÄ
2021-05-28 17:15:20,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 more today, I reached 78 shares @15.07 average."
2021-05-28 19:19:29,wallstreetbets,Panic sold 4500 shares at 25 and then FOMOed 4000 shares last minute at 26....dee dee dee
2021-05-28 18:59:04,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 17 shares here @ $18. Every banana peel in the fuel tank helps üçåü¶ç
2021-05-28 19:27:20,wallstreetbets,Way to go shit hole.
2021-05-28 16:05:02,wallstreetbets,I thought everyone here was retarded?? Wouldn't a retard *hold*??
2021-05-28 17:50:19,wallstreetbets,Exactly damn right
2021-05-28 15:29:53,wallstreetbets,Staying in and pushing the short sellers into bankruptcy.  Going to pass $400 later this summer!  Don‚Äôt miss the boat!
2021-05-28 16:09:43,wallstreetbets,You must be the buy high sell low type of investor
2021-05-28 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre saying sell?
2021-05-28 19:13:46,wallstreetbets,Tuesday is when market opens up after memorial day weekend
2021-05-28 15:12:18,wallstreetbets,Good catch
2021-05-28 18:04:17,wallstreetbets,Would the increased demand not drive the share price up?
2021-05-28 16:47:33,wallstreetbets,No it's the volume of the day at the time of the post... ended the day at 656M .. look at the trading volume when you are looking at the stock all info is provided on your trading platform.
2021-05-28 16:16:42,wallstreetbets,"What am I missing?  I bought 1,700 shares and now going to spend some money at amc theaters to watch some movies...?"
2021-05-28 17:39:41,wallstreetbets,That just sounds cringe
2021-05-28 15:24:40,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-28 15:52:24,wallstreetbets,"People will add after hours puts, expecting a huge dip Tuesday morning. It will go up."
2021-05-28 15:47:15,wallstreetbets,Lol yea pretty much
2021-05-28 16:03:09,wallstreetbets,I made off with 75k. Was shooting for 150 and got greedy.
2021-05-28 15:55:34,wallstreetbets,"What does that mean, and how do you know?"
2021-05-28 19:53:12,wallstreetbets,Yep. Bought at $14 back in January and just watched the red every day for months.
2021-05-28 17:26:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, yeah, by the time the entire front page is full of memes about a specific stock, you've probably missed the best entry lol, but it's not like AMC and GME came out of nowhere."
2021-05-28 17:05:44,wallstreetbets, Ahh the comments on Reddit.  If only they actually knew what they were talking about. Instead of just zombie hoards chasing brains.
2021-05-28 16:11:25,wallstreetbets,Bought a shit load at $33 and holding üíéüôåüöÄü¶ç
2021-05-28 16:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 31 and 33. My portfolio looks like pure pain right now :) 

HOWEVER, my balls and hands are carved from the finest diamonds, so we will H O D L. üíéü§≤üöÄ"
2021-05-28 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,Maybe in a few months of flat trading you‚Äôll go in the money for a couple days again. Unless you diamond hand it again.
2021-05-28 18:27:49,wallstreetbets,"Whoa king retard here, good luck man."
2021-05-28 17:44:48,wallstreetbets,True that sold some bs to get 3 more today!
2021-05-28 16:13:48,wallstreetbets,"The vast majority is. It's the minority selling and being vocal about it, seeking confirmation that they made a good decision.

*They didn't*"
2021-05-28 17:31:52,wallstreetbets,What about 6/2?
2021-05-28 16:34:16,wallstreetbets,"All growth stocks dropped 30-60% from January.  I admit, I‚Äôm new to this type of market of meme stocks and day trading but I‚Äôm learning to be a retard like you"
2021-05-28 19:25:20,wallstreetbets,Yes. But that doesn‚Äôt answer my quaston. I-I ass-askkk-asked b-b-b-b-beee-cause ev-reeeee one111111 I-Is sae-sayin-g I-it wu-w-would Ro-Ro-Rockkketttt!!!111!!!111 :3333
2021-05-28 18:10:10,wallstreetbets,Volume doesn't indicate demand. It just indicates shares changing hands.
2021-05-28 15:46:35,wallstreetbets,I say it‚Äôs time to buy more!!! This game will stop some day. But not today!!!
2021-05-28 15:52:27,wallstreetbets,"Well, at least you‚Äôve paid your tuition for this very important lesson. In the stock market, if you‚Äôre not early, you‚Äôre more often than not, already late. Learn to look the other way and find something else."
2021-05-28 16:13:13,wallstreetbets,Dude if u believe it‚Äôs going to 400 then u get diamond handed n hold. But you just another paper handed bitch
2021-05-28 15:56:54,wallstreetbets,"https://twitter.com/ORTEX/status/1398308177976954888?s=19

2021-05-28 17:27:25,wallstreetbets,looks like....üòÇ
2021-05-28 19:13:21,wallstreetbets,Bruh u think this really finna hit 100k or 500k
2021-05-28 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,Don't forget to vote with your shares. Makes the unrealized loss that much tastier
2021-05-28 16:29:20,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-05-28 19:45:48,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm holding for you.
2021-05-28 16:33:37,wallstreetbets,Bought the dip today at 34! Just wasn‚Äôt done dipping yet but I‚Äôll be laughing at all the paper hands when it hits 300-400 like gme :)
2021-05-28 18:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Lmao thats when i sold... but i only have 3 shares anyway, i paper handed a hundred early on"
2021-05-28 17:00:50,wallstreetbets,"My balls are blue, because I'm waiting for this shit to bust."
2021-05-28 19:28:46,wallstreetbets,Way to go man. You not alone. Bought 305@33
2021-05-28 18:25:48,wallstreetbets,I also pulled the trigger on a spce $35 call @ $3.70....
2021-05-28 18:57:34,wallstreetbets,üòÇüòÇ
2021-05-28 19:27:51,wallstreetbets,The emotions run strong in this ape
2021-05-28 19:27:04,wallstreetbets,I like where your heads at üåù
2021-05-28 18:59:50,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the difference? If a share is traded 27k times in a day. That‚Äôs gotta reflect demand one way or another.
2021-05-28 15:54:14,wallstreetbets,"I mean it'll go up again yea? I assumed it would dip because it's a Friday and a longer weekend, just concerned"
2021-05-28 16:15:46,wallstreetbets,Paperhanded means selling at a loss right? I believe I'm still holding
2021-05-28 19:22:13,wallstreetbets,I think its gonna drop like a rock for the next 2 weeks. And a whole lot of sad people gonna be holding some heavy bags. Just like after GME squeezed then fell.
2021-05-28 17:38:41,wallstreetbets,Holding from London UK using Hargreaves Lansdown and I don‚Äôt think they allow us to vote for US shares.  Any ideas fellow UK apes?
2021-05-28 16:57:30,wallstreetbets,Ouch? Are you kidding lmao. That‚Äôs a huge discount
2021-05-28 16:40:13,wallstreetbets,Houston we‚Äôre gonna need a medvac
2021-05-28 17:28:07,wallstreetbets,"I love the enthusiasm! If it does get to 300 or 400 like GME, I wonder how long it‚Äôs going to take? I don‚Äôt plan to sell any time soon. Just curious why you think that."
2021-05-28 19:12:25,wallstreetbets,You forgot the K in those numbers... 300k-400k üòè
2021-05-28 18:22:34,wallstreetbets,I'd like it too. 52 wk high today followed by closing negative from yesterday's close. With a 24.50 low today.  I hope it's closes 15 Tuesday!
2021-05-28 18:26:38,wallstreetbets,Expiring today? Damn that‚Äôs expensive.
2021-05-28 19:19:21,wallstreetbets,"Nope. One transaction could be pushing price down, one pushing price up, over and over. 

Volume alone just says there is a lot of interest in a stock."
2021-05-28 16:24:32,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt lose till you sell
2021-05-28 15:57:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you'll be alright, buddy. Go see some movies at AMC with friends until Tuesday. Let people add their AH puts anticipating the dip, and let us all come back Tuesday PM to fuck the shorts."
2021-05-28 19:38:57,wallstreetbets,Do you think it‚Äôs best to sell by then or just continue holding?
2021-05-28 17:00:15,wallstreetbets,Right!
2021-05-28 17:18:34,wallstreetbets,Im a narrow minded ape
2021-05-28 18:02:06,wallstreetbets,Bought 10 shares at $30 today.
2021-05-28 17:06:19,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah, Im just chilling on the ISS pick me up on the way to the moon."
2021-05-28 17:37:52,wallstreetbets,Do you seriously think anyone can answer that
2021-05-28 18:32:30,wallstreetbets,I mean bust...up! Gonna close at $50 on Tuesday.
2021-05-28 18:30:19,wallstreetbets,Nah next Friday so there‚Äôs time I suppose.
2021-05-28 17:23:57,wallstreetbets,Understood hahahaha.... I‚Äôm holding for you too
2021-05-28 18:04:11,wallstreetbets,"Hello, I meant it more like what‚Äôs your thought process for that price point. I wasn‚Äôt being literal about a time frame. I‚Äôm new to this so I like the convos. üëç"
2021-05-28 18:37:28,wallstreetbets,Well we shall see but I'm excited. People didn't invest in this one to hold they did it for massive profits quickly. Today was the chance to cash in. I wasn't involved though. Best of luck.
2021-05-28 18:31:56,wallstreetbets,Makes more sense. Could happen who knows. Gotta jump big again.
2021-05-28 19:47:07,wallstreetbets,"Warrior I personally am expecting amc to squeeze within the next 2 weeks IF everything goes smoothly, and theses types of things DO NOT go smoothly. üíéüôå"

2021-05-28 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,"You lost me when you said they're not in it for the money, that's a line rich people pull on poor people they think are idiots. A rich guy would never say that to another rich guy without laughing."

2021-05-28 18:08:45,wallstreetbets,Fisker the fabled designer and failed  CEO is swinging to the fences for a second try with his wife in charge...   Let that sink in before you buy the stock.

2021-05-28 15:02:42,wallstreetbets,that's enough words to make me dump my live savings into deep OTM calls expiring next week

2021-05-28 15:33:07,wallstreetbets,I met Henrik Fisker at car week in monterey a couple years back after his first company failed. He laid the groundwork for his EV plan and he has followed through with everything since then. I like the stock. I like Henrik. loaded already on FSR. Loading more 7/16 calls now.

2021-05-28 19:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Is this going to be like, no one will respect his work until many months after he dies? As he considers himself more of an artist?"
2021-05-28 19:09:54,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-05-28 17:18:09,wallstreetbets,Seems legit!
2021-05-28 17:52:13,wallstreetbets,"I talked to one of their offshoot brands at a racecar oriented job fair (not going to go into more detail on that) in college. I‚Äôd never heard of them because they were just branching out from SoCal so I asked ‚Äúwhat do you guys bring to the table? Do you design and manufacture in house? Are these going to be production vehicles for general use?‚Äù And the person behind the table points and says ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our car.‚Äù And blew me off. 

I come to find out minutes later that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbattery powered‚Äù car, but there‚Äôs a gasoline generator under the hood that powers the battery. I‚Äôm not a fan"
2021-05-28 16:26:54,wallstreetbets,How do you know he didn‚Äôt do nothing at work?

2021-05-28 18:55:26,wallstreetbets,They come in green too?
2021-05-28 17:17:41,wallstreetbets,Well he‚Äôs probably saying the same thing about you somewhere else.
2021-05-28 16:17:36,wallstreetbets,Well Fisker been known as a scam artist for 5+ years probably has something to do with it.
2021-05-28 18:57:11,wallstreetbets,"That makes no sense. If the guy didn't work then he didn't work. Also, the people in jobs who dont work are even aware of it themselves. Are you perhaps that non working dude that is now in Fisker. You kinda are really critical of ""him""."
2021-05-28 16:25:30,wallstreetbets,Lol known as a ‚Äúscammer‚Äù never heard of that. Where is this source from? What has he done the last 5 years after the karma ordeal that‚Äôs labeled him as a scammer?
2021-05-28 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,Charge 700 miles of range in 1 minute? Wheres that at lol. This was 3+ years ago he announced it.
2021-05-28 18:59:39,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, for real!? Not even a Tesla can get close to it. üòÇ Damn, Fisker should be the top car company in the world since 3 years ago then."

1. We're waiting for the proxy vote to validate the DD.  It costs us nothing to hold and them interest.  They will bleed and we will wait.  Absolute worst case scenario is GME is a great long term investment.  Best case scenario is it squeezes soon after the shareholder meeting or before.  
2. The DTCC (and others) are implementing rules to prevent this from happening again and will, hopefully, lead to a margin call on Citadel."

Times are about to change. We found their weak-spot and now they can finally feel the anger piling onto their endless buttomline. They double down, banking on fucking us All over, by forcing margin calls for the lower classes with their fucking insane amount of money. The only way we beat them is togehter. They count on us acting as their Nice complacent human moneymaker, but now we are buying and holding like true apes.

2021-05-28 15:51:05,wallstreetbets,"But we're not. Thanking them, that is. Those guys have an overinflated sense of their influence over the situation.

2021-05-28 15:56:47,wallstreetbets,agreed but it‚Äôs a slippery slop gambling with money that can pay debt. I would not advise it.

2021-05-28 14:32:27,wallstreetbets,^ Probably one of the same people that said sell @ 9$
2021-05-28 14:27:49,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs high praise.
2021-05-28 15:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Selling a stock that has more than doubled in the past week for huge profit and sitting on it for a little while is never a bad idea.

Don‚Äôt hate the stock, just can‚Äôt stand people like you."

It‚Äôs like you bought your identity at Build-A-Bagholder Workshop. More power to you. How have your positions been? Realized any gains? You‚Äôve certainly had a chance to take profit, if you‚Äôve been holding for more than a few days.

2021-05-28 14:35:57,wallstreetbets,If you're not going to sell at 35 either then it makes no difference. The ones who sold at 9 and moved on have profits. The ones who are clinging on and never do never will.
2021-05-28 14:28:14,wallstreetbets,Is it though
2021-05-28 15:49:23,wallstreetbets,"This just in, no one fucking cares"
2021-05-28 16:35:20,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs like losing weight once you‚Äôve been fat. You used to weigh 260 as 5‚Äô9 guy but thrn u lose 40 pounds . Now you get more attention from the ladies who are 5 n 6. But why stop there? Stick to ur weight loss plsn lose all the fat n build muscle to get girls that are 8 n 9s. Making a 1000 profit means shit to me. One rent payment takes that away. But a 100000 profit is life changing .
2021-05-28 15:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Wtf are you saying? He bought calls and then sold them, not difficult to understand"

2021-05-28 14:38:58,wallstreetbets,"Except when y'all are done brigading, *we* will still be here. Still trading. Have *you* competed a trade lately?"

2021-05-28 15:09:43,wallstreetbets,You are acting like that almost half the nation doesn't have either medicinal or recreational weed.  Here's a reason why these Canadian companies don't have a future.  The grey market in Illinois is larger than the entire Canadian legal market.  The money aint coming from the north homie.
2021-05-28 18:38:47,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Sell that crap

2021-05-28 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,With 5k shares you could sell 50 calls deep otm for like 350 every two weeks. And then you can take that premium collected and reinvest if you're really sure this will pay off. That's what I've been doing anyway.
2021-05-28 18:39:33,wallstreetbets,"If you own the shares to back it up the only way you will lose money is if you sell calls at a strike and underlying price lower than your average or selling more calls than you can back up with stock. For instance having an average of like 3$ and selling an otm call at 1.50$ currently. If exercised you'd lose half the value of your investment. But say your average is like .50¬¢-1$ if you sell a call at like 1.50$ strike right now on a bi monthly basis(every two weeks) you make like 7 bucks per contract. Keep in mind that it also essentially drops your average cost by the premium sold at. So if I sold covered calls against all of my shares at .07 per contract I net 7$ per contract x 50 contracts= 350$ plus I've now also dropped my average at .50¬¢-1$ down to .43¬¢-.93¬¢

I've been doing that with a much smaller position lately to average down and reinvest the earnings into sndl so I can sell more calls. 

I just try to go deep otm so that way my assignment risk is pretty low. If I were to get assigned on my calls I still make money... But it limits my profit potential. If I set my strike at 1.50 and the price jumps to 3  my profit potential stops at 1.50 whereas the dude who bought the call can keep on riding past 1.50. 

It's not hard just takes a tiny bit of research.

Edit: also... why more people don't sell covered calls baffles me. Make that money you put in work for you dude...

 You can do it with lvl 1 options with most brokers on a cash account and don't have to worry about losing money you haven't personally transferred to an account. You won't be in debt with lvl 1 options in a cash account. But you can turn that bad investment you may have made into a much better one by selling calls against it. Make that money work for you. And then eventually you may break even on the stock price and you can sell a deep itm leap to cash out and make a little extra on the side. 

Btw... Don't forget to withhold some of your profit for taxes. It may end up fucking you at the end of the year if you don't."

2021-05-28 16:40:45,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre up on a call (or put) and don‚Äôt have a day trade left, just sell a higher strike call on the same exp date. 

So say, on Monday you:
Buy AMC 6/4 20c for $0.50

Wednesday rolls around, that call is now worth $5.00 but you don‚Äôt have a DT

You can sell the 6/4 22c and collect say like $3.00 premium

Now you locked in $2.50 profit. With an additional upside of $200 (difference in the spread) if AMC went above $22

And you don‚Äôt use a DT


Works same with puts, but you sell a lower strike

EDIT: in order for this to save you a day trade, you‚Äôd need to do it same day as the buy. This does work for locking in profits with a bit of upside also. I use it to make trades free. 
Sorry, brain was extra smooth"

Just seems like they‚Äôre gonna lock us out anyway they can.

1. Being that it's a good stock to hold and invest in even if it doesn't balloon.

2. That it can't fall any lower than it is at the moment. There's too much interest and meme value in the stock now, if it did fall lower it would get flooded with buys and apes to try and catch the next big mene stock. There's too much potential gain for it to fall lower, and not much risk at all comparitively. It's the perfect gamble. If it goes down it'll get flooded, if it goes up then it goes up .. so it's all good."

2021-05-28 15:05:56,wallstreetbets,"They don‚Äôt expire at market close, just an fyi. They expire a couple of hours after the close. Don‚Äôt listen to apes (I mean they are apes, after all) and just google and read. Shit tons of info on this.

If they expire in the money, your contracts will be exercised at the appropriate strikes, so you will end up owning shares (number of contracts times 100) if what expired was call options. 

If they expire out of the money, you loose all the money you already invested in those contracts, ie the premium you paid for them. 

To note here, if you do not have the capital to pay for shares if your contracts are exercised, your broker will automatically liquidate the contracts some time before market close on the expiration date. Edit: they will liquidate via a market order, so it will be filled with whatever market offers at that moment. 

Another important note and why it is important to know that options expire a couple hours after market close is because, as you are (probably?) aware, trading still takes place after market close; therefore, your contracts can go in the money (and out of the money) even after market closed for the week. This distinction is especially important to recognize if you are the one selling options.

Really though, just google shit and learn on your own. You are more likely to get incorrect or incomplete information here because, while there are many people with wealth of knowledge and understanding, there are also many people like you with insufficient knowledge (or no knowledge at all) and some of them, for some reason, will gladly ‚Äúanswer‚Äù your questions instead of shutting the fuck up and learning themselves.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cramer on CLNE Good day everyone,

I must address Cramer's statement because he is obviously trying to add fuel to the short-selling fire: When he says ""we're not going natural gas"" he is clearly making a vague and general statement meant to be interpreted in the worst possible way: ""no one is going to buy or use natural gas."" By now, I hope everyone that is interested in this stock understands that CLNE offers an alternative transportation fuel, thus, the investments made by BP and Chevron, and not revolutionary technology like some EV's (but this is mostly hype meant to catapult EVs to the front. What most people do not realize is that driverless technology and such can be placed in Petro vehicles too). Also, unfortunately, the company has done a terrible marketting job. That's why powerful analysts can get away with making vague and unsupported statements. The fact that Cramer explained the stock's decrease over the last month as being due to widespread dissaproval is misleading, at best. Many people do not yet know about the cleanliness and therapeutic effects RNG has on the climate. We must get the word out and pressure CLNE corporate to begin marketting campaigns to get the word out. I think it's about time."

2021-05-28 14:08:04,wallstreetbets,"I scalped my 32$ call at $35 I think. About a $300 gain per contract sold. Felt like a crash was coming. Meant to buy puts on the way down, but life called and I had to answer. 

This is only the beginning though!"

2021-05-28 14:39:39,wallstreetbets,Buying 0 days throughout the day to ‚Äúaverage down‚Äù. Hasn‚Äôt worked so far. I have now begun a game where it‚Äôs AMC against my solvency.
2021-05-28 16:07:25,wallstreetbets,Don't follow the WSB trends you need to be in before the hype just gotta accept that you missed out sometimes and not fomo
2021-05-28 10:54:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought up shares at 35.50 (6K worth) and watched it flame out. LOL. I know it is tiny compared to where AMC is going. Much love to all!!

2021-05-28 13:08:29,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah!
2021-05-28 13:44:45,wallstreetbets,Did you say ‚Äúsold‚Äù? What is that?
2021-05-28 14:04:09,wallstreetbets,True true... bad play on my part
2021-05-28 15:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Yes, delicious"
2021-05-28 16:13:00,wallstreetbets,Perfect freaking attitude! You just made the Christmas card list!
2021-05-28 10:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Your yolo post was $2,000 in shares"
2021-05-28 18:40:41,wallstreetbets,"If the hype gets crazy and ever other posts is about a specific stock your to late to the party. Its not time to buy, its time to sell else your just bag-holding fool for those that got in early."

2021-05-28 13:11:11,wallstreetbets,I sure hope Clov gets a big squeeze!
2021-05-28 13:42:26,wallstreetbets,Praying for us both bro. Just need a cool 38% increase or so and I'll be fine üòÇüòÇ
2021-05-28 15:25:02,wallstreetbets,"Seeing to much of this. And yall retards wonder why its down. If everyone who bought 0 DTE calls today used the money for shares, imagine where we'd be."
2021-05-28 18:05:55,wallstreetbets,This is 100% true. All the stocks I've been following have either tanked or accelerated due to other reasons than the original DD.
2021-05-28 11:03:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah you're safe. My calls expire 6/4. My breakeven is embarrassingly high. I was planning on holding them for like 10-20 mins and then selling for profit and buying shares. Instantly down over 100 and then it just got worse and worse and worse
2021-05-28 17:48:56,wallstreetbets,So buy calls on red and buy puts on green?
2021-05-28 16:07:34,wallstreetbets,"I bought amc calls every day this week today was the first day I didn't get a 80-120+ same day return

I just happened to throw in way more money than I had been all week and lost everything I made and then some."

2021-05-28 12:31:22,wallstreetbets,Hold strong! Let‚Äôs make that $$$$$
2021-05-28 14:07:11,wallstreetbets,Lol that was just paperhands with FUD this morning. It's still going up
2021-05-28 12:00:26,wallstreetbets,"I too have the uncanny ability to always buy at the top. At least I only bought 2, I am not a big gambler lol"
2021-05-28 19:56:19,wallstreetbets,"So what you are saying is we need to develop a stock-noob indicator that tells us when stock-noob buys into the market, which will be the high and that's when we fade the shiznit out of it??? I'm picking up what you are laying down my man üí™"
2021-05-28 12:14:53,wallstreetbets,Dunno man. Ath on a gamma squeezes usually go down
2021-05-28 11:24:41,wallstreetbets,This IS up. Lmao.
2021-05-28 13:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Lol we would all LOVE TO SEE $90. And sure maybe with market cap but I doubt anything beyond $50 is realistic.

Mind you, I hope we all come out millionaires.
$90 seems suss"
2021-05-28 14:52:49,wallstreetbets,Price increasing = Ape loins length and girth increasing!
2021-05-28 13:44:21,wallstreetbets,Yee you‚Äôre only late if you never buy
2021-05-28 10:29:54,wallstreetbets,I hope so man i just did it on 32
2021-05-28 18:25:46,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs also they don‚Äôt lose their money by buying near ATH ü§°üëúüß≥üíº
2021-05-28 19:01:15,wallstreetbets,A little over a dollar each so around $8k total
2021-05-28 16:12:04,wallstreetbets,The 15s I sold for 1.39 and the 14s I sold for 1.08 Theta is super high on these
2021-05-28 13:00:54,wallstreetbets,"Yep, good luck!"
2021-05-28 16:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Not sure where you should mail the card to, our addresses will be somewhere between the MOON and URANUS"
2021-05-28 13:08:42,wallstreetbets,Godspeed!
2021-05-28 11:47:24,wallstreetbets,My call expires today.i might need ur username
2021-05-28 13:43:44,wallstreetbets,"Have 6/4 as well, been to new highs and taken my overall account to net negative since I started it. I also bought shares at $17, I just cant learn my lesson on when to get out on options, need to stick with shares."
2021-05-28 19:02:27,wallstreetbets,No he means don‚Äôt buy calls on big green says because the They‚Äôre crazy expensive already due to the volatility and your breakeven is crazy high and theta crush is always there too
2021-05-28 15:23:02,wallstreetbets,maybe but not today
2021-05-28 12:05:33,wallstreetbets,That is a great ability. Now you just need to let us know so we can use this ability of yours.
2021-05-28 12:46:51,wallstreetbets,Bro I did the same thing I only bought 3 but at 31 bucks lol. I don't even know why Im here ü§£
2021-05-28 19:50:37,wallstreetbets,You mean investor...
2021-05-28 13:09:34,wallstreetbets,It's not real market market cap. It's a gamma squeeze and I think soon enough it'll correct to $15
2021-05-28 10:31:04,wallstreetbets,Same here but at $31. Stay strong
2021-05-28 16:17:53,wallstreetbets,I will leave it on the rocket ship and you can just open it up on Christmas.
2021-05-28 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,Lmao normally I'd let you borrow it but I need it my man. Bought my calls for 700 each they're now worth a whopping 120  üòÇ
2021-05-28 19:04:50,wallstreetbets,So no calls green or red and no puts green or red?
2021-05-28 16:17:03,wallstreetbets,That's okay. It's got a nice long 3 day weekend to build its energy back up
2021-05-28 13:23:46,wallstreetbets,"sorry, what in the everliving fuck are you talking about? It will go to $90, wait... will correct to $15. You understand the gap there right? PICK ONE"
2021-05-28 10:48:08,wallstreetbets,Same here $31 ü¶çüí™üèª
2021-05-28 10:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Opened my positions at $18, Godspeed to all of us and see you apes on the moon ü§öüíéü¶çüöÄüåö"
2021-05-28 18:50:24,wallstreetbets,lol thanks for sharing this
2021-05-28 19:52:32,wallstreetbets,The keyword is ‚Äúbig‚Äù green or red days dude. Theta will crush you most likely. And thos contracts expiring worthless is horrible waste of money when it could‚Äôve gone towards shares.
2021-05-28 13:26:15,wallstreetbets,Lol. There's no guarantee it'll go to 90. That's like a 90billion dollar market cap for a cinema company. And in the past when it exploded it fell back down didn't it? Don't get crazy with profits
2021-05-28 10:58:18,wallstreetbets,I bought originally at 12 sat on it for a while then at 31 finally said fuck it and pulled the trigger
2021-05-28 10:59:08,wallstreetbets,Buy back at that $29 dip or nah? Gotta keep to the code.
2021-05-28 11:00:18,wallstreetbets,"Ofc I did .my life is boring as it is ,needed some excitement"
2021-05-28 11:12:58,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 11:38:01,wallstreetbets,Also did a call and it instantly dropped lmao
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PTON When you take the time to investigate, use a little ingenuity, and you know how to do math, you will discover just how much PTON Bike sales are expected to Decline sequentially.
1) We look to the PTON CFO's statement found in the latest earnings call transcript, for guidance:
""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior.""
2) Being that we do not have access to a 10-K filing for Q4 fiscal '19, we will access other filings that do in fact reference numbers from fiscal '19...
A) 10-K filing dated 9/11/2020
B) 10-Q filing dated 5/6/2020
3) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $223.3M under Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19)
But, that is TOTAL Revenue; we need to find out what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike sales...
4) To calculate what % of TOTAL Revenue is Bike Sales, we can use numbers from neighboring Q3 (i.e. Three Months Ended March 31, 2019)...
A) On page 6 of the 10-Q, you will find Revenue of ""Connected Fitness Products"" (aka Bike Sales) to be $261.6M
B) On page 85 of the 10-K, you will find TOTAL Revenue of $316.7M
C) % of Bike Sales per TOTAL Revenue: $261.6M / $316.7M * 100 = 82.6% {""Connected Fitness Products"" Revenue (aka Bike Sales)}
5) Apply 82.6% to the TOTAL Revenue $223.3M for Three Months Ended Jun. 30, 2019 (i.e. Q4 of fiscal '19): $223.3M x 0.826 = $184.45M {Bike Sales for Q4 of fiscal '19}
6) Per the CFO, ""We expect Global Bike and Bike+ unit sales in Q4 fiscal '21 to be over three times higher than they were in Q4 of fiscal '19, TWO YEARS prior."":
$184.45M x 3 = $553.35M"
2021-05-28 10:12:12,wallstreetbets,Can you repost this with line breaks...
2021-05-28 14:32:33,wallstreetbets,As a peloton owner I love the bike and the service. I think the apparel can make them a ton of money if they become a name brand like under armor or nike. I do not have a position in the stock because I definitely think it‚Äôs overvalued in the short term.
2021-05-28 10:29:55,wallstreetbets,TL;DR
2021-05-28 12:23:58,wallstreetbets,I bought the crash and it's up 25% from there so I'm happy
2021-05-28 18:34:52,wallstreetbets,I shorted it at 89.80. I am an idiot. It was on Monday the 17th at 1:30 when things started suddenly going up for Nasdaq.

2021-05-28 11:49:54,wallstreetbets,My expert analysis. This stock is poised for a massive crash. Or a rocket ride.
2021-05-28 10:38:53,wallstreetbets,Stop with the peloton crap ticker
2021-05-28 10:48:21,wallstreetbets,üò° mods abusing their power again I see
2021-05-28 16:53:24,wallstreetbets,under armor is doing horribly. can i ask you why you wouldnt buy an actual mountain bike and hit the trails? its one of the most fun things to do and it seems way better than being stuck inside a home on a fake bike
2021-05-28 10:21:26,wallstreetbets,Love me those suburban yoga mom's though. God bless $PTON

2021-05-28 12:35:48,wallstreetbets,Lol. As though they only generate revenue with bike sales. Monthly memberships will continue on long after the market of bike sales reaches peak.
2021-05-28 12:14:43,wallstreetbets,Def a rocket ride. This thing is sticky as hell.

I‚Äôll explain. 

He bought 18 contracts at .59 cents. 
.59 x 1800 (100 shares per contract) resulting in 1 K

The contract was for 17C... current share price let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 33$. 

33 - 17 you get yourself 16. 

16 x 1800 = 25 k +

Edit: there‚Äôs premiums you pay for the contract itself hoping to be ‚ÄúITM‚Äù as long as your in the money you‚Äôre good. Had a work meeting. Wrote it in 5 min and tried my best to ELI5.

Edit 2: Thank you for all the awards. üôè

Edit 3: There is a lot of stuff online to give you a better understanding of what an option is. Please proceed with caution.

Sell to close: 17c @ 19.00 x 18 (19 x 100 x 18) = $34,200 (reward)

Profit: 34,200 - 1,062 = $33,138

Can you give an explanation of how someone can lose it all?

Instead of AMC going from $17 to $33, it goes down to $10. That means I am negative $7. 

$7*1800= $12.6k

Does this mean I owe the broker $12.5k?"
2021-05-28 17:34:05,wallstreetbets,I understand stand it but now they are super expensive to do one and possibly lose money. Back when you could buy them at pennies or low dollar amounts it would have been great to try but now it‚Äôs to risky for most people. Idk

* Are the premiums built into the 0.59?
* How are you taxed on gains? Is it the same short term capital gains tax as if you bought/sold shares?
* Also, if a stock is doing well, wouldn't the call options ""go up in price""? Could you somehow use option premiums to figure out nearterm future pressure on stock price?"

2021-05-28 17:40:59,wallstreetbets,There is a pretty large bid/ask spread. You probably need your make your bid to be closer to the ask for the contract to be assigned
2021-05-28 11:27:31,wallstreetbets,"Your own money, you can lose up to the premium you paid, for calls you want the price to go up and vice versa for put, I‚Äôm pretty sure you have to apply for them on TD but I‚Äôm not sure"
2021-05-28 11:41:03,wallstreetbets,"There are others in this comment section that have touched on it, but I‚Äôll give it a go here for kicks.

Calls are basically contracts that allow someone to buy 100 shares of a stock per 1 contract after the stock reaches a strike price.

So if you see 20C, that means it‚Äôs a call with a strike price of 20.  If the market value of the stock is over 20 by expiration, you can exercise the contract and buy the 100 shares at the price of 20 apiece.  

However, there‚Äôs a premium you‚Äôll have paid for the right to do this; let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs .59.  That means you pay .59 per share in the contract (so .59*100=59) and that‚Äôs your cost to buy the call up front, is 59.  This means the stock value needs to hit 20.59 for you to come out even from exercising the call option.  After that, you would make whatever the price is -20.59= Your total profit.

Puts are the opposite: you buy a contract that allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price. So 17P would be a put that gives you the right to sell a stock for 17 if it happens to go below that price.  Again, it has to go lower than 17-(your premium you paid) for you to make money exercising it.

Keep in mind, you don‚Äôt have to wait and try exercise it.  You can keep an eye on what your contract premiums are for that type of contract, and if it goes up in value, you can sell the contract you bought to someone else for a bigger premium than what you paid for it.  This is how a lot of people make their money on options, not from actually exercising them.

Also keep in mind that the options, if they expire without reaching the strike price in either direction, become worthless.  It‚Äôs more of a gamble than straight up stocks.

I‚Äôm thinking you can figure out what you‚Äôre hoping the stock will do depending on which one you bought (and conversely, which one you sell, if you‚Äôre offering the option initially, where you‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs allowing someone to buy 100 shares at a price or sell their 100 shares to you at a certain price).

TD you‚Äôll probably want to visit the good old Google to see where their options buying and selling are.  Options require a decent amount of investment into learning them and how to buy and sell them, so it seems like it would be doing you a disservice just handing you all the info on how to get that set up so that you end up falling into it without really knowing anything about them."

2021-05-28 14:18:36,wallstreetbets,"a Call option gives you the right to buy stock at a specified strike price, A put option gives you the option to sell a stock at a specified strike price.  


For a call option to be in the money, the current trade value must be greater than the strike price. You make money on the difference between values ( Market - Strike).   


A put option is the opposite, you make money when the market value falls below your strike price (Strike - Market).   


Each contract is for 100 shares. Options have an execute date but you can execute them anytime before then, but after they expire you can no longer exercise them.   


You can either exercise the option (so for a call, choose to purhcase the stock) which means you need 100 \* Strike Price to buy them....then you can sell the stock to make your money or you can sell the contract directly to someone else."

2021-05-28 10:45:55,wallstreetbets,"17C is 17 Call option. There is also put which would be written as 20P.

The number is what you expect the price of the share to be before expiration. With a 17C, you want the share to go above 17 before expiration.
With a 20P, you want the share price to go below 20 before expiration.

Usually, the 17C would be followed by the expiration date."
2021-05-28 11:39:13,wallstreetbets,"I see people tried to answer some of this, but didn't break it down to its very basic explanation.

A 17c... Is a call for $17.  The $17 is called the ""strike price."" The strike price is what he is gambling on (the contract allows him to buy 100 shares at $17).  That is, if he purchased the call out of the money, being that the share price was less than $17, the closer that it gets to $17, or if it exceeds $17, the value of the call contract increases.

The price doesn't have to go to $17 to make money, but in the best case world, the share price would exceed $17...as it has.

A call contract is for a hundred shares.  So a 59 cent $17 call actually cost $59 (59 cents * 100 shares). 

The expiration date, is the point at which either the call option is exercised or it expires worthless.  It would expire worthless if the current share price is lower than the strike price.  As an example, it would make no sense to exercise a $17 call if the share price is $15. In short, exercising it would cost you $1,700 to buy the 100 shares, when you can buy it on the open market for $1,500.

You can exercise a call option at any time, which allows you to purchase the hundred shares at the strike price.  

So if the share price is $33, one contract allows the person that owns it to exercise it and purchase 100 shares at $17 each.  The $59 premium is not the purchase price of the shares, that was the premium to have the right to purchase 100 shares. So exercising the call is still going to cost him $1,700 ($17*100 shares). 

The vast majority of people do not exercise contracts.  They buy the contract, and then sell it after it's value increases before the expiration date. Or they buy a contract, and it expires worthless.

The majority of people that play with contracts lose money."
2021-05-28 10:39:58,wallstreetbets,"Your hoping the share price hits 17... the chances of that hitting was slim to none in such a short period of time (June 4th) 
Now that the price has gone up significantly, those contracts are now ‚Äúat the 17 dollars‚Äù plus whatever the stock is. 

The contract was for 17/share

The share price is 33/share

33 - 17 is 16.

16 x 1800 shares is 25K +

To lazy for math."
2021-05-28 10:48:52,wallstreetbets,"17c is the strike of the call option he bought ( he thinks the stock will go up to $17/share)
$0.59 means the option cost $59.00 ea.

2021-05-28 14:10:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you
2021-05-28 14:30:15,wallstreetbets,"This is a great explanation. 

And yes, Google is great, but sometimes I just like to have acquire knowledge via conversation rather than blog posts or YouTube. 

To further understand, I‚Äôd like to ask about the typical criteria that I‚Äôd fill up when buying options. 

- let‚Äôs say a stock is currently at $10
- and I think that in 1 year (or sooner), the price will be $20
- i could buy 100 shares today, and if I‚Äôm right, then I‚Äôll double my money when it reaches $20. 
- but that‚Äôs also risky, because my confidence isn‚Äôt 100%. 
- therefore i choose a less-risky alternative: ‚Äúcall options‚Äù
- each ‚Äúcall‚Äù comes in bundles of 100, no more, no less. So 2 calls would be 200. 
- i pay a premium of $0.50 per share. For 1 call, that‚Äôs 100 shares, each at $0.50 premium, totaling a cost of $50.  The most money I can lose is $50. 
- when buying, I choose the expiration date.  Extending the date is doable, but will cause the premium to go up. 
- so lets say 6 months down the line, my contract is only halfway to expiration.  And the price went up 50% (from $10 to $15). So it hasn‚Äôt doubled (yet).  But now I‚Äôm getting cold feet and paper hands. I have the right to exercise my option to buy the stocks now at $10/share (even though market value is $15). That is, I do not have to wait for the market value of the stock to hit a certain threshold. I can exercise whenever I want (theoretically, even at a loss if i wanted to). 
- my profit is now 50% of my principal investment, minus the $50 cost of premium. 
- but after exercising the call, im still simply holding stocks, not cash.  In order to claim the money, i need to sell those stocks. 

Do i have all of the correct?"
2021-05-28 14:20:53,wallstreetbets,"It's not about the platform, Questrade's IQ Edge is one of the better trading views, it's the fact that you're using the basic-ass Questrade website for options trading.

Also options trading isn't gambling any more than buying shares are, unless you buy 1 week expiries like you YOLO'ed on...you were definitely gambling and got double zero's."

2021-05-28 11:53:11,wallstreetbets,"So with a call option the worst you can do is lose the fee for the contract but with a put, short,  you have the potential to lose huge? 

Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm new and just buy and hold."
2021-05-28 12:06:47,wallstreetbets,So u saying most ppl who buy the contract doesn't exercise it but sell it fir higher value... but who are they selling to?
2021-05-28 14:41:13,wallstreetbets,Thank you for sharing this info. So you would only wanna exercise a call option if you knew or had a strong feeling the shares were going to grow to that strike price in a short period of time where you can close your position - basically what this guy did ?
2021-05-28 14:03:44,wallstreetbets,"I have a few questions. 

1. Why would it not make sense to make a $17 call if the stock is 15? Is this because the premium wouldn't be worth the minimal increase in value? 

2. In OP's example, were the 59 cents chosen as a price by the stock exchange, or did they select that price? 

3. How much money do I need to initiate a call?"
2021-05-28 15:25:42,wallstreetbets,"I think what I don't fully understand is let's say he buys the contract at $17 but the stock drops to $15. It's worthless and he doesn't exercise, got it!  So, he loses the .59 x however many shares.  In this case it's a 1K investment.  As long as that share value goes up at any point, he's in the money.  But what gets me is when I see people lose tens of thousands of dollars when the stock goes down, and they keep losing money when the stock keeps going down. In this case, it seems AMC could go to $1 and it wouldn't matter, he would still only lose the 1K.  Is that correct?  If so, why do some make these investments where they can lose so much rather than just make this investment where the loss is just capped at the premium?"
2021-05-28 11:45:18,wallstreetbets,"this is how this sounds in my head

""the 17c strike call topn and bout thinks stock will go to $17 but no, $.59 equals $59 or just about $100 for 18 cents of AMC for $17"""

2021-05-28 13:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure. I have a few friends on IBKR who told me that as well. I actually don't do a lot of options trading. This was an exception, albeit an incredible one. Also, in this case the fees were pretty nominal compared to the profits haha."
2021-05-28 10:24:53,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre placing a bet that the stock will reach a price. Each call is a multiple of 100 stocks. Here, it seems he called that the stock would reach 17.25 by June 4 and got 18 calls. That would be 1800 stocks, but instead of buying them outright you pay a premium for each stock, here it was 0.59 per for a total of 1,062. If the stock hits and goes above your call price + premium you would make as much money as you want until you sell or the date passes. If the stock doesn‚Äôt hit, you would lose the cost of your premium."
2021-05-28 17:22:39,wallstreetbets,"The theory is roughly accurate, the big point is that the premium will most definitely be higher than that if you‚Äôre buying in-the-money calls, so you could (and if it‚Äôs a stock with any show of growth, probably would) be paying a $5 premium for that call, so you‚Äôd be barely at the breakeven point.

The other point of issue that comes into play with options is that you need to have capital to exercise the options, so if you‚Äôre exercising your $10 call you‚Äôll need $1000 available to pay for the shares.  It‚Äôs generally not doable to exercise and simply try to turn around and sell the shares to recover the costs to pay for them, it starts breaking liquidation rules.

So what you may do instead is see what those calls are selling for.  Let‚Äôs say, people are paying $5 for the premium over your (let‚Äôs say) $2.50 initial premium.  You can just sell the option to one of them for a x2 return on your $250, so $500. No requirement to have more cash to settle shares, just money in your account.

You don‚Äôt need to have cash to exercise with in this case, and the returns are a lot better than what you‚Äôd have made exercising the stocks.  So if you were to buy $1000 of shares, or $1000 of options, you‚Äôd have a higher potential return from the options.  They can also crash and expire worthless, which means you‚Äôre out the $1000, whereas shares probably will still have value.

Not to be mean mate, but on the learning front, there‚Äôs a difference between

2021-05-28 16:31:55,wallstreetbets,That's why trading in options is even more like gambling than purely trading in stocks. But the true value in options is being able to hedge potential losses and reduce the volatility of your portfolio but that's a bit more advanced idea.

2021-05-28 11:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I would say that normally the worst you can do is lose the premium when you purchase a call option. I don't know what happens if the call expires in the money, and you don't have the money to buy the shares. But again, most people don't keep options until their expiration date, they sell them prior to realize the increase in value.

I have not played with puts yet, so can't explain them. I'm still busy getting my ass kicked with calls...üòê"
2021-05-28 12:22:50,wallstreetbets,"I guess you'd have to put it in the context of how many times did it change hands before it finally got exercised?  How many call contracts are purchased and expire worthless?

I mean, eventually it will get exercise, or expire worthless.

Here's a couple quotes.

""Statistic published by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), which is that only 10% of option contracts are exercised.""

""10% of options contracts end up being exercised, and 55-60% get closed out before expiration, that leaves only 30-35% of contracts that actually expire worthless."""
2021-05-28 14:52:42,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome

I don't believe I would ever exercise a call option.  But speaking in general concepts, you would never exercise a call option unless the value of the stock increased beyond the strike price, and you were better off exercising the option as compared to buying the stock on the market.  

Let's say you bought a $16 call on a stock that is trading at $16, and paid a premium of a dollar.  That means the call option cost you $100.  But also means that your breakeven point is now $17 a share ($16 strike price, plus the $1 premium).  So if you bought the option, and then turned around and exercised it, you would lose money.  Let's say that the stock price increased to $17 a share.  Now you're at your break-even point, in that if you exercised the contract what you got from each share would total the premium plus the strike price.  But let's say that contract would now sell for $1.25.You would actually be better off selling the contract to close than you would to exercise the contract.  If you exercise it, you would break even. If you sold the contract, you would make $1.25 a share, or $25 profit for every contract that you purchased and then sold.  As you get closer to the expiration date, there is normally less money to be made by selling the contract...but it is still normally better than exercising it.  So as an example, for this $16 call, if the share price increased to $20, the contract would sell for more than $4. So you would be better off selling the contract, as compared to exercising it.

Now just to make sure you understand, exercising a contract is something that you would do after you purchase it. Once you purchase a contract, if you exercise it, you then are buying the shares, 100 shares, at the strike price.  So using my example above, if you exercise this contract with a strike price of $16, you are going to be buying 100 shares for $1,600... No matter what the share is selling for in the open market, that contract with a $16 strike, can be exercised for $16 a share.

If you meant, when you said ""exercise,"" to purchase a call... Yes, you would only want to purchase a call on a stock that you believed was going to increase in value.  If you believe the stock was going to go down in value, you would want to purchase a put.  If the stock trades sideways, you're going to lose money, because the extrinsic value of the call option is going to decrease as it gets closer to the expiration date...being worth zero at the expiration date."
2021-05-28 14:34:52,wallstreetbets,"1.  It's all a gamble. Some people buy in the money calls, some people buy out of the money calls.  Making up numbers, but let's say that the stock is currently trading at $15 a share...and let's say a $14.50 call is $1.60.    In reality, if you buy the call, and then exercise it, it actually cost you $16.10 per share ($14.50 plus the $1.60 premium).  But you are less likely for the contract to expire worthless. The same stock trading at $15 a share, you can buy a $17 call for $0.59.  So the break-even point becomes $17.59.   if the expiration date for this call is 2 months out, and later the stock is trading at $16 a share, now the contract is worth more than 59 cents....so you can sell the contract at a profit.   Better yet, during those two months the stock goes to $33 a share. You could exercise the contract and purchase 100 shares for $1,700...and turn around and sell them for $3,300.  Or you can sell the contract for a gross profit, without exercising it.  

So I guess it comes down to how much you believe in the stock going up in value, and how much you're willing to gamble on that happening. 

2. Contract price is chosen by the person selling the contract. Of course just like a stock, a contract isn't going to sell for a price that the market does not dictate.   That is, nobody's going to pay a dollar for a contract that everybody else is selling for 0.59.  So you could say the market sets the price, or you could say the seller sets the price, but I guess it's kind of a combination of the two.

3. You need to be approved by your brokerage firm to be able to purchase contracts. At least that's how it works for me with Charles Schwab.  I filled out an application, and they still did not approve me for the level that I wanted... So I called them up and the person I talked to played 20 questions with me, once they knew that I understood options, they approved me for the level that I wanted.  I know that doesn't really answer your question, but is the first step to being able to trade options.  There really isn't a minimum or a maximum amount of money you need for options trading.  Looking at amc, the calls that expire a week from now, vary in price from $1.29, to $29 (realize that the $1.29 contract is going to cost $129, and the $29 contract is going to cost $2,900 to purchase).  They vary based on the strike price that you select and the expiration date. If you pick a strike price, and then look at the same strike price that expires at a later date, the price will be higher.  But this starts to get into intrinsic and extrinsic values, that you would probably be better off learning by watching a YouTube video.  Anyhow, the extrinsic value of a call option would decay as the option gets closer to expiring.  So with nothing else changing, the value of the option decreases day by day.  So as a general rule, options that expire sooner, have less extrinsic value..."
2021-05-28 16:02:16,wallstreetbets,"Let's say the stock price is at $16 dollars, when he buys the call contract at $17.  The stock price drops to $15.  If it doesn't get to the expiration date, he hasn't lost all of his money yet. The contract might now be worth $0.25.  if the call contract expires and the stock price is $15, then yes, it's worthless.

The upside is why people invest in options.  In this case he invested $1,000, and made what, $25,000?   The downside, is that most people lose money investing in options.  The number that commonly thrown around is 10%, 10% of options traders are successful."

2021-05-28 19:22:14,wallstreetbets,........
2021-05-28 16:00:54,wallstreetbets,".59 is the per-share premium to buy the contract (this changes like a stock price based on several factors). In this example, $59 per contract gives you the right but, not the obligation to buy 100 shares @ $17 by expiration. For a 17C ($17 strike, Call option), the break-even, in this case, would then be $17.59. (strike + premium) so, if the stock price goes above 17.59 you make money, either by a) selling a 17C and collecting the difference in premiums or b) exercising the option (buying 100 shares @ 17) and selling or holding long stock, that's your choice.  The risk in this scenario is the premium you paid for the contract so, $59. If the price doesn't go above 17.59, you would either c) sell to close at a lower premium and lose the difference or d) let the contract expire worthlessly and you forfeit the max $59"
2021-05-28 18:04:37,wallstreetbets,You're not buying actual shares. It's a premium/fee for the option.
2021-05-28 12:05:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes. The cost of the contract (premium) is .59 per share. But an option contract is always a bundle of 100 shares per contract.

A .59 contract would cost you $59 to buy."
2021-05-28 12:00:22,wallstreetbets,After seeing the bad time Citadel is having with puts I think I'll just leave that to the 'experts'.
2021-05-28 12:24:01,wallstreetbets,What's close out?
2021-05-28 15:08:03,wallstreetbets,Once again thank you so much for such a thorough explanation
2021-05-28 16:22:31,wallstreetbets,"Ok, let me try to ask another way.  It seems his loss in this instance is capped at 1K (the premium).  What if AMC dropped to $10 at the expiration date.  Does he still only lose the 1K?  If so, why are there so many having losses that are dependent on the share price?"
2021-05-28 17:39:37,wallstreetbets,Definitely true that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm all in on shares but not confident enough to do the options yet
2021-05-28 17:43:50,wallstreetbets,Goddamn on $1000 initial investment?
2021-05-28 11:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Oh ok.  I thought it was cuz the option call was still for more time.
Could one sell an option earlier than the contract date?

I'm thinking FUBO will bounce back to 50+"
2021-05-28 12:40:33,wallstreetbets,If you think it's luck it's because you lack skill and knowledge. There are people in this world that do this often enough and make money regularly.

2021-05-28 17:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and that‚Äôs what we all hope for. Majority of the time it expires worthless."
2021-05-28 15:18:40,wallstreetbets,"Get a white board and write down some options you were planning on doing, then figure out how much you would have made/lost. It's not worth losing 1k or more on options because you didn't understand something. If you fuck something up on white board options, you can figure out what went wrong and you can research it more for options down the line.

Remember, with Calls, if you buy a call option for $1,000, you  can only lose that $1,000, but if the price goes over your strike price, you can make unlimited gains.

Same with puts, if you buy a put option for $1,000, you can lose that $1,000 if the price goes up, but if it tanks from $50 per share to $20 per share, you just made a FUCK ton of money.

Each Option is ONLY for 100 shares. You can buy a call option for $1.00, which would cost you $100, meaning the price has to be $1.00 higher than what it currently was at option purchase to even break even. Every $1.00 it goes above your break-even price, you gain $100. Do some research before losing $25,000 because of a dumb mistake."

2021-05-28 11:27:09,wallstreetbets,Facts.
2021-05-28 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,11 if you take our first investment
2021-05-28 12:04:04,wallstreetbets,The worst part of it is that citadel isn't playing with their own money. That's people's retirement savings that they are playing with.
2021-05-28 12:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Contracts are odd compared to buying and selling normal shares.

That is, you can sell to open a contract, or sell to close a contract. You can buy to open a contract, or buy to close a contract.

So if you're the person with 100 shares, that sold the call contract on the shares (sold to open a contract), you could buy the contract to close it out (buy to close).  You can actually close it out at a profit, or a loss...but you can close the contract out instead of having to sell your hundred shares if it gets exercised (that is you can close it out before it's exercised)...or you can close the contract out to realize a gain that would happen if the value of the contracts decreased."
2021-05-28 15:22:29,wallstreetbets,You're welcome
2021-05-28 16:28:57,wallstreetbets,"In the instance of the call option, yes, the most he could lose is what he used to purchase the option contracts, in this case $1,000.

Are you referring to the hedge funds?  If so, they shorted stocks. That is they borrowed shares of stock, and sold them. They are responsible for returning the same number of stock shares, no matter what the price is.  So let's say they borrowed 100 million shares at $4 and sold them, they have $400 million. They are gambling that the price of the stocks will go down.  No matter what the cost of the stock, they owe 100 million shares to the people they borrowed it from. So if the price of the stock goes down to $3 a share, they give the hundred million shares back at a cost of $300 million, and get to pocket the other $100 million.  

So now let's say the stock goes up in value. If their shares are called, they have to return that quantity of shares no matter what the cost is. A bunch of people buy into the stock, and hold the stock, and are unwilling to sell it, the price goes way up.  So if the price is now $400 a share, they still owe 100 million shares of stock to the entity they borrowed them from. Now they have to buy those hundred million shares at $40 billion dollars and return them. So in this example they are out $39,600,000...and the cost of borrowing the shares.

Hopefully all my math is correct in that explanation."
2021-05-28 11:54:21,wallstreetbets,"I have leaps on FUBO. Expiring next year. 

If the share price keeps going up, my contracts will follow."
2021-05-28 13:51:57,wallstreetbets,Jezus there is literally none that consistently makes 2600% on 2 week calls. If there was then they probably own the entire world next year
2021-05-28 13:54:17,wallstreetbets,Noone makes 2700% on weekly options regularly my dude. If you could do that regularly you could turn $100 into 1.7 billion in 5 trades.
2021-05-28 13:55:06,wallstreetbets,"Not at all dude, get off the high before you wreck yourself. Amc is not predictable. Especially contracts that are less than 2 weeks to expiration. That's a full gamble."

Can you sell it like 3 months earlier than due?"
2021-05-28 15:16:04,wallstreetbets,"Lots of people make a living doing this. That's fact that you think otherwise orr think luck is involved tells everyone you 5 people that down vote don't. 
1. I didn't say anything about amc
2. This was 100% predictable
3. Nowhere did I say anything about 2600% gains. That fact you jumped to that conclusion means you never learned critical thinking skills
4.there are plenty of people who have a winning track record at this even if you 5 don't
5.no gambling involved
6. I never implied anyone could turn any amount of money into billions, you lack of comprehension is amazing
7. All I'm saying is that there are people that do this for a living and that this move was obvious enough for them to make money from. It not being obvious to you is irrelevant
8. I'm not on any high you just have no idea how common spikes are. No need to predict most spikes last more than one day. Why you assume people don't take profit on the way up?
9. Having a winning track record i.e. making a living at this does not mean every trade is a winner or runs 20x+ and I never implied that, learn to read

You people are like the people that think poker is luck despite the same people reaching the final tables every year."

2021-05-28 16:48:44,wallstreetbets,"A naked call, would be selling a call option without owning the stock.  

Normally, a person that is selling call options, owns a bunch of shares of the stock (selling a covered call option). Worst case scenario, they collect the premium, and then have to sell 100 shares of their stock per contract they sold at the strike price.  

If a person sells a naked call, they don't actually own the stock, they are going to have to pay for the hundred shares per contract at market value if the contract is exercised. 

As for puts, I haven't really done much research on them..."

2021-05-28 17:28:19,wallstreetbets,"Right, I did recall reading that.  I think what's confusing for a lot of people that are new to this is that are a lot of variables.  For me, I read a lot of things that you wrote, but I need a Q & A to cover a few examples.  Options scared me off because of all these subs where dudes were losing like 90k.  One guy was down 450k after he made 1.5 the year before.   I don't know what the upside is to risking that much when you can simply buy options where your only risk is the premium.

Appreciate your time.   I actually opened up an investment account to include options so I might give this a whirl."

Just last week the entire healthcare system in Ireland was attacked by cyber criminals, resulting in delays of MRI‚Äôs, surgeries, and a tonne of lost data. They wanted a ransom of 20m euro (which wasn‚Äôt paid). This is due to the cyber security being old fashioned. I am confident that many other countries are in the same boat, of having outdated/very little cyber security.

You think GME is gonna fall back to $17 any time soon? No because it's meme hyped. And if it fell too low the apes would be straight back on to gamble again. Same here but less extreme, but if it falls too low it will definitely shoot straight back up for the fact that it is meme hyped. Being a current popular memestock gives it a lot of value. You can see that value very clearly in GME and GME and you'll soon see it in BB too when it starts rising faster and an increasing amount of apes jump on the ship.

Will it fall back down to 7/8? Maybe. Will that be within the next year? No chance at all."

It was literally more meme-hyped in January than it is now, what happened in February and March? 

BB has nowhere near the meme appeal of GME and AMC, and you‚Äôre massively overestimating the amount that retail dictates the prices of large caps. People here are lying to themselves if they don‚Äôt think whales are playing into the meme hype to enrich themselves.

2021-05-28 17:42:28,wallstreetbets,"I agree with what you wrote, but what do you think their long term share price will be? I don't see why it would matter if it dips to 8. They already have their QNX tech and others in almost 200,000,000 vehicles. Seems pretty unlikely that 6-8 will be their market value in the future."
2021-05-28 17:46:03,wallstreetbets,"The point is that in can only fall that low again now after a huge gain spike. So there'll always be the chance of profiting from it while the gains are happening. And if it does fall again after a huge gain it will hold at a higher value than it did before because it'll have more memeability. Look at every single meme stock after a gain and fall, they all hold higher still after the huge gain / fall than they did before it. Prove me wrong?"
2021-05-28 17:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Disclaimer: I have a few hundred BB shares.

For me, at this point after watching BB take a hit in the market for months, it comes down to a few main points. 

1. The market does *not* seem to favor BB in the way that it‚Äôs lenient to the rest of the tech sector in terms of growth potential vs current revenue.

2. Good tech does not necessarily imply good revenue. BB hasn‚Äôt yet fully convinced me that they stand to make a killing off their tech, even if it‚Äôs the best in its niche.

3. Opportunity cost. How long am I willing to let this thing trade sideways before it starts reflecting the quality of its tech? What if it hits a valuation in the meme craze that reflects what its valuation should be on fundamentals in a year? Why should I park my money in BB for years when there are potentially better plays in the meantime?

I can‚Äôt give you a price target, and anyone here who confidently throws a number out of their ass is completely full of shit. I‚Äôd honestly be surprised if it becomes stable at or above $15 EOY on non-meme valuation, but again, it‚Äôs impossible to know. 

Personally, I‚Äôll probably dump my shares during the meme hype and pick some back up after the hype dies."

Biden is proposing to renew them for 10 years. Sunrun has 15% of float short, so if the clean energy bill proposed by senate passes, or they include the tax credits in the infrastructure bill, get ready for fireworks. Notwithstanding the credits, sunrun is a great company, with most PTs in 70-80s. They also recently announced partnership to install ford f150 chargers/sell them solar. That‚Äôs general thesis.

2021-05-28 11:30:16,wallstreetbets,"Financial times article on Jim Cramer BYND pump.
Jim Cramer of CNBC Mad Money fame has never been one to shy away from bodacious market calls that appeal to as broad an investing demographic as possible. In his time, he has inspired everyone from Eric Cartman to your granny (probably) to take a flutter on the market.

But, today before US market open, we were struggling to get our heads around this tweet from the dome-headed financial news host.

What on earth is going on here?


One generous interpretation is that Cramer likes fake meat purveyor Beyond Meat‚Äôs stock. Why wouldn‚Äôt he? After all the $9bn ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù company grew, err, 11 per cent last quarter making its valuation of 13 times forward revenues seem totally reasonable. Depending on how you spin it, anyway. So perhaps that‚Äôs it?


Or perhaps Cramer is not so subtly signalling to the Reddit retail trading army 

To be honest we don‚Äôt have a clue.

But if the latter is the case, the tendie-hungry masses seem to have got the message.

In early trading, Beyond Meat‚Äôs stock is up nine per cent to $138 on absolutely no news. They did touch $144 earlier.

Cool.

Here‚Äôs an idea, though. If we (and yes, that means even FT Alphaville) want to shed the scaly reputation of professional financial journalism perhaps it is better if we don‚Äôt go around suggestively egging on the masses into so-called meme securities?

Actually, we‚Äôre talking about CNBC."

2021-05-28 14:27:56,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone on WSB actually feel bullish on Beyond Meat? Sounds like he is actually just talking out his ass.   


For the Reddit army to work you have to have the support of the Reddit Army. I'm not seeing that here (if anything, I'm seeing a sorta ""stick it to the man"" mentality where even if people were bullish on it because of Cramer now they aren't).  


Also, I'm curious if the research he did focused on the frequency of the symbol BYND on Reddit or  the frequency of the word ""Beyond""... because there are a lot of ways to use the word ""beyond"" that wouldn't suggest anything good about this company."

2021-05-28 13:44:37,wallstreetbets,">I don't have a lot of money to put into AMC, but I bought  4 shares of AMC the first time around, and I shocked to see it finally go from red to green, and then just skyrocket. 

most people cant afford to buy a trillion shares, but hey you still are in the profit! :D"

2021-05-28 17:02:54,wallstreetbets,Same here~bought 100 shares AMC then the Red Week happened and I lost so much I had to sell my OTCs and Pennyies to pay for margins. But I held my GME and AMC. Still cant Figure out why AMC is taking off but F it nice to see Green again. ü§£
2021-05-28 12:29:23,wallstreetbets,"He's full of shit. The same people that said GME would hit $4200.69. Manage this realistically and you'll make a good bit of profit. And remember that the ones say ""hodl!"" are the ones selling.

Be smart, don't be a retard. You really going to take advice from somebody on the internet? They don't care if your portfolio blows up."

2021-05-28 12:04:55,wallstreetbets,I don't see why it cant be both
2021-05-28 13:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday's volume was 600m shares.

Yesterday's shares available to borrow so you can short were around 3m-5m (can't remember exactly, but not more than that). It's in everyone brokerage if they look it up.

Shorts yesterday could not have shorted more than 5m at best.

Borrow fee has been 5%-7% for days now, and has not increased at all this week despite the frenzy.

Bottom line is, retail is selling to retail who are FOMOing like crazy. The shorts have nothing to do with all this crap. Everyone tells each other to hold and that the floor is $500k and that they aren't selling, because they are hoping to sell before them.

There will be a lot of bagholders on this, sadly."
2021-05-28 11:25:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean, sure anything is possible.

What you're looking for is probable.

I mean uh, ooh ooh aah aah"
2021-05-28 11:15:55,wallstreetbets,"it's not impossible.. AMC is trading at a volume of 300 million... that means A LOT of people are buying& selling at the moment. if you look at the break down more people are buying than selling at the moment (marginally) if this keeps up it can pop even further but again no promises as to how high.

Somebody posted this in the Rite Aid sub. Can one of the more astute people here comment on this? Is this a real possibility? 

The news that leaked that Amazon was interested in physical locations makes me wonder, but they‚Äôve had years to buy Rite Aid, CVS or Walgreens. So far they‚Äôve done nothing but Pillpack, which has been mostly a failure. 

So I don‚Äôt know what to make of this, is it a real possibility or just BS?"
2021-05-28 09:29:41,wallstreetbets,"CVS and Aetna Insurance merged a couple of years ago. Half of Rite Aid is Walgreens, other half was supposed to go to Albertsons but that deal fell through. I could see Amazon/Whole Foods picking up that part of the company."
2021-05-28 09:35:17,wallstreetbets,"Amazon wouldn‚Äôt buy cvs. A few reasons, 1) cvs runs all target pharmacy locations and I‚Äôd bet there would be a conflict issue there, 2) Cvs is too large of a buy, 3) cvs owns caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager similar to express scripts.  

The only logical buy is rite aid. 1b market cap vs 45b for Walgreens and 113b for cvs"
2021-05-28 10:43:04,wallstreetbets,"All in all Rite Aid is an attractive buy at the present price. Rite Aid is not for the weak of constitution; diamond hands or something stronger. But once the price goes up it can go to the moon. I understand wsb love affair with AMC and GME, but if you really want to see fireworks, wait until wsb gets behind Rite Aid. Much potential for large gains. Also, if you care, research the Rite Aid backstory. It has everything, and like I have said before, would make a good book/movie. The Rite Aid story is interesting on many levels, and should be taught in business schools as a cautionary tale."
2021-05-28 09:58:17,wallstreetbets,Sold me already
2021-05-28 10:34:44,wallstreetbets,"More likely than Amazon buying Rite Aid is one or more activists getting involved with Rite Aid. Several activists have been considering Rite Aid. One was waiting for the political climate to change (Trump to leave office), before making a move. So now that Trump is out, that barrier is removed and they can move forward if they are still interested. The thing about Rite Aid - it's a wild card. You know something good is going to happen, but you don't know when or what. One caveat is it might be a takeover target with a low ball offer like Cerberus made a couple of years ago. Employees and shareholders of Rite Aid deserve better."
2021-05-28 13:03:22,wallstreetbets,"I actually believe that the highest probability of a buyout of Rite Aid would come from Walmart.

Walmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company.  However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens.  In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale.  If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over.  WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.

A couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:

\- Walmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions, thereby lowering its cost

\- All the goods sold in the front end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products that Walmart sells in its department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.

Based on the above 2 points, Walmart improves both its own existing margins and at the same time improves those of the Rite Aid revenue.

The Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.

If you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $5 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels.   So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment."
2021-05-28 11:13:12,wallstreetbets,It would be the quickest way for Amzn to have a legit national presence in the pharmacy market. Only issue is Rad is only in 26 states after selling stores to walgreens...mostly stores on east/west coast
2021-05-28 09:56:46,wallstreetbets,All Amazon has to do is not treat pharmacists like shit and they will dominate competitors.
2021-05-28 09:30:16,wallstreetbets,I thought Rite Aid had already sold to Walgreens a few years back

2021-05-28 10:26:22,wallstreetbets,"I would say possible but unlikely. Amazon has had the chance to buy Rite Aid for years, and at a cheaper price than today, but has not. When Bezos leaves, maybe things will change."
2021-05-28 10:10:15,wallstreetbets,My friend work for cvs. Yeah they ain‚Äôt going nowhere.... only the employees might leave due to high work stress lol...
2021-05-28 11:07:30,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your statement that, ""I understand wsb love affair with AMC and GME, but if you really want to see fireworks, wait until wsb gets behind Rite Aid"".

Rite Aid was a WSB meme stock a few years ago.  Should it be picked up and become a WSB meme stock again, the RAD share price would roar higher.   There are only 55 million RAD shares outstanding (that's 15 million less than GME - Gamestock has outstanding).  Also, the RAD float is only about 25 million shares.  With the heavily level of shorting of the stock that is done by hedge funds in Rite Aid, RAD is primed for a squeeze."
2021-05-28 11:16:14,wallstreetbets,Where do I submit my losses for the stronger than diamond hands feature.
2021-05-28 13:21:03,wallstreetbets,Great post! I confess that I had never even considered Wal Mart as a buyer. But what you said makes a lot of sense. I wonder if this Amazon leak will spur some sort of move by them?
2021-05-28 14:42:48,wallstreetbets,"Good idea. I have seen Walmart casually mentioned in the past. It is always Amazon that most people reference, but someone like Walmart might end up being the suitor."
2021-05-28 12:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Still, a Rite Aid acquisition is the only way to immediately establish a 2,500+ retail pharmacy store foothold in the USA for Amazon."
2021-05-28 09:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Walgreens bought half of Rite Aid stores back in 2019 --- a little more than 1,900 stores total.  
  
Rite Aid ( RAD ) still have more than 2,500 retail pharmacy locations in the USA today and did more than $24 billion in revenue last year (---which is amazing when you consider that the market cap based on today's stock price is only $1 billion)."
2021-05-28 09:32:48,wallstreetbets,"They bought about 45% of Rite Aid, but the rest stayed independent. The albertsons thing was a scheme cooked up by Rite Aid‚Äôs CEO to give himself a 20 million a year job as CEO of Albertsons. The big shareholders of Rite Aid killed it.

Oddly, that former Rite Aid CEO is now head of the US divisions of Walgreens. So you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd just buy the other half, but so far nothing has happened."
2021-05-28 09:58:50,wallstreetbets,"That was another thing they gave me pause for thought, I think they spent like $8 billion on that or something? 

Does Amazon actually have the cash on hand to spend another four or 5 billion or whatever it will be buying Rite Aid? 

I know Amazon is a huge company but they can‚Äôt have that much cash laying around to just keep buying other companies. Or maybe they do, I really don‚Äôt know.Ôøº"
2021-05-28 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid needs to scale up to re-establish a national presence.  The Bartell Drugs acquisition made Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy retail chain in Seattle.   

By growing its national presence in the USA, Rite Aid will continue to improve its cost position and profitability.   It will also benefit the Rite Aid PBM, Elixir, as expansion provides greater opportunity for Elixir to grow its market share by having access to more regions throughout the USA."

2021-05-28 12:28:53,wallstreetbets,"The Rite Aid story is so compelling, even with what is known. The unknown bits would make it even more so. On a moral basis I would love to see Rite Aid become the next meme stock. I cannot think of too many stocks where the shareholders have suffered so long with problematic management, as well as shorts (who might have been associated problematic management)."
2021-05-28 12:37:41,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid is certainly a stock wsb could get behind. It has all the right qualities. It would not take much to send the stock much higher, where it should be, like you said. Will it happen and if so, what will the catalyst be. Who knows."
2021-05-28 12:23:09,wallstreetbets,"Wish I had a good answer. If they are realized losses, not much you can do. If unrealized, just hang on. Hope for buyout, merger, or that wsb gets behind Rite Aid. Given the Rite Aid backstory, and the shorts, it would be a great thing if Rite Aid would become the new AMC or GME."

2021-05-28 10:09:02,wallstreetbets,"Amazon has approximately $45 billion in cash and equivalents.  So spending $5 - $10 billion on any strategic acquistion they chose is no problem at all for AMZN.

Amazon has approximately 500 million shares outstanding.  If they prefer to hold on to their cash, they can offer 2 - 3 million shares to complete an acquistion in the range of $5 - $10 billion.   That would cause little dilution and would create significant value in the AMZN pharmacy business."
2021-05-28 10:06:18,wallstreetbets,Their net profit was 386$ billion last year. An 84% increase over year. They absolutely have that much cash on hand. It's literally incomprehensible.

I have friends who work for cvs and they absolutely hate it. 

It‚Äôs not physical labor. Just a lot of bs to deal with and not enough staff compared to other chains."

2021-05-28 11:12:13,wallstreetbets,"Agreed --- A buyout would be in the range of $2 - $3 billion, or potentially even higher if a bidding war breaks out between Amazon and Walmart."

2021-05-28 16:43:51,wallstreetbets,"To Amazon would be more. To shareholders it would be 30% on top. You have to remember Amazon would have to either assume the debt they have or pay it off. If I remember correctly, rite aid debt is in 4-6 billion range. So Amazon‚Äôs purchase price would be 1.3 plus the debt. Somewhere around 5-8 billion. The shareholders won‚Äôt get double or triple price unless there is a run on stock. 

Wonder if Amazon will keep thrifty ice cream if they do buy it."
2021-05-28 16:51:19,wallstreetbets,"Debt is only $3.1 billion now after the sale of 1,900+ stores to Walgreens.

The minimum price to acquire RAD with it‚Äôs current 2,500+ stores would be $2-3 billion plus the debt payoff.  Otherwise, Rite Aid would never make the deal.  That would mean a sale share price in the range of $40-$60.  So a double or triple from today‚Äôs RAD share price is definitely possible."
2021-05-28 16:54:31,wallstreetbets,You are rite. Didn‚Äôt factor it in. They would still have to also assume all payables. Liabilities in the 6b range.
2021-05-28 17:37:05,wallstreetbets,"The receivables and cash + cash equivalents more than offset the payables.  The net long term debt is currently down to $3.1 billion.  So, if the company is bought out for $50 per share that equates to a sale price of $2.75 billion.  Add to that the $3.1 billion debt, and the total cost to buy Rite Aid for $50 per share is $5.85 billion.  Not bad for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue."

# SPY SG:

Looks like low volatility day. Play tight.

Note from SG: ""For todays expiration our models show about 15% SPX /30% SPY gamma expiring, which could allow volatility increase a bit into next week. This in turn may free markets for a push up into that 4250 target (Call Wall) area.""

Gamma Index: decreased to -0.1 (A large negative figure indicates volatility may be high. The range is from 4 to ‚Äì4.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 419 (Important support and resistance level. (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged

Gamma Notional: Decreased to $-516 (stock has larger put gamma position. A negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying)

Put Wall Support: Increased to 419 (If Put Wall shifts to a higher strike it could be a bearish indication)

Call Wall Strike: Increased to 425 (When this strike is rolled higher it is generally considered bullish)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.88	 (when decreasing it‚Äôs a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Increased to 198k (positive delta position infers options market makers have a net long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.06 (When the ratio shifts towards 0 it indicates call demand)

2021-05-28 10:43:12,wallstreetbets,Looking like we will be pinned close to 420 most of day IMO. Next week should see more volatility :)
2021-05-28 14:08:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah Im hoping at 3pm it would make a move smh
2021-05-28 09:27:37,wallstreetbets,I think I'm picking up some 0dte 421c lottery tickets
2021-05-28 10:32:01,wallstreetbets,"Sorry. I gto super busy with the kids :)

Slow day AGAIN..."
2021-05-28 10:32:25,wallstreetbets,NLG today.
2021-05-28 10:54:23,wallstreetbets,I think we will be pinned at around 420 - which is the abs gamma strike. Pending any black swan news IMO.
2021-05-28 12:36:14,wallstreetbets,Sorry for spamming I‚Äôm just trying to get someone‚Äôs attention who can help out
2021-05-28 10:20:04,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt believe the market hasn‚Äôt reacted. Perhaps waiting for infrastructure plans.
2021-05-28 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,"That's actually very normal, and considering that you're measuring from bottom to top, arguably, that's a bit low."
2021-05-28 11:55:37,wallstreetbets,you mean tuesday?
2021-05-28 09:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bud. 

Been following these posts for about a week now. Lovely TA, great reads. Thanks for posting."
2021-05-28 17:41:54,wallstreetbets,Your posts are very helpful. But for SPY and other ETFs  volume should not matter rjght? It should simply track the prices of the underlying holdings.
2021-05-28 09:09:27,wallstreetbets,SPY is above the 420.79 in the PM. We might just make it.
2021-05-28 10:53:52,wallstreetbets,"its only 2 spx call contracts they went to a low of 125 from 400 avg. Was thinking of buying 30 more contracts and sell on the next spike, was too late and missed out on turning that 500 dollar loss into a 3200 dollar gain"
2021-05-28 10:32:55,wallstreetbets,No worries.  Mind if I cross post.
2021-05-28 14:09:15,wallstreetbets,Think I should sell for a loss or do you think we will pop through on 6/1

I've been buying SPY 6/18 p420  this morning on the molehill peaks and selling on the potholes, but this is a stupid way to make a couple hundred dollars. There was a minute in there with less than 50k volume and the underlying.  Pretty sure I'm just trading options with thetagang."
2021-05-28 12:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure tradition_fee means Monday, just looking out for us and is making sure we play on a day we have a 0% chance of losing money"
2021-05-28 17:58:07,wallstreetbets,"It does when you're trading 0dte options. When implied volatility is high, expect big moves - more money lost or more money won for the day. When we see a break in resistance we should see a heathy volume increase, in relation to the days average, illustrated by the volume indicator"
2021-05-28 09:15:23,wallstreetbets,Needs to hold and we should get 422 imo. Let‚Äôs see :)
2021-05-28 09:44:28,wallstreetbets,Not happening it seems like. Another slight green day but sideways movement. Thinking of taking profit on my 419C or should I let greed take over üßê
2021-05-28 09:55:16,wallstreetbets,Low volatility read today. I‚Äôm out personally. Focusing on fubo and crm atm

2021-05-28 08:18:43,wallstreetbets,"No no, this one matters. 111 broke a barrier for us."
2021-05-28 09:27:39,wallstreetbets,"PLTR Bears-Priced in, ""only 30,50,100 mil.contract"" , 40 billion valuation etc ... Yeah except PLTR is growing at 50 percent YOY despite the fact they entered the private sector just recently.Also it seems that they are getting those kinds of contracts on a weekly basis. Is this priced in???"
2021-05-28 08:19:53,wallstreetbets,"$111 mil is...ridiculously cheap for something called ""Mission Command Platform"" - especially for the US military - especially for its most elite forces...

I'd say multiply that by 10x and we'll have the first beta-testable version."

2021-05-28 10:01:03,wallstreetbets,Yes to the moon above 24
2021-05-28 08:18:08,wallstreetbets,prepare for the dip
2021-05-28 08:17:41,wallstreetbets,So it should drop to single digits then
2021-05-28 11:23:01,wallstreetbets,$PLTR to the mooon
2021-05-28 08:49:58,wallstreetbets,"If my extensive research is correct, this should be priced in already. We can expect a pretty significant dip today. About time too, I've been in the green with this stock for days, it's making me uncomfortable"
2021-05-28 10:27:04,wallstreetbets,I thought Palantir was a cannabis stock
2021-05-28 09:25:53,wallstreetbets,To the mooooon $PLTR $PLTR
2021-05-28 11:05:58,wallstreetbets,$PLTR is something special and priced stupidly low rightnow but not for long.
2021-05-28 16:40:35,wallstreetbets,It was up like 6% or so today and just gradually farted out all the gains. I do not understand how this stock is not at $50.
2021-05-28 09:46:59,wallstreetbets,On a per year basis this contract alone would make Palantir the highest paid NFL player. Sorry broke ass Mahomes!
2021-05-28 09:57:51,wallstreetbets,PLTR dropping to 18 was soooo nice of themüöÄüöÄ
2021-05-28 08:17:54,wallstreetbets,Now it‚Äôs going to drop
2021-05-28 09:03:44,wallstreetbets,"Palantir relies too heavily on government contracts. You know like Boeing ,Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin . You can‚Äôt get a big market cap off of government contracts"
2021-05-28 10:07:14,wallstreetbets,finally some üöÄüöÄ's today!!    do we have enough gas?
2021-05-28 10:35:39,wallstreetbets,This is a very expensive PowerPoint presentation.
2021-05-28 16:25:01,wallstreetbets,"Palantir has a remarkable, elegant concept for years. Bespoke approach to  very particular challenges.
Worth every penny."
2021-05-28 16:36:14,wallstreetbets,"So in PLTR life, good news means buy puts right?"
2021-05-28 10:03:21,wallstreetbets,"Well, if it dips further. I'll just buy more. This company's stock is seriously undervalued. Plus, with them winning all these major gov and commercial contracts, basically puts them in place for FOREVER recurring revenue streams. Couple that with the fact that they keep beating earnings call reports QoQ, and still being so low. Well, bigger forces at play here, clearly."
2021-05-28 10:57:08,wallstreetbets,LOL at the Palantir employees blatantly exploiting the WSB phenomenon.
2021-05-28 10:10:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok, stock going down. Got it!"
2021-05-28 08:58:23,wallstreetbets,Looks like 1 year with a 2nd year option.  Very nice.
2021-05-28 09:45:14,wallstreetbets,Should I buy ?

2021-05-28 12:26:19,wallstreetbets,111M sounds awesome for a company that has the innovative software to just sit back and make money.
2021-05-28 13:14:45,wallstreetbets,Outside of employee comp- all news has been positive.   They also have a knack for increasing revenue with existing clients. That tells me they deliver!  Holding the line long term!
2021-05-28 19:00:30,wallstreetbets,"Great, palantir going to be down then"
2021-05-28 19:29:57,wallstreetbets,I'm looking forward to buying the dip on this news.
2021-05-28 08:20:23,wallstreetbets,Already priced in?
2021-05-28 11:02:12,wallstreetbets,So the stock is going to tank?!
2021-05-28 13:53:01,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt worry it will drop 7 dollars now
2021-05-28 12:23:43,wallstreetbets,"None of these contracts are anywhere near the size it would take to move the stock or be worth caring about.  From a gov't contracting standpoint this is a literally drop in the bucket. 

Palantir is a small-ass company, but not small enough that a win like this matters much.  They also aren't going to be locking up Lockheed Martin size mega contracts to manufacture airplanes or something that would be enough to move the price with 1 win."
2021-05-28 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a dead stock
2021-05-28 14:20:16,wallstreetbets,"That's an upcoming long weekend Pay for the CEO.

2021-05-28 15:59:45,wallstreetbets,PLTR is a garbage stock and anyone who invests in it obviously hates money and themselves...

""What is this? A Mission Command Platform for ants?!?!"""
2021-05-28 08:45:48,wallstreetbets,Exactly what I was thinking. Sounds like they got lowballed.
2021-05-28 09:31:47,wallstreetbets,The article says it they are ‚Äúcontinuing their work‚Äù which just means it was a re-compete and the incumbent captured it. Just follow on to the contract they were already awarded for additional years
2021-05-28 10:14:46,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a one year contract with an optional second year. $111 million for one year is a big deal dude.
2021-05-28 10:40:41,wallstreetbets,You'd think it's cheap but it's probably the size of a studio apartment.
2021-05-28 11:31:21,wallstreetbets,I work in the field. It is not unreasonable. Then there are ECP's and possibly several other rounds of funding. We should all know that the first award is never the end of it.
2021-05-28 10:31:15,wallstreetbets,All of pltrs contracts are so gd cheap its weird. Like they the only contractor not taking advantage. Other contractors charge 15x as much
2021-05-28 09:31:49,wallstreetbets,"Mmmm... nah, probably not. 

First, SOCOM gets what they want and they don't care about money. Of all the combatant commands, SOCOM is the biggest trust fund baby. These are the dudes who authorize requests for entire palettes of cash and send them to remote locations in like 48 hours because they need to pay off a HUMINT source or buy a bunch of trucks under the table. Or buy up like 1,000 very particular battle rifles because a few team guys said they felt really good on the range, so hey, now they're an option for everyone. 

Second, a ""mission command platform,"" while probably pretty fancy for SOCOM, ultimately is never THAT fancy. It's software. Try googling ""CPOF."" That's what conventional units get. Now THAT'S your government budget shit."

2021-05-28 18:07:04,wallstreetbets,It's not a Microsoft level contract but $111 mil is 10% of last years revenue
2021-05-28 19:17:19,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just the initial cost of software development right? Or did I misunderstand that. I‚Äôd think that most of the money made would follow this step. What do I know I‚Äôm just an ape.

2021-05-28 14:00:13,wallstreetbets,"Half for each year, 111 is the total."
2021-05-28 11:33:35,wallstreetbets,Long game. Get small contracts now and keep upselling new things and as the insider your systems incrementally improve and you have an eye on the features the end user really need and you charge for that and the ongoing service and maintenance and pretty soon you are making crazy money but you need a finger in every pie.
2021-05-28 12:27:43,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is a small software company.  The big contracts (from a dollar not margin standpoint) go to manufacturing stuff, which is clearly not their game.  

Their business model is a whole bunch of small contracts.  None of this crap is worth getting worked up over."
2021-05-28 17:19:57,wallstreetbets,"A palette of cash is a pretty funny concept.

2021-05-28 09:08:20,wallstreetbets,Only to dip more with more good news
2021-05-28 12:04:09,wallstreetbets,That's just how Palantir rolls
2021-05-28 13:06:25,wallstreetbets,In the past Palantir dropped every time when there was good news.
2021-05-28 10:33:37,wallstreetbets,"lol.  Bro PLTR could discover alien life forms living within the information stored in server farms and these MFs would be like.

2021-05-28 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,how
2021-05-28 14:38:17,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is all about dangling the carrot. Their strategy is basically get a contract for cheap to develop the software, deliver the product, and then customer extends that contract in perpetuity because they are now hooked and cannot perform to the same efficiency or profit margins without that software."
2021-05-28 09:45:58,wallstreetbets,This is how it always works. They'll add features later on that the client will want and pay for
2021-05-28 09:44:36,wallstreetbets,Exactly my thinking
2021-05-28 10:36:01,wallstreetbets,"That makes more sense, thanks!"
2021-05-28 11:26:36,wallstreetbets,Gotta love democrat spending! Get the money bois
2021-05-28 18:15:25,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not how sole source acquisitions work. There are specific criteria that need to met before a contract can be awarded without open competition. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúwe really like this company‚Äù it‚Äôs usually, ‚Äúthere is only one company that can provide the thing we need in the time requirement‚Äù"
2021-05-28 17:23:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I‚Äôm not too familiar with Palantir‚Äôs past performance, just a few months into a role with heavy capture and BD. Oddly enough I was reaching out to a few people from there today to set some sync meetings haha"
2021-05-28 13:01:05,wallstreetbets,Not small for long tho
2021-05-28 13:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Don't discount Tom Clancy.  His description of the inside of an Los Angeles sub was so accurate the FBI investigated him to see if he had access to restricted information.


Also, I know a bunch of military guys and a a couple spec ops guys.  The general attitude is that special operations gets whatever they want and even the operators will admit to that."
2021-05-28 15:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Am military, and am friends with defense contractors that supply special forces. What he said is 100% accurate."
2021-05-28 10:56:10,wallstreetbets,Throw all the shade you want. I'm sure there's plenty others in the sub who have a wild first hand story about special operators getting wild shit under wild circumstances.

2021-05-28 19:06:29,wallstreetbets,"I agree it isn‚Äôt just willy nilly. I guess you could change my comment to say ‚Äúwe really need this software and no one else can provide it‚Äù.

Seems a bit semantic. They obviously do ‚Äúlike‚Äù it more than whatever they used before Palantir."
2021-05-28 15:26:55,wallstreetbets,"What's a ""Los Angeles sub""?"
2021-05-28 11:31:37,wallstreetbets,"It isn't as easy now that a lot of the combat zones are being ""closed"" down as US draws down in Afghanistan, iraq and Syria.

20 years of whack a mole is coming to a close.

That and the bigger side of the branches are always pissy about the money spent on Special Operations.

But once PLTR gets inside then PLTR can start showing off the other neat things they can do and pretty soon PLTR is a pretty big line item in the budget."
2021-05-28 13:34:30,wallstreetbets,My BN TF (650 Soldiers) did a couple joint training exercises with the Royal Thai army a few years back. The SF group from our installation came out to train as well. Our BN TF slept on cots with mosquito nets in the middle of the jungle. The SF guys got a hotel.

 -üöÄMexico/US P3 trials and Price outlook üöÄ-
Nvax has P3 data coming In June. (7-14 days probable, end of June worst case) for their Corona Vaccine, along with other catalysts in the next few months (approval most likely slated for July-August for US ,UK ,South Korea, and the list starts there ). . Profits at the end of 2022 are going to be the equivalent or close to Moderna.  Moderna is a 75 billion MC while we are a 11 billion MC (About 7x less of a MC  then moderna right now) So next year when our profit matches moderna's and our market cap matches we have about a 7x potential which will put share price between $850 to $1000. (Nvax is $150 right now so $150 x 7 is what the market expects)  Chart on Contracts nvax has and what future prices/MC is expected to be is down below in the ""DD literature section"" at the bottom



-üöÄ Intro to Protein and mRNA type VaccinesüöÄ -
Protein vaccines are the most efficient at handling Covid variant strains (more on that in paragraph below) so as time goes on, and variant strains mutate/ get worse ..... other vaccines will get more and more ineffective.  Other types of vaccines that can handle variants are Pfizer and moderna, but they still only take a portion of these Spike protein. ... versus nvax which makes the whole spike protein. Why did why does this matter? put it this way...

             
                           
-üöÄDifferences how Protein vs.mRNA vaxs worküöÄ -
Imagine if the whole spike protein is like a picture. Then I took that picture and I chopped it up into 100 pieces... what Moderna does it takes one piece of that picture and tells your body to recognize it to understand the whole picture, and helps modify your Messenger RNA to recognize the virus. What Nvax does, it uses more of a complete picture... almost all the pieces of the picture, so as the virus mutates  one piece of that picture it can still recognize the virus due to being able to see various other parts of the picture. In the mRNA method using one portion of the picture as virus mutates,  it becomes easy to distort and not recognize the picture anymore therefore needing to always update your vaccine ... that's what moderna and Pfzer have to do.  Because of this using the whole Spike protein via a protein vaccine is the most effective type of vaccine for covid. .... And due to this I expect protein vaccines will be the most in demand due to using a full length protein.



-üöÄ Safety, Side Effects, and Adjuvenants  üöÄ-
 Every vaccine uses what's called an adjuvenant. This basically boosts the vaccines effectiveness. There's different kinds, and every company uses one in their vaccine. Not all are created equal. What makes Nvaxs adjuvenant (called Matrix M) so special is its the only plant based (soapbark tree) adjuvenant out there, and is the least irritating. This adjuvenant has been tested on pregnant women in the past and pases with the flying colors. mRNA adjuvenant vaccines use common molecules found in viruses and bacteria that stimulate our immune system. This approach has not been fully tested on pregnant women long term. One of the most common types that were used in the past were aluminum salts. They were found not to be ""harmful"" but we also didn't know enough about them and how they affect us on a grander scale. A lot of anti-vaxxers are against aluminum salts and giving it to the children. This is why Nvax will be the perfect solution for anti-vaxxers, children and the eldery that want something completely safe. Just using the term plant-based in a vaccine adds a good connotation, let alone the stronger protection/immune responce it provides. As far as what the virus is grown in,  Nvax uses a moth based formula. So it's insect and plant-based. Sounds like the Karen's will love this! Ultra safe. 


Adjuvenants work by creating an irritation/inflammation at the injection site, This in turn helps the vaccines be more effective apon administration. This is what makes you feel sore after getting a vaccine and specifically amount of adjuvenate that being used.  NVAX only needs to use 5mM vs  mRNA type vaccines use anywhere from 50 to 100 mM of adjuvenant. Therefore when getting a mRNA type vaccines you get a much stronger side effect due to the large amount being used. This is proof how effective nvax is because they need to use so little to be to get a strong immune response. Hence why they have the best data and we're called a first in class vaccine. In conjunction with how much adjuvenant is being used you can also say it directly alters the safety profile. Use too much and you get too many bad reactions. This is why Nvax has one of the best safety profiles out there.Hands down üôå Bottom of my post is a link with a lot of the data charted out that includes all the side effects of each vaccine charted.


 Lastly because the amount of ajuvenant used in mRNA type vaccines can only fit one maybe two strains max before throwing off the safety profile and risking not getting approval.  If they do use two strains they have to use less adjuvenant for both to combine them, meaning you're not going to get complete protection for each strain from the vaccine.  Nvax does not have this problem because of the such small amount they use, they could combine up to five different strains without an issue.... And right now with it being so clear that covid strains are going to keep mutating we need vaccines thay can cover multiple strains and give full protection on each one. Sometimes one strain can cover multiple strains but depending on where the strain mutates, a bad mutation will require addressing each strain individually and putting them together in one vaccine. Since you can't get four strains in one mRNA vaccine this puts us out at a clear advantage down the road when people need to do booster shots, and don't want to get multiple vaccines through the year.  So all in all it's clear Nvax adjuvenant separates itself from the pack and performs much better then other kinds on Safety, Effectiveness, Coverage of all strains and convenience of less shots in a given year.


-üöÄ Logistics and Storage.üöÄ -
Nvax can be stored in a regular refrigerator, and can be left out to sit out in room temperature for a while while you're vaccinating people. A special ultra low temp freezer is needed for the current MRNA type vaccines. Middle income to low-income countries can't afford the special freezers. This is a majority of the world, not to mention the intricate ways you got to handle it so increases your distribution cost because you need special warehouses, dry ice etc. Also makes it easier logistically/cheaper for NVAX to store and ship using regular freezers.

                 
- üöÄ Scientific conclusion üöÄ  -
So far nvax is the only protein type vaccine coming to the market (vs mRNA type like Pfizer or moderna..... or inactivated vaccine...like JnJ or Astrazeneca). As of now Nvax elicits the strongest immune response out of any vaccine with the highest efficacy. Another thing that's really important to know is every trial is not built the same. Every company creates different end points for their trials. Some are looking for severe disease, some are counting everything mild, medium and severe. Nvax counted every single possible infection whether it was mild medium or severe. Case in point j&j didn't have very good efficacy in South Africa so what they did was they only counted the most severe cases so they could say that their vaccine works. (Great you won't die but you'll get so sick you wish you did).
 When looking at mild cases their vaccine didn't work very well. This is why it's always hard to tell apples to apples when you look at efficacy numbers because every trial is different. So you have to look at the devil in the details. 


It's getting harder and harder to get trials done because people just want to get the approved vaccines. This puts other competitors far behind us, giving nvax a economic moat of profit untill 2025 at least. Their pipeline is amazing! They teamed up with Oxford for malaria vaccine that's in the third phase right now. ( second phase results for malaria vax was at 77% efficacy which of P3 is the same it's good enough for approval). Their flu vaccine had the highest efficacy vs any commercial flu vaccine, and phase 3 is already complete and now they're moving on for approval. They will running a trial on their flu and covid combo vaccine, and once launched they could double the price of current covid vaccine due to being a 2 for 1. Moderna and Pfizer are also looking at a combo shot but they haven't even started trials yet. The problem is they can't even finish their trials because flu is non-existent right now so be very hard for them to get trials done for a long time. 



 -üöÄ Investment Thesis & Financials  üöÄ-
Nvax is pretty much de-risked at this point vs where they were a year ago. Yes you could buy other biotechs that can go up 20x, but they are a gamble. This is a pre-revenue biotech that's more starting to make revenue of a giant pharma. (Hell of a scale up, generally takes years for companies to get to this point if not decades.) They have all successful trials, successful manufacturing officially set up, 2 billion dollars on the balance sheet, $2 billion dollars invested from the US government for ""operation warp speed"" (a program created during the Trump era to speed up vaccine development). They are expected to ship 2 billion vaccines next year. So this is the moment in time where this investment moves from risk to a much safer investment; where you can set it and forget for a year and not worry about failure. CEO came out and said "" all manufacturing now is done and set in place, there are no more issues or glitches to worry about and a year from now we'll be looking back as this being a major success""


They're the most undervalued covid play right with the lowest float to future earnings ratio and high short ratio that's about to get squeezed in the coming weeks. The before Memorial day weekend on one trading day before market close 4 million shares were bought 5 minutes before close.  Representing about 80% of the daily trading volume in 5 minutes on no specific news. Hedges are repositioning towards long and a lot have bought in this last month. Institutional investment is about 70% in the company. 
 Fidelity & Rowe Price etc have all added... and now is a good time to squeeze the small float while the shorts have a high ratio. 


A link for future outlook chart on forward earnings broken down per contract is at the bottom of the post in DD literature section. It converts future contracts that are a done deal into future market cap/stock price. With all current contracts and current negotiations stock will hit $850 -1000. IMO $800 easily by end of next year. Now would be a good time to buy some July 200-250 strikes and flip in mid June for shares/or more options when P3 results come out.  In June, anticipation will also grow for approval which will increase the implied volatility by a lot ....securing you a decent profit on options. 



 -üöÄMy Positions üöÄ -
As far as my position I own some $200 July calls along with about 933 shares. I'm all in baby.  Been in since $4.06, I panicked and sold once during February a couple months during the mini bear market and got back in a bit too early so got a wash sale as well üôà but I'm diamond hands all the way to $800 from here.  LFG  (Check out next link below this paragraph, it has My positions with the price chart mentioned above. My screen name on stocktwits is Johnnyknowsbest. Been on there and here since i started with nvaxz feel free and drop a follow if you want up to date info. But honestly the whole board is worth following there's so much good DD on there, we have a really strong tight knit group of longs that help each other with DD. 


Also below this paragraph is a link for the last earnings call and the lastest investor presentation, and the last link is a interview with CNBC with the CEO, where he talks about the data is coming before the end of June, but he said he thinks it could be earlier.  So sounds like 2 weeks is on par or close to it. Also discusses brand new information on how they are launching a covid flu trial this year. 

I expect this to squeeze hard in June. Feel free and AMA, been researching NVAX for over a decade.

2021-05-28 07:18:10,wallstreetbets,"Biden mentioned them as the next vaccine to get approval. Manufacturing wise they will be producing just as much as Pfizer and more than moderna. Take a look on stocktwits for more DD. AY888 is great resource on Stocktwits. They are going to be one of the largest players in the covid space. Everyone in the biotech community knows of them and they're very well known. They will be providing 1.1 billion doses to Covax, an international effort to get vaccines across the world to mid to low income countries. Along with that they have a lot of contracts with higher end countries and a contract with the EU is expected for 200 million doses. Right now their market cap is going to be what their revenue is going to be next year. So at a minimum of 4X but I expect 7x without a problem personally due to the unique nature of their product having the strongest antibodies and variant protection."

2021-05-28 12:50:48,wallstreetbets,"So a couple days ago the CEO said in a couple weeks the data will be published before the end of June but he expects earlier than that (on CNBC). So I expect possibly and one to two weeks worst case 3 weeks.  

Turn to the 1 minute mark in the link to the video below and listen to the CEOs response at the 1:15 minite mark. That's where he mentions a how long and this was a couple days ago. Always better to get in a little earlier than gauge it late.

2021-05-28 15:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Because of the P3 data coming out and anticipation of approval in July, come mid-june implied volatility will be pretty high on options and price will already be much higher due to P3 results will have been released by then. At that point everything coming together for novavax for approval  as well. So I was saying easy to buy the July $200-250 call options and sell them in June a month from now and collect some nice profits. Then that would give you some nice working capital to go with Jan 300 2022 call options or buy some shares with the profits as 2022 will be a strong year."

My position and DD Chart of contracts priced out into future share price/MC


I originally bought 737 shares for a lil for about $2,992 @ $4.06. I've added a lil over 200 shares since then and occasionally sell 5-10% to buy options. Since the GME Robinhood incident where they restricted selling, I ditched Robinhood and got a Ameritrade account and never looked back. That pissed me off because they also restricted Nvax on the day it biggest gains of the year. Anyway my autistic ass paniƒá sold in the February market crash to rebuy a falling knife and get a wash sale üôà. I know, I know bonehead move. So my wash sale got added to my position and gonna pay the taxman a nice visit next year. But over all not bad about $6k invested and I'm sitting at $139,720 altogether now with options and stocks. Could be worse could be better but I'mma take it with a chip on my shoulder and get ready for round 2. With all their contracts this will moon to $800 over the next year or so. DD is easy 7x from here so lm not selling untill then.  $1,000,000 is my goal LFG! üöÄüåö"
2021-05-28 06:59:28,wallstreetbets,Just let me know what you want me to explain and I'll go into detail for you.
2021-05-28 08:18:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes CEO said they will be filing early Q3, being July. That's what I originally mentioned in the first sentence of my DD. (Just to clarify) That's a lil over a month away. In about 1 to 2 weeks US/Mexico P3 results are coming out. There's a lot of other catalysts such as EU approval for 200 million vaccines coming. There's a steady stream of catalysts coming, institutions bought and brought up the ownership to 70% in last 3 weeks. A lot going on for this stock. 

Approval getting pushed back 6 weeks is not a big deal, as theres too much demand for the next 4 years for covid vaccines. A lot of people think this is a race but it's really a race to do it right so sometimes taking your time and setting up manufacturing the right way and doing trials the right way will get you past the competition. And to top it off all the approved vaccines right now couldn't even vaccinate the world due to short supplies and too much demand. A lot of people want to think about the US demand is done because the US got at least 50% of people with one shot. The fact is most of the profits are going to be overseas. And we will be the go-to for booster shots due to our superior multi-strain protection. The US makes a very small portion of the revenue. With only 5% of the world being vaccinated there isn't enough vaccines in the next year to cover the world we're going to need a lot more than just nvax. So they will be selling at max manufacturing capacity for the next 4 years. Either way they're still producing vaccines as we speak versus Pfizer and moderna that started producing after they got approval and it took them awhile to get stockpile a ready before they could give out vaccines. So regardless, time-wise it's going to be basically the same in that regard because their stockpiling before approval so when approval comes they can hit the ground running versus when their competitors got approved they  stumbled out the gate with manufacturing.

Also last tidbit they can be stored at regular temperatures unlike mRNA type vaccines. One of the reasons why 1.1 billion doses of Novavax will be delivered to mid to low income countries because they can't afford crazy freezers for Pfizer and Moderna."
2021-05-28 09:37:06,wallstreetbets,"As far as approval we have the best covid vaccine data in the world to date! Better then Pfizer, Moderna JnJ etc. Not only that we have the most comprehensive data they took the time to get the most diverse population which made the trials tougher to show a good result, and still we had the best result vs our competition. The competition just breezed through their trials and brought in a bunch of white people to make it easy. For example we did a phase 2 trial in Africa with Africans and HIV positive Africans, nobody else wanted to do that because they're afraid of bringing their results down. But this is how you build comprehensive data and that's how you get approvals all around the world. This is why it took them a little bit longer to get across the finish line, but for all the right reasons it took longer and will benefit shareholders exponentially more in the future due to that. Because of the diversity of the trials the data is gold, Biden is teaming up with South Korea to send 4 billion dollars worth of Nvax overseas to low-income countries as well. So if the president say that NVAX is coming out.... it's not a matter of if, but a matter of when. The vaccine is very much needed right now so there's a big push to get it out there as soon as possible but also launch with manufacturing ducks all in a row unlike Johnson & Johnson who had manufacturing hiccups; that's why we're taking our time to make sure everything's perfect and we don't disappoint our customers like AstraZeneca disappointed the European Union and now they're getting sued and not getting any more orders. 
 There's been scientific peer reviewed papers published on our vaccine by top scientists saying we're first in class and all the analysts agree. Including B.Riley FBR 5 star analyst Mayank Mamtani. Link below on what he has to say

[5 star analyst from B.Riely explains why nvax has the edge the over it's competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-edge-215910558.html)


As far as Viotility goes...it was connected to overall markets. We hit 330 last time we reported data, the same week GME took off. When the markets took a big dip late February and in March we followed just like gme so we went down with the market. Then the CEO was kind of quiet while they were getting manufacturing worked out and we got hit with a lot of shorts like GME or AMC. In the last couple weeks manufacturing has been all sorted out. The FDA has been in communication with us and basically all the ""t's and i's"" have been crossed and dotted. We are about to hand in our FDA submission for approval any week with the anticipation of July approval...or very close to it.

Whenever a biotech is pre-revenue the share price is all over the place. We are finally entering the stage of revenue. Went from being in the negative in 2019 to having two billion dollars in our balance sheet from deposits on purchase orders. So now we have orders finalized, manufacturing finalized. And Governments.... not companies, but governments sending us millions and billions dollars worth of orders that are locked and loaded and some already negotiating for years ahead.

During the last earnings call the CEO said it was just going to be another couple months until approval and everybody got their panties up in a bunch and thought approval was going to be within a couple weeks so there was a sell-off. But there's no reason for a giant sell-off when approval is coming weeks down the road, people just aren't patient these days. That being said we're supposed to start getting approvals from different countries in July. 

All in all this is the moment in time where the volatility will start getting a little bit better and we should be over 250 without a problem as a support. The average analyst price Target is double the stock price right now and target price by analysts will go up once manufacturing starts and countries recieve doses.(nobody wants to hurt their five star rating so they adjust accordingly as developments happen with the company, and we got a lot of developments coming this year)"

2021-05-28 13:12:51,wallstreetbets,It all depends how long it takes put together the package it's a lot of paperwork and they are simultaneously doing it with multiple countries around the world at the same time every country is a different regulatory agency that follows by different rules so it's no easy task obviously they're pushing for us approval but things like getting the UK approval would open up the doors also the other approvals. July has been the most common time frame talked about within the investor community on stocktwits and twitter. They also have agreements for July with the Philippines &  South Korea and Covax will start shipping some of their 1.1 billion vax agreement. So approvals should start rolling in soon. L I think a lot of countries are waiting for the US but there are countries that have their own decently well-established regulatory agencies that can act on their own.  Worst case it's an couple weeks to a month but at that stage in the game I don't expect to see a giant dip in the price because longs are not going to want to sell their shares.

2021-05-28 11:10:04,wallstreetbets,ELON NOW ACCEPTING AMC SHARES AS PAYMENT FOR TESLA'S.
2021-05-28 11:38:06,wallstreetbets,"Not doing a write-up as a full post, but here's the current gamma structure of AMC as of open this AM. It's probably shifted some as people jet in and out of options. The spike at open probably corresponded to dealer hedging of all of those calls in the 30-35 range that became in or very near the money today.

[https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8](https://imgur.com/a/Qw27FB8)

Note that about half of the gamma vaporizes today and with that is a lot of delta evaporating too (about 18% of total delta). And, the dealers at open were holding $3.7B of shares as well according to spot gamma. That value would've climbed up significantly in the open. That means that you may see something more like 25-30% of delta getting dropped from the open to the close, which ends up being more like $1.5B or something.

What does this mean? Well, it means that there will be selling pressure today if this price doesn't break out and fast. There's a gamma ramp down more than up, but more importantly, a lot of calls are expiring OTM today, and as the day goes on, dealers de-hedge by dumping stock they previously bought to protect themselves.

If a gamma squeeze up does happen, it would be hard for the price to go a lot past $40 because the options end there. And, there's a big gap between $35 and $40 in terms of dealer support, which we saw in the fizzle this morning.

You also have to contend with people monetizing ITM calls, but ITM puts will soon balance it, approximately around 30. For values under that, you get a slight buy into the close of people dropping puts instead of being assigned a short, and above that you get a sell into the close of people not wanting to hold a fistfull of AMC from their calls.

It's probably easier to buy this at a low today and hope for next week, than to win today, unless you see a big increase in momentum - the dealer flows will be very significant, and primarily to the downside (unless price well under $30 near close, then you could see buying up as people dump ITM puts expiring today)."

2021-05-28 10:50:23,wallstreetbets,SHFs are giving you one last discount today on GME.  They will do whatever it takes to try and make it close below 250.  Idk if they'll have enough ammo throughout the day to drop it into the 220s but they're gonna try like hell to get it that low.  If you're able to grab some moon tickets in the 220s or 230s today big congrats to you because this might be your final chance at a discount before the rocket takes off.  I'm predicting that the last half hour of trading today will be an epic battle for over/under 250.  Apes get your popcorn ready!!!

In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, and oil.
3. Pour the bowl of wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients and stir just until everything is moist. Avoid over stirring. It's okay if there are a few lumps.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared dish and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top and edges are golden brown. Cut into 8 pieces and serve."

2021-05-28 11:28:44,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness BB seems like a good stock. It's undervalued and has so many patents. Their tech is in like all major cars. I felt like I was too late for GME, by the time I started looking at calls it was way too expensive after its second run after that legendary ""would you buy at $40"" shit. But anyway I feel this is the one to get in at the ground and make some serious money. I never liked AMC, I'm not from The US and don't see how cinemas have a future but that's just my own opinion, no offence to anyone who probably knows a lot more than I do about AMC. Also my wife's boyfriend works in the city and told me he thinks this is the next big one."

2021-05-28 16:10:40,wallstreetbets,"AMC ended ended at $26 today. That's good. There are a ton of puts at $25 and under. Ideally it ended at $28, as there are about 200k calls at $27/$28. However, $26 is still pretty damn good.

GME was a bit less fortunate. At least it ended above $220, avoiding those 13k puts at that price. There are about 30k ITM puts. It's not THAT much, but still a decent chunk. It would have been nice for it to end the day at $240, ideally $300 or even $270. 

We might see some drop next week on GME before going back up. Either way I'm holding. GME 70 shares@~$270

EDIT: Aftermarket looks good. AMC might end up above $27 and GME maybe above $230. It's only a chance though."

Guess what the big bets were against today? GME as you look at the graph yesterday gme didn‚Äôt show great volume nor movements up till the end of the day. And right before close you betcha that the bets were coming in against gme and today they made a lot of money. They were ready it‚Äôs Friday this was their goal. Do we really want to see them win? Lack of effort today this all started with gme back in January and we looked the other way from the legendary gme."

So the value of the reward gained isn't currently worth breaking the trend. And Ape knows this.

And Ape knows other Apes know this as well.

And most importantly, oher Apes know that Ape knows that they know this.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Trainline dip | LSE Trainline has taken a huge dip since the UK government's announcement of the plan to nationalise the railway network. The plan includes creating an online ticketing platform by Great British Railways which might have a huge blow on Trainline revenue. However, this platform does not yet exist and will probably take a couple of years to develop. Moreover, it is unlikely that the already existing companies in the transport business will be excluded from the plan implementation as that would result in a fair few companies going bust and couple of thousands getting unemployed.

In the worst case scenario, Trainline still have its international ticket sales.  Year-on-year, its proportion of ticket sales in international markets has been growing. In 2018, this was 10% compared to 13% in 2019. In 2020, the proportion was closer to 30%.

I am bullish on this, as it would take a long time  for the government to implement the plan, hence, Trainline would have ample time to prepare and expand their services to other areas if need be in the future.

This is my first time making a post here, please do give constructive feedback and criticism.

I had a look at $BB and assume that we finally formed the bottom. In the last few days we saw a sharp rise which might continue in the next weeks. If we can break the 12$ resistance, the next targets would be aroung 25-28$. 

Using Elliot wave theory we are probably at the end of the correction wave 4 and now began with the bullish wave 5.

Price targets:

\#1 12$

\#2 25$

\#3 48$

The risk/reward is worth entering a trade here. I bought yesterday around 10$. My stop loss is below 8$.

2021-05-28 19:01:57,wallstreetbets,"DO NOT USE STOP LOSSES!!!!!!

Stop Losses are a bad move for these heavily-shorted stocks. Hedge funds pay big money for visibility for this data, because it gives them concrete targets for their short attacks. Now they know they can buy your shares for $8. This is not good for anybody except the shorts. KNOCK IT OFF!!"

2021-05-28 11:04:22,wallstreetbets,I'd say Minimum of $50/share by EOY but we could see higher especially with the deals they've been landing with all the auto manufacturers re QNX tech especially with future self driving cars/trucks in the future.

2021-05-28 05:37:26,wallstreetbets,What's an exit strategy
2021-05-28 10:19:24,wallstreetbets,I don't think it'll be worth $75 BILLION dollars any time soon (implied mcap if shares hit $150). This is coming from a shareholder and someone that actually understand the AWS and BB partnership
2021-05-28 14:40:17,wallstreetbets,"BS. 

Don't say shit like this. 

This echo chamber of rockets is what forced people in bag holding from when it was $25/share 

There were a few different things that sparked AMCs run. To add to it, there is still no evidence the shorts have covered."
2021-05-28 10:08:55,wallstreetbets,Yes

2021-05-28 08:42:55,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, this is sloppy as hell analysis. If you truly believe in your thesis and analysis and follow up by setting up a stop loss the same day you buy...well that just undermines your very own thesis even before you accept any criticism. Its just sloppy and shows no conviction in the play.

Never enter a new position and be unwilling to accept a red day or two. Rookie mistake."

2021-05-28 06:33:32,wallstreetbets,or they can hold as they see it growing faster as before and dont want to miss big earning if it reaches $40

2021-05-28 09:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Not an issue, lots of longs with Diamond hands. Apes want to ride long & fast, not short."

2021-05-28 09:13:14,wallstreetbets,I totally agree with you. The risk/reward is very nice and worth a trade IMHO
2021-05-28 11:46:20,wallstreetbets,"I have to ask..... with all the analysts figuring this stock is worth around $8USD and only two analysts with a BUY rating (NO STRONG BUYS), what do you know that they don't?  Exactly what fundamentals are you relying on???? Having dealt with analysts in the C-Suite on numerous occassions I am familiar with the level of detailed information they get.  I am having difficulty understanding how you would have access to more information and information they wouldn't consider, unless you are an insider with VP level info clearance.  Please advise..... thanks"
2021-05-28 10:02:14,wallstreetbets,Don't tell me what to invest in
2021-05-28 13:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I'm out"
2021-05-28 09:25:13,wallstreetbets,I think we are quite early here. Let's wait for the big moves :)
2021-05-28 11:33:49,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre already up over $1000 then, I hope you like money"
2021-05-28 13:17:32,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 09:12:14,wallstreetbets,I think this is probably correct. The price started climbing around the same time as GME and AMC this week so I am guessing this will be similar to back in January where BB rises along side those stocks. I have 200 shares and bag holding around $15.
2021-05-28 08:41:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah like that time it just hovered around $8 in January.
2021-05-28 09:43:56,wallstreetbets,So I should sell now and buy more at 8$? But..........

2021-05-28 09:13:49,wallstreetbets,"I don't think so, I think I read around 9% of the float is shorted for BB."
2021-05-28 09:24:43,wallstreetbets,Good choice! I am also here for the real gains
2021-05-28 11:32:41,wallstreetbets,Every share counts !!!
2021-05-28 11:32:29,wallstreetbets,samesies.
2021-05-28 11:45:51,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-05-28 12:57:30,wallstreetbets,I totally agree
2021-05-28 10:50:33,wallstreetbets,At what price?
2021-05-28 12:17:44,wallstreetbets,"Day's still young, they could still expire worthless today. :-/

Edit: and just like that you're back to free money. Or, $32/contract to close out the position early and take the rest of the afternoon off. 

FWIW, I had an order close out my position at break-even (I got my two month bagholder pin a couple of weeks ago) and jumped in with 6/11 calls at 12 and puts at 10 right at open. Sold half my calls to cover around 80% of the money, and I'm just hoping to ride the volatility for a few days."
2021-05-28 16:56:51,wallstreetbets,"10 myself, 15 7/2"
2021-05-28 15:28:52,wallstreetbets,Those 10 going to be worth a lot more than that soon!!
2021-05-28 05:29:20,wallstreetbets,"If you buy, you create momentum!"
2021-05-28 05:04:09,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this stock!!
2021-05-28 04:58:14,wallstreetbets,I assume that we will see a shift into $BB and $TLRY soon
2021-05-28 05:25:50,wallstreetbets,At this price there no fear in holding it if it doesn‚Äôt pop. You‚Äôll just become a long term investor
2021-05-28 05:24:10,wallstreetbets,GME to the Moon!
2021-05-28 05:05:11,wallstreetbets,I think it‚Äôs going to be sucking on AMC tail pipe today hopefully! Maybe I can finally dump these $20.10 bags I‚Äôve been holding since last January..
2021-05-28 09:48:05,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs where I am at but that is also how I lost out on on GME lol
2021-05-28 06:57:20,wallstreetbets,yeah worried we might soar past the moon and go straight to uranus
2021-05-28 13:56:48,wallstreetbets,Entirely depending on their patent sale progress. If they manage to close the deal then the ER can look very good.

2021-05-28 10:18:20,wallstreetbets,Well BBs lower market cap and all their cybersecurity stuff means they're severely undervalued.
2021-05-28 15:28:35,wallstreetbets,What's that? Do not comprehend...
2021-05-28 15:28:20,wallstreetbets,Great entry price considering it was $12 earlier today! It'll get back there Tuesday and rocket ship from there!
2021-05-28 13:57:49,wallstreetbets,"Nah BB is a decent company with lots in the pipeline coming up (Eg. Working with AWS). It's not going anywhere but up. Probably not a rocketship overnight like GME but definitely lots of room to take off and fly, which it will next week!"
2021-05-28 11:31:18,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 14:52:00,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-28 14:00:14,wallstreetbets,ooh! ahhh!!

2021-05-28 19:53:28,wallstreetbets,I have‚Ä¶ certain words for my own company! Every since they were bought out by an American company
2021-05-28 11:14:59,wallstreetbets,"What's the reasoning behind this? If they go belly up you lose your job and your stocks? 

If my company was publicly traded I'd have a few handful of their shares in my portfolio, nothing crazy. I'd feel obligated. LOL"
2021-05-28 13:57:12,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm holding due to the potential. All it‚Äôs gonna take is showing consistent revenue growth and they‚Äôll take off. 

They‚Äôre ramping up this year an incredible amount and it will interesting to see where they stand next January

You need to remember they had to change from a Damn phone company into a software, iot and cybersecurity company. That takes a lot of time and patience. Blackberry was after its huge decline from the 100+ on track to going bankrupt. And it was reversed. That‚Äôs a huge accomplishment in itself and people bash it all the time but they successfully made the transition. Also, blackberry has known to be extremely secure foreeeever, this is well known fact and large part of why they have so many government contracts"
2021-05-28 13:56:15,wallstreetbets,"If the company wasn't called BlackBerry and was called something else, without the past history of BB and all that baggage, this stock would be trading at $30-$50 at the moment with everything coming up in their pipeline. BB will get there eventually but will take time. If this were a new company it would be up there already with more room to grow!"
2021-05-28 15:11:44,wallstreetbets,"u/AqsaAbbasi \- Just looked at this. Lucky you sold at $27 but went back below $8-$10 consensus target price, so don't see how you did not get back in ? As to analysts, maybe BB management don't want to share all the information with analysts, or can't. Analysts are not the most entreprenurial types. Not hard to see BB doing some very neat things and they are partnering with the best in the world. I don't think Chen and Watsa spent all this time (7-10 years) and money NOT to succeed. Plus Chen gets most of his pay when the shares are at $16-$20 USD and $30 USD."
2021-05-28 05:02:51,wallstreetbets,I am in and I also plan to add today
2021-05-28 06:41:57,wallstreetbets,"i am not in currently due to lack of funds, and i think it might take some time so i have time to still get in, but as soon as i gather a fair sum i will defintely go in to BB."
2021-05-28 07:21:20,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm in. 6,000 shares. I believe they will continue to grow as a security company and with IVY coming to market around February 2022 the potential is huge"
2021-05-28 10:20:17,wallstreetbets,"Memes aside they have a lot of work to do. They are competing with Android for EV os, and while they definitely have advantages, the google ecosystem is probably the first option that comes to mind because of how well you can integrate stuff into it. I'm still long (only 44 shares) because if things go right their valuation will skyrocket. Holding strong until it goes to zero or 100."
2021-05-28 15:23:25,wallstreetbets,I got in about 4-5 months ago at $13.70 or something like that. it was always my long game because I think the company is severely undervalued.
2021-05-28 11:23:00,wallstreetbets,Agree.?dont know about price eoy. But itll get pretty far

2021-05-28 09:53:39,wallstreetbets,Lol survey says...
2021-05-28 10:58:32,wallstreetbets,I averaged down from $18 a share to under $10. Feels good.
2021-05-28 08:40:45,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-28 14:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but it fucking *sucks* knowing you have to throw more money at a **massive** loss to make it worth it lol"
2021-05-28 09:45:28,wallstreetbets,I figured it was a dead stock
2021-05-28 11:02:33,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt average down in an IRA :(

2021-05-28 08:56:05,wallstreetbets,Yup. Stop loss at 8 when it closed below 10 yesterday means OP doesn‚Äôt believe what he‚Äôs saying. 20% dip and he‚Äôs out?

2021-05-28 08:28:26,wallstreetbets,Constipated?
2021-05-28 05:20:03,wallstreetbets,Just shares. Thought about calls at 9.50$ expiring sometime before June 4 though... have lots of potential for sure.
2021-05-28 13:29:44,wallstreetbets,Great post BTW.
2021-05-28 14:54:27,wallstreetbets,"I don't know anything other than what is publicly available to anyone. Despite wild swings that can take place in a share price, in the end the fundamentals win the day. In the early days it is more subjective. Financial analysts work for IBs and not for the actual company they are researching. Yes sometimes both the company in question (like BB) and the IB are on the same side of the table BUT sometimes they are not. Financial analysts are not motivated to make bold calls or be subjective. They may eventually show up but usually much later, at which point the share price has likely appreciated quite a bit. They generally look for certainty. But one does not have to wait for the money to be on the books to know it‚Äôs coming. To make this point, 10 years ago FB had a user base of 50 million and NO revenues. Yet MSFT invested $246 million for a tiny stake valuing FB at $15 billion. This is not a crazy analogy becasue QNX has a user base of over 175 million. And IVY will have the ability to tap that. BB also has revenues. Using $15 billion equates to about $27 USD per share for BB. What if we used 175 million ? At the time many thought MSFT was crazy but today that $246 million would be worth $20 billion or 75x more. You suggest no financial analysts have a buy rating (most are SELL/HOLD). If this is the case, you can ask yourself, or the institutions in question, why are 50% plus of the BB shares held by institutions. Many of these are considered world class and very savvy. Allianz hold almost a quarter of a $ billion in shares when no analysts are recommending BB ? Why ? Because they do their own research (as you, or I or anyone should) and understand that IB analysts and IBs are not working for you and I or them. There are other reasons as well but kind of sums it up. Hope this was helpful."
2021-05-28 19:15:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't trust any of these analysts. With AMC, for example, most analysts were saying to sell, that it's only worth $2/share (when it was at like $8). And I was like well shit, and eventually succumbed to the groupthink and sold all mine for a small loss. If I'd ignored the ""experts"" I would be up pretty big today. 

Same with BB. Last month I sold 75% of my shares after all the analysts suddenly downgraded it from bullish to bearish (the dumb little Fidelity analyst scores on the positions page went from like 8.2 ""GOOD BUY"" to 2.0 ""SELL NOW"" like overnight). I basically broke even selling at \~8.50 but again, if I'd just ignored the BS I would be up like over 10% on those shares right now. 

I'm no longer giving these analyst ratings any credence. Plus it's the financial sector anyway, lots of money at stake and so much abstraction, who knows what fuckery is really going on. Maybe it was in some powerful player's interest for more people to sell the stock so some analysts got paid off to tell people to sell, and vwa-la; share price goes down and they can swoop in and get a free discount on bulk shares. Then later change the rating to a ""MUST BUY"" and watch the price go back up, sell for profit. Maybe that's just overly paranoid on my part but really it wouldn't be that hard to make serious money by just advertising some ""experts"" opinion to sway public behavior on a stock. But that aside, I've already missed out on profits twice now by acting on analysts' opinions instead of my own. Analysts also said GME wasn't worth shit, just about every single one of them was wrong"
2021-05-28 10:12:26,wallstreetbets,Big moves here. +20%!
2021-05-28 11:45:37,wallstreetbets,what are the possibilities here?
2021-05-28 11:41:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Suddenly, stocks are interesting again."
2021-05-28 10:23:11,wallstreetbets,Honestly i would if i was actually in the green
2021-05-28 17:12:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reassurance haha.
2021-05-28 17:28:38,wallstreetbets,Check back next week to see if I get rotisseried or üöÄüöÄüöÄ.
2021-05-28 10:57:11,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 10.78, at the last rally the price soared to 25$. 

If this wave will be greater, like 2nd amc wave, so there is a lot to expect"
2021-05-28 04:59:58,wallstreetbets,You think so? Also I'm wondering how much more amc/gme will go up
2021-05-28 06:56:37,wallstreetbets,TLRY? That's a ticker I haven't heard in a while. I've been a bag holding ape for a good 4 months now
2021-05-28 05:52:37,wallstreetbets,You didnt average down?
2021-05-28 09:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah I'm worried we'll leave the solar system and I'll never find my way back to earth again.  7,000 @ $12.  I have no doubts I'll be picked up soon for our journey."

2021-05-28 14:55:42,wallstreetbets,Huge news. This is why I went all in this morning!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
2021-05-28 13:00:27,wallstreetbets,Wrong - Android only competes on the infotainment system level. Even Blackberry suggests Android has advantages in terms of infotainment. And Blackberry / QNX work along side Android. Beneath the Android infotainment system is QNX. And QNX is beneath other aspects of the cars' critical operations. Android is not. There is widespread misconception about this. Plus QNX has years of experience over anyone else as well as safety certifications that are absolutely critical that no one has.
2021-05-28 11:32:15,wallstreetbets,Well I think we could see it spike to $ 50 and then settle by mid June to the 30's which is where it belongs. I do love it when users say they don't know about this price by EOY when literally there are a ton of stocks who definitely don't deserve the levels they're at but are. I honestly believe that not rebranding BB with a new name is a bad idea. I think when the new CEO comes in soon that they'll do it. Chen has had his run ( since 2013 ) but it's time for him to retire ( he's going to be 65 soon ) and they need to find someone young fresh and more energetic to run the company. If he wants to make his bonus compensation by putting the stock over $ 40 USD he best move faster. BB is a long play but it should pay off especially with their QNX tech and the future of electric and self driving vehicles. It's P/E is 50 vs others in its same field which are much higher.
2021-05-28 11:51:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah fucked myself with selling a CC this past tuesday. Good bye my sweet blackberry shares ive had since Jan 11th

2021-05-28 09:06:33,wallstreetbets,$8 is time to buy the dip and avg down. Losing $2 per share is an exit strategy? Wow.
2021-05-28 09:45:59,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm down 27% in my stocks, last week it was 35+% the past few months but I‚Äôm still holding. You can‚Äôt buy with money you need to live on. I‚Äôm new to this but I knew going in that I had to be okay with loosing what I was putting in and being patient. To many people are expecting to get rich overnight."
2021-05-28 08:29:55,wallstreetbets,Shorts they have shat.
2021-05-28 11:07:51,wallstreetbets,"If you believed it was going back down to 8 you‚Äôd sell now no matter how in the red you are and buy back in at 8, recouping 3 a share immediately."

2021-05-28 08:25:52,wallstreetbets,This is what the largest issue for some bag holders is.  You can profit on the way bag up if you average down.

I work in the entertainment industry/hospitality. Well, that's what they call it. I call it, working in a Bowling Center (to most it's a Bowling Alley). However, my company has 300 locations so I'd buy some shares for the hell of it if they went public."
2021-05-28 05:40:30,wallstreetbets,80% shares. 20% calls with 10.5 strike
2021-05-28 11:01:22,wallstreetbets,"That what i thought. Also, the left over cash I have i dumped into AMC. 

And also ""stick"" for the barkbox merger.

Between those 2 i can eat the BB loss for desert"
2021-05-28 15:11:42,wallstreetbets,"depends. I averaged GME down to $189 from $360; cashed out this week and made like $350 from it (I only had a few shares). I'll go back into GME when it bottoms out again, which I'm guessing will be in two weeks


I didn't like the idea of averaging down but it turned a loss (or a longer wait) into a small profit."
2021-05-28 16:02:11,wallstreetbets,Precisely.
2021-05-28 19:19:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve already contributed my max to my Roth. Can‚Äôt average down unless I sell other assets

woohoo"
2021-05-28 12:14:53,wallstreetbets,"I heard they used BB tech to to warp one up there, popcorn will be hot n ready."
2021-05-28 15:16:35,wallstreetbets,"Exactly right! Don't buy with money you need to live on. I missed out on gains last year because I had to sell a couple times around the first of the month. Now everything I buy is money I am willing to wave goodbye to, and everything I buy I believe in, so if I am down and can afford it, I just buy the dip and lower my dollar cost average. Long haul baby!"
2021-05-28 08:52:33,wallstreetbets,so much it is even harder to differentiate the shit from the shorter
2021-05-28 11:41:07,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd probably short the company I work for ü§´

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPCE - we have achieved launch On the 22nd SPCE completed the first of its 3 planned test flights to space.
Everything looked to have gone off successfully. We are now waiting on the data and craft to be analysed and inspected. This will take a few weeks according to Michael Colglazier.
That being said he had already outlined the test schedule in the earnings zoom call.

1st test flight - may 
2nd crewed flight - June 
3rd flight with R Branson on board late June/July 

4th flight this will be taking the Italian airforce on a training mission (600k a seat) late July


On the run in to the first test flight some possible maintenance issues appeared with the carrier plane White knight 2‚Ä¶. 
This indeed could have gone either way , after 2 weeks inspections it was decided that WK2 did not need to delay testing no maintenance was needed at this point. Scheduled Maintenance will commence in the fall after all tests have been completed.
Upon this news it is my opinion that the testing programme will go ahead as planned.

The market has responded accordingly and the stock is now up from $17-‚Ç¨31

With all these catalysts lined up before the end of the year and commercial operations looming for early 2022 things are looking up for Virgin Galactic.The success of the last test flight the company have now proven tech and concept. 
Also with revenue now coming in Nasa who are conducting micro gravity analysis.
Also international training for military pilots and astronauts.
Commercial flights look imminent.
Space ports planned for around the globe and intercontinental travel looming.

I posted something hesitant on this matter yesterday that got removed. 

People need to remain advised on the realities at hand, just because the inspection passed for this flight, does not mean the maintenance is now on track for Fall. It was discussed in detail on the earnings call if you skip to 10:00 in. If anything, the past wear could be a sign of accelerated wear which details are being held on, causing the the maintenance schedule to potentially be moved up in between some of these next 3 flights. But oh god, god forbid someone suggests something that would cause the stock to not moon day after day. 

I'm bullish as fuck on this stock. I trust the SPCE team is doing the diligence to ensure a predictable maintenance schedule, but hello.....this is uncharted territory."

They then  decided that the maintenance wasn‚Äôt necessary and could wait. Until the original programme in the fall ? I think so.
I don‚Äôt believe they would have flown WK2 if there was any doubt that the issues would impede on the test flight programme. 
I suppose we will have to wait till analysis is finished and hear back from VG.

I fully appreciate that there are doubts and given the background of the previous test flights who wouldn‚Äôt have doubts.

After all, he‚Äôs always said he wants to go up on his birthday, July 18th. This date would also put SPCE ahead of Blue Origin, which plans on taking its first tourist up on July 20th."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Genuine AMC question (related to any short squeeze) So this is something I can't figure out and I'd really appreciate it if someone helped me understand.

Everyone is talking about how the squeeze didn't even happen and the shorts didn't cover yet. What I don't understand is why wouldn't that be possible? If short interest is 17%, so let's round up to about 100M shares. Today the volume traded was 700M shares. Couldn't 100M of those 700M have been the shorts covering? And if they didn't cover, today alone 700M shares were traded, why would 100M shares bought by shorts cause a squeeze if today 700M were traded?

I have been having this question for awhile, since I noticed the same with GME. In the days preceding January 28th (when GME reached its peak), the combined volume was several times the amount of float. How come the squeeze happened and why did it happen? If the volume was so high, couldn't the shorts have covered in the days preceding that?

I hope this makes sense and I really hope someone will be kind enough to explain a fellow retard who only knows about crayons what this all means.

P.s. FUCKING HODL AMC üöÄüöÄüöÄüíéüíéüíéüëãüëãüëã"
2021-05-28 01:02:18,wallstreetbets,Those 700 million shares are counted for each sell and buy transactions so if there are a lot of day traders day trading the same share back and forth that would bring the count up high up quick.
2021-05-28 00:53:52,wallstreetbets,I'm holding
2021-05-28 00:56:45,wallstreetbets,My theory is that these HF elitist snobs just absolutely refuse to believe they have been outsmarted by people who drink domestic beer. They believe there is no way we can stay organized long enough to make a difference.
2021-05-28 01:30:22,wallstreetbets,"Today was likely just a gamma squeeze, with only 17% short float, there's probably not enough pressure to force a short squeeze. If enough people believe the squeeze is coming and buy shares and calls (which causes MM's to buy shares) then it spikes the price. The issue will be when that reverses as MM's unhedge OTM calls (charm pushes delta to 0 or 1 as time decreases). There's a lot of latent selling pressure if the price doesn't continue to rise, which would likely lead to a deflation tomorrow. There's also the possibility that people who are shorting meme stocks are shorting more than one, and may have covered AMC positions to hold on to GME shorts, or vice versa. Most of the heavily shorted stocks popular on here went up today which would support this: GME, AMC, NKLA, SOS, EBON, etc, all went up together which would support this idea."

2021-05-28 01:02:26,wallstreetbets,GME reached its peak? GTFOH. I don‚Äôt see no moon.
2021-05-28 00:50:47,wallstreetbets,"I think the float data (which is usually 24 hours old) will reflect that tomorrow morning from today. Last I read it was like 20.3% (S3 data) and 140Mil shares. I wish I knew the exact answer myself, really no one does in real time. That 20.3% doesnt reflect the ‚Äúfake shares‚Äù allegedly out there either mind you. The synthetic shares could be 50+ million more. Gonna be a another printing press tomorrow it looks like."
2021-05-28 13:09:36,wallstreetbets,"Look at the charts today for GME, AMC and FUBO. Tell me there's nothing to see there - they're exactly the same. While there was bound to be some deflationary pressure today, there's much more afoot than that."
2021-05-28 01:13:44,wallstreetbets,"If there are more shares than the actual float of the companies, shorts didn‚Äôt cover. It depends on how many shares you think are outstanding. To me, when a ticker is trading its entire float in a day, it‚Äôs not so much of a sign that shorts ‚Äúcould be covering,‚Äù as it is a dramatic indication of just how many shares have been synthesized"

I'm eager to learn, so if you got some good info or advices I'll take them!"
2021-05-28 01:03:52,wallstreetbets,I just meant the January peak. Chill
2021-05-28 00:56:50,wallstreetbets,"But even if the synthetic shares were 200M, couldn't the shorts have covered today given the volume of 700M?

Not sure if it's clear what I'm asking.
I'm just confused as to why everyone says that shorts can't have covered yet when the volume of shares traded is so much higher than the float"
2021-05-28 03:58:37,wallstreetbets,"The idea of a short squeeze of shorts covering is pretty irrelevant unless the net short position declines. If new people come in to short positions as the stock goes up, short interest remains the same and short covering is not causing a squeeze.

The only type of squeeze likely is a gamma squeeze where people who sold uncovered calls are buying shares to hedge. Even there a lot depends on ITM calls being closed out and selling the hedges on those.

Basically as to why the volume is what it is and what has driven the upward price momentum is very hard, to impossible to determine. It does appear to be a squeeze, but more likely a gamma squeeze I think than a short squeeze."
2021-05-28 01:18:29,wallstreetbets,"This is true as well! Especially if a lot of retards and apes are diamond handing their shares, it just means there's much more synthesized shares than actual float being traded.

Also I just assumed the actual shares shorted are the ones reported, so just around 17% of the float. But we know that's not true, the data reported is not necessarily reflecting the reality of the situation and the actual number of shares being shorted."
2021-05-28 01:02:18,wallstreetbets,"If we look at the combined volume of the past 4 days, which is when the rally started, it is something like 1.3B. Therefore even if there were 900M synthetic shares, in theory the shorts could have covered (just taking into account the volume)."
2021-05-28 03:19:02,wallstreetbets,"Sam Adams is more than passable! Boston Lager is a fantastic representative of the style and for how much they produce? Amazing they've maintained the quality for so long.

Good reason why their stock is so high too!"
2021-05-28 01:03:51,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs ok, ape, they brew in Baltimore, MD now too!"
2021-05-28 01:56:33,wallstreetbets,"This is the underlying principle behind maximum pain theory. I've got a spreadsheet going for GME to estimate how many shares are likely going to be unwound tomorrow. It's currently around 3 million. They will get sold off as time passes (charm), if the price drops (delta), or as people take profit on their ITM calls (if they sell the call back to the MM, the MM then sells the hedged shares). It'll be a tug of war between MM's unhedging, paperhands, and dip buyers to see what happens. I'm personally betting on unhedging and paperhands, which is probably not welcome here."
2021-05-28 02:37:00,wallstreetbets,Premarket in Germany is up 7% so I‚Äôve heard. So it may jump up. It‚Äôs just as likely to plummet though.
2021-05-28 02:35:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't know dude. I just know that based on the tables AMC has about 28m shares held to hedge options. It's just a latent selling pressure that will impact the situation. 28m out of 700m of volume may not be much, but you'd have to factor it relative to the number of people who bought new shares and weren't day trading and we can't know what that volume was. If unhedging causes a dip and people decide to sell and get out, that'll be the real cause of the drop.

Edit: my numbers were only counting 5/28 options. Once you add in the next 3 expirations (oi drops off after that) it's more like 70m shares. And we can expect about 3-4m shares to unwind per dollar drop in price."
2021-05-28 01:41:54,wallstreetbets,"People see GME going up, they buy calls and shares. Susquehanna (who is probably on the other side) then buys shares equal to the call delta to hedge the position. When the price goes up from these buys, it pushes up the deltas requiring more hedge shares, which feeds back on itself until the options are hedged and the MM is delta neutral. They also combine shares with other options (bought from yet other MM's) to gamma hedge, which they are probably doing a better job of this time around which is why the spike was smaller than January."
2021-05-28 04:11:52,wallstreetbets,"You can see the OI on options, then you can calculate the deltas and add everything up across the next several expirations. I don't have a good way of pulling the data live so I've just been having to hand enter it into an excel sheet to calculate. Best guess right now will be 3-4m shares per dollar drop in price (plus whatever calls get sold). I think the downward pressure from unwinding will just be the primer that triggers the retail selloff. Those who aren't totally drinking the koolaid will recognize that if there are more ape shares than short shares, then the only way to get out with a profit will be to leave another ape holding the bag."

2021-05-28 01:36:56,wallstreetbets,"With AMC there are too many shares and the float is too large.  Your logic is sound.  GME is the real rocket because the float is so small and the amount of shares available is so small.  Full disclosure I had 220 amc contracts for 2022 and 2023 8 and 15 call.  I sold them all today.  I made good money on them.  I will then buy more gme.  I like seeing amc successful, but in my opinion gme and amc are not the same despite some of the same references being used."

2021-05-28 02:43:41,wallstreetbets,Im willing ro bet that most of these people don‚Äôt have the money to exercise their options.
2021-05-28 03:52:21,wallstreetbets,"If there are only 100m short shares, and apes are holding way more shares than that, then where do you think the money is coming from when people decide to exit? It's coming from other apes who don't believe the squeeze happened. The only way this CAN end is with a ton of bag holders."
2021-05-28 02:39:25,wallstreetbets,"When a ticker goes nuts like this, the implied volatility shoots up. Options become more expensive when IV shoots up because there‚Äôs even less certainty about which way the stock will go. In other words: the sellers of the options get a higher premium since there is also more risk as the ticker could swing wildly either way."

Synthetic longs would be exposed, create a short squeeze while still being able to raise funds through the bonus issue

&#x200B;

When OSTK did this their shares went to triple digits.

&#x200B;

Adding extra text to get around the dumb robo script which wants to check length. It also wants to check against brevity. Further it is synonymous with red tape. It would actually just want to cut ribbons than get on with it."

2021-05-28 09:20:21,wallstreetbets,"Synthetic positions are just a 2 leg options play mate. You don't ""buy"" synthetic longs or shorts, you buy a call and sell a put to create an 100 delta position which effectively mimics 100 shares with their price action (hence the ""synthetic"" part of the name). 

But they aren't something that's floating around and pretending to be a real share, that's a *massive* misunderstanding of what it is.

Edit: If you don't believe me, then just read this https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/synthetic.asp"

2021-05-28 02:40:22,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. From long share perspective, doesn't matter if the share is real or not. If the broker allowed you to buy the share and it shows up in your account, then they are the first entity that is on the hook for paying you cash when you sell the share. If they can't, then they will margin call someone else to get the money."

If that term indicates what you're saying it does, then I shouldn't be on page 4 of Google still looking for it. The only references to the definition you're asserting is a post on the GME subreddit and one YouTube video that's also about the squeezing.

What am I missing here?"
2021-05-28 17:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Yes but I'm explaining that the term ""synthetic long"" doesn't mean what you think it dies.

A SeekingAlpha blog post

And a Reddit post

All 3 of which are about the squeeze this past few months. Are you *sure* that term is a thing?"
2021-05-28 17:50:05,wallstreetbets,"Wrong link? I Ctrl-F-ed it and the word ""synthetic"" doesn't even show up once."
2021-05-28 17:56:26,wallstreetbets,"I get way different results from you when searching for

 sec naked shorting synthetic share

It's basically when a naked short is opened and that share gets shorted again and again."
2021-05-28 18:02:47,wallstreetbets,"Put quotes around ""synthetic share"". That limits it to the results where the phrase actually appears. And once I do that I got my same results from before lol.

And I mean, I'm not calling you a liar or anything, but I am starting to think that somebody, at some point, completely misunderstood something and misappropriated the term ""synthetic"" in a financial context and then a bunch of people believed then because it sounded good, or something along those lines.

Just like ""short ladder attack"""

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blue Apron: Hero or Zero This isn‚Äôt what you think. I‚Äôm not going to pitch a shit short interest play or prattle on about some pipe dream. No. I‚Äôm going to introduce you to an ultra-high-risk micro-cap play that, very well might be on the precipice of greatness.


What is Blue Apron?


Blue Apron (NYSE: APRN) was the forgotten step child, bad luck Brian, IPO of summer 2017 that priced below range and had the misfortune of debuting after Amazon bought Whole Foods. Since it‚Äôs debut, the stock has suffered dropping from nearly $150 per share (adjusted for a 2019 reverse-split necessitated to stay listed) to as low as approximately $2.00!


Why the Drop?


Management. Fucking. Sucked. The prior executive team essentially handed Chad Hello Fresh the keys to the kingdom, when they made the fatal error of betting that the ‚Äúhigh affinity core users‚Äù would be enough to sustain the business. For this reason, they cut marketing to nearly nothing and attempted to realize operating leverage by shrinking the customer base only to its most prolific buyers.

This was stupid. HelloFresh did the opposite, essentially giving away meals, and they used it to stockpile market share. Put a chart up of HelloFresh customers against Blue Apron. You‚Äôll see the two lines converge and a clear indication that HelloFresh stole most of their business. HelloFresh was one of the best trades of the past 5 years. Look at the chart, look at the sales, and look at the margins. They have managed to achieve operating leverage by employing affordable pricing and emphasizing retention.


Blue Apron Might Go Under....


Today the company is in a dire place. Languishing away in Micro Cap hell at an $80M market cap, no one on Wall Street wants to cover these guys. Only their bankers, CG and MS, write them research and neither are overly optimistic. They‚Äôre in a shit spot with a credit line that mandates they keep $15M cash at all times, and they keep their customer base above 300K (thus far, they‚Äôve struggled). They‚Äôre sitting on $29M and burn enough cash per Q that they might go below that $15M level (wouldn‚Äôt be a first). All signs are negative...


But I Think They Might Win


Blue Apron is under new management. Linda Kozlowski, is the former COO of ETSY and an ex-strategist at Alibaba. She believes HelloFresh did things right and she wants to right the ship. Her ballsy-ass plan is to ride the line on cash and go all in on customer growth. She realizes those customers are worth a lot more than income on the P&L, and that she needs to make the pot as big as she can. Thus far, it‚Äôs worked. Customers are up over 20% in the past two periods and retention rates are rising. We are seeing signs of operating leverage, and it opens a big possibility.


My Prediction

Management is buying shares. They know the company is not healthy. The only logic is that they have a plan that‚Äôs working. You can‚Äôt sell a dying business with a shrinking share, but you can certainly sell a growing community, that could be an accretive asset to a better capitalized entity. I think Linda is going either get the business in a position where it can refinance for better terms, or where it can be sold to create shareholder value via a strategic alternative.

If that happen, given this is priced for bankruptcy and ignored by the Street, the returns could easily reach the triple digits. I‚Äôm long and I plan to add on additional weakness.

Disclosure- I‚Äôm buying a stock that might go under. This is not advice! I‚Äôm stupid."

2021-05-27 23:44:13,wallstreetbets,My wife and I absolutely LOVE Blue Apron and have added a lot of recipes (or parts of) to our repertoire.  I think the biggest hurdle is coaxing people to cook.  My marketing ideas would revolve around convincing young couples to discover the joy of cooking.
2021-05-27 23:29:22,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm listening‚Ä¶
2021-05-28 00:08:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm looking at their quarterly earnings, and I'll listen to their earnings call, but there is a lot to take concern about. I also need to read the 8K about their new debt covenant, and one or two other things. I did notice one or two things I liked, however. 

With the market cap of this company as small as it is, any meaningful shareholder appreciation in a very quick manner will lead to new share issuances, diluting existing shareholders, for one. They need the cash, and they need it badly. 

Another thing i noticed, is that they are all about being positive EBITDA wise, but that doesn't help when we're talking about net income. And I don't see even how they become Cash Flow Positive on an EBITDA basis anyways.

With that said, they have a lot of money in inventory, and in pre-paid expenses, so they have a bit of runway still.

I'll update with my observations tomorrow, probably."

2021-05-28 10:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Blue Apron trades at 0.2x revenue versus HelloFresh trades at 4x revenue. I'm not saying Blue Apron deserves the same revenue multiple as HelloFresh right now, but if they can figure things out quick this could be a 30 banger over the next 5 years.....or it could go to $0. Lots of upside but highly risky. I like it."
2021-05-28 15:18:53,wallstreetbets,"Taking a look here and yeah, this is risky. Even if you just bought shares, you could end up losing everything. Blue Apron is not a healthy company BUT a turnaround would be an enormous cash in"
2021-05-27 23:28:55,wallstreetbets,Everyone I knew took their promo and cancelled after. Can‚Äôt say no to free food
2021-05-27 23:42:39,wallstreetbets,"I think blue apron and companies like have passed. Grocerers have been developing and pushing ready to cook/heat meals for 3 years now. The 159 billion spent annualy (2019) on RTH/RTC meals is expected to grow by 5.5%. Its cheaper for the consumer, easier to prepare and easier to get now that more companies do curbside pickup and delivery. 

I think blue apron came 5-10 years too late."
2021-05-28 10:29:14,wallstreetbets,"I have puts on APRN from when it was $8. I am betting its going to zero. The cash flow is drying up. Their customer base is hardly growing. All they announce are new meal recipes which really don't do anything. Look, this isn't a turnaround play like GME. GameStop was actually undervalued. APRN is teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. I could give you more reasons why, but really if you read the 10-K you can figure it out for yourself."
2021-05-28 12:38:58,wallstreetbets,"OP do you use Blue Apron?

No? Why not?

There‚Äôs your answer."
2021-05-27 23:21:54,wallstreetbets,"I go to the local butcher shop, buy meat, season it, and throw it on my Traeger.  I don't need meals shipped to me that cost 300% of what I can cook myself.  No dice."

2021-05-28 06:03:20,wallstreetbets,Isn't almost all of their new user acquisition through marketing? This seems like capped upside with massive downsides.
2021-05-28 14:12:38,wallstreetbets,"This is going into the tank.  Purely anecdotal : the middle class suburban moms on my street tried this and Hello Fresh during promo period, then quit, because it's way overpriced.  A couple liked the recipes, but we have The Internet so that's not really a thing.  When the recession hits, the few remaining customers are gonna dump this like, some analogy for dumping something extremely fast."
2021-05-28 00:47:16,wallstreetbets,I agree. I was basically an idiot in the kitchen. We did Blue Apron for like 3 months...switched to Hello Fresh lol. Then just stopped because I had enough kitchen skills at that point to just shop for myself and now my wife basically eats at a decently nice restaurant every night.
2021-05-27 23:37:24,wallstreetbets,Me tooüêã
2021-05-28 07:13:25,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve read all of their 8Ks, listened to their past several earnings calls, and I keep a model. I typed this on my phone so unfortunately so I didn‚Äôt get to be as detailed as I wanted.

They previously had EBITDA covenants which they breached. I believe they refinanced last year for this very reason. In fact, they‚Äôve already breached their current covenants by going under $20M during 1Q. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been revised down to $15M.

The company enjoyed a pretty strong pull-forward in demand last year, but it wasn‚Äôt positioned to capitalized on it. They were already in a state of making the business lean and they didn‚Äôt have the resources to drive improvements in retention, rates. They were also hit by labor shortages, which caused increases in opex and further prevented the realization of operating leverage.

I don‚Äôt view dilution here as a major negative. When you bet on micro caps, you‚Äôre essentially betting a person is going to drive a turnaround in a broken business, and that‚Äôs what this is. We need flexibility to be able to focus on the growth initiative without being saddled by that debt. Oh, and before you waste time on the 8K, it‚Äôs $15M at all times and over 320K customers. There are also a bunch of warrants associated with the offering (dilutive), at $0.01 per share. Again, bad signs.

Look at HelloFresh. It started smaller than Blue Apron and it‚Äôs now a $15B company with high top-line growth rates. The negative risk factors for blue apron, low competitive moat, low switching cost, etc extend to them, so a campaign focused on low margin customer acquisition would be effective.

Regarding timing, I‚Äôll save you some extra effort, as it‚Äôll also have to be soon. They‚Äôre within the danger zone assuming their current cash burn remains constant. They‚Äôve resolved many of their labor cost issues that drove expenses last year, so they estimate $2M at least will drop off the burn, but we‚Äôll see what actual impact it had in August. Anyway, they‚Äôre coming up on headwinds from reopening reducing demand with more people wanting to travel and they‚Äôre also facing the worst seasonality for margins given the challenges of shipping perishable goods across the nation during the warmest months of the year.

This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúwait and see what happens‚Äù deal, it‚Äôs a near-term event where it‚Äôs either going under, or they‚Äôre going to find a way to continue on. I think it‚Äôs likely that, if they can continue to grow the customer base, they‚Äôre able to successfully execute on a strategic alternative. The fact is, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to be able to refi the debt or issue enough equity as the current conditions stand. Maybe they can find someone to do a PIPE offering, or ATM, but I think they‚Äôre going to be in a position where they sell to a better capitalized business. A big reason I believe this is that they‚Äôre so close to that cash covenant (again), but they‚Äôre still full throttle on growth. Usually a company in this stage would be aggressively trimming costs down to the bone, unless there was a reason not to be concerned. If you see any off-cycle sell-side research from Maria or Brian (or better yet a new analyst) that‚Äôs also a good clue that banking activity is up.

IMO- you can‚Äôt use traditional fundamentals to judge a micro cap stock. That‚Äôs how it got here. At this point it‚Äôs more prudent to use mosaic theory and anecdotal evidence as to how it can come back and what form that would take. The fundamentals totally point to bankruptcy, you‚Äôre right, but look at their announcement in Feb 2020 and compare it to their actions today. You‚Äôll see the prior reflects a company preparing to die and the more recent implies something different."
2021-05-28 07:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Hey, the big guys are allowed to go on CNBC, Bloomberg, Fox Biz, Cheddar, etc and talk their books. No reason I can‚Äôt share my idea. This is a high-risk trade and I don‚Äôt try to hide it at all, but I know this business well and I want to share my research. Absolutely do not buy this without researching it yourself, but there is no shame in sharing ideas."
2021-05-28 00:28:12,wallstreetbets,Yes Master
2021-05-28 09:56:04,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-05-28 09:55:46,wallstreetbets,lol the stocktwits crowd has been trying to make this happen for over a year
2021-05-28 12:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. You get it. High chance of bankruptcy, but if you‚Äôre fine losing a few hundred bucks, worst case, then you could end up with close to $10K. Pretty solid risk/reward model, especially since I think they‚Äôd try to sell the business (might not be at an ideal price) before they go under, which means you wouldn‚Äôt likely be completely shit out of luck."
2021-05-27 23:30:49,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what they should be doing. Again, I‚Äôll repeat myself, look at hellofresh. That approach works. The old method of trying to increase high affinity user KPIs was wrong. Giving away food to attract new customers and gain adoption works."
2021-05-28 07:19:55,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm going to say it for a 60th time. HelloFresh proves the business model works. There is a question as to whether or not Blue Apron can turn around, but there isn‚Äôt as to whether or not meal kits are viable. I cook for myself all the time. It‚Äôs one of my favorite hobbies, so I‚Äôd never use this, but clearly people are buying hellofresh when you look at the trends in sales growth and margin expansion- even pre pandemic."
2021-05-28 03:26:18,wallstreetbets,"Idk if they came 5-10 years late so much so as the pandemic pushed everything up 5-10 years sooner. 

So many large grocery chains dragged their feet on competent grocery ordering online, but tell them that people can't come into their stores for a month and all of a sudden WalMart, Meijer, Kroger etc. All have user friendly grocery delivery and pickup. 

I'm not mad about it either, it fucking rules and is EXPONENTIALLY cheaper than these. The only people who I see this being for are those who have absolutely zero interest in researching what to cook but wanting to still cook instead of RTC/RTH meals"
2021-05-28 12:17:40,wallstreetbets,"GME is not a turnaround play either, it‚Äôs a large scale pipe dream that is entirely unproven. I‚Äôm not comparing these, but, to play devil‚Äôs advocate. It was also a micro cap bet and that‚Äôs essentially how these work."
2021-05-28 12:52:31,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt use hellofresh either and they have killed ebitda margins and strong net profit with lots of room for expansion from added operating leverage. That isn‚Äôt the best way to look at stocks.
2021-05-27 23:24:29,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you. I hate this shit, but the business model works. HelloFresh is essentially a proof of concept. Right now, this is trading at a third of sales. You get this up to 1x and you keep growing the subscriber base, and you‚Äôre looking at a nice return."
2021-05-27 23:39:48,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúI personally can‚Äôt use the service this business offers so investing in this business must be a bad idea‚Äù
2021-05-27 23:23:52,wallstreetbets,Just buy AMC or oil stocks instead
2021-05-28 07:25:19,wallstreetbets,"Historically, yes, that‚Äôs played a role, but more recently it‚Äôs been a mix between that and R&D.

Upside, intrinsically isn‚Äôt capped. The downside is capped at the capital invested. At $80M, it‚Äôs pretty safe to say the downside is limited compared to the potential in the event of a recovery."
2021-05-28 10:31:20,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! This is the explanation everyone was looking for. I think personally based on my research that its going under. Their ""growth strategy"" hasn't really worked. I will admit them adding customers in the most recent quarter is a good thing. But still not enough to make it worth it."
2021-05-27 23:42:08,wallstreetbets,"Put in an order for 100 shares and 5 Jan 20, 2023 $22 calls"
2021-05-27 23:45:53,wallstreetbets,Hellofresh doesnt really make money though right? Didn't they turn a profit for the first time LY? And i assume people will be going out more in the future as we move past corona fears.
2021-05-28 13:34:48,wallstreetbets,"I was saying GME was undervalued at $4. Not anymore, but thats regardless. They have had lots of time with this new management, and they are so close to breaking the covenants of their loans. Not to mention reopening could cause people to eat out more instead of going to their at home boxes. Also 1st quarter is their strongest quarter usually. (They say so themselves) So don't be surprised if the rest go downhill."
2021-05-28 16:23:39,wallstreetbets,Why don‚Äôt you use hellofresh?
2021-05-27 23:51:16,wallstreetbets,"Sorry bro, I don't get it.  My girlfriend orders this type of crap at a ridiculous cost and when I buy food myself and cook it, it always turns out better.  Maybe I'm in the minority and don't realize it."
2021-05-28 07:17:42,wallstreetbets,"Hellofresh actually has pretty good margins. They were essentially break-even in 2019, which was a continuation of an already positive trend, so while the pandemic pulled-forward some adoption, it wasn‚Äôt what drove the realization of operating leverage. In other words, they would have been profitable last year anyway, just probably not as profitable given you‚Äôd have to back out some inbounds and increase the CAC. Actually look at the expenses as a percentage of sales. I was surprised too."
2021-05-28 00:23:08,wallstreetbets,"I concur and may I add; I want all the food not some pre measured portion, I want ALL the food."
2021-05-27 23:59:05,wallstreetbets,"No....I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong in why you don‚Äôt see the value in it, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a bad investment.

I think Tesla makes kind of shitty cars and Elon Musk is a huckster who is full of shit, but it won‚Äôt stop me from buying TSLA calls. 

Being out of an investment because you personally don‚Äôt desire the product the investment produces is specious reasoning."
2021-05-28 00:50:20,wallstreetbets,I disagree- the quality of the meat and produce is excellent. Better than what you can buy at most grocers. Also I feel like it‚Äôs mostly about learning. For example I didn‚Äôt know how to deglaze a pan and make a pan sauce after cooking chicken. I didn‚Äôt know how to do like 95% of what I do now before I used Blue Apron. I think this entire business models biggest hurdle is figuring out how to keep people ordering once they‚Äôve learned to cook for themselves.
2021-05-28 09:57:38,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not. I hate this crap too, but I also hate TikTok."
2021-05-28 01:06:27,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but i think blue apron/hellofresh are targeted at people who are clueless/intimidated by cooking"

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir DD if you want to understand company and it's history better (also insider ""selling"" explained in detail) This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions."

2021-05-28 00:05:41,wallstreetbets,I have 10 shares @23.79 if you would like to buy them for say 25 each
2021-05-28 00:56:36,wallstreetbets,"I don't know the details with Alex Karp, but for those trying to understand the tax treatment here, what the author is saying is he received nonstatutory stock options.

Tax-wise, when the option is exercised (i.e. he buys the shares) he has regular ordinary income on the difference between the current share price and the strike price. For example if the strike is $10 and the stock price is $22 he has income on 22-10=12.

Two things to keep in mind... One, he has to come up with the $10 per share, which he can simply get via selling enough shares to cover the $10 cost and two, he needs enough money to pay tax on the $12 income, which may force him to sell another large chunk of those shares.

If his plan is to hold the shares, then to the extent he does not need funds to cover the strike price it is beneficial for him for the share price to be lower as his tax burden is less. BUT, as he needs money to cover that strike, obviously a higher price might be better.

Going back to my example above, if he exercised 100 shares worth, he would need $1,000 to cover the strike, which at $22 per share would be about 45 shares. In addition to cover taxes (assuming 40% x $1,200 = $480) he would need to sell another 22 shares, leaving him with 33 shares net. If the share price instead was $15, then he would need to sell 67 shares to cover the strike and the tax (40% x $500 = $200) would need another 13 shares, netting him with 20 shares. Bottom line, he benefits from the stock price being up if he needs to cover the strike price.

This is all forced activity as the alternative may be to lose the money.

Not sure how my explanation plays into your thesis but it is what it is.

I am bullish on PLTR."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Legend of /u/EmperorOfJenks aka ‚ÄúOrnamental Gourds Futures Guy‚Äù continues (Part 2) 
[When we last left our hero,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrly28/the_legend_of_utheemperorofjenks_aka_ornamental/) he had just lost all of his rent money and what he could advance from credit cards on a failed Super Bowl bet, and a YOLO on ‚ÄúRhodium‚Äù that he ordered from a sketchy Slovakian Wish.com ripoff. Alas, it was, of course, fake, and he was broke and depressed. It might have been the first fatal case of autism. He thought to himself ‚ÄúAm I really that retarded?‚Äù Then, he realized ‚ÄúNo, it must be Oklahoma that‚Äôs retarded!‚Äù

So, [after a brief case of violent diarrhea from Oklahoma Grocery Store sushi](https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/lrslbb/psa_do_not_eat_grocery_store_sushi_right_now/), he was ready to hatch his plan! Uruguay! Yes, Uruguay. [He was going to move to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lh5igx/c%C3%B3mo_se_puede_llegar_a_melo_desde_montevideo_sin/)

His plans for this move could‚Äôve been anyone‚Äôs guess. One possibility he inquired about was [how to be a Tea Blendmaster.](https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/lfga0m/how_does_one_become_a_blendmaster/) [Another was him possibly reconnecting with God.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/lsij6j/agnostic_jew_seeking_faith_in_god/) Yet, he seemed to be asking questions about another topic more often than the others...

[Bees.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/lxcnt1/c%C3%B3mo_es_la_legalidad_de_la_apicultura_informal/)

Specifically, beekeeping, a topic he admitted he had no experience in, [as evident from him looking for any book on the subject as an introduction months before.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/)

What he planned on doing with the bees was anyone‚Äôs guess, and I doubt he thought it through that much either. One post **AFTER** he took possession of 200,000 bees (we‚Äôll get to that later,) was [asking Americans if there was a demand for mead in the states.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/l6r6y1/best_popular_science_books_about_bees/) So, was he thinking of importing Uruguayan honey to the US to be made into mead? Was he going to make it himself? Did he move to another continent for no reason? Let‚Äôs all find out!

A little more than 2 months ago, he finally did it. [He moved to Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/uruguay/comments/m9ejpn/la_paloma/) And about a week after that, [he was driving a truck filled with 200k bees across his new country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/) Based on replies in that thread, he was aiming to have [a monopoly on beekeeping in the country.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mfu9r1/transporting_200000_bees_across_uruguay_is_the/gt48gke/) 

And for a while, things were kind ok for our young Autist. [He picked up his hives without complication.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/) [And then he settled into Melo, Uruguay, and set up his apiary ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/n1jnte/my_humble_apiary_near_melo_uruguay/). Life was good.

But, trouble was afoot. According to a reply, [the species he was planning on keeping had literally never been kept by keepers in Uruguay.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/mtkkf3/about_to_upsize_my_apiary_whats_the_best_layout/gv0viej/) And then, disaster struck. [He went to TIFU to post his tale of spreading an invasive species in an industry he knew nothing about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/nmd69k/tifu_by_importing_bees_to_uruguay/)

Indeed, he had no idea even what a bee was until he stumbled his way through a book, and then decided to YOLO into honey in Uruguay. He somehow got in touch with an ecology professor in Montevideo that would help him set things up in exchange for grad students fucking with them every now and again. Oh, and the bees were from fucking Myanmar. Handshake agreement, of course. Total Chad move.

And like I said before, the rest went without incident for a while. It would take the bees ‚Äúa year‚Äù to make honey, so he just kinda hung out, stayed busy, and tried to find part time work in a foreign country he arrived in 2.5 months earlier.

And then, the professor ghosted him. Just disappeared. Shortly thereafter, government agents come out about this kid from Oklahoma illegally importing a non-native bee to their country. Apparently his bees had been fucking with other apiaries. So, he did probably the smartest thing he‚Äôs ever done.

He ran.

He fucking ran from the Uruguayan government, took a plane to LAX, and arrived with $14 to his name. His friend sent him $100, which wasn‚Äôt enough to go back to Oklahoma, so he took a $75 flight to Seattle, where he is also not from.

His last post is from a train out of the airport, with $39 to his name. I don‚Äôt know what is in store for him, but I know that $39 is as good as spent on urchin futures or whatever market he‚Äôs going to crash up there.

God speed, /u/TheEmperorOfJenks. May your future YOLOs be just as retarded as the others"

2021-05-28 00:46:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean...are you serious with this question?

Maybe I'm grounded in science too much, but there is no way to answer this question as written. I would need answers to a dozen questions before even starting to assess what they number might be. 

If you don't know what number is a life changing amount of money for YOU, and you can't pair that up with a price target and do some division...you're probably in the exact right place to be getting financial advice. 

What country to you live in? What part of the country? How much is cost of living there? How old are you? Do you have debt? How much debt? Do you have any expensive medical conditions? Do you have children? How many and will they be going to college? Are YOU wanting to go to college? How much is college in what ever country you live in? Do you want to travel the rest of your life or are you happy living comfortably in a modest home for the rest of your life...how ever long that might be? 

Life changing money might be $5,000 for one person who is 21 and just needs enough to pay for the last 2 quarters of college and finish a degree (potentially changing their life) while they live at home, or it might be 5 million for someone else who is 40 or 50, owns and runs multiple businesses, and just wants to shut it all down and walk away but not lower their quality of life. Or maybe it's 10 million for someone who works making 200k a year, but they are trapped in a job with great health coverage and their little girl has an illness that is covered by their health insurance, but it would cost 100,000 a year in medical if they quit their job. So they would need 10 million to be able to safely live off a safe 3% dividend stock and not be risking their kids life by quiting their job."
2021-05-27 23:49:33,wallstreetbets,How much would it take at $50k a share to be life changing. $50k is my floor at minimal for AMC.

I‚Äôv been struggling with how much more I can afford for time being until the squeeze and then once there make enough gains to buy one or many businesses to sustain the wealth with new home and new vehicles and private schooling for. Currently I‚Äôm at 614 shares. A month and a half ago I was at 918 but then realized I over spent so I needed to pay bills and feed my daughter so that‚Äôs how I got down to 614. I‚Äôve just been struggling to decide if I need more or if I‚Äôll be able to accomplish my goal with where I‚Äôm at with 614. I know it‚Äôs a dumb thing to ask on Reddit but but yesterday and today have me extremely anxious now and even though I have 614 FOMO is really fucking with me.

Greeting to All my beloved Apes!

I just watched some Korean youtube channel talking about AMC stock that on June 2, $500 million of paid-in capital increase will be decided according to the vote result.

But, I heard somewhere that even if this happens, Adam(CEO) will not going to make it by 2021 which is a clear sign that he is on our side.

But I was not able to find the official remarks or sources that he claimed it.

Is there anyone who is keen on this? If you have any resource dealing with this, please let me know. Thanks."

2021-05-27 23:32:47,wallstreetbets,Simple; make sure margin is turned off your account or your shares are being lent out and you‚Äôre forfeiting your vote.

2021-05-27 23:12:40,wallstreetbets,"Ford came out swinging with a dig at their competition; a low price matching Tesla, and a huge new focus on fleets with a standard package price matching lordstown.

What will actually happen: $75k average price with deliveries starting mid 2022, as was anticipated a year ago...  Their ICE models lose margin once production is reduced, so it will be a slow shift to EV.

GM is offering early EV reservations for current customers, too.  Those prices are close to $100k, so I think Ford has over promised, or is banking on cost reductions before production starts."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"*UPDATE* Why I still Think EXPI Is Going To $60 In 4-6 Weeks (up 10.59% this week) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkrw5i/expi_why_its_a_buy_60_price_target/

The above link is what I said 2 days ago. At the time EXPI was hovering around $28.50 and since then it has shot up to about $32.27 on what appears to be about average volume for the stock. 

I still think they are going to have a huge share buyback of over 14m shares (their buyback program was increased from 75m to 475m) in stock and add to the insider owned shares which is now at 54.80% over the week it has gone up about 2%. Which is a bullish signal. If 14m shares were bought that would leave about 51m shares to be traded publicly and the insider owned share percentage would go to about 62% which would be a large driving factor in the price going up due to scarcity. Also the buyback would be large enough to trigger a massive buy and I would jizz my pants."

2021-05-27 23:47:32,wallstreetbets,"Regarding your last post, I would want to know where those houses are being sold and for how much. Selling 70,000 houses in rural Iowa at $30,000 each is not as desirable as selling 5,000 houses in Southern California for $800,000 each. 

Not saying you're off the mark, or on the mark. Just information I would want in order to build a more complete picture. I like expi long term as well, but currently sitting on $83 of available margin left to use. So...gunna have to wait to make any more plays."

2021-05-27 22:56:14,wallstreetbets,"My realistic year end price predictions over the next couple years:

2021: $30 - $40
2022: $60 - $80 (or buyout)
2023: $100 - $200 (or buyout)

What are these valuations based upon:
- Continued increasing quarterly sales and patient enrollment of Orladeyo for HAE, with possible +EPS quarters successively to come later this year.
- Starting pivotal trials for BCX9930 (Factor-D) in 2H for PNH patients, resulting in blockbuster results in 2022.
- FDA approval for use of Factor-D for PNH patients by early 2023.

These estimates do not factor in other drugs in their pipeline. Those will be added to the valuation if/when they mature.

These are just my personal price predictions and not investment advise. Please do your own DD to determine what investments meet your financial goals."

2021-05-28 11:17:24,wallstreetbets,Not nervous just kinda pissed I didn‚Äôt come close to the top. Left a ton of money on table. But hindsight hurts.
2021-05-27 22:08:58,wallstreetbets,have you hit on BB before?
2021-05-28 11:30:57,wallstreetbets,Yeah gotta just accept that almost nobody gets the top. I had June calls frkm the original peak that were 20.00 each aaaaaand i held them all down to expired lol

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is the Atlis Motor vehicle pre-IPO round of investing real? I saw an ad to invest in Atlis Motor Company. Its not yet publicly traded and I was thinking of throwing some money in with the hope that it will either get bought out by a larger manufacturer or the share price will increase when they go public. I like how their vehicles look and this seemed interesting to me.

Then I thought about it and thought it was a little weird that a company would advertise to invest in it to the public? Then I thought I remembered someone  told me that the general public cannot invest in a pre IPO stock because they aren't considered a sophisticated investor. Then I thought this might be some type of scam.

Gonna post the link at the bottom.... if anyone knows anything about this please give me some insight. Thanks.

2021-05-27 23:12:55,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs some posts on Reddit about this, it‚Äôs real . However, their chances of success are low. Some have compared them to Tesla and how much money it took for Tesla to succeed, and these guys don‚Äôt have that kind of cash flow. Maybe through this they can build that cash flow. If you have money you don‚Äôt care to throw away then $8 per share is not that crazy . Their real challenge is being able to create a battery that can charge in 15 minutes."
2021-05-28 02:25:33,wallstreetbets,"Just another ape here, but my tiny brain that only thinks about the nanners is saying stay away. They're a battery company that's trying to shift into the vehicle manufacturing business. Looks legit because their ads show 2-3 models from what I've seen, but they haven't produced any mock-ups. Very risky unless you know something I don't. As I said, just another ape, haven't deeply researched the company, but that's the few things/thoughts I've seen thrown around about the interwebs."

2021-05-27 21:25:57,wallstreetbets,This is the way. This is what I strive to be. You have more balls than me and a lot of others. See you on the MOOOOON!!!
2021-05-27 21:36:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm holding January 20 2023 $4 LEAPS. loving the gains so far. Let‚Äôs see if we can keep it going. If it hits GME levels I‚Äôm going to be filthy rich.
2021-05-27 23:54:31,wallstreetbets,"When leaps are this deep itm- sell them, buy stocks, start selling calls (weekly)."
2021-05-27 21:12:03,wallstreetbets,Man leaps were the way to go sheesh
2021-05-27 20:54:59,wallstreetbets,"As someone who‚Äôs never hit that big on leaps, how easy is it to sell them now? Doesn‚Äôt there need to be a buyer in the other end, and who would actually pay that much knowing the price won‚Äôt stay this high long term?

Not criticizing just genuinely curious"
2021-05-27 21:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Wow, when did you buy these? Your cost basis is amazing."
2021-05-28 10:02:39,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the green? Isn‚Äôt it meant to be a minus and in red?

2021-05-28 01:23:34,wallstreetbets,How many contracts did you buy?
2021-05-28 09:49:47,wallstreetbets,There are 70 million GME stocks and around 6 times as many AMC. Hitting GME levels would that mean 1/6  the price of GME?
2021-05-28 02:11:03,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt be too smart to buy the stock at these levels lol this is a short squeeze...
2021-05-28 10:58:33,wallstreetbets,Why do you need the stocks to sell weeklies? You are just increasing your risk to do the same thing.
2021-05-27 20:59:54,wallstreetbets,I honestly have no idea. Wen mooning i will exercise.
2021-05-27 21:37:36,wallstreetbets,"I had no issues selling half (2) of my GME leaps during the last spike. No issue when there‚Äôs a lot of volume. On a slow moving, low volume, stock I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs quite difficult to offload them."
2021-05-28 01:50:50,wallstreetbets,"A market maker will buy them for slightly below market value. Part of being a market maker is providing liquidity, and they are required to do so, per their legal agreement to be an MM."

2021-05-28 11:45:23,wallstreetbets,Only buy if you want exposure to the name...
2021-05-27 22:24:28,wallstreetbets,Don't exercise. You give up all the extrinsic value. Better off selling the option and buying the shares.
2021-05-27 21:00:46,wallstreetbets,Um oh ya I forgot you can just exercise rather than sell to close. I‚Äôm tarded

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir Options - DIRT CHEAP TLDR: Just loaded up on some Palantir Options with my sweet tax refund thanks to Uncle Sam <3.

Palantir Options are dirt cheap and there is a lot of eyes on it now. Call options with 100+ day expiry and within $1 of strike are selling for less than $2 per contract. Lots of analysts very bullish on this stock. As always do your own DD.

See you at the top boys.

Position: $40c June 17 '22

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them."

2021-05-27 23:07:49,wallstreetbets,"Also you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tesla might be a bad future investment. (long read)  

so a bit of a preface, i'm pretty new to investing, but one thing i do know is science, so hear me out.

Tesla is known as a good long term investment because of the fact that eventually we are all going to need electric cars in hope to reduce our carbon emissions as low as possible, meaning the abandonment of the internal combustion engine... or does it? recently in the past few years there have been a lot of study's released proving that synthetic fuel or fuel basically made of of hydrogen with renewable energy like wind power is actually as carbon neutral as electric engines, i think this is dooming to tesla for a few reasons.

1. synthetic fuel is MUCH more convenient then electric. synthetic fuel is able to work in the internal combustion engine which means that people wouldn't have to replace their cars. the base model of the cheapest tesla is 35,000 dollars USD which a lot of family's(including mine) can't afford to spend on a new car, especially if our current one is working. so that's thousands of cars being left in the dust while they can be used and have a neutral carbon footprint.
2. tesla problems. from what i have heard tesla's are built like sh#t, low quality and poor assembly make them prone to needing repairs, which normal car mechanics are not equipped or trained to deal with because of the obvious. also tesla's are extremely heavy, i don't really care about that but apparently that's a huge turn off for others.
3. other industry's. so tesla and other electric car company's make electric cars, not planes or boats, so that means that those to major contributors are left out to still release a lot of co2. with synthetic fuel they can switch alongside cars making it better in that sense.
4. car fans. so i know a lot of car enthusiasts who, all hate tesla's and wouldn't buy one if they had to. they would much rather stick to their cars like Lamborghini's and other old cars that would get left out with electric cars but would still be as usable synthetic, and considering the amount of car enthusiasts in the world and how much they affect the auto market i don't see it panning out there.
5. timing. so no matter what number you agree on for how long it's going to take to switch completely electric it's stupid. so like i said earlier the majority of family's can't just drop thirty five k on a new car meaning it would take awhile to be able to get everyone electric plus the time and money it would take to build up the infrastructure to switch electric but considering that synthetic fuel uses the same stuff as petrol it would be much easier to keep going synthetic.
6. back on the subject of time, i saw a study saying we could switch completely synthetic by 2024 if we tried. whomever if you look at electric you see company's like GM saying they will have 50 new electric MODELS by 2050, do we really have that time? science say's no.

They will continue to be #1 to the Musk fan boys but we're going to start seeing some real great options from Audi, Mercedes, Porsche, Ford and others. The market will continue to grow, but Tesla's share of that growth is going to shrink. If Musk was truely concerned with the environment he would be also pushing green hydrogen tech.

2021-05-28 00:01:46,wallstreetbets,"1. Traditional ICE engines and drivetrains have limited lifespans and will cost more to make than EV's.
2. No one is ""replacing"" their ICE cars, rather as people are in the market for new cars, many opt for EV's.
3. EV's with million-mile batteries, will last 20 years, versus about 10 years for ICE vehicles (also see point 1 for why EV's will last longer). This will mean total cost of ownership is substantially cheaper for an EV. Further, it will ensure a robust used car market where you can buy 5-15 year old EV's for less than comparable ICE vehicles.
4. Tesla's are built fine. There are some minor panel trim issues that should be resolved with the new builds from Texas and Germany (once the factories are up and running). Inherently the new cars with front and rear single casts will be built to tighter tolerances than any other car out there (it is an inherent property of casting, so going to be hard to beat the quality of those Tesla's if you don't use single large castings as well).
5. Weight will go down significantly with the single casts and the 4680 structural cell. This means more range, better handling, and less wear and tear on wheels and suspensions.
6. Not sure the relevance of other industries if batteries are just better for EV's (recall Mr. Diess of VW has agreed that pure battery is the way to go).
7. The switch to electric seems to be going as fast as Tesla can make them. Tesla is also making home battery packs and solar panels which are increasingly being rolled out which help make the grid more robust and support more EV's.
8. If you can switch to synthetics now, than might as well, but no reason it should stop the move towards EV's. Further, the idea that you can make synthetic fuel efficiently is based on having access to green energy, but you point (#5 in your list) says the electric infrastructure is not there... The thing is, making hydrogen takes about double the energy you get  out of it, so to go to synthetics you need your grid to be double what it needs to be for BEV's, which is where I will stop with this, as trying to think through the apparent contradictions this raises is causing my head to hurt.

Basically, Tesla will have incredible growth and any attempt to move to synthetics will likely result in a massive failure as it makes no sense to build vehicles that use that if you can make them BEVs instead."

I think hydrogen and synthetic fuels will become viable for long-distance freight carriers (think semi-trucks and freight planes) where only a small number of refueling stations are needed with a steady demand to make production viable. 

For personal transportation I would bet on full electrification with major improvements in battery technology and charging infrastructure just a few years away. Tesla may play a part in these industries if they can keep their customer fan base loyal like Apple does and willing to tie themselves to their eco-system. But I see them as maybe having 10-30% market share in the future just like Apple does. Huge but not dominant. Definitely not justifying their current valuation (worth more than many of the other major auto-makers combined)."

Because H2 will inevitably be supplied (right now it's 95% of H2 supply) by natural gas the through steam-methane reforming process. This requires both high heat and high pressure--energetically expensive, and must be factored into the efficiency.

This is guaranteed to be the predominant force in H2 production, should it ever reach a matured market because oil majors have the most money to buy politicians with. This is a law of nature that also must be factored into the calculation. This analysis cannot fail to take into account Big Energy's grip on policy, just by virtue of the system of legalized bribery--in the US and everywhere else billionaires run the country.

So there's the energy to get H2 from NG. The by-products: H2O, CO, CO2. Transport costs to the gas stations, more GHG into the system. Then the efficiency of the burn and power losses over the course of a regular ICE engine--this is the biggest efficiency loss. There are a tonne of steps in this process, it's energetically expensive, and therefore, produces more GHG by-products. 

Don't be fooled. H2, if it ever becomes viable, will be another tool of the big oil majors. They control the multi-trillion dollar extraction and processing infrastructure already. They will use it any possible way to squeeze every possible shekel out of it until it breathes its last breath, and they don't care if they turn the entire planet into the Sahara Desert in the process.   

Until we have home electrolysis units producing fuel safely from our homes, or otherwise cut Big Energy interests out of the equation, H2 will remain a gimmick."

Even then, H2 fuel replacements will just be a transition away from the consumer ICE marketplace. 

Given the same price, would you rather have a vehicle that burns fuel and needs oil changes or one that doesn't do either, which do you want? I know which one sounds more appealing to the average person.

The advent of EVs throws the efficiency question out the window for ICE vehicles. They simply can't compete with upwards of 70% efficiencies from EVs, plus the low maintenance, no oil changes, extension of battery pack life, etc. 

These other fuels do have a place in the transportation needs of the future--drones, aircraft, industrial machinery, all will continue to use liquid fuels for combustion, but the retail ICE market will be displaced by batteries and nothing will stop that now."
2021-05-28 13:45:48,wallstreetbets,"Hey I added another link.  The path is simple if you are dedicated to making them work.  Think of it like solar with batteries.  The fuel cell is your battery.  But also, the H2 you get can be used as gas for stoves and fireplaces and what not.  

I love my ICE car.  I'd love to run it on H2.  Personally I dont trust BEVs and every Li-ion battery I've had didnt last after a few years (I know car batteries are more robust).  Infact I had a cell phone battery nearly blow up, the casing was bulged out like a balloon.  If I could I'd remove all the computer dependency out of the car I'd do it too.  There is no way I'd want to spend a third of a day charging a car if I wanted to do any distance driving.

People think about H2 in small passenger vehicles all wrong.  Forget efficiency for a moment.  Once we get away from gas reforming and H2 is made off peak hours from the grid.  It'll be freely sourced from water or waste.  Solar, wind, hydro, nuclear will make the H2 free too.  It'll be abundant and clean the air by using it.  They have materials in development that can store H2 4x as compact as traditional tanks and contain 5x the fuel.  Couple that with ultra capacitors or batteries that dont rely on rare earth metals or toxic lithium and the benefits out weigh any efficiency arguments to me."

This is all understandable as an emotional response to the changing market, but ultimately this approach ignores the raw reality that BEVs are vastly more efficient and lower cost of maintenance than anything else. By a longshot.

There's no motivation to put a tonne of money into H2--especially into large-scale production of consumer level electrolysis--because BEVs already solve every problem with *higher* efficiency. People and companies have better things to spend their money on than a problem that's already solved. They'd end up spending a fortune for a final product that's less than half the efficiency with current BEV tech.

Who's taking that deal? Someone with a large marketing budget.

>They have materials in development that can store H2 4x as compact as traditional tanks and contain 5x the fuel. Couple that with ultra capacitors or batteries that dont rely on rare earth metals or toxic lithium and the benefits out weigh any efficiency arguments to me.

First, storing H2 is incredibly tricky. Even the most water-tight storage containers can leak H2. Secondly, the battery materials problem is largely solved or solvable. LiFePO4 batteries have cut Co out of the equation, increased battery life by tens of thousands of cycles over LiO, and solved the thermal runaway problem. You've got outdated info."

It'll cause massive power outages.  The electricity needed to charge everything comes at a cost too.  Maybe green power will be enough, but judging from the winter storm this year and how the grid failed.  I have my doubts.   Massive infrastructure will need to be put in place.

Also, there will be major supply issues with sourcing batteries and disposing them.  Unless something revolutionary in the battery tech comes along.  Elon has been promissing that.  He also said he'd have a truck and semi.  So far other auto manufacturers filled that market.  Ford F150, Hyundai Semis.  Some big companies talk of going all electric but its just lip service, there are way too many ICE for the time being.

It's the most important part of the equation. Ignore it at your peril. 

>How can a city support charging all BEVs. It'll cause massive power outages. The electricity needed to charge everything comes at a cost too.

The national grid in the US needs serious upgrades. Perfect time for a ""New Deal"" for the American people, no? Maybe a new deal that aims to be energy efficient and unchained from the uncertainties and waste of the petroleum economy--what do you think?

Besides the obvious benefits of cheap, clean energy by a massive investment in PV, wind, etc., there are vast amounts of good paying jobs that can largely absorb the employment force of the oil/fracking companies and create thousands of private companies as well. 

A lot of people are still holding onto the petroleum model, but we're already past that as the primary energy source. Nobody wants to touch another drop of oil if they don't have to. Is that where you're coming from? Nostalgic for dragsters and muscle cars and the smell of burning fuel? I get that. Really. Been wrenching on bikes mostly, but it relaxes me to take experiment with carburetor jet sizes to get the right burn. 

But the battery tech is undeniable. And it's a decade ahead of H2. Plus, the EVs don't need extensive infrastructure investment compared to H2. The wires are already run, just need the charging stations. Not cheap, but not anywhere near the expense of H2 storage/piping/transport.

Seems we have to agree to disagree, but my money is where my mouth is. Dinosaur tech will produce questionable returns when there's an obviously better tech at price parity."

Today $BB is at 10$, just sell put at 10$ and with what you earn you buy call at the same strike and at the same expiry time, in practice you finance call with put.

This way if $BB stays above 10$ you always gain and you only lose money if $BB falls below 10$."

So this yolo basically means you are gambling on the chance that BB will increase by way more than 300% within the timeframe to be able to buy them at $40 which is a discount by then?"

I say Technically because I don't know if commissions (cost paid to beoker for fascinating the trade) is being paid and if it's being factored in the calculations.  If he is paying commission then the True break even price includes entrance and exit commissions which would cause the breakeven price to be slightly higher.  Its great hough that this is not like the good old days of high commissions trades.

I'll be trying to get out of the June $20 without a loss sometime in the next week or two. Other June and the July stuff I'm gonna ride for a bit and try and get some money. On the following pull back / consolidation phase I'll buy calls for the next leg.

**DD and back story -**

**The Good**

We'll get to that part in a bit

**The bad**

The history: GE was a massive company, has been around forever and was known as one of the quintessential American companies. They became this massive conglomerate that bought up companies left and right leading up to the mortgage backed securities bonanza in the mid 2000's. Not sure I'll need to remind everyone what happened at the end of that (Rhymed with Semen Mothers) but GE took it particularly bad. See after the 2008 / 2009 meltdown it turned out that not only had they lost a ton of money on derivatives and other financial products but (as would become public later) they lied to investors about it on disclosures and jumped through hoops to keep investors from finding out just how bad the situation was. Add to that some really badly timed all cash acquisitions that worked out terribly and the company was about ready to go belly up.

**The Ugly**

There is a reason that while the whole world got its act back together after 2009, GE continued to play act a paraplegic thrown in the deep end of a pool. The stock took beating after beating as news kept coming out about acquisitions that went bad (massive write downs), accounting fraud and various other losses. After getting rid of their CEO they brought in someone else to try and turn things around, then after a very short run they replaced that guy with the current CEO Larry Culp. They basically had to bribe / beg him to take the job, getting him to leave a cushy gig at Harvard where he was basically in working retirement after having earned a reputation as a corporate turn around guru.

**Making our way back to the good**

While GE's stock continued to flounder Culp got busy and started to shake things up. First he started selling divisions and companies. Some of them had been with GE forever, like the lightbulb divisions, others were acquisitions (some of which only a few years old) that were sold off. This wasn't about profiting by spinning something off - it was about cutting losses and making sense out of a massive company that didn't have a functioning balance sheet. Some of the chunks that were sold were profitable and many were not. The net effect was that he cut operating expenses more than he cut operating revenue, moving free cash flow (FCF) in the right direction (albeit still negative at this point) and raising cash from the sales.

They slashed the dividend to 1 penny. People were clutching their pearls and screaming! I mean... It was GE for Pete's sake. They've had a good dividend forEVER! This dragged the stock down more. But it shoved FCF in the right direction.

Between significantly improved FCF and money raised from selling off divisions and assets GE managed to cut its TOTAL debt from $130 BILLION to $71 BILLION (which is about where it is right now, although they do have more than $25 billion cash on hand). Oh yeah they also own 25% of Baker Hughes (valued at about $6.5 billion, that is after they sold $1 billion worth of it recently), they are also selling GECAS (airline leasing company that owned airliners and rented them out to airlines and other companies) to the global leader in the space. In return for shedding this division, which due to structural issues and insufficient scale to create real efficiencies, was losing GE $700 million a year in FCF, GE is getting $24 billion in cash, $1 billion in cash equivalents and $6 billion worth of a company (45% of the company's stock) that happens to be beaten up at the moment but is the world's largest airline leasing company and is about to have a gang buster year as airlines struggle to find planes. Could easily see the value of that swelling and then them dumping it to pay down even more debt.

**The Good - you may have to squint but it is there. I swear**

GE is now a rather lean company, especially compared to the mess that existed 5 years ago. I've given you the current cash / debt position. From that alone, doesn't seem great but I do ask that you keep in mind the trend line, from $130BB to $71BB over 5 years.

Today GE is made up of 4 divisions (they no longer make home appliances, it isn't one of the divisions. yes I know, they still are on the market but the stuff sold under the GE name in home appliances is by actually made by the Haier conglomerate and.... never mind):

**HealthCare** \- Not sure if any of you have had an MRI but if you had you may have had the same weird experience I did. Walking into the room, kind of nervous to get this big medical test to find out what is wrong with my ::Insert body party here:: and being confronted with the biggest GE logo I have EVER seen. Embossed into the side of this MRI machine. Anyway, whether you were aware of it or not GE makes a lot of tech for healthcare. from MRI machines to ultrasounds and tons of other stuff. It is a growing business that is consistently profitable and ***something*** *:: cough cough COVID knocked us on our butt and hospitals need to retool and get better::* tells me that healthcare spending is going to be rising a lot this year and next year.

**Energy -** Basically this is about steam turbines used for 20th century electricity generation (and storage in some cases). Talking huge turbines used in natural gas, oil, coal, nuclear and geothermal power plants (I think GE itself may consider Hydro power plant turbines part of this sector but I'm listing them below because that makes more sense). While not very forward looking this business has the potential to generate significant FCF over the next few years maybe even a decade or more. While some of these power sources are on their way out others (like natural gas) have seen a surge in utilization and some (nuclear) seem to be about to make a comeback. This chunk of GE is usually profitable, although not hugely so. That being said, between what happened in Texas which will require several power plants to be overhauled or replaced, existing service and new equipment contracts and the potential to grow, I think this is a worthwhile business unit to keep around.

**Renewable Energy -** Some solar, a decent amount of hydro power, a growing pumped storage segment and WIND TURBINES. These electrical generators (and in the case of pumped storage - mechanical batteries) are one of the most exciting areas for me personally when looking at the GE story. GE briefly snagged the title as producing the world's largest wind turbine (14 MW) and it is the largest one that many countries have certified for use. This thing is bonkers, every rotation of the blades produces enough electricity to power roughly 4,000 homes for a DAY. It is a monster and it has been selected for use in the next phase of the world's largest offshore wind farm and the first phase of the US' first large offshore windfarm. GE also makes onshore wind turbines, they make the truly massive turbines used in huge hydro electric damns and they also make turbines for use in pumped storage\*. This segment has up till now been generation negative FCF (losing money) however it is growing by leaps and bounds and seems poised to start adding to positive FCF a little this year or next and then growing exponentially.

\*Pumped storage is really cool. Basically you create a large body of water (like a lake) by using excess electricity made by solar and wind when it is available to pump water up hill. Then, when you need more electricity because it is night time or the wind isn't blowing you throw the turbine in reverse and it acts as a hydro electric damn.

**Aviation** \- This is the crown jewel of GE although in a weird twist of fait it delivered a kick to the nuts just as things started turning around. Needless to go into much detail as to why a business that makes its money building and servicing jet engines might be negatively effected when air travel takes a year and a half pause. That being said GE's newest engines are showing a great track record of winning orders. Doing this DD I found out that apparently when you buy commercial airliners you get to pick what engines you want (if there are more than one option) kind of like when you buy a car and pick whether you want the in dash CD player or not. GE's engines are proving to be more efficient, more reliable and cheaper to operate than their main competitor Pratt and Whitney. That means that as everyone gets waxed and vaxed in preparation for the horney party boom we are about to witness airlines have started ordering planes again and in a big way. You see, during the covid crisis airlines didn't have many customers and what most of them did was they identified their oldest and/or most problematic aircraft and sold them off various other companies in other industries or to companies that lease aircraft to airlines when they need a few to fill a gap. Now that things are coming back online airlines are ordering more planes. As other parts of the world start to open up over time this should create sustained tail winds for this division.

Oh yeah and one thing that often seems to be overlooked is that while yes, the aviation division has been beat up, management has used this as an opportunity to streamline and improve operations. Both sales and maintenance saw significant drops in revenue however the drop in FCF was smaller than would be expected because the whole time GE was improving its margins. Now as their order book starts filling up the aviation division is significantly leaner and more optimized which should mean that when the FCF starts up again this fall or this winter it should turn into a firehose.

**Other points of interest**

GE has announced a 1 for 8 stock split (that is a reverse split, for every 8 shares you own you will end up with 1 share that is worth 8X the pre split value). This makes sense for a few reasons.

1. GE has a massive number of shares outstanding and doing this reverse split will bring its stock price (adjusted for market cap) within line with its piers and should put it in a position to re-enter the DOW. Doing so will create demand for the shares as it is added to funds that track that index.
2. Once GE reinstates its dividend (which will be another catalyst for the stock to continue upwards) the lower share count means a slower drain on FCF since I imagine they will incrementally increase the dividend. It seems silly because it doesn't really matter how many shares except when you consider that they have so many that if you decide to go from a dividend of $0.01 to $0.10 the difference in share float would be hundreds of millions annualized in FCF. Obviously the target yield wouldn't be impacted but even this small thing can have a real impact in speeding up the debt reduction.
3. I fully expect that as the stock price increases and then the reverse split happens GE will do a share issuance to raise a few billion to pay down the debt. I view that as a buying opportunity as any drop in share price should be short lived and I expect the resulting reduction in debt will mean net / net share prices will increase due to the issuance.

On that note GE has committed to a stated target of 2.5 times EBITDA (which is the cutoff for investment grade securities) from the current 6 times EBITDA. Getting to investment grade will create increased upside pressure, that is why I'm saying the stock will go up when they issue more shares (even though there will likely be a temporary dip at that time)."
2021-05-27 20:00:18,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in!
2021-05-27 20:19:00,wallstreetbets,"You should adjust your price targets for the 8:1 reverse split that will cause some head winds. Although not fundamental it does irrationally put pressure on prices.

Also worth mentioning that the decades of creative accounting have built a legacy of uncertainty. Nobody knows what problems will surface because of that. This was the reason I sold in March because I did not want to be exposed to this risk longer term."
2021-05-27 20:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Wow GE to the moon. I think with Joe Biden all them value/older companies are going to do well under him. F, GM, GE, KO, WBA, etc are all up. Old money going to follow old companies by older people. I'm going to join you on this."
2021-05-27 21:36:36,wallstreetbets,"1996 (yes, a quarter century ago) called and wants its GE stock price back. I had that stock when I was a kid through a few years ago. Finally sold that cuckold of a stock. Good luck to you."
2021-05-27 23:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Good DD, I enjoy me some deathbed stocks. But I don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs at a nearly 3 year high. Makes me not wanna buy."

Not a wealthy man. Just doing it one step at a time."
2021-05-27 22:28:27,wallstreetbets,Bringing up some good points
2021-05-28 00:19:02,wallstreetbets,I am an engineer and I used to work for 2 different divisions of GE:  Plastics and Water Technologies.  Both were sold off as GE ventured further into the financial side of the business.  That ultimately blew up in their face but they continue to hold some of the strongest industrial businesses.  If infrastructure and the economy grow in favor of lower carbon sources; GE will do very well.  I‚Äôm watching it.  I like the stock.
2021-05-28 00:56:24,wallstreetbets,I think it‚Äôll close above 15 as early as tomorrow. Like this DD though I‚Äôm in
2021-05-27 20:09:27,wallstreetbets,When you are talking big turbines makes me wonder who is making the turbines used for direct air capture of co2. That‚Äôs the trend not hydro. Since we are running out of water. Dams are cool but no water and wind and co2 turbines make more sense.
2021-05-27 20:22:51,wallstreetbets,Why are you buying calls. The whole play is about shares. And you got the ticker wrong. It‚Äôs GME.
2021-05-27 20:58:09,wallstreetbets,"GE has been losing money for decades, nice try boomer!"
2021-05-27 21:48:08,wallstreetbets,I bought in at $13.70 before it dropped below $9.00
2021-05-27 22:32:40,wallstreetbets,Fuck GE. I ate nothing but spaghetti for 3 months as a kid when my dad was caught in a round of layoffs at his GE plant. Had been there 2 decades.
2021-05-28 00:30:27,wallstreetbets,Sold my ge to buy more gme

2021-05-27 22:08:56,wallstreetbets,thanks!
2021-05-27 22:11:17,wallstreetbets,"I think that my timing on price targets should be good (split adjusted of course). Those are dates leading up to quarterly releases and I expect that to be the general trend line.

As for the accounting stuff - totally get that. I addressed that a bit and from what I've been able to find the new management team has done a thorough job finding all the skeletons and resolving their outstanding litigation liability. Overall I'm confident that the significant free cash flow (high single digit billions quarterly) that they look to be on track to achieve late next year would allow them to weather most storms while paying down debt"
2021-05-27 22:12:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm quite a bit younger, I was still in elementary school then. I totally understand you may have some bad memories but I'd ask that you read my DD and let me know what you think about it. Am always open to new information and if you know about stuff I don't that makes me change my mind I'd thank you for it."
2021-05-27 23:26:47,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! We are right in the middle of a rally. I think we hit 15, maybe as high as 16.50 before it pulls back after earnings (buy the rumor sell the news). So I def think you can wait for a consolidation but I'm riding this wave."
2021-05-27 23:27:01,wallstreetbets,Cheers!
2021-05-28 09:28:32,wallstreetbets,"thanks! so on my price targets - I'm not saying when I think the stock will cross a threshold, just where it'll be on that day. I expect it to run up (hopefully to 16 or 17) into earnings and then pull back."
2021-05-28 06:13:06,wallstreetbets,"And you guys wonder why mods are strict with GME.

Stop acting like invaders and maybe you'll be treated better."
2021-05-27 22:13:28,wallstreetbets,"I totally understand your perspective and from a historical perspective it is spot on. However, if you read my DD above I think I lay out a pretty solid argument for why we are at an inflection point and the stock has a lot of room to grow over the next few years. I'd appreciate any constructive criticism or counter arguments."
2021-05-27 22:04:01,wallstreetbets,GE has a large renewable division as well.  They are pretty well positioned on that front domestically and internationally.
2021-05-27 22:15:40,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure what you are referring to. I'm not aware of any systems that use turbines to capture CO2 directly from the air (carbon removal). I know there are many companies and academic teams trying to develop something to do that at scale but I'm only aware of solutions that rely on using various chemical processes.
2021-05-27 22:05:27,wallstreetbets,So have GME and AMC but that aint stopping anyone there now is it
2021-05-27 22:16:22,wallstreetbets,I'm a millennial and I'd ask that you review my DD and let me know what you think I got wrong. Thanks!
2021-05-27 22:17:33,wallstreetbets,I've laid out my price targets above. I've been following this story for a while now and been on point since it bounced off the bottom making some money along the way. I'm finally focused on trying to time this thing out and make a big chunk.
2021-05-28 02:51:49,wallstreetbets,"Okay so your DD was actually really good (and amusing, not in a bad way). From a valuation standpoint, you‚Äôve had a good year but does it deserve to be a $126bil company? Tripling in a year and a half is ambitious. I would stay diversified with your options. From a fundamentals standpoint, I grew up hearing from my dad (a classic engineer/CEO) about GE‚Äôs business leadership and pedigree, but years of disappointment in their leadership and focus slowly soiled my dad‚Äôs lofty opinions of GE in my mind. I always had those same great expectations that my dad had and that you have of what GE could do with energy and aerospace and it‚Äôs only been steady over time. Sure there has been and is potential but how mired is it in the remaining legacy businesses and debt. I‚Äôve been hearing the same implicit and explicit promises from GE for literally decades. I don‚Äôt think GE is terrible but I do think there are too many other opportunities or companies with better product and personnel leadership. Every dollar invested has an opportunity cost. And I think every dollar invested should be treated as if the invested company has pitched you for that dollar that they‚Äôd put it to work better than anyone else. Is GE still cleaning up their dirty diapers or are they grown ups again. I don‚Äôt know. If Larry Culp and Elon Musk sat with you for an hour asking you to invest in them and their companies, would you really pick Culp over Musk? Okay, so I‚Äôm a Tesla fanboy but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidence that the top employer that engineers want to work at is Tesla. There are other good companies too, it‚Äôs not all about Tesla, I‚Äôm just wondering if GE is in the upper echelon of companies and opportunities. And will money managers look past GE‚Äôs rough recent past? They really want GE in their top 10 holdings list? Sure you can date the hot chick turned hooker that you‚Äôve tamed and cleaned up but at the end of the day do you want to introduce her to your parents? Anyway, your DD was indeed diligent though and I hope your calls pan out. I should also say that I have not stayed current with research or news on GE since I lost interest in them, so be aware I am not current on this, and I can be entirely wrong."
2021-05-27 23:34:03,wallstreetbets,"my counter argument is that tesla is going to be disruptive to the energy sector, but then I discredited myself slightly due to my bias. I feel the energy sector is going to be completely different in the next decade, and I don‚Äôt see how GE naturally fits in. This is also a general answer, have not included my research. I‚Äôm convinced though, and thats all I really care about!"
2021-05-27 22:25:05,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just came online within the last year. Google Occidental petroleum and CO2 direct capture. I am not sure who is making the turbines but they are massive.
2021-05-27 22:19:31,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been long only because I‚Äôve been down, but I‚Äôm totally long on this stock"
2021-05-28 09:34:27,wallstreetbets,"thanks! I 100% understand your thinking and honestly that is part of what I am banking on, that a lot of people haven't been watching too closely because it has been such a dog for so long. I believe GE has turned the corner and adults are once again in charge. I don't think it is the same company it was before things got bloated and ridiculous but I do think the new GE is lean and positioned REALLY well.

Do I think that if GE was fairly valued it should triple? no not at all. However GE's valuation got SO low that even after doubling (which I was along for the ride on) I expect it to continue going up. Right now it is rising on the turnaround story part and over the next year as they continue to aggressively shed debt AND their FCF grows and they start making real profits each quarter the fundamentals will keep the stock moving higher.

As for diversification this isn't the only thing I'm in, just only showed that part of my portfolio.

And I am a huge Tesla fanboy myself. If you were going to give me one million dollars worth of stock from either Tesla or GE I'd take the tesla stock but right now I'm looking to identify shorter term plays that I can profit on using calls to leverage my buying power. And I am very confident on the timing of this particular story. I could totally see Tesla dropping 50% over the next year only to explode later, or not. Who the heck knows? I did make a good chunk on Tesla's run up pre split."
2021-05-28 00:21:55,wallstreetbets,Well to be fair my bull case only runs through 2023
2021-05-28 10:15:38,wallstreetbets,"Cool, yeah, those are all good points. I just assume everyone on WSB is all in on one company, so I assumed these were all or at least most of your calls/positions. They‚Äôre not terribly out of reach, you did the $20 Jan ‚Äò23 calls not the $45 where you think it‚Äôll be, you‚Äôre probably totally fine and likely will make money. I‚Äôm too personally scarred from GE but you‚Äôve convinced me to invest your money in it üòú, it‚Äôs probably a good play. Best of luck with it! There‚Äôs probably some government infrastructure impact on it too with the energy side, we know how failed Cali‚Äôs infrastructure is and recently Texas‚Äôs so yeah, probably more positives than negatives with this play."
2021-05-28 11:48:18,wallstreetbets,yeah totally! and while I fully believe it'll be at $45 plus I'll still make plenty of money if it comes in shy of that :)
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Up 2.5k from 5 calls and 60 shares of AMC with an initial 2k investment. Profits into shares or more calls?

2021-05-28 09:55:16,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a solid plan.
2021-05-28 07:22:26,wallstreetbets, Not necessarily. But high volume in a meme almost always means buyers driving up the price.
2021-05-28 09:56:07,wallstreetbets,"So I actually did do it. It‚Äôs not a lot of cash though, only 5000 ( I‚Äôm a relatively poor college student ) so far I‚Äôm Down 100 bucks but up 7k on my calls soüòÇ"
2021-05-27 22:41:14,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs probably why it will rise. When the shorts start covering it‚Äôll take off
2021-05-28 07:23:20,wallstreetbets,"So, low volume can mean sideways to downward? Because of lack of action?"

2021-05-27 23:25:20,wallstreetbets,"The relentless four-day winning streak in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is drawing even more blood from short sellers.  
  
The movie theater‚Äôs 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.  
  
AMC Entertainment shares have more than doubled so far this week  
Retail investors have cheered gains in the cinema chain while hashtags like #AMCSTRONG, #AMC500k, and #OccupyWallstreetAMC trended on Twitter. The stock has consistently been the most referenced asset on the social trading platforms like StockTwits lately. Thursday‚Äôs rally cost shorts another $634 million, according to S3 Partners, bringing losses to just below $2 billion for the year.  
  
While some shorts have been covering their positions, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3‚Äôs managing director of predictive analytics, he believes the pain could get even worse for skeptics. The company, along with retail investor favorite GameStop Corp., ranks high on S3 Partners‚Äô ‚ÄúSqueeze Score metric‚Äù with each scoring a 10 out of 10.  
  
‚ÄúThis signifies that both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said by email. Roughly 20% of shares available for trading for both companies are currently sold short, S3 Partners data show."

So, when the hedgies crash the AMC stonk down again I will be rooting for 7.76. If that happens, I will buy 3 more shares and see if I can average back to 7.77. It seems like it would work but math isn't my strong suit and I'm just a retarded ape.

> 
> Shares soared 36% to $26.52 as 691 million shares changed hands, in the busiest day since January for the Leawood, Kansas-based company. The four-day rally more than doubled its stock price, pushing its year-to-date gains to 1,150%.
> 
> AMC‚Äôs revival has been fueled by individual investors eager to save the movie theater industry after it raised more than $1 billion in financing to avoid bankruptcy over recent months.
> 
> Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron has embraced the Reddit-fueled rally and talked to new retail investors on conference calls. The stock has roughly tripled since AMC reported quarterly results on May 6, adding $9 billion in value. Thursday‚Äôs milestone stands out against a market value bottom of $216.8 million which was hit in April 2020.
> 
> AMC Entertainment's market value has soared to a record amid retail mania
> While Chad Beynon, an analyst with Macquarie Securities, is waiting for AMC to continue to shed debt and lease obligations before getting more constructive on shares, he acknowledged the mania individual investors can create.
> 
> ‚ÄúThe Reddit crowd is strong, the volumes have been off the charts lately, so there‚Äôs clearly demand that wasn‚Äôt there pre-Covid,‚Äù he said by phone. The company‚Äôs ability to raise cash at over $10 a share earlier in the month ‚Äúmarked the first time the company was able to financially benefit from the Reddit rally,‚Äù he said.
> 
> The cash AMC has raised through the sales of hundreds of millions of additional shares is a key driver for the massive run-up in market value despite the stock actually trading down more than 25% from a 2015 peak. More than 490 million shares of AMC are currently available for trading, data compiled by Bloomberg show, almost ten-times the 52 million shares outstanding at the start of last year.
> 
> Number of AMC Entertainment shares has soared as the theater raised cash
> More Capital
> Debt tied to AMC has rallied alongside shares, setting new highs in recent days. The company‚Äôs bonds, which were trading at a low of 5 cents in November, are inching close to par, according to Trace trading data. That debt carries a hefty coupon of 12% for the notes due 2026.
> 
> AMC‚Äôs bonds were among the top performers in the U.S. high-yield market on Thursday, extending gains from earlier in the week.
> 
> The company said previously it might seek more financing, and some investors have suggested it sell more shares to pay down or look to refinance its more than $10 billion debt load.
> 
> The cinema chain ‚Äúwill carefully examine the raising of additional capital in whatever form we think is most attractive‚Äù and is focused on de-leveraging, Aron said on a call to discuss fourth-quarter results in March.
> 
> AMC's bonds reach record high amid Reddit rally
> The company‚Äôs latest resurgence at the hands of individual investors has pushed the market value to more than double its April 2017 peak of $4.17 billion prior to this year‚Äôs trading. Put a different way, AMC has consistently added more than $1 billion in each of the last three sessions -- more than double its value at the start of the year.

Movie theater has surged 120% this week to a four-year high
Mentions on social media have soared with #AMCSTRONG trending
The relentless four-day winning streak in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is drawing even more blood from short sellers.

The movie theater‚Äôs 120% surge so far this week has dealt investors betting against it roughly $1.3 billion in losses, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners. The stock, which has become a poster child for retail traders using Twitter and Reddit to squeeze short-sellers, soared 36% Thursday to the highest level since May 2017.

AMC Entertainment shares have more than doubled so far this week
Retail investors have cheered gains in the cinema chain while hashtags like #AMCSTRONG, #AMC500k, and #OccupyWallstreetAMC trended on Twitter. The stock has consistently been the most referenced asset on the social trading platforms like StockTwits lately. Thursday‚Äôs rally cost shorts another $634 million, according to S3 Partners, bringing losses to just below $2 billion for the year.

While some shorts have been covering their positions, according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3‚Äôs managing director of predictive analytics, he believes the pain could get even worse for skeptics. The company, along with retail investor favorite GameStop Corp., ranks high on S3 Partners‚Äô ‚ÄúSqueeze Score metric‚Äù with each scoring a 10 out of 10.

‚ÄúThis signifies that both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,‚Äù Dusaniwsky said by email. Roughly 20% of shares available for trading for both companies are currently sold short, S3 Partners data show."

2021-05-27 23:59:32,wallstreetbets,"The options pricing shows that they still believe both AMC and GME will crash down any day. They have constantly been wrong but it's still true.

I made a post months ago on the options sub about how far away from standard options pricing the calls for these stocks are.(specifically GME)

They are priced to fail because the market believes so strongly that it has to go back down. Call spreads have been super profitable for this reason"

2021-05-27 22:08:01,wallstreetbets,"Idk, am retarded, sorry"
2021-05-27 22:27:01,wallstreetbets,"They might. They would collect a little premium to help the margin calc but don‚Äôt protect downside much. If the stock goes 2x again, they still face a margin call where if they sell they need to buy back the puts or face risk the opposite of your original thesis. If the squeeze is viewed as temporary, the puts are probably still expensive as they have had little time to degrade."
2021-05-27 22:25:50,wallstreetbets,They thought we would‚Äôve sold by now. Everyday for the last 5 months this bubble they blew gets bigger and bigger and bigger.   POP

2021-05-27 22:22:54,wallstreetbets,Hard to find any buyers.
2021-05-27 22:06:09,wallstreetbets,Someone answer this please
2021-05-27 23:20:18,wallstreetbets,"I think that is fundamentally the reason they are in this position right now.

They sell a put, presumably the options market maker buys that put, and then the options market maker sells some naked/synthetic shares into the market to remain neutral as bonafide risk arbitrage.  Eventually that option expires, and the options market maker needs to unwind the arbitrage position to maintain the minimum net capital, as that naked share will count as a liability that is un-resolved.  They don't have to buy immediately, but under the net capital rules, the short positions unresolved after delivery are debited at an increase of 25% of the current market value every 7 business days - this is the premise for the 21 day cycle we are seeing."
2021-05-28 18:08:37,wallstreetbets,"And this also ignores the calls they bought previously in case it rocketed.

Those big OTM sweeps are them covering their ass as they short sell more."
2021-05-27 22:37:38,wallstreetbets,"After the Archegos saga, which bank would be liberal enough to grant such large margins?"
2021-05-27 22:50:07,wallstreetbets,"They can also hedge the worst of the short position by buying high calls.  They can then deliver on the short positions from the calls.  The problem with that is they do further encourage a gamma squeeze by doing so, but its bette than getting hammered with a naked short position."
2021-05-27 23:55:46,wallstreetbets,"There's no way they have the buying power/margin for that.

To offset these kinds of losses they would have to sell an insane amount of contracts, what you collect per contract is way less than the margin required."
2021-05-28 00:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but wouldn‚Äôt that pour more fuel on this dumpster fire? Ofc selling naked puts, brokers would have to hedge their risk by buying the underlying stock."
2021-05-28 00:16:51,wallstreetbets,If I had to guess they probably want to trigger a big sell off before making a move like that
2021-05-28 00:45:08,wallstreetbets,"1. They probably are

2. You need a lot of cash on hand in case the put goes belly up for you, so the broker knows you can cover. So if they're not doing this, they don't have the cash on hand because it's all tied up in other assets"
2021-05-28 00:48:58,wallstreetbets,Delete this ..no helping them.
2021-05-28 08:13:18,wallstreetbets,"I think they bought long, drove the price up on purpose, made a shitload of cash, then they sell, and cover their shorts."

2021-05-28 00:59:08,wallstreetbets,I got stock in AMC awhile back because I knew that movie theaters would reopen and they would make money. I think it's silly to believe otherwise.
2021-05-28 00:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Wait for dip, I bet you can buy under $25"
2021-05-28 00:31:18,wallstreetbets,Eh. My opinion is that AMC is overpriced at this point. No doubt in the long run it'll settle around 15 but short run looks like it might hit 35. You are likely to lose big as this price was inflated by retailers and once they lose interest the stick will drop like before when it peaked at 17. Only put in what you're willing to lose and not your months rent and you should be fine. Not financial advice. Am not smart in stocks.
2021-05-28 08:14:54,wallstreetbets,It hit 33 overnight in euro trading. It's just consolidating before open. I fully expect now to hit 33 by next week. Not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor.

2021-05-28 05:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Buying in now is pure FOMO imo. Unless you're gambling on a quick flip, wait for the price to come back down in the next week or so and buy in before the next run up"

2021-05-27 23:17:40,wallstreetbets,Shorts haven't begun to cover. This is bullish momentum and a gamma squeeze so far.

2021-05-27 23:08:19,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I think we're 50/50 on it going to $100. Gamma squeeze can do that alone (I think it's partly responsible for what we've seen so far).  
12.5 % chance that it goes to GME January heights or better on the back of a squeeze. Short squeeze has not started yet.  


Would not be surprised if we consolidate and dip tomorrow, but would be shocked if this was the eventual peak."

2021-05-27 21:48:10,wallstreetbets,I sold at $19. Felt like an idiot today (though I did make a small bit of profit).
2021-05-27 21:59:42,wallstreetbets,"It won't do a GME. It's not shorted nearly enough and was pretty fucked before covid just like gme except they really can't pivot their business model like gme is trying to do. Amc is a company that has an absolutely insane amount of upkeep to essentially sell popcorn on weekends. Ironically of course the fundamental business has almost nothing to do with the short-term stock movements. I had some calls that I sold yesterday for profit but that was just a meme movement play. As for how high it goes, depends on how long the high rollers want to play chicken. I wouldn't hold it much further up personally but I also wouldn't be surprised to see it keep mooning short term. Take your preference of risk tolerance."

2021-05-28 08:41:20,wallstreetbets,"Margin Maintenance Requirements

This is Schwab‚Äôs minimum equity requirement to maintain a stock position in accounts that have and use the margin feature.

     AMC

     AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc

     Margin Maintenance Requirement

     Special Maintenance: 150%

If you have a special maintenance requirement on your account that is greater than the equity-specific requirement, then the account level maintenance requirement will supersede the equity-specific requirement.

Margin requirements are subject to change at any time. You must meet initial deposit requirements on all trades.

Stocks trading for less than $3.00 are not marginable.

Typically, the ongoing maintenance requirement for most stocks is 30%, but it can be much higher for volatile or lower-priced securities.

Special maintenance requirements are set at Schwab's discretion and are intended to reflect a stock's volatility and to ensure that your account maintains sufficient equity to cover large price movements. Some stocks are so volatile or illiquid that they cannot be margined.

Margin requirements may be changed due to concentrated positions, non-diversification, changes in market conditions or at Schwab's discretion.

This value is not applicable for portfolio margin accounts, which utilize a different set of calculations."

That's like a cop who is accused of a crime and gets investigated by his department and finds no wrong doing. (There are good cops, don't get me wrong. But historically speaking internal oversight shouldn't be the standard operating procedure. Should be like car insurance. Should be external audits and recommendations.)

Lastly, punitive damages with jail time. If I commit fraud and make hundreds of thousands, I'm going to jail and getting someone's banana in my crack. But when a financial institution does it and makes billions and pays settlement with millions, that's baked into their cost of business.

Here's that number put into perspective. 1 million seconds 11.5 days. 1 billion seconds 31.7 years. 

I'm no math person. But I know when I'm getting fucked. Those numbers are insane and laws should be revised or enforced to ensure maximum penalties to deter these behaviors."

And if karma is coming, it‚Äôs been a long time coming and all going against the ultra rich hedge funds. They decided to short businesses to try to take massive profits off of a company going bankrupt, causing thousands of people their jobs. Like they have been doing for decades and only getting slaps on the wrist. 

It‚Äôs over. The people are done with it."
2021-05-27 23:36:36,wallstreetbets,"Don't....

You don't know where they have been..."
2021-05-27 23:43:57,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, why does a long weekend imply pullback?"
2021-05-28 02:24:26,wallstreetbets,This means i could sell today and buy monday again? Maybe even more?
2021-05-28 02:27:04,wallstreetbets,"So their unrealized losses are so large that accepting failure guarantees financial ruin?

Too big to fail sucks when you're getting fucked by it, doesn't it wall street?"
2021-05-28 10:29:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm a retard, how do call spreads profit when the prices are so jacked up"
2021-05-28 10:44:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean both GME (and probably AMC) prices are obviously not anywhere close to its (much lower) fundamental value. Eventually it *will* go back down, it's just a matter of timing it right."
2021-05-28 02:37:51,wallstreetbets,"I have to imagine some funds are already at implosion levels of unrealized losses, so their only hand to play is to keep going and hope apes paper hand."
2021-05-27 21:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Curious what makes you put that timeframe to it? I think we are going to see a correction of some extent like we did earlier this year, but why <7 days?"
2021-05-27 23:11:13,wallstreetbets,What are you willing to bet?
2021-05-28 00:08:57,wallstreetbets,"They can downvote all they want. You‚Äôre right, you think Wall Street is going to fall for this twice .... we are about to see a reversal"

2021-05-27 22:11:50,wallstreetbets,Loook you are not wrong but I think it has more to do with the price of the stock than the value of it.
2021-05-28 07:31:05,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, no"
2021-05-28 08:41:50,wallstreetbets,Lol bunch gme haters couldn't stand their show pony being talked about that way lmao!

2021-05-27 22:33:12,wallstreetbets,It will happen after it does. You can tell by the way it is.
2021-05-27 22:47:56,wallstreetbets,I dunno if you should be downvoted. The squeeze will be over only after the shorts have covered. Even after today those cocky fucks shorted MORE. The short interest went up on AMC today. Buy what you can and hold when you can‚Äôt.  There‚Äôs no date and there‚Äôs no price limit. Escape that idea.
2021-05-27 22:49:13,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôre looking to learn I suggest watching Matt kohrs. Live everyday that the markets open and teaches newbies what‚Äôs going on using real data and the lingo and explains it a newbie friendly way. He made 169k on amc today.

2021-05-27 23:04:57,wallstreetbets,Another guy had the idea of using the premium from selling the puts to buy calls and more or less freeze their losses in position to ride it out.
2021-05-28 01:10:50,wallstreetbets,"I put 150 in (10.7 shares) the end of January, cause I was like, people are gonna go back to the movies eventually right? But this is really just super fun. Long term betting, but, at least, educated (kinda betting). I wish I knew more!"
2021-05-27 22:26:04,wallstreetbets,"And my guess is even if they did sell puts, their losses far outweigh their gains from selling puts."
2021-05-27 23:15:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah no, it‚Äôs plenty liquid.

Hell the volume was 700m today ...

The number of shares outstanding is 500m"

2021-05-27 22:56:21,wallstreetbets,"Well none of us work for a HF (that are willing to share info) so we can‚Äôt possibly know for sure. 

IMO it‚Äôs hubris. They think they can just wait us out of shake us off. 

My other theory is they are so beyond fucked that if they tried to close they know it would quickly get out of control and bankrupt them. So they are purposefully making the problem bigger so someone bigger and more important downstream from them goes bust too and gets bailed out by the government. They try to get some of that money through whatever bullshit means."
2021-05-27 23:03:11,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, sell puts, buy calls, to essentially freeze their losses and avoid being forced to buy to cover."
2021-05-28 03:08:54,wallstreetbets,I think they were even praised for it lol. They got free publicity.
2021-05-28 01:21:27,wallstreetbets,are you me? I also grabbed 6 at $10 back in march.
2021-05-27 22:28:26,wallstreetbets,"40 @ $12, holding forever"
2021-05-28 01:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Hey, it has to start somewhere. :D

Not every 'stick' has to have dozens of zeros behind it. :D

Should this, or GME, go up the way many believe it might, then there's some decent $ to make, and if it doesn't... lunch money is easy to spend, easy to recoup and easy to let go :)"
2021-05-28 02:53:17,wallstreetbets,"Big hits are awesome. But death by a thousand cuts still works, too. For every ape buying 1000 are thousands of small timers buying 3-50. That‚Äôs nothing to turn your nose to."
2021-05-28 01:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Finally, i found my people! 2 baby shares of GME and 10 of AMC. It ain't much but it's honest work."
2021-05-28 02:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah massive dip coming at ¬£50 I reckon, they‚Äôll try and lead us into thinking the squeeze is over, but even smooth brain ape knows this isn‚Äôt the case."
2021-05-28 08:41:41,wallstreetbets,"No way it goes that high... right?

$100 peak? If we're lucky?

I have 250 shares. I'm scared to get my hopes up lol"
2021-05-28 05:23:05,wallstreetbets,How do you know the shorts haven't begun to cover?

2021-05-27 23:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Didn't AMC issue a shit ton of shares, so $35 now is huge compared to $35 then, as in, not realistic in the long term?

Idk if its up because of the squeeze or the FOMO, or both."
2021-05-27 23:36:59,wallstreetbets,lol a/s/l?

AMC is 1000% shorted! To the moon."
2021-05-27 21:53:40,wallstreetbets,What's an exit strategy?
2021-05-27 22:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Ohbwow, i was thinking at 500 id sell 1 share to cover all I bought  at $9.90 and then ride the rest. 

19 bucks was your bailout point?  Huh."
2021-05-27 22:37:49,wallstreetbets,it‚Äôs may not be shorted as much but it as potentially over a BILLION synthetics that all need to be covered
2021-05-27 23:12:32,wallstreetbets,"1. GME's squeeze in January had nothing to do with their restructuring or pivot.
2. GME's January short interest is a unicorn. It'll never happen again. Not even with GME.
3. That being said, AMC's short positions are much greater now than back in January, it's a higher platform, and from the data, shorts have not begun to cover (probably will see some covering in the next 2 days).

It doesn't take January GME #'s to short squeeze."
2021-05-27 22:13:03,wallstreetbets,Gme business model is hopelessly fucked. We‚Äôre just riding hype dog. This shit is worthless but I‚Äôm buying it anyways.

2021-05-28 04:52:49,wallstreetbets,"it's a laughably low interest rate, I don't know what it is for AMC, but for GME it's 1 or 1,1% of the share price."

2021-05-28 05:15:12,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôd have to lodge more collateral - so yes more interest.

 identify ideal place to short, and go in for the short at the highest yield time. No matter. Bulls will come back on for the re-run to the top. And so on the cycle continues. As long as there is more buying than selling... This reducing the current shares outstanding available to public market and making them more valuable, then yes, whatever short selling comes along will merely be a divit. My guess, as soon as people stop seeing it as the ideal casino, more selling will take place."

For example, 255/260 spreads for next week run about $1.50. For something as volatile as GME you'd expect the odds of it expiring past that to be closer to 50%. Yet it's priced at about 30% chance instead."
2021-05-28 10:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Right, but considering it's been MONTHS now of this state, pricing the % chance of it dropping back down at like 10% per week seems horribly incorrect.(this is pretty much what the options pricing implies, at least on napkin math)"

If the strikes vary then you can collar your gain/loss. BUT, you either come out of pocket for more premium, take risk of further share price appreciation or give up the benefit of your short.

2021-05-27 23:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they waived the requirements but each broker had discretion. RH and other brokers have a legal out so don't expect much. How they handled their internal risk was initiated by the DTC increasing collateral requirements.

The DTC is in cahoots with these guys. They've been accused of allowing naked shorting for a very long time. They only acted in self preservation. If the brokers go tits up, their banks, clearing house, and lastly the DTC are on the hook.

It wouldn't surprise me if decades down the line, we get the truth that some billionaire called in a favor at the DTC to orchestrate the halting of retail buying pressure.

It's unprecedented that buying stocks with cash were halted for retail. While we were locked out, HFs got to reposition and or make profits.

Separately, these crooks dropped the stock price by 77% with 8 million volume. There is material damage done to retail.

We got fucked in the ass without dinner or lube.

2021-05-28 08:15:06,wallstreetbets,"Why are you such a curmudgeon?

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/maintain-short-position-delisted-stock/
A company doesn‚Äôt go bankrupt JUST because of short selling, but short sellers(large firms not everyday retail) have a damn good reason to make shareholders continue to sell off, ultimately hurting the company via stock price. Then the short sellers have no shares to buy back. Free money basically. 
As seen with GME and AMC, shareholders investing in a company can bring them out of debt and completely turn a business around. Now the massive firms betting on their demise have become opposite bag holders and want this stock to fail. 

How‚Äôs that for a brain dead take?

Regulations are being put into place as we speak by officials. You think I, a nobody, have any say in a financial system that has been taking advantage of stocks for decades? Firms have been fined millions of dollars and it‚Äôs nothing compared to the billions they make. 
And I am doing what I can by holding these stocks and helping my new found friends fight back. 

I‚Äôd say anyone taking the time to discuss their opinion on an open forum cares enough to be heard. I‚Äôm listening, and I‚Äôd love to hear a real reason as to why you oppose this. If millions of people lose money, what‚Äôs it to you? People, collectively, lost more than that last year."

2021-05-28 00:39:49,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did halting retail buying cause options to end unrealized? I would 100% be suing them if that happened to me."
2021-05-28 03:13:41,wallstreetbets,Nah. Most people were playing options or long equity prior to all this. Literally nobody was talking about opening short positions. Even folks doing options strats weren't selling naked calls.
2021-05-27 23:57:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes,however, they weren't using illegal loopholes and tactics and smear campaigns."
2021-05-28 00:07:46,wallstreetbets,Very few people here have an broker that would allow them to open naked short positions. Most can only buy some puts or sell call credit spreads if they want to inverse a particular stock.
2021-05-28 02:45:32,wallstreetbets,Ah you still have faith in the system.
2021-05-28 02:25:25,wallstreetbets,Little bit of exaggerating. Maybe. We don‚Äôt know cuz the system is so completely rigged. The truth will come out eventually though. If I‚Äôm rigjt the magnitude that hedge funds went to will be close to if not market crashing and they‚Äôll have to cover.... what is that stock again... oh GME. Yeah that. Everything will tank and GME will sore. Do your own DD though.
2021-05-27 22:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Just my opinion of course. This is not financial advice.


I believe this isn‚Äôt the shorts covering. I believe this is more of a gamma squeeze rather than an actual short squeeze."
2021-05-27 23:50:01,wallstreetbets,"Because no shorts covered their position, short interest is actually higher on the day so they just shorted it more. All this price action is pure FOMO and sentiment."
2021-05-28 00:45:27,wallstreetbets,Because the people invested in it are literal apes. They might lose all their money than sell it. This is what heavy retail investment does IMO.

2021-05-27 23:33:54,wallstreetbets,I wonder if setting stops is hurting things (in the big picture). Certainly massive multi billion dollar hedge funds have ways of finding out where the stop losses are

I'm sure there's thousands of ppl still holding on Robinhood"
2021-05-28 01:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Calls that were ITM that weren't exercised and then OTM, you lost $.

Speculative, but these PFOF brokers sell your data with their overlords.  It's a possibility they know where retail stop losses are and can hypothetically short the shit out of a stock when buying pressure is completely turned off and those stopped losses are activated.  Losing $.

There are many lawsuits coming out.  However, I wouldn't expect anything from them.  The DTCC gave brokers a legal out when they increased collateral requirements.  Even though we were told they were waived months later.  The brokers had to evaluate their risk and acted accordingly.  They had full discretion.  

In short, they would have failed their margin-call, gone ding dong down, so in order to protect their business, they restricted/limited buying on certain securities.  They'll spin it like this.  In order to protect their customers (not retail, but institutions), they had to limit buy on certain stocks because of volatility."

2021-05-28 01:27:17,wallstreetbets,They actually borrowed another 5 million shares against amc just today. The trend we've seen the last few days seems to be continuing even into AH. If the price went all the way up to almost tap $30 then I'm sure most people will see the current price as a sale. After the morning paper hand people will see other people buying still and jump back in. As long as apes protect the high then the fomos and day traders will continue to hop on board imo.
2021-05-27 23:07:19,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, we saw the same thing last time, this is just a gamma squeeze"

2021-05-28 11:58:46,wallstreetbets,You are the man
2021-05-28 05:56:18,wallstreetbets,What brokerage app do you use? The trailing stop percentage is an option to sell in that tab. You might have to click on advanced or a drop down if you're only getting prompted to sell all shares at market price.
2021-05-28 06:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Ok, say you bought 10 stocks at $10. Now that stock is $20 but is volatile. You're sitting on your $100 profit and don't mind letting it ride for a little while to see where things go.

To protect a chunk of those gains, you can set various parameters. The easiest one to understand that will protect the most gain is the trailing stop loss. What is does is set a limit you are willing to lose until, but the trailing part is important. It keeps increasing as the stock goes up. 

If you set it to 20% (there is an option for dollar amounts but I find it easier to pick a percentage) it won't just sit at a 20% loss at $20 if it goes up to $30. Your limit will now automatically move to a 20% loss of $30, capturing all the gains you made up to that point. That's why it's a trailing number, since it follows the stock up.

Now if it shits the bed and goes down to $8, your 20% limit let you get out at $16, protecting some of your gains. 

The biggest choice you have to make is what profit you're comfortable losing, and what you stop loss is set at. Too high, like 10% on a fluctuating stock, and you screw yourself out of gains if it just touches it and rebounds up 12% unless you are on top of it. I don't have time to watch my investments all day, so I set alerts and orders.

I know diamond hands are coveted around here, but there are a lot of bag holders who buy stocks high and then ride them all the way to the ground with zero protection."
2021-05-27 22:47:32,wallstreetbets,Weird. That's how long I've been on Imgur. Maybe I did set this up at the same time and don't remember. I just used my Google account to login today and it asked me a bunch of questions about what I liked and wanted to follow. I assumed it was brand new account today.

2021-05-27 22:16:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't know or really care to look. The data will be weeks old so not totally reliable, and the stock market is heavily skewed in favor of the market maker and big money investors.

To be honest I had almost forgotten I even held AMC in my portfolio until Yahoo told me it reached my target price yesterday. It's only up 110% beyond my initial investment which is kind of pathetic when compared to the magic internet money everyone around here seems so afraid of.

It is worth noting the Volkswagen short squeeze in 2008 occurred with only 12% of the float shorted, however."

2021-05-28 11:08:53,wallstreetbets,"That isn't how margin calls work.  I could have 100B AUM and get margin called on a 10M position.  Margin calls are about liquidity, what made it obvious a margin call was going on with GME was that the stock was booming as the overall market was falling.  Institutions were liquidating other positions for liquidty, further driving selling by automatic trigger points.  This brings the market down as a whole.   Which is why stop losses on anything are a risky bet if a short squeeze is going on.  You can get stopped out of a position becuase institutions need liquidity."

2021-05-28 15:50:57,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Already opened the account and found an option within to transfer directly from RH to Fidelity. Looking forward to the future of attempting to learn the market. This group has already been extremely useful! Cheers everyone!

2021-05-27 22:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Short volume would not be 30%, like it has been for the past couple days (and is typical for AMC) unless it was a very small short position being margin called."
2021-05-27 22:47:32,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, but if the short interest starts to fall sharply there's a good likelihood that its because someone got margin called."
2021-05-27 22:49:04,wallstreetbets,It probably won‚Äôt be public knowledge until way after they‚Äôve been margin called. Similar to the Archegos situation.

2021-05-28 10:23:20,wallstreetbets,"The goal for 401k is long term gains, safe retirement. You should have *some* flexibility with the funds, but generally they are all blended assets which are stable and safe, and I don't know anything, but I'd recommend target funds (they're structured based on 5 year increments for your target retirement date). 

First you should absolutely hit the annual $19.5k pre tax. And second the Roth IRA (or traditional converted depending on income) max of $6k (which you can put into your own Fidelity account and play with stocks and options if you so choose). Thirdly, invest post-tax money into your 401k. This isn't available at every job. The max per year is $57k."
2021-05-28 01:05:14,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice, and is fact, terrible advice. 

What --> I <-- would do personally is cash out the 401, take the tax hit, drop the money in the biggest turnaround company of all time. 

If Gamestop doubles at any time from here til your retirement, you will have covered your taxes and then some. 

Maybe even and then some and then some and then some more.

I think you're mainly addressing this point.   
   

>It's smarter to put away retirement savings at the current tax bracket you are in and not pay taxes when you withdraw at retirement.
  
Ok, so this assume Roth 401k. 
 
One of the ways Roth is good is if you expect your withdrawals to be about or greater than your salary (with some leeway because who knows what tax rate is when withdrawing). 

But if your retirement income/401k withdrawal is significantly less than your salary, then traditional may be the way to go."
2021-05-28 00:03:42,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how marginal tax brackets work? In all seriousness.

You only get taxed more on the extra money you make. You won't make less money if you somehow do end up in a higher tax bracket."
2021-05-28 00:08:45,wallstreetbets,"But you're not going to be paying more taxes when you retire though. You'd be withdrawing say, 20-30kish per year and you'd be taxed on that as income. That's way less than what you'd be making at the height of your career. Not understanding what you mean."
2021-05-27 20:41:53,wallstreetbets,"Happy cake day. 

The idea with pre tax contributions is that when you pull it out (üòú) you‚Äôre retired, aka not working, and in a lower tax bracket. You can also opt for Roth 401k contributions which means you pay into the 401k with post tax money."

2021-05-28 11:09:22,wallstreetbets,Actually not sure about that.  I think matches are employer dependent because I'm pretty sure Vanguard said matches would still happen with post-tax contributions on my plan (but could be wrong).
2021-05-28 02:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Planning for retirement is very individual. Because taxes and inflation increase constantly, I personally don't think utilizing a 401k as my main retirement income source is wise. I am anticipating maintaining my current lifestyle and I do think I will be spending more than I am now. I won't be working so I anticipate a socially active lifestyle is going to cost more than my current lifestyle. If you consider that you only have the weekends to be social when working, then in retirement you will have the entire week to plan social activities."

2021-05-28 01:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I think you have to look at it as an individual.  I make good money. I plan to sustain my current way of life till I die. So I calculate how much I spend then add in increases in taxes and inflation. Then I add in maintenance of my forever home, vehicle costs and quadruple my current medical expenses. Taxes and inflation don't go down. If you think you are going to ""withdraw 20-30kish"" when you are retired then kudos. You decided for yourself that you are going to live your retirement years modestly. My mother lives on $2100/mo and is struggling. She is constantly asking for monetary help. That's $25,200/yr. I don't know how many years you have till retirement but I know how many I have. And I'm not going to follow in my mother's footsteps and struggle financially in my retirement. Good luck to you in your retirement."
2021-05-27 20:45:57,wallstreetbets, If you are given that option kudos. Every company (current one included) I have worked for never offered a post tax option. So I do minimums.
2021-05-28 03:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Your not hearing me. A employee decides. Not the government . It should be the same across the board with your mindset
 Not company a does this and company does that. That's my complaint. Your not understanding"
2021-05-28 18:28:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm spanish ..so to me they are the most beautiful women I have ever seen. Spanish women with European features (light eyes, lighter skin tone and hair). Most Spanish people where I live all have dark eyes and dark hair. Different flavor

I've been to Spain and the mix of latin america with European is 100x than plain euro Spanish

Edit: most of those Spanish should be ""latin "" this or that. We use the word interchangeable in northeast us"
2021-05-27 22:58:01,wallstreetbets,"You sir, did the math my brain ignored when seeing a six figure salary! Basically nailed it!"
2021-05-28 14:51:06,wallstreetbets,"I would add Austin, TX to your list.  This place is expensive, and keeps going up."
2021-05-28 11:20:37,wallstreetbets,I bought 3k shares of GME in dec. But yes it was stupid and lucky af. Would not recommend to anyone I liked.
2021-05-28 02:31:47,wallstreetbets,"well yeah, if you think your withdrawals (depending on your other sources of income) to be greater than your salary, then Roth would be the way to go.  

But in any case, higher taxes = higher income, which seems like a good problem to have"
2021-05-28 13:20:56,wallstreetbets,its relative of what you plan on withdrawing vs your current income level
2021-05-27 20:51:45,wallstreetbets,"Ahh so you don‚Äôt even have the option to do post tax contributions? Even within the $19.5k limit? Bummer. 
I assume that also means you can‚Äôt contribute past the $19.5k towards the $57k mega?"
2021-05-28 03:27:08,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a 401k plan sponsored through your specific employer, though."
2021-05-28 00:23:15,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand for a Roth IRA (I have never heard if a Roth 401k) you can contribute $6k/yr post tax, then at age 50 you can contribute $7k/yr till retirement age(the social security administration says this is at age 67). So if u started putting these amts into your Roth IRA at 22yrs old till retirement you will have $287,000 that you can withdraw at retirement without having to pay taxes. If you invested it wisely you will pay capital gains tax on gains when withdrawing above and beyond the 287k. 

A 401k allows you to pre tax withdraw up to 50% of your income and if you are lucky your company matches a bit. My company match is 6%. 

I pull 10% of my income through the 401k program. I thankfully have a nice job that pays well so I contribute the measly 6k into my IRA and the rest into my personal investment account with post tax $ . With any luck the capital gains tax won't go up by the time I start cashing in my investments to pay for my retirement."
2021-05-28 04:58:59,wallstreetbets,And who decides the rules for my 401k?
2021-05-28 08:13:59,wallstreetbets,you don't need to pay capital gain tax on Roth IRA if you don't withdraw early.
2021-05-28 08:45:21,wallstreetbets,"You might want to re-read up on retirement accounts, it sounds like you'll be paying more taxes long term with your current strategy.

You won't pay any tax on Roth distributions.  That's the point - you already paid tax on the contributions, so your burden is covered.  That's why a lot of high income earners do backdoor Roth IRAs.

I do both traditional and Roth accounts for tax diversification.  I do pre-tax 401k because I expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket when I retire, so it makes sense to defer tax payments for me (and pre-tax means more principal invested).  I only do post-tax brokerage investments after I've maxed out all my tax advantaged accounts.

Choice of accounts is highly dependent on everyone's individual situation, but it's not a bad idea to have some diversification.

Also, some of the things you said vary based on company (e.g., my current company allows 90% of income toward 401k, my last allowed 100%)."
2021-05-28 10:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes - good info. 

Unless you're pouring everything into rental properties, or something like that, which would cause you to be in a *higher* tax bracket in retirement, pre-tax now is a good idea."
2021-05-27 22:04:00,wallstreetbets,"No, that was it, I don't have any additional advice. Good luck."
2021-05-28 00:04:11,wallstreetbets,"What part of ""You're a moron"" is advice you fucking lunatic?"
2021-05-28 06:38:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh, looks like I forgot to write why you are a moron. Your target allocation of funds is moronic. I was trying to point out that all you wrote is bs, funny but bs. All know it here, but you put your 401k on the line to back it up. Hence, moron. Good luck nevertheless."
2021-05-28 10:55:58,wallstreetbets,None of that is advice.  I don't think you know what words mean.
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Rolling AMC Covered calls a few times today. To those that were on the other side congrats.

2021-05-28 07:59:15,wallstreetbets,shares were already bought at 12....
2021-05-28 00:26:09,wallstreetbets,"non. just me being dumb  and further out reduced the costs so i don't have to spend additional money on the role I am just spending the credit difference.   I don't know how long it last and if buying pressure stays like it was with GME the price of the shares bought are still covered to the new strike price. as vix decreases i can just rebuy back the calls at a discount then sell and close the position.  

i have two puts if it drops next week or tomorrow so I am covered there. in all if i just learn to stop fucking with shit I would make more money... 

the original june 4th calls likely will end up expiring otm after the down turn and I would have made a good amount. 

also I was selling cash covered puts that did expire Itm but i paper handed those. If i kept them in and just sat on the shares like I originally planned I would be up 10grand...."

# TA Notes: 

* Bulls broke the small 419.64 test that was listed in prior posts. Found support until SPY tested 20 SMMA . We got a nice green candle after close üëÄ.
* However, SPY still could not break 421.

# TA Notes:

Theta has caused a rinse and repeat of targets the last three days.

* if 420.73 breaks, look for bullish üéØ : 422.43 - 423.81 - 425.15
* If 417.25 breaks, look for bearish üéØ : 416 - 415 - 414.13 - 412.74 - 411.26 - 410
* Please not that if we push below 415 we could see downwards pressure to 405.
* **Best case for bulls is that we gap above 421 tomorrow.**
* **Best case for bears is we gap below to fill small gap @ 419 and test new resistance.**

Short-term Ascending Triangle Continuation Pattern?

* Uptrend continuation pattern
* Bullish bias
* Bullish üéØ : 423.81 - 425.15
* Need resistance to break and hit 423.81for pattern to hold true.
* Pattern is null if support breaks.

It was a lie, obviously, wonder who paid them to say that.

All this tells me is that short sellers are fucked.

If you're gonna buy anything, buy AMC. don't let them fool you with this same old trick. 

I find it hilarious how this is playing out exactly like the start of GME. The difference is that now we *know* that buying and holding works, it was experimental with GME."

2021-05-28 02:39:24,wallstreetbets,If you go to any grocery store you will see that new imitation meat products are coming out at a fast rate. I'm not even vegan and I buy Beyond meat burgers because I like them more than real burgers. I expect them to do very well and the market they are targeting is definitely growing. A lot of people are starting to see red meat as bad and plant based diets as the holy grail.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TLRY looks squeezy. Nice setup in an industry that's growing 30% YoY. TLRY has been cooling off since the January excitement. Good technical reversal spot. RSI is creeping up to squeezy levels. Their industry is projected to grow 30% every year for the next 10 years. So it's a good long term bet. It's also a good short term bet because it gets really nice big spikes. I'm in this position. Exits for me are laid out in the chart. Assuming I reach a TP I will exit part of the position and then when it cools off for another month or two I will enter again when the technical setup looks good. I plan on doing this a couple times a year for a few years if this pattern keeps up.

Good luck to all.

2021-05-28 10:27:44,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll be fine by this time next year
2021-05-28 15:13:24,wallstreetbets,Strongest - I‚Äôm holding so much as Cannabis is the next frontier.  It‚Äôs had its pops a few years ago and again in Feb.  $TLRY will ha e annualized revenues over $1B in 2022 with high growth multiples.  I believe their market cap will be in excess of $20B in 2022.   That translates to a 3X return for me.
2021-05-27 21:22:33,wallstreetbets,"I agree - I think the week cycle is gaining traction.  $TLRY is the leader in the sector and the upward trend will happen. $SNDL is barometric of the sector - and if that gets above $1, everything accelerated.  Long and strong!"
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Natural Gas Summer Blitz $CRK With a rare natural gas price uptrend beginning right before summer, Commstock Resources is well placed to make a big move higher.

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

[$CRK Poised to Regain It's Former Glory](https://preview.redd.it/dglghbon4q171.png?width=1625&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd79d88fb18d87001e268178c90e87239bd6b0c)

With NatGas prices charging higher we can expect to see a nice upswing in Commstock's beaten-down share price, as investors continue their rotation away from massively overvalued assets (TSLA, CryptCurrencies, etc) into deep value plays.

&#x200B;

[Natural Gas Exploding Higher Today](https://preview.redd.it/ps8mj4qc4q171.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3bde298236cb1108ea2d62891f6728be131c63)

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

I only hold 80 shares, currently in the Red, but plan on buying more. Small fish in a big pond. So do you're own DD, cause I'm retarded!

TLDR:

$CRK go \^ when it stonking hot outside.

Fair Value Price Target: $12+. Rocket boosters take it to the moon."
2021-05-27 20:42:09,wallstreetbets,I think natural gas will have a solid upward trend over the next 5 years but I would recommend TELL as the natural gas company to go with.

2021-05-27 20:50:14,wallstreetbets,"That looks pretty good too. 

Paying 4x the price for options tho, ATM. Looks like an option sellers market for now, until its IV settles down and its customer base reaches critical mass. 

Not a bad long term play at all. I'll be watching."

As the earnings announcement gets closer, the implied volatility (IV) should increase. Now Vega--the greek responsible for the jiggle factor--reflects the option price's sensitivity to the change in IV. Higher IV means higher options price.   


IV:

* Last Earnings Call (March 30, 2021): \~75%
* Currently (May 27, 2021): 58.2%
* Difference: 16.8%

  
Options Contracts:

   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.15
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0.061 \* 16.8) = $1.02
* 06/11 76C
   * Vega: 0.061
   * Current Price: $4.05
   * Expected price increase due to vega: (0061 \* 16.8) = $1.02

If he says more deals are coming in the next weeks I believe him.

I'm sitting here atop the world in my penthouse counting my stacks and plastered out of my goddamn mind. I intend on staying this way for the next 4 days.

Lesson to be learned here? Being drunk lets you act with zero filter and no fear of consequence. So just stay drunk and allow yourself to do what you were too afraid to do before.

Introspection is the enemy of happiness. So just don't."

2021-05-27 23:49:01,wallstreetbets,"Since we're talking about short interest again, here's a reminder:

If you have a margin account (you get instant settlement, instant deposits, you have to follow PDT rules), and not a cash account (trades must fully settle after several days), then your broker lends out your shares and collects the short interest premium on them.

You agreed to it when you signed up for a margin account. You have a certificate of ownership of the shares, but the shares are in their custody and contribute to their margin pool. Typically brokers let you short from the broker margin pool for free, but if none are available, they can source shares for the rate if you ask.

RH, TDA, Tasty and Webull works like this. Most others do too. If you're buying and holding shares, you aren't starving shorts. I guess you're driving the price up if you take an ask, but if your transaction is merely helping a bona fide hedger dynamically hedge an option, you aren't reducing the share supply."

2021-05-27 22:11:15,wallstreetbets,Every 3rd post on here is somebody pointing out a high SI on some random shit stock like it's a good thing. 99% of the time if a ticker has more than 15% SI I'm staying the hell away. That means someone is investing some serious cash in keeping that price down. Why would I want to go to war with somebody with the cash to push a price around? Plenty of other tickers out there.

2021-05-28 00:24:00,wallstreetbets,"**How much $25k invested in SPY in March 2020 is worth today?**

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **100.21** which gives us a total value of:

#$1,002,100

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

The recent move in **AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC**) has nothing to do with a short squeeze, Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  
  
What Happened: 680 million shares were traded Thursday, yet AMC Entertainment only has 450 million shares outstanding, Greenfield said.  
  
**""If hedge funds wanted to get out of their entire position, if they were short, they could do it within minutes,""** he said, adding that the AMC Entertainment price action does not point to big institutions or hedge funds being squeezed."

I said want me to get you another towel? And the last autistic moment was she climbed on top of me while watching one punch man, and I just looked at her and continued to watch one punch man. I did not hit. But slept in the same bed. I‚Äôm not joking about any of this either lol

No matter how much money they raise from investors, they lose money simply by operating.  I want to keep this simple...  It doesn't matter if they are open again.  Being open just costs them money and, as a business, all they do is destroy shareholder value.  They have a current ratio way on the wrong side of 1.  They have more debt than assets.  They lost $550 million in the 4 years prior to the pandemic.  They can only put cash on the balance sheet by borrowing it or selling stock.

This ain't GME.  There's no turnaround coming and management has no plan.  Aside from selling popcorn for $40 per bag."

It‚Äôs still cheap enough for the everyday man to buy, and enough people believe in the squeeze and are holding that the float keeps getting smaller and smaller.

What I‚Äôm saying is, buying the highest strike OTM calls at open today that expire at least two weeks out is not a totally retarded idea.  At least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm going to justify it to my wife when she asks where our kids‚Äô college fund went."

Quoted from Press Release, Opinions on this one Please!

Simply Wall St;

  
Thu, May 27, 2021, 5:03 AM  
There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So on that note, Seanergy Maritime Holdings (NASDAQ:SHIP) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital."

2021-05-28 03:45:44,wallstreetbets,Calls on stupidity
2021-05-28 03:47:14,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a cycle of raging boom then bust capitalism that is getting more frequent. In reality we never recovered from the 2008 bank crash in any meaningful form. This cycle allows the wealthy to get wealthier and so is perpetuated by them. We are sucker fish trying to attach ourselves to the whales as they feed.
2021-05-28 04:13:20,wallstreetbets,"So you lost a lot when it maxed out at 20 and now you're gonna fomo in at 27?

2021-05-28 05:31:42,wallstreetbets,Good we run them
2021-05-28 05:41:05,wallstreetbets,NOK will find it's way up either way.
2021-05-28 05:52:30,wallstreetbets,"If it‚Äôs done all at once yes 10,000,000 people have the power. It‚Äôs usually large institutions though. It‚Äôs fun thinking it‚Äôs us!"
2021-05-28 05:53:40,wallstreetbets,No it‚Äôs whales and we just tag along until it burns and hold the bags
2021-05-28 05:54:11,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs all just based on dollars and volume. If you have 1,000,000 apes investing $200 in an hour, it‚Äôs the same as 1 institutional investor investing $200,000,000 over the course of an hour. Institutional investors obviously have more power because of the amounts that they play with, but get enough apes reasonably hyped up and organised using wonderful platforms like Reddit and we can have a similar pull"
2021-05-28 05:52:16,wallstreetbets,No these movements were started by retail but just looking at the volume there is no way this is normal or retail

2021-05-27 20:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Paper hands are green hands on a momentum play like AMC. Sure, it might keep mooning, but when it inevitably comes down it's going to come down fast. Ride like lightning, crash like thunder. Good luck"

2021-05-27 23:14:43,wallstreetbets,I feel like tomorrow is going to be the epic rug pull of 2021 on meme stocks.  No way they are going to let all these options end up ITM.

2021-05-27 23:00:08,wallstreetbets,25x annual salary should put a lot into retirement. Or that should at least be enough to quit your shit job and find something else to do.

2021-05-27 22:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, exactly. No fucking way Redditors bought $350 million in AMC calls *at ask* over the last two days. A single person bought $2.4 million in GME FDs at ask this morning. No way anyone on Reddit is starting this."

2021-05-27 23:54:53,wallstreetbets,I don't like seeing parents getting roped into this. Remember seeing a dude back in January blow up his dads life savings on BB calls. Not cool.

2021-05-27 22:06:52,wallstreetbets,Only thing that sends market down is interest rates. Anything else no one could give a fuck about
2021-05-27 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,Inflation will work its way down once supply chains catch up and COGS go down. No more fuckin stimmies though. Agreed for sure on spending increase. Feels like we‚Äôre overheating right now

2021-05-27 20:31:10,wallstreetbets,If these Apes could read they would be very enlightened
2021-05-27 23:26:30,wallstreetbets,Imagine the people saying they are buying calls after a stock has ran that much. GME was a unicorn. Not every squeeze can produce the same results.
2021-05-27 23:26:36,wallstreetbets,Imagine NOT buying amc and watching it go up ANOTHER 40%
2021-05-28 01:47:33,wallstreetbets,29 and 19 barely even odd..

2021-05-28 06:12:14,wallstreetbets,"It closed at $0.33. 

Your theta was ~$0.22 to hold 17.5 hours over night. So if there is no underlying price change, your option would be worth $0.33-$0.22 = $0.11.

Your delta is $0.33, and your gamma is $0.23. 

 Your example calls for a $1.70 prince increase. This would be 1.7 units of delta, and .7 units of gamma.

So if it moves $1.70 to the upside, your call would increase in value by $0.33 (first delta) + $0.23 (second partial unit of delta) + $0.16 (gamma) - $0.22 (theta) = $0.50.

Headlines are so definitive that reddit is driving the price vs reacting and responding to the price movements. Of course everyone was talking about AMC today! It was up 50%

Would love to see some data supporting that price moves before reddit mentions. Or be proven wrong. Either way would be interesting."

2021-05-27 20:59:24,wallstreetbets,Just roll it to a further out date call at the same strike price. you may actually make money. After this is over just close the position with a higher buy call. once it drops 30 calls are going to be really fucking cheap.

Ag commodities had pulled back but are going up again.  Corn and Soybean cash bids and futures prices are up between 30 and 40 cents per contract today.  Higher prices translate to higher farm income and farmers are notorious for spending increased revenue on new/more expensive equipment.

Titan Machinery Inc (TITN) just blew away earnings and is up about 24% today.  As of posting this, up $6.14 to $31.70.  Titan is a large Case New Holland dealership and is indicative of CNHI sales and service/parts revenue.

2021-05-28 17:22:35,wallstreetbets,My sarcasm detector just blew up
2021-05-28 19:51:10,wallstreetbets,You pay the per share price x 100 and receive the shares. So in this case 1900 dollars for 100 shares at the 19 dollar strike price. Which is a big discount when the stock trades at 26 as of close Friday
2021-05-27 20:15:32,wallstreetbets,"It depends on your broker, I think"
2021-05-27 21:14:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think it's dependant. Even if it's a small commission on E-Trade my options are usually 50 cents to buy/sell and I figure at this point it's a win either way
2021-05-28 03:24:04,wallstreetbets,"honest, question cuz I'm new here. if It  does go to 100k and everyone goes to sell where is the money actually gonna come from? won't someone who tries to sell get screwed? I genuinely don't understand where the money would come from."
2021-05-27 23:54:00,wallstreetbets,"I was affirming that this isnt a short squeeze, so folks dont feel like bagholders.

2021-05-27 22:30:36,wallstreetbets,AMC is trash after it went up 70% in 3 days. Short it then you FUCK!

2021-05-28 11:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, when AMC has a market cap of more than double the US GDP. Reasonable."
2021-05-27 21:17:41,wallstreetbets,Umm...because it's already gone up like 100% just this week?
2021-05-28 07:29:37,wallstreetbets,"At that price, I think it would be all the shorters liquidated holdings. It would probably create a general market downturn from the sudden forced selling and piling of all capital into AMC."
2021-05-27 22:33:52,wallstreetbets,Is it possible for short interest to go up even if some company closed a fat stack of shorts?
2021-05-28 01:24:31,wallstreetbets,"You do know that they could have covered yesterday considering the volume right? They do not have to return the shares untill 2 days after buying them. Which means the SI% on ortex can be much lower in 2 days. 

They also might not have and this will be obvious on monday. But saying that they did not cover anything is misleading."
2021-05-28 07:36:20,wallstreetbets,Hubris!! Hubris has killed more men in history than anything else!!
2021-05-27 23:54:26,wallstreetbets,"But that doesn't make sense. If they are covering tomorrow why would they intentionally push the price up? The volume has been insane, they could've covered today at 25, why push to 50 to cover?"

I know that reading and comprehension is hard for apes but hear me out. The company itself is trash and I stand by that, but making money off of said trash is fine too. So you do you boo, don‚Äôt let my little comment trigger you.

Oh and remember, that 70% is not real unless you sell üòú"

2021-05-28 12:38:42,wallstreetbets,"You guys were right I ended up buying more myself, taking a profit, and then making a little something more on the way back down!"
2021-05-28 01:34:57,wallstreetbets,"You're right, some have covered, but according to shortvolumes.com 61% of the volume yesterday was short volume, and today it was 51%. The small covering that is being done doesn't compare to what needs to be done to close out a majority of short positions."
2021-05-28 00:50:47,wallstreetbets,"Because they're hoping that at $50 a ton of paper hands will start selling, driving the price down."
2021-05-28 00:53:39,wallstreetbets,">they could've covered today at 25

How?

They need *enough* people to sell.

Did you sell today?

I didn't.

Edit: They're **buying up to sell at 50 and cause a big dip and cause panic.

Edit2: They're not hoping for you to sell at 50, they're hoping you sell *after* they create a dip. The idea being to aim for pockets of stop losses and drive the price down with a waterfall and get out of their shorts with minimal loses and even increased profits."
2021-05-28 16:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Apparently many are selling. I‚Äôll jump in Monday morning with $18,000. Unless it drops through the floor, in which case I‚Äôll wait for an uptick."
2021-05-27 23:03:46,wallstreetbets,what do you use?
2021-05-28 14:40:41,wallstreetbets,That's what I did.  You can never go broke taking a profit!
2021-05-28 13:46:52,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, carry on."
2021-05-28 01:52:00,wallstreetbets,"51%? While there was almost 700M volume? So like 350M additional short positions? No way.

I mean why dont you use ortex data here as well? They reported almost no shares borrowed. 

You cant take the most biased info to support what you want to be true."
2021-05-28 06:45:10,wallstreetbets,Fidelity.
2021-05-28 02:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Dude I'm just saying what I'm reading, there isn't bias. I don't have a ortex subscription so I can't print screen any data from them besides what they post on twitter. If you think I'm wrong, check out

And email them. They report on every ticker, it's not random website geared to AMC retards."
2021-05-27 21:02:59,wallstreetbets,I am very pleased with the decision. I hope you guys 1000x from here
2021-05-28 02:17:34,wallstreetbets,"Defenitely not saying you are wrong, I just want to point out that it might be misleading.

I support the cause, 100 %"
2021-05-27 21:58:46,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm of the same opinion. I don‚Äôt understand why everyone thinks this is a hot take. This trash ass company is not a longterm hold if u bought in at >$6. It‚Äôs 10B in debt for crying out loud! 

I hope everyone makes money, but Jesus Christ amc done gave me heartburn holding at $13 since Jan lol"
2021-05-27 22:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Oh a sore bag holder that sold. You don‚Äôt lose shit till you sell, paperhanded bitch."

2021-05-27 22:39:57,wallstreetbets,"Actually I made 140% profit on my trade. Again, hope you guys 1000x from here."
2021-05-27 22:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh you mad, mad.

You also don‚Äôt make any money if you don‚Äôt sell. So you diamond hold for me until the next dip, and I‚Äôll come back again for more profits. Thank u for your service, you a real one üíØ"
2021-05-28 07:53:29,wallstreetbets,We should all be here to be making money.  That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm sayin.
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Had to jump on the gain train 
2021-05-28 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts about all the stories published on SHOP Stock recently Clearly, the company Shopify {SHOP} is in a market that is growing as it was showing before the beginning of the pandemic already -when the stock rose up to $500. I mean who doesn't believe in the internet here :-\]

During the pandemic, this SOFTWARE company helped a lot of smaller and midsize businesses as they were easily able to set up an e-commerce presence with Shopify's help. As a result, SHOP revenue increased a lot and the stock got propelled up to a crazy over 200 times forward earnings and a still to high current $$ 1240 price tag today. Yeah, that is my opinion only but Note: At the last press conference they said that operating cost will increase \[and by revenue increase will slow down\], THEY SAID IT - but nobody wants to hear it. 

You may wonder why to believe me if everybody can see that the stock price didn't fall back to a quite logic 60 times earnings \[like FANG Stocks for example\] ... meaning about 7-800 Dollars ...  

Well, SHOP was falling but then ...   
I can only assume that the three leaving executives teamed up with some other people who are interested in bumping the stock up again. Together they started an extensive press campaign, the one that we see even today: ""Shopify poised to go up"" I read today? Is it not that always when another one of these messages comes out A LOT OF stocks are suddenly traded? And that when the price goes up \[and even down\] it is often a very controlled 40bucks a day?    


IF you still want to read more, let's look up that complete marketing campaign to bring the SHOP stock up again:   
First Shopify was compared with Amazon itself - which is laughable. Even Karl Marx knew already that capitalism tends to create a monopoly. Shopify ... by helping all the little and medium companies with their software is the exact opposite of Amazon. Not to mention that the malls are full again ... meaning fewer people will buy online than during the pandemic. Which at least in the short and midterm will bring online revenues down a bit.

Then Google mentioned some Google button that makes it easier to find Shopify customers. Well yes but that doesn't help Shopify results at all. AND it makes clear that Shopify customers severely lack visibility compared with an omnipotent Amazon.   
   
Then the Shopify payment system was hyped. Buy now pay later? REALLY? The """"have's"""" have credit cards and pay with them as they even get perks/payback and points for it. So who uses the buy now pay later system? The ""DO NOT HAVE's with only a half-decent credit score of course.

Sorry but when I read about this I was only able to imagine the Shopify payment system as a """"buy now pay NEVER"""" system and I certainly had no idea how this helps the Shopify stock in the long run. Do the revenue numbers go up in the quarterly results? What about liabilities? 

Then SHOP was mentioned as the ""stock to have"" in 2021 ?? Not even worth a comment. 

For me, the only thing that is ""poised to happen"" is that the pockets of the three leaving former executives of Shopify are filled and that the buying retail investors are screwed over in about 2 months' time with a two-digit percentage loss. 

And I write all this while I actually like the Shopify story, as I like Tesla and so many things that are happening with all these wonderful tech companies ...  
But IMO the SHOP stock goes back to $800 exactly as Tesla went down from 900\[intraday\] to now 600...

Well, Good luck, give me your thoughts and I hope the bots even allow a huge and way too long posting like this."
2021-05-27 23:20:03,wallstreetbets,Sell it now....buy it again if it breaks above the FEB highs and short it below the double bottom around a 1000. It is dead money for a long time to come
2021-05-28 13:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Yes I know, too much, not for everyone. But just buy SHOP it's gonna be great"

2021-05-28 05:59:09,wallstreetbets,"It never was a meme, investing in GME/AMC (not that they are both the same, mind you) is hyperrational. I don't know if you trust strangers on the internet, but if you invest a few hours to read up on everything you can, check for yourself and do your own research you will know where to invest. I'm personally up 150% on my entire portfolio since last year.

2021-05-28 14:02:10,wallstreetbets,Could have fooled us by WSB deleting GME posts
2021-05-28 17:05:21,wallstreetbets,"Ain‚Äôt that the truth. I held. I watched WSB jump around, which was the original intention of the group. A place to make money. I was all in though and some of WSB acted like anyone holding AMC or GME were morons. I have always been a vocal person, but I listen to both sides of the story and I try not to be disrespectful.

We will never always agree, but we can be respectful. Apes shouldn‚Äôt shit on apes. We are one in the same. 

Let‚Äôs do the damned thing. 

Got a question though. What if stocks don‚Äôt squeeze in unison. I a not a smart ape. Let‚Äôs see some DD for post squeeze, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th squeeze plays."

There were a lot of people holding from 1st squeeze, I‚Äôd say they paper handed hard when we got back up to them. 53 million float, 20% shorted... I keep reminding myself of these numbers. The price has increased dramatically the last week with relatively low trade numbers. and at this price I‚Äôm sure hedge funds are borrowing every share they could find to keep shorting.."

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


Already powering many of the telematics of current cars, BB is poised to benefit from their established relationships with big automakers. Getting certified with an automaker is not easy, so it is a barrier to entry for other companies wanting in on the action. Security and reliability are top of mind for these companies. You don‚Äôt want your car to get hacked easily, so what better than a cybersecurity company that happens to also do EV software, and already has experience with ICE cars. I did a long DD here 4 months ago and still stand by it: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxknrl/bb_dd_9_reasons_why_bb_is_from_former_bb_employee/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf


SONY:
100 shares at $101
üöÄüöÄüöÄ


I wouldn‚Äôt call this the Japanese equivalent for BB, as they aren‚Äôt a cybersecurity company. But Sony has a thriving consumer and B2B business that benefits greatly from consumer demand: the fact that they are literally selling every single PS5 they make is amazing and image sensors going out on many cell phones, including Apple using both image and lidar sensors from Sony. Great solid volume of sales to stabilize the company after some stagnant years.

On PS5, it‚Äôs actually a good thing that there‚Äôs a chip shortage. As Sony loses money on the hardware (and earn on game royalties and licenses), they are buying time to refine their manufacturing to lower costs, and lose less money on hardware sales. And because demand is so hot for the PS5, they are on track to build a bigger platform than even PS4 to charge 20-30% on every game they sell. That‚Äôs some fat margin.

Now, you‚Äôre probably wondering‚Ä¶wtf, I‚Äôm here to read about EVs, why you telling me about PS5s? Yeah, you‚Äôre right but a conglomerate like Sony is multifaceted. While they build up their EV software platform, they have cash cows in imagery and video games. And if Apple is really building an EV, I would bet (am literally betting) that they would rely on currently trusted partners like Sony for their imaging needs. You sit inside an Apple car and camera recognizes who you are and where you‚Äôre sitting? Well that‚Äôs probably a Sony camera‚Ä¶or 20 of them. There will be so many cameras inside and outside of any Apple car. I mean‚Ä¶my iPhone 12 has 4 cameras, and it‚Äôs a tiny slab of glass and my family can‚Äôt sit inside and drive down the road with others in the environment.

And when Japanese automakers get into EVs, they‚Äôll look into a Japanese partnership. Guess who‚Äôs probably in pole position?

Full disclosure, I also have 150 AAPL.



VW:
200 shares @ $33.32
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

You are all excited about Ford. I am too but I‚Äôm not buying into them because I think they are overhyped. But what‚Äôs interesting about Ford‚Äôs EV play is that they are partnering with VW to do so. That means‚Ä¶even if Ford can‚Äôt sell that many cars, VW will probably still benefit from joint research development and cost sharing. We also know how much more climate change is viewed as reality in Europe, and that‚Äôs VW‚Äôs home territory. VW already launching EVs under Audi, Porsche in the premium sector, VW, Skoda and Seat in the value sector, and Bentley and Lamborghini will likely have their ultra premium EVs soon.

But you might wonder‚Ä¶what about Tesla? They are so great! Well yeah they aren‚Äôt that bad. But VW is a goddamn monster. It‚Äôs kind of cute when Tesla announces a new plant, oh this is my 4th plant! We now have Shanghai and Fremont and building out Berlin and Austin. That‚Äôs cute. VW has 136 plants around the world. The economies of scale is insane and will be able to source materials for incredibly better deals. Oh and there‚Äôs that other partner called Ford who builds millions of cars a year also jumping into to beat on suppliers to give them both better pricing. Welcome to the big leagues, EVs.

VW is likely to launching 5-10 EVs per year, the equivalent the full Tesla line up every year. And they have Electricfy America network (and Canada) and similar in Europe.

And one more thing: VW also does trucks. Like 18 wheeler trucks. They are one of the biggest manufacturers, behind brands such as Man, Scania, and Navistar. And trucks have even more of a compelling business case for EVs‚Ä¶Will merge this part with Volvo.


Volvo:
800 shares @ $26
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ


Going to keep this briefer because this is already a novel. Now, when I say Volvo, I don‚Äôt mean Volvo Cars. That‚Äôs bought by Geely and yes they are making EVs under Volvo and Polestar brands. But I‚Äôm taking about AB Volvo, still out of Sweden, building trucks, mining equipment, backhoes, haul trucks and cranes.

EVs are so more more compelling because of the use and mileage they get. It‚Äôs not uncommon for a one year old truck to have a million miles. And as cities around the world clamp down on urban center access (congestion or polluter fees common in Europe, and allow EVs in for discount or free), EVs increasingly make more sense. You save so much on lower op/maintenance costs, avoiding tolls and tax credits. Oil prices will be going back up so saving on fuel costs is the smart thing to do.

Another thing is, governments around the world are spending trillions on infrastructure stimulus. What do these trillions buy? Concrete, steel, Volvo construction equipment, labor. Where does the concrete, steel and other commodities (like rising gold and silver prices) come from? They get mined out of the ground with big Caterpillar, Liebherr and Volvo equipment. Yep, there‚Äôs Volvo again!

So if you believe stimulus is happening, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe inflation is real, Volvo is a good choice. If you believe EV is the future for hauling shorter distances and/or heavy loads, Volvo is a good choice.

2021-05-28 02:34:03,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not bullish on Daimler because they seem stuck in the past. I‚Äôve owned 3 Smart Fortwo in the past, 2 of them EVs so I‚Äôm an early adopter to EVs. Daimler was well ahead of the game, and in fact used Tesla batteries in the smart ELectric Drive and B class ED (and they even owned a bit of Tesla hence Tesla Model S switchgear and buttons come straight out of a Merc B class too). 

But for the past 5 years, they are stuck at that stage and haven‚Äôt moved much after cutting ties with Tesla. They even managed to botch the EQC launch, and eventually cancelling for US. Their brand is aging quickly too.

I don‚Äôt think Daimler will die‚Ä¶brand is too valuable so somebody will scoop them up. But I think they are fit for a dip and need a merger to survive at some point in the next 5-10 years, unless they course correct quickly."

On a related note, a lot of people think Tesla is done it‚Äôs bull run, but if you have a long term horizon (5 years or so) you can‚Äôt go wrong owning it. I see it as buying Amazon when it was close to 1,000PE.  Tesla is 5-10 years ahead of the competition and companies like Ford trying to compete with it reminds me of IBM trying to compete with AAPL.

576@24.02

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment¬†& network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

* Market Cap: \~$7bn

üì∑

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share.¬†People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in eco friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

2021-05-27 22:20:11,wallstreetbets,I heard on CBNC today that 40% of all AMC contracts were put options out of 3.3Mil+ contracts traded today. You just so happen to be ballsy enough to show your loss.
2021-05-28 08:27:06,wallstreetbets,Never understood why people choose to make money Betting on something to fail. To me that's just bad karma waiting to happen. You can easily make money betting On companies to succeed  instead of hoping they tank. Good luck.

2021-05-28 07:42:19,wallstreetbets,WOOF - Petco is severely undervalued at $23.00 with super earnings. Big short position makes this a short squeeze candidate. Even more so than AMC or GME
2021-05-28 08:43:02,wallstreetbets,Lol you‚Äôre one of those apes. I‚Äôm happy you loss money. Any amc doubters should kick rocks.

Fuck that noise, everybody and their brother was foaming at the mouth to buy them - Delta was near 1 and gamma near zero all the way out to $10-12 out of the money. My limit order was based on yesterday's Delta/Gamma and was so far off my broker was passing it around to everyone in the office so they could get a good laugh."
2021-05-28 11:31:49,wallstreetbets,It's harder to understand why someone would bet against this ticker specifically knowing the backstory and potential for loss by doing so.

2021-05-28 18:22:37,wallstreetbets,He bet against it lol. He must have not been using his brain
2021-05-27 20:26:46,wallstreetbets,Poor people have poor ways bro.  Just tell your kids about him so they don't turn out the same.

2021-05-28 10:20:29,wallstreetbets,"Because he bought put options, meaning he shorted the stock, meaning he‚Äôs not a true ape."
2021-05-28 10:19:36,wallstreetbets,Yea a put option means an investor thinks a stock will tank and it also shorts the stock.
2021-05-28 11:23:34,wallstreetbets,You will be rich don‚Äôt worry
2021-05-28 19:44:03,wallstreetbets,Yes following for a while. Its a trainwreck. Imagine the value that fallen to 1 nok last year. Basicly they need to raise capital but cant sell in that price so lets ¬´adjust¬ª the price to 60 nok buy reducing the amount of shares. Its still worthless but who cares. Now you get to buy millions of new worthless shares on discount while they bag your real money. Boom norwegian is OTC penny stock now. You got played by the big boys. For the love of god stay away from it.

2021-05-27 22:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Lol, sure, if you've been living under a rock for the last six months. There has been DD explaining that these kinds of run-ups and evens MSM is onto the volatility."

2021-05-27 21:32:10,wallstreetbets,I really didn‚Äôt see amc passing $15 and hitting $30 without resistance coming. Lol.
2021-05-28 00:44:57,wallstreetbets,Same thing here. At one point I was up 20% and like a dumbass I held.
2021-05-28 03:06:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah I managed to make money off of my 15$ puts yesterday because the volatility was so insane at some points.
2021-05-28 08:54:48,wallstreetbets,Kramer‚Äôs on talking about it now
2021-05-27 21:44:50,wallstreetbets,"Watch InTheMoney on Yt he breaks it down pretty well. 

But the basics are buying calls means you think the stock will go up and buying puts means you think the stock will go down. That‚Äôs the gist but there‚Äôs also stuff with greeks and Implied Volatility is also pretty important"
2021-05-27 20:36:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm still hella learning (and lost about $300 last week) as I just started some options, but I'm getting the hang of it.  Can understand a bit better when looking at the options chain, and I used this https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp and kind of just trying it out to at least get a better understanding of how calls work.  Haven't tried puts yet, but similar.  Unless stock goes to 0, you can only lose so much money which is nice."
2021-05-27 22:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you learn by losing it all and then some! After you lose it all, it helps getting that retard badge cause you know your one step closer to losing it all over again and then, only then you might see some gainz."
2021-05-27 23:43:13,wallstreetbets,Might as well increase the risk. See how much you can really loose

Poorly executed joke set up to get flamed."
2021-05-28 03:18:31,wallstreetbets,Maybe because of his title?
2021-05-28 08:56:41,wallstreetbets,"The title is supposed to be a joke. People often say things like ‚Äújust bought SPY calls you‚Äôre welcome bears it‚Äôs definitely going to tank now,‚Äù making fun of their complete inability to predict the price."

2021-05-28 14:05:57,wallstreetbets,"The closer the expiry and the more OTM (out of the money) the strike price, the less chance the option has of being worth anything, and the lower option will trade for. 30 by 6/8 feels very risky to me, especially after the meteoric rise earlier this week.

Your trading app should show you cost basis (the amount you bought the option(s) for) and the current price of the options. If the option is in the green, you may want to sell for a profit unless you're very confident that the stock will be above $30 + the amount you paid for the option if you bought it OTM (since the extrinsic value of an option drains away as it reaches the expiration date).

Congrats on just risking $20 for your first option instead of risking a huge amount. It might even be worth watching the option's value for the next couple weeks to see what happens when the price goes up/down, and how time value decay reduces the option's value as it gets closer to expiry.

With options, remember you're trading on the likelihood of the contract expiring in the money (and then the profits on the contract once it's ITM). Sometimes a bonkers options contract that realistically won't ever be ITM will go up in price because the likelihood of ITM at expiry has increased from 0.001% to 0.01%. That's why you may see far OTM options gain value for a short time if a stock rockets up."
2021-05-27 20:37:26,wallstreetbets,I only purchased one contract at $20 just to learn and gain experience. Could I sell my current call right now and still make money?

Pfizer recently did a $4.2 Billion partnership deal with MYOV for essentially 50% of their drug for which they now have an additional approval for women's fibroid.  This is a very undervalued stock and will be a very nice long term bet IMHO.  Do your own due diligence.  They have lots of cash and will likely add another $250 million by end of this year from milestone payments.  Both MYOV and Pfizer will be selling their drugs.

2021-05-27 23:56:58,wallstreetbets,I sold my Blackberry like a week and a half ago and bought AMC. Was a great choice

Out of all these stocks, BB is the only one with legit, material growth potential due to it's business model anyways"

2021-05-28 10:53:59,wallstreetbets,I agree. They are headquartered in waterloo surrounded by tech industry like google and university funded accelerator centers. If this stock shoots up they have more than ample opportunity to find new ideas and tech to pivot about.

2021-05-27 22:39:47,wallstreetbets,Temporary technical malfunction trading some stocks. Any green should be normalized within a few days. Just be sure if you see results like these to not withdraw anything and keep investing as WSB directs to reverse course.

I escaped with $800 or sometimes it was pretty sad‚Ä¶I did learn not to let dating affect life choices/events though finally. Costly but worth it in my opinion."

2021-05-27 21:03:23,wallstreetbets,Thats fucking dope dude. I'm still kinda struggling to wrap my head around options to invest. Any suggestions for videos or courses?

2021-05-28 00:54:53,wallstreetbets,I really gotta find out how calls work....
2021-05-28 01:01:07,wallstreetbets,Turn into a milli or no balls

2021-05-27 22:09:51,wallstreetbets,How do you do the stop loss when you do an option call
2021-05-27 21:32:52,wallstreetbets,AMC changed people's lives up until the insane hyperinflation we're about to experience negates all of these gains and everyone becomes a poverty stricken millionaire.
2021-05-27 22:14:56,wallstreetbets,I did $10 call last month 50 contracts for 8500 bucks LOL if I did it longer than a stupid week and I put it out for a month and a half how much would that have turned into do you have any idea I ended up losing half my money and got out
2021-05-27 20:21:10,wallstreetbets,The 39s  went from .04 to $2 then just under $1 today.
2021-05-27 20:02:46,wallstreetbets,I think it's even more nuts your medical school loans cost that much then me winning that.
2021-05-27 21:26:46,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-05-27 21:13:50,wallstreetbets,"It ended up being 500,000 with the last 200 shares I was lucky enough to get the top. I'm okay with it though you never can get the bottom and hit the top perfectly."

2021-05-27 21:05:28,wallstreetbets,Sounds right if I understand you correctly

2021-05-27 21:41:04,wallstreetbets,Feels like home
2021-05-27 21:40:38,wallstreetbets,Just have to look at my history I did it last 3 weeks.
2021-05-27 21:53:21,wallstreetbets,I'm just a guy who likes movies
2021-05-27 21:52:54,wallstreetbets,"I played weekly's last 3 weeks. Went up 100K profit two weeks ago, down 90k last week, up 500k to this week and closed out. All AMC and I posted them on here if you look at my history"

2021-05-27 22:44:37,wallstreetbets,I bought calls saying the price was going to go up $2.80 in 3 days. Then I sold those after a couple hours when the price went up to 15 and bought $18 calls. Basically betting more money that the price was going to go up another $2.50 in 3 days. Luckily for me it went up 10 more dollars
2021-05-27 22:49:05,wallstreetbets,Na. Post pandemic me is more like the world of Warcraft guy from South Park drinking a mountain dew.
2021-05-27 22:51:18,wallstreetbets,Really I feel like covered calls is harder to understand than buying calls.. when you buy calls you don't need to collateral like when you sell them.. so if you buy $100 of calls that's the most you can lose.. you can win Infinity amount theoretically. The high risk reward.
2021-05-27 22:55:36,wallstreetbets,If shorts cover your golden... Even if it doesn't squeeze tomorrow hopefully Tuesday will open strong with good box office numbers from the memorial Day weekend.
2021-05-27 23:10:15,wallstreetbets,Sold when AMC hit 29.50
2021-05-27 23:08:08,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Maybe AMC will be up tomorrow
2021-05-27 23:15:42,wallstreetbets,Yes because I couldn't fit all on a screenshot. What you see on the bottom is the cashing/closing  of the first two plays. So between those two plays I bought it for 10K cashed out 19 those two combined.. I then rolled the 19k into the 15.50s.. then from there I rolled 38k into 460 k profit.

In hindsight I would have had the stop loss on 5 of them it would have sold the 5 and kept 5 that went on to 30 this AM I would have made 58.5K.  just look at a 15 dollar call for today they are 11.70 √ó 5 = 58.5k but It sold because it dipped passed my stop loss so I is what it is.  sometimes you sell it goes up.  sometimes you hold it goes down.

I think its more of a gamble to buy calls though whereas selling covered calls does require me to own 100 shares its kind of hard to lose money with it. I think its also harder to predict if buying a call will make me money.

Im down to learn though I think I just need to go through each thing one at a time."

2021-05-28 07:58:43,wallstreetbets,Alright so if I did a 10 call at 1.74 for 50 contract for $8500 AND did it for 6 weeks(I did it one 4/27 and yesterday 5/27 it went to 29. If I sold those 50 contracts at 25 yesterday do you have any idea how much I possible could have made on that option call? Holding my breathe
2021-05-28 08:03:35,wallstreetbets,"Just commented and asked question in response to your help but did not put in reply. Can you look below your comment? I bought 50 contracts for $8500 on 4/27. It was expiring 4 days later. I messed up and if I did for 6 weeks. It was a 10 call plus 1.74 so break even was 11.70.  The stock was I think about 12. I it went do to like 10 something and I sold and lost half. If I did for extended time would my money have come back yesterday when it went up and if I sold at 25, any idea how much that option call would have turned into that I purchased 50 contracts at that time for 7500 bucks. Holding breath. Also how do u figure that number out? What are you multiplying?"

2021-05-27 23:09:26,wallstreetbets,It is a gamble to buy calls. High risk reward but 90% of calls and worthless. Got lucky. Selling calls you can have a 90% success rate if they're farther enough out of the money
2021-05-27 23:11:41,wallstreetbets,The run-up is just people fomo buying. They're still over 100 million shares short and they need to buy it back still... So if retail can keep the pressure up it's costing hedge funds hundreds of millions of dollars a day.. if they break or get margin called it could definitely go to 50 or $100. They're able to hold it off expected to stay in the twenties and slowly lose excitement and go back down to the teens
2021-05-28 11:13:24,wallstreetbets,"Where did I say it was going to 50? I mean I think it can if shorts start covering. I don't know 100% if and when that will be though. I did buy $8,000 worth of $31 calls expiring today though."

2021-05-28 14:10:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you won't make the same gains, you'll probably make more. You have a slim chance of succeeding with FDs, and an even smaller chance of making a lot of money. 

Statistically you're going to lose money with FDs, someone else has to take on the risk of assignment to give you those calls. Why would they risk losing a lot of money unless the chance of that was very small?"
2021-05-28 14:10:35,wallstreetbets,I view it as a form of teaching
2021-05-28 15:01:00,wallstreetbets,"You generally don't want to exercise, especially far from expiration. Part of an option contracts value is based on how much time it has left until expiration and the current Implied Volatility (IV) of the contract. These 2 things are known as extrinsic value, and are completely lost when the contract is exercised. As you get closer to expiration time value decays more and more until it hits zero at expiry. Basically you very rarely want to exercise contracts, especially ones far out in expiration. 

Some of this time value (often called Theta) goes away faster and faster each day closer to expiration, and really speeds up the last 30-45 days before expiration. This is called theta decay and it's a reason you often do not want to hold your calls until expiration unless you're very confident it'll go up even more.

So I'd generally recommend selling at least 30-45 days before expiration, and preferably when your contracts Implied Volatility (IV) is high. IV estimates how much the underlying stock will move in the future. If it's really low then not much move is expected and it's less likely your contracts will get ITM. If it's very high then it's expecting the possibility of very large moves in the underlying, which would make the contract more likely to get ITM. 

Now of course a super important metric in rather you should sell or not is the stock price. AMC is very weird because it's unpredictable. It might spike even higher tomorrow and you could make way more, or maybe it'll drop back towards where it's been, which would crush the IV and lower the value a lot. In my opinion i would sell considering you're up like 500% which is insane gains honestly. But I'm better at learning theoretical stuff than i am at actually trading, and with how wild AMC is, it's very hard to judge. I just think greed is very hard to get passed, and when you see huge gains your brain likes it and wants more. Basically you have to decide if the risk of keeping it is worth potentially losing all of these gains.

Another thing you could do is sell one of the contracts which should recoup the amount of money you paid for both contracts, so even if the other call becomes completely worthless you already covered your entry fee and hopefully made a little profit as well. 

Last thing, you can roll your calls. If you think they might be worth even more but you want more time value you can sell your calls and in the same trade buy 2 new calls further out in expiration. This works best when IV is high, because the further out in time the lower IV goes, so you'll sell your contract with a high IV and buy back a new one with lower (but still high) IV. For example, right now you could sell the Sept 17th 15c for 15.45 and then buy the Dec 17th 15c for 15.88, so you get 3 more months and more time value for 42 dollars. 

What I would do is at least sell one to recoup what you paid, and then do whatever u want with your ""free"" contract."
2021-05-27 20:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks for the tip. I'm still young and my serious long term investments are in a separate account. The $500 I started with was ""hey I heard about this options thing, let's give it a try."" Made $3k on my second trade buying Tesla calls last February and I've been addicted ever since. 

Though after my second day trade ban and not being able to trade for 90 I realized just how much the addiction was screwing with my mental health. So I decided to stop buying calls and start trading deep ITM credit spreads as that seemed less risky but then Amazon and Apple had a few bad weeks and I was down thousands."

Now, if you want to expand that knowledge and learn more go on youtube and just watch some videos on options or Google it if you prefer reading.

Once you get this you can watch so many videos about different options strategies like covered calls, spreads, cash secured puts, etc. 

 Best thing in my opinion to follow this up is to sign up for TDAmeritrade and download Think or Swim (TOS).

Like I want to learn, I really do, just to throw in 100 bucks whenever I can and casino this bitch but I ""kind of"" understand some terms but then when I try to apply it I don't see how to properly read an option or whatever.

Lets take his screenshot, one of the transaction says:

Buy to Open 692 contracts AMC May 28 2021  18 W calls @ $0.55 and a limit with the same amount after the @.

Im guessing THAT means something but just cant see it :c

cause if 692 contracts means how many stocks he bought, that means 692 x the stock amount, right?

so that doesnt add up in the slightest


edit:

So on further investigation, those 692 contracts were actually ""5 dollar calls"" basically saying he ""bet"" the stock was going to go up 5 dollars. And since the stock did, his actual amount of stock got like multiplied? how do you know how much it will multiply?

Sorry I suck at learning if im unable to bounce questions back and forth even if I sound dumb"
2021-05-27 22:12:51,wallstreetbets,"I mean so much depends on how much a stock is likely to move, the timeframe and your goals. It is really hard to just have one criteria. 

OP had a huge, consistent gain over a short period of time. If he'd bought the first option weeks ago those barely OTM would have expired worthless and been expensive. If it stayed flat you'd just watch your initial investment fade. 

So if you had say, projections of what the stock would do, you could plan it out, but nobody does exactly. This worked out extremely well but we're seeing the best stories and outcomes here (and the worst). Biggest thing is have a plan and figure out if you want small guarantees or if you really see something and think it'll happen within X."

The reason the options were as low as 0.55 when he bought, no sane person would INVEST in the **bet the price would go up** to $18 *in hours*. This autist, however.

Friday May 28 if AMC wasn't over 18 (or 18+0.55) his $38,000 buy would crater to $0.00 come Saturday."

2021-05-27 21:29:51,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. So, the amount you would pay isn‚Äôt the 15*100shares, it‚Äôs actually a premium that you would pay per 1 share (I can see rereading my original explanation that it could be misleading)

But we can run with the AMC example: AMC is at 26.51 at the writing of the comment, and a call option expiring June 4th @ 15$ is currently sitting at 12.05 per 1 share, BUT typically options are sold together for 100 shares, so buying 1 option contract would cost 1205 (12.05*100). Now your break even point would be sitting at 27.05 (15 strike price+12.05 premium)... the moment you‚Äôre above 27.06 you are making a profit. But you‚Äôre right in partially where you could exercise at 27.06 and make profit ((27.06-27.05)*100) to arrive at whatever your profit would be.

I‚Äôm using arbitrary numbers so also a rule of calls (which makes them particularly attractive to some) because your profit is virtually unlimited because the price of a stock could be infinite (theoretically).

I hope that makes more sense! Feel free to PM me if you need anymore explanation; sometimes there could be an ELI5 for finance but def do your own research because the stock market is inherently risky and options have a significantly higher level of risk! Be safe and do the DD!"
2021-05-27 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhhhh now I get it! I thought it was like a $0.35 charge per stock which made it look really a ttractive, but it‚Äôs a high stock premium. That‚Äôs why the numbers didn‚Äôt add up, it‚Äôs expensive lmao.

So let‚Äôs say I made the call for 15 and the stock lowered to 9, a call is the right to buy it so the only thing I‚Äôd be losing is the money for the call right? I‚Äôd be down maybe 500$ as opposed to 600$ 

Yikes that does sound kinda risky now that I typed that"

2021-05-27 22:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that was bad explanation on my end! Sorry for any confusion. 

And you‚Äôre correct in your thinking, it provides the OPTION vs an OBLIGATION... so, you can exercise the option at any time, but you‚Äôre not required to. If the call with a strike is at 15, but the stock drops to 9... you would be considered ‚Äòout of the money‚Äô meaning you wouldn‚Äôt be making any money by exercising and your max loss would be the (premium of the contract*# of contracts), and wouldn‚Äôt make sense to exercise using a call to buy a share @ 15 when you could buy it for 9 without the option! 

Options are a great way to make a lot of money... but also a great way to lose a lot of menu. I‚Äôm not a financial advisor but most will tell you that you want to ‚Äòplay‚Äô/invest money you‚Äôd be okay with losing because nothing is guaranteed (even when the market is pretty hot/has been hot)"

2021-05-27 20:29:33,wallstreetbets,"hold till $500k

Let me explain how insane that is.

AMC has a market cap of almost $12billion dollars

With 450 million shares 

12 billion market cap divided by 450 million shares gets you your share price of $26


You need an extra $11,000,000,000 (billion) dollars invested to reach a price of $51 

You need  $225,000,000,000,000 (trillion) to reach a price of $500k per share.


The largest stock by market cap is Apple $2.09 trillion"
2021-05-28 08:17:16,wallstreetbets,I'm not seeing 500k?
2021-05-27 20:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Screw college, they can work at AMC HQ you can get them a job there you own thenplace."
2021-05-28 02:12:43,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt do it. Among many things my wife‚Äôs dad stole her college fund. Let‚Äôs just say they don‚Äôt talk. At all. I‚Äôve met him once in the 12 years we‚Äôve been together.
2021-05-27 23:14:17,wallstreetbets,This is the way

Putting all your savings into a stock can get rough when it starts going down. But this is part of the plan the game is set in motion we wait and we hold and buy. Because this is the ape market. Diamond hands!
2021-05-27 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,Bought 27 shares when it went up to like 17$ dollars.. I‚Äôm glad I took my advice and bought high and sold low. I‚Äôm doing it again

2021-05-28 07:44:45,wallstreetbets,WOOF - Petco is severely undervalued at $23.00 with super earnings. Big short position makes this a short squeeze candidate. Even more so than AMC or GME

Felt crappy when it tanked, but feels great now

He's told me if it 2x es and starts going sideways to dump one and get his initial investment out, but if it shows steady growth not to sell until 5x  

He's probably more likely to end up in profit than me who'll probably never even sell due to fomo lol"

2021-05-27 21:06:03,wallstreetbets,700k shares is not long. Thats a laughable position that will get eaten up in 5 mins with AMC's type of volume from someone like Citadel.

2021-05-28 08:54:25,wallstreetbets,Their beta approach Fidelity is looking pretty nice now as well. Much cleaner than it used to be only a few months ago. It‚Äôs nice that they even have a big button so users can submit suggestions for what they want to see with the app.

And now people wanna yolo when it's spiking again when a better time would've been before the current spike. 

My only regret is not buying more when it dipped to 9."
2021-05-28 10:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Pretty amazing run AMC is having, but it doesn't change the fact in the last 3 months it was half the price and OP could have doubled his position. Either way, I'm glad he didn't get burned, I'm surprised that comment got so many up votes"
2021-05-27 21:19:51,wallstreetbets,That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not fundamentally overvalued at the current price.

2021-05-28 00:12:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah I started trading with a few hundred bucks just to practice and not get burned and this is an early lesson. I finally made back what I lost but I would‚Äôve doubled my money if I had just let it be lol

It was suppose to be completed yesterday but RH told fidelity that I had transactions pending on my debit card (which is complete bs I haven‚Äôt used that debit card in over a month) so it was going to delay the transfer till next week Wednesday but woke up this morning to the transfer being completed. 

I think they were trying to buy my shares at a cheaper price before transferring my account but realized this baby isn‚Äôt going down anytime soon so they aborted mission and just transferred my account while it was still at $17."

2021-05-27 22:31:27,wallstreetbets,"Wow. This really happened years ago. If you ever seen that little sticker on a push mower. Keep your hands and feet from under the mower. This bonehead, tried picking it up and cut his hedges with it, but he didn‚Äôt have a snazzy pole like this. Well it cut off his hand, or something like that. He sued the maker of the mowers and in the end. He won and got paid. And All the lawnmower makers added that little sticker. 

So if this guy cuts his hand or foot off, he‚Äôs shit out of luck. ü§£ü§£ü§£"

To be honest I have no idea about the bars.  But my general thoughts looking at it now are that tensile force isn‚Äôt going to be the same on the entire bar so we‚Äôd have to get into how strong it is in that particular scenario.

2021-05-28 08:53:21,wallstreetbets,Hope so! I think we'll see big movement today. We need the bulls to paint the tape so that everyone FOMO's in next week!
2021-05-28 19:10:17,wallstreetbets,Well we got movement today but it crashed back to earth before getting to the moon! I hope it retries like a SpaceX flight that was delayed then finally was cleared for take off!  I'm hold 3000 at over 22 so I'm hoping it can test the mid 20's to 30 in the next 2-3 quarters

2021-05-28 17:10:20,wallstreetbets,You make it look too easy. Enjoy the weekend
2021-05-27 20:19:15,wallstreetbets,How do you push out the expiration?
2021-05-27 22:29:09,wallstreetbets,"It's not being caused by shorts covering. It's primarily the result of T35 FTDs on Monday, followed by T21 FTDs on Tuesday. There's also gamma ramping, and then you can sprinkle some fomo at this point too."
2021-05-27 20:22:25,wallstreetbets,Buy to close and sell to open.
2021-05-27 20:03:20,wallstreetbets,"What if it goes nuclear then settles at $1,200 range, post squeeze, based on the e-commerce model?

How would your bet play out then?

That‚Äôs how i see this playing out."
2021-05-27 23:30:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes those FTD's are causing forced buying but this amount of price movement I don't think is just them.  It is much more a huge influx of new buyers.  On the days GME surges there are too many trades for it to just be FTD's, IMO.  I'm curious what the new data will show but it has been trending down over time.

In any case GME just has to not be above $300 for an entire month for my bet to pay off.  As I said, longs can make money and so can I at the same time in theory."
2021-05-27 20:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Si is self-reported, though.

I wonder, does the fine for misrepresenting the SI cost more or less than being squeezed out of >100% SI?

Isn‚Äôt it obvious that these firms would rather pay the fine than expose their shorts?

That said, I think you‚Äôre play has legs. Godspeed."
2021-05-27 20:21:59,wallstreetbets,I lose 50k.
2021-05-27 21:54:03,wallstreetbets,"Worth adding though, IMO that is basically impossible in a one month span from B&M retailer to ecommerce giant."
2021-05-28 07:59:39,wallstreetbets,"It's a bold move, but you're right about longs making money and the potential for you to as well. At some point the bear spread is going to work. 

Of course if you'd bought shares with that 50k you'd already be up about $9k or so. Your max profit with your spread is $7600 and potential loss of $50k. Good luck."
2021-05-27 20:25:20,wallstreetbets,"I think even if it were quite large it might even help my bet.  Instead of a slow squeeze, after the recall it will be very high briefly, then crash like Jan or the VW squeeze.

There is room for a long and short play here IMO."
2021-05-28 00:14:40,wallstreetbets,"I agree with your view. The point of playing this way is to let most of the diamond hand retards let them expire past temporary peaks. 

I get risk mitigation but this is Wall Street bets not Wall Street income gains."
2021-05-28 08:01:02,wallstreetbets,Fair. You seem to have calculated this move as best you could. I hope it prints for you.
2021-05-28 08:25:02,wallstreetbets,"This is true.  But the problem with the long situation, at least for me, is that it's very hard for me to gauge when it peaks.  It could keep going, it may not, how to set an exit price for something when fundamental valuation is irrelevant?  So while it's true that in hindsight I would have made money I had no idea how high it could go and I have to accept that with my style I'm going to miss a lot of things like dog coin, BC, etc.

I feel like longer the time horizon though, the more likely it becomes that things settle down and generally I feel confident about overall direction.  I still have the option to simply move the expiration forward and actually increase total premiums gained."

The websites were mma websites so I'm not sure the thoroughness of the sources. But the explanation on all the sources are that It is not exactly known what disorder Hasbulla Magomedov has that caused his stature to resemble that of a child.

The young (Tajik) woman whom I knew (got her degree at my same school) spoke Russian for sure, but I don't remember that accent.  She didn't break from English hardly at all around me, though‚Äîso hard to be sure.

I did have a handful of co-workers (going back two years) who were Afghan‚Äîinterpreters moved to The States mostly‚Äîwho would joke about the not-fully okay good life of settling into an apartment in Tajikistan where the rental would be cheap and a nice, uh, housemaid would come with it.  They didn't raise any issue about understanding her.  That's even though the guys in question were all Dari/Farsi-literate but really native speakers of Pashto.  Their perspectives may have not been fully informed, or maybe something upstaged communication for their main focus. Friendly guys for sure; not the most notorious for their respect for women.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"

I wish the legislation was aimed at supporting the new big 3 (TSLA, GM, F) as it would gain more support than just targeting GM who‚Äôs EV‚Äôs are either too expensive (Hummer) or shit (Bolt). Just drop the union element and raise the sticker to $100k."

2021-05-27 21:49:42,wallstreetbets,"Possibly unpopular opinion on here: if you're new to investing, your smartest investment is index funds for steady long term gains that build wealth. 95% of what I'm in right now is FLCNX in my 401(k) or VUG (vanguard growth ETF) for individual. Even experienced traders have difficulty beating index funds. Seeing massive gains in here can be misleading because of survivorship bias: they often (with exceptions) also have massive losses from high risk trading strategies like buying options that can average out to a loss. Focus first on investing in the overall market to study patterns in it and help you become a better investor.

What OP used were stock options which act like a multiplier on gains, or losses. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp  
  
options have larger risks, if the option is not ""in the money"" at its expiry date, it expires worthless. This is unlike securities which you can just hold until they regain their value."

Also, there was a Report in some newspaper that their technological progress in terms of batteries and EVs in general is worse than the progress of their counterparts (Mercedes, Toyota,..). They are making cool EVs now (ID.3 is I think pretty successful) but i personally doubt that they can continue the leadership they held in the past. 
Also, they still have lawsuits to deal with because of their diesel scandal here in the EU. In general, their reputation here in Germany is significantly damaged. 

I could be wrong, I now. History has told us that you should never underestimate VW but this time, I don‚Äôt know."

2021-05-28 08:01:17,wallstreetbets,It's two different things.  First is what the company is worth or will be worth in x amount of time.  This is based on their market cap vs earnings.  Second is just straight up what someone is willing to pay for them.  The difference is the premium.  Premiums can be justified by your investment time frame but can be effected by the hype or fud around the company.

You gotta stop thinking intraday and actually start considering the big picture. 

If he sells today and makes money, good on him. But I'd wager good money that he'll end up selling for a loss, because he picked a really bad time to enter AMC. It's nearing the top of a euphoria bubble."

Because I've made a lot of money shorting both. Everytime it rallies like this week, I short and make money. Every time.

It's my current strategy. And this is a stock market sub, so I post about my strategies.

>I‚Äôm not in AMC but all you seem to do is talk down on AMC and GME and not provide any counter DD as to why or show positions on shorts or puts.

Uh huh, and 99% of this sub does the opposite, posting AMC and GME and emojis, with no DD. Do you go stalk them as well, telling them their comments aged like milk every red day? 

You don't, of course, because you're just biased. Just say that, it's easier.

Workday is leaps and bounds better than what we transitioned FROM. Personally, I think it's intuitive, user friendly, big stupid buttons (tiles), and I've never once needed to consult HRIS analysts or help documentation to find something. Going on 4 years managing staff and hiring via Workday.

Those who hate Workday, please tell me what you've used that's so much better and what makes it better."

2021-05-28 08:52:28,wallstreetbets,"Jira is just slow and sometimes clunky. Overall not the worst app on the planet, but they feel 5 years behind at least when compared to top-end engineered products.

Like how you transition ticket statuses or try to change an issue's type and the screens can just refresh randomly.

Or try doing a bulk or certain action on items and Jira takes you to the completely wrong screen afterwards.

Good luck when stuff doesn't work the way you want or expect, or you made some kind of error by mistake. Atlassian's response to the majority of issues is really, truly lacking from a support and UX side."

2021-05-28 07:05:31,wallstreetbets,Oh man. U want me some deviled eggs!!
2021-05-28 10:53:19,wallstreetbets,"That's really odd. Verifying time for my workers takes 30 seconds each, submitting my own time for the week takes 30 seconds.

Two clicks from the home page and I'm on my time sheet for the week, click Actions drop-down menu on the right, Auto-fill from Schedule, check off any days that are holiday or I'm taking PTO, and a few more clicks and my time is in for the week.

Granted some of my employees are required to be more granular to allocate 1hr towards this project, 4hrs towards another project, but I also have salaried employees like myself that just do the 8hrs/day Auto-fill from Schedule option.

So, from my perspective, I'm not sure how the process is any worse than an excel spreadsheet.

If it's a shared spreadsheet, isn't it susceptible to others mistakenly overwriting areas they're not supposed to, or submitting time on someone else's behalf when they think they're on their own line for their submittal? If it's individual spreadsheets that sounds like a mess of files to weed through.

Edit: I can't even imagine what trying to recreate that allocating hours towards projects part would look like in Excel. You would have to define a drop-down to select from projects, and in our case that's a list of over 50. Not to mention the ability to report you worked X hours from another state which is important to Payroll. Excel may be fine for a company of 50 total employees, but when you start venturing into the thousands of employees... it really doesn't get any better than Workday."
