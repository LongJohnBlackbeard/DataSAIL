2021-04-12 19:47:55,wallstreetbets,"Nice üòÇ honestly I hope it prints that gme shit is a disturbing cult getting taken advantage of by the same hedge funds they think they're destroying. And they destroyed the best sub on reddit. I even made money off the first squeeze but that shit disturbs me. They're so in denial. I had a contractor come work at my house and we start talking about trading. I swear to God he tells me with full conviction that GME is going to 10,000 and it's literally a given. That's when I realized how fucked up this has gotten."
2021-04-12 19:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I know bro it really is. Fucking straight derelicts in the sub. I had my account banned for getting too ""personal"" with one of those idiots and it was just constructive criticism. I cant wait to get out. Might play BABA tomorrow depending on pre market if I make big on that ill settle with the l on gme shares and holp puts I have.

2021-04-12 18:22:11,wallstreetbets,Dont sell at a loss and regret later like a fucking idiot. Sack up boy
2021-04-12 18:55:34,wallstreetbets,"If you looked at the chart and also get scared at the thought of a 30% loss, you have no business in GME"
2021-04-12 18:58:31,wallstreetbets,"I dont know why people think if this thing is going to explode its going to be 

A)instant moon

B)easy to hold 

And some people literally want both.  What it really is 

A)not instant.

B)This thing will drop significantly, even possibly back down to double digits, **because the price is artificial**

You can literally look today that buy orders are just being filtered *outside* the main exchange whereas **ALL** sells are happening *inside* the main exchange.

The only gamble you are taking is ""will this fuckery end and be exposed for the sham it is before I become a paper handed bitch?""


That is the real struggle for every holder."
2021-04-12 18:21:58,wallstreetbets,"Gme is on sale - 30% off!

Buy those dips baby

Nealy doubled my position today"
2021-04-12 18:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Like everyone else said, unless you need the money no reason to realize the loss."
2021-04-12 19:08:43,wallstreetbets,After last time where it dropped to 40is then back up to 200+ I‚Äôm never talking shit again. This is the one stock that can erase a 30% drop in a matter of minutes.
2021-04-12 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs nothing hard about holding üòÇ... should have seen the people down 90%
2021-04-12 18:28:05,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there king! If you can't handle 50% down, you don't deserve 500% up"
2021-04-12 18:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry about it too much. It'll comeback up eventually, don't lock in your loss unless you need the cash"
2021-04-12 18:24:26,wallstreetbets,"With a 28% loss, it should be easy to hold. Stay strong ape."
2021-04-12 19:08:51,wallstreetbets,"Most comments are spot on. Let me add something about **the worst moment to sell**:

You invested because you've done your DD and believe that the stock will gain value later. If the conditions that made you invest haven't changed and your financial situation can handle it, you should hold or even add more. 

The worst possible time to sell your shares (options are a different story) is when you are down and feel all the stress of losing more and there is no other material reason for the stock to underperform. That's where other market participants want you to be. That's precisely why technical analysis and bunch of other predicting techniques kinda work, because they are based on predictable human emotions. 

Don't look for confirmation here. We're bunch of retards gambling our money. Think about why you got in and why you should hold."
2021-04-12 18:58:08,wallstreetbets,Only a loss if you sell!
2021-04-12 18:36:32,wallstreetbets,What would be hard is selling at a loss
2021-04-12 18:44:14,wallstreetbets,Not hard some people held all the way down to 40$ I‚Äôm one of them
2021-04-12 18:52:23,wallstreetbets,"It did this last time, went down to super low and eventually went back up.  Hope this is the same wave ü§û....   Tesla is also up and down so it‚Äôs all about patience in stocks and only investing what you can hold hold hold"
2021-04-12 18:26:04,wallstreetbets,Is this dude for real?
2021-04-12 18:47:10,wallstreetbets,I held all the way down to 38$. Then back up to 350. Its so easy to hold now.

2021-04-12 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,Feel no pain.
2021-04-12 19:41:38,wallstreetbets,Price doesn't matter with GME. They have to buy at your price. Easy hold.
2021-04-12 18:51:15,wallstreetbets,Just close your eyes.

2021-04-12 18:43:03,wallstreetbets,Here let me buy some PUT option and it will take off
2021-04-12 19:33:42,wallstreetbets,"Base on the GameStop fundamental alone, it‚Äôs worth over $200/ shares for mid to long term. What you‚Äôre lacking is the DD. Researching enough then you don‚Äôt give a shit about the price anymore."

2021-04-12 19:46:34,wallstreetbets,Averaged down from $160 today that was nice
2021-04-12 19:25:24,wallstreetbets,"""GameStop didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment on the Reuters report.""

Yeah, why would they respond to random rumors and conjecture pieces? This is one of those journalistic legalese sentences that is supposed to make you think Gamestop (or whoever) is trying to hide something without the writer actually outright accusing them of it."
2021-04-12 18:24:18,wallstreetbets,"I bought 20 more today, if this goes below 100 I'm selling other stuff to buy more GME. If GME goes to 50 or less, I will take out a bank loan I cannot afford and buy more with that"
2021-04-12 18:15:50,wallstreetbets,"I bought a little more. In for a penny, in for a pounding."

they can say things like

""kenny G of shitadel has a strict diet of eating freshly removed foreskins"" for breakfast.  I asked him but he never got back to me.

see what i did there.  Even if i didn't ask him and i called his personal phone line and breathed like an ape for 45 minutes until he climaxed in fear, he'd still deny it.

oops i did it again.  it's almost like I've developed a horrible journalist skill while working in that industry for half my half life.

2021-04-12 18:18:18,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs big institution dumping shares.
2021-04-12 19:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Retail obviously isn't selling, in fact they're buying more and more

Institutions have been increasing their shares

So who's selling? The naked shorters most likely judging by the consistent 40-60% short volume. When will it stop? Probably when the price drops low enough for a whale to make a fortune off of forcing a gamma squeeze again. I'm expecting another huge runup within two weeks just based on the last two squeezes which have played out in very similar ways.

If retails owns 99 of 100 total shares available to trade, hedgies can just trade that 1 free share back and forth between 2 hedgies 10,000,000 times so it looks like a large sell and tons of trading volume. They can also trade shares that don't exist. They can also buy on the backend ""dark pool"" and sell on the public market. They can also act as the house and the player and self-deal stocks between 2 subsidiaries.

2021-04-12 19:09:27,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm feeling ‚Äòya ape. My loss porn % and $ ain‚Äôt far off... but the key here is 132 tickets to board the rocket. Brrrrr! ü¶çüöÄüåö
2021-04-12 18:43:20,wallstreetbets,red is the new green
2021-04-12 19:40:17,wallstreetbets,AMC!! The next big squeeze!!
2021-04-12 19:47:25,wallstreetbets,Shoulda known haha
2021-04-12 18:30:12,wallstreetbets,ASO is the üöÄ
2021-04-12 17:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, but if you can withstand tomorrow and hold you should be ‚Äúok‚Äù"
2021-04-12 18:29:14,wallstreetbets,Can ASO become the next GME?
2021-04-12 18:25:24,wallstreetbets,"To be real, your amount at risk for what is to be gained is a little disportionate. I would recommend reducing your risk here ape"
2021-04-12 18:29:07,wallstreetbets,1.2 million? 98k aint nothing at that point.
2021-04-12 17:58:41,wallstreetbets,can‚Äôt comment on WSB-OG but hot damn you have balls of steel.
2021-04-12 19:49:41,wallstreetbets,"Man, if AMC votes to dilute on Friday, those shorts are gonna fuckin printtt"
2021-04-12 17:48:00,wallstreetbets,For what ticker lol
2021-04-12 18:38:24,wallstreetbets,I fucking hope so ü§£
2021-04-12 18:25:57,wallstreetbets,How...?
2021-04-12 18:01:18,wallstreetbets,Or I'm just absolutely retarded. I'll keep updating.
2021-04-12 19:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Is Friday voting day?? Lol, if they don't vote for the share dilution, they are going bankrupt."
2021-04-12 18:36:52,wallstreetbets,"I take that back, I think your aso 4/15 calls might miss.... but I hope I‚Äôm wrong"
2021-04-12 18:55:52,wallstreetbets,In my opinion it has everything to be the next GME. I just wish there was more coverage on Wallstreet bets. Seems like it's  mostly been shrugged off. Just my opinion. This is not financial advice.
2021-04-12 18:39:30,wallstreetbets,"My risk is less than 300k for AMC, gains could be like 700k"
2021-04-12 18:01:48,wallstreetbets,how long gonna keep going with your short position?
2021-04-12 18:38:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's alright. If I die, I die."
2021-04-12 19:53:33,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why the downvotes but my calls give me the ability to purchase 100,000 shares at $11.60. $11.60 - $9.56 is $2.04 loss per shorted share max. That's $204,000 + cost basis of calls ($43,410 for the $12's and $33,073 for the $11's). My loss potential is $280,483. I guess that exceeds your risk tolerance but that is worst case scenario, assuming the price skyrockets. You guys are either AMC fan boys, truly retarded or don't know how hedging works."
2021-04-12 18:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Depends, I wanna cover around 2 dollars."
2021-04-12 18:03:34,wallstreetbets,fuck 95k profit anyways. lol good luck man i wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep at night with this much cap
2021-04-12 18:07:50,wallstreetbets,I have calls so I cant get completely blown up with retard strength.
2021-04-12 18:08:31,wallstreetbets,"yeah i see the hedge, i just also see the profit (that i‚Äôve never even had saved up) and drool lol."
2021-04-12 18:12:02,wallstreetbets,"ü§£ü§£ I started with like $4,500 in November. Play a little smart and a little stupid. Don't get married to a position and know when to accept your losses!"
2021-04-12 17:46:23,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low
2021-04-12 19:40:23,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm bleeding out on the APHA side. When we merge our blood will become one sludge of degeneracy. Pure and unkempt
2021-04-12 18:55:58,wallstreetbets,"damn no 4/20 for me this year 

can't afford it now üìà

unless. . ."
2021-04-12 18:03:17,wallstreetbets,Fuck that
2021-04-12 18:05:59,wallstreetbets,call any financial advisor for advice and do the opposite
2021-04-12 19:59:12,wallstreetbets,A YOLO with shares?
2021-04-12 19:36:07,wallstreetbets,I also followed this strategy very well on TLRY. I need it to go higher so I can buy more before it bottoms out
2021-04-12 18:13:30,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-04-12 19:10:40,wallstreetbets,"Goodluck dude, your wild and this is real wsb content"
2021-04-12 17:56:37,wallstreetbets,"This guy made 80k today while I‚Äôm still here at my wage cucking job, congrats and fuck you"
2021-04-12 17:34:35,wallstreetbets,Bezos stepped down
2021-04-12 18:50:44,wallstreetbets,200K coin flip for no reason. Literally retarded.

2021-04-12 17:35:48,wallstreetbets,Godspeed
2021-04-12 19:32:03,wallstreetbets,CPI comes out tomorrow so that could always make people buy more.
2021-04-12 19:59:58,wallstreetbets,"Nice! Just curious, what‚Äôs your exit price? You planning on holding until Friday? Or exit if it hits your price? I‚Äôve been following AMZN and I think we could see 3525-3550 by Friday."
2021-04-12 18:12:26,wallstreetbets,The rally last Friday was strong. I hope so too
2021-04-12 17:33:11,wallstreetbets,Looks like I'll be cashing out some PTO for more $GME üëÄ
2021-04-12 17:50:02,wallstreetbets,Previous target was $12 and actual price was comfortably sitting above $160 so I don‚Äôt consider this target change to mean anything.
2021-04-12 17:56:23,wallstreetbets,"I can't even tell if these articles are supposed to scare me, or get me jacked to the tits because I'll be able to afford 100x the amount of shares at that price."
2021-04-12 19:15:54,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what they wrote about Tesla too. That would have been the time to buy
2021-04-12 17:48:32,wallstreetbets,"Finally, the discount I've been waiting for.

Are these guys so retarded they don't realize the more affordable the share price becomes, the more us apes will buy and hold?

ALL ABOARD APES, WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON!"
2021-04-12 18:04:12,wallstreetbets,">Ascendiant Capital Markets analyst Edward Woo lowered his rating to Sell  from Hold and cut his price target to $10 from $12 over the weekend. 

They should be called 'accidental' or 'random' markets. Same as their price targets. 10$? I'll buy 100 thou shares at this price right.fucking.now, no questions asked."
2021-04-12 17:58:07,wallstreetbets,I would love to average down.  Are they stupid to realize that fundamentals means nothing on a meme stock?!
2021-04-12 19:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Isn‚Äôt this guy a little late to the game? Took him 3 months to come to that conclusion?

Bad analyst is bad.

Next."
2021-04-12 18:25:26,wallstreetbets,"I mean, yes please. Get some far out calls, wait for another jump and be rich like DFV."
2021-04-12 18:47:25,wallstreetbets,Ascendiant Capital what is your position in GME? LMAO
2021-04-12 17:58:35,wallstreetbets,These guys are fucking idiots and still have no idea how the real or theoretical world operates.
2021-04-12 19:39:18,wallstreetbets,Wasn't Woo the guy that peed on the rug?
2021-04-12 19:50:27,wallstreetbets,"If GME goes to $10, I'm buying in."
2021-04-12 18:59:02,wallstreetbets,"here's their market research write up as of jan 15 2021, i couldn't find a newer one on the site despite the update: [https://ascendiant.sharefile.com/share/view/597ef0e15d8c419a](https://ascendiant.sharefile.com/share/view/597ef0e15d8c419a)"
2021-04-12 19:25:36,wallstreetbets,They can Ascendiant up my ass
2021-04-12 19:15:08,wallstreetbets,GME just needs to issue more shares with more different underwriters.  Then they'll have lots of $170 price targets.

2021-04-12 17:50:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah was mostly making fun of the article blaming the dip on that target change lol
2021-04-12 18:20:02,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm jacked to the TITS!
2021-04-12 18:06:17,wallstreetbets,Agreed!!! It‚Äôs like they have tourettes.
2021-04-12 17:55:09,wallstreetbets,"Ok, that explains todays dip. What about the other 27 days from this past month?"
2021-04-12 17:55:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I would assume anyone on this sub knows a price target is nonsense on this one.
2021-04-12 18:30:08,wallstreetbets,Turrets go brrrrrrr
2021-04-12 18:19:20,wallstreetbets,Are they retarded or are WE RETARDED?!  I'm doubting our retardedness now.

2021-04-12 19:13:43,wallstreetbets,"Gutsy move on the contrarian side.  What makes think market crash coming now?  

IWM Puts served their purpose for me last year as a hedge against my tsla calls.  For awhile last year IWM seemed to move more quickly than other market trackers."
2021-04-12 17:51:04,wallstreetbets,Market pull back after your puts expire
2021-04-12 19:09:27,wallstreetbets,"\-2% in late after hours, DID U CAUSE THIS!? ;DD"
2021-04-12 19:06:47,wallstreetbets,Just the shares I needed to free up capital I still have all my calls
2021-04-12 18:49:48,wallstreetbets,God has no mercy for $BB paper hands
2021-04-12 17:48:34,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I‚Äôm waiting in case we have a few more Green Days but something is coming. This market is way over extended"
2021-04-12 19:16:35,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think a crash but a strong pull back is due. And I‚Äôm not fully loaded on the short position, but I will short more if we melt up higher."
2021-04-12 19:17:55,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think so gusty considering how much IWM moved up without a meaningful retracement
2021-04-12 17:54:00,wallstreetbets,Haven‚Äôt fully exposed myself to short side still holding some cash.
2021-04-12 19:29:14,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs more than enough degeneracy. BB PMCC is literally free money
2021-04-12 19:03:43,wallstreetbets,"My last BB flew out the window of a Camaro doing 50. It also had the hood of an MR2 closed on it.

The only sign of these incidents when I sold it was a dent in one of the keys, and a few scratches on the case.

I aspire for my hands to have the same level of resilience as that Blackberry."
2021-04-12 17:50:15,wallstreetbets,Idk how much people trust the fib retracment thing but we‚Äôre coming up to a resistance
2021-04-12 19:35:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes. retracement is overdue.

""gutsy"" because it seems Jpow and others want to see a breakout to upside in April or May.  Just my sense of it though."
2021-04-12 17:59:36,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm still bag holding BB like a fucking idiot.

2021-04-12 19:08:32,wallstreetbets,A lot of indicators are saying overbought but I just went with my gut on this one
2021-04-12 18:03:34,wallstreetbets,BB is massively undervalued but it hasn‚Äôt been moving I still have exposure to it with my call options. I‚Äôve only liquidated my shares because they‚Äôre more capital intensive and I want to capitalize on going short since I believe the market is way over extended.
2021-04-12 19:10:33,wallstreetbets,Good luck
2021-04-12 19:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Saw some info / research / DD on here right before earnings, and if any of it was true BB sure seems to be getting ready to kick ass and take names.   Still disappointed not reflected in a moonshot."
2021-04-12 18:09:34,wallstreetbets,i have 5.5K shares well ITM - been myself thinking about liquidating just b/c of the whole market thing - but man i think next ER is the one we've been waiting for all these years - as in - there will be profit...
2021-04-12 18:12:55,wallstreetbets,But you‚Äôre right next quarter for bb is clutch. But also early 2022
2021-04-12 17:27:00,wallstreetbets,*Total Return +93k* Yeah I would not be upset either.
2021-04-12 18:21:34,wallstreetbets,"The $3.06 buying power really brings the whole montage together. 

Bravo!"
2021-04-12 17:27:41,wallstreetbets,"Oof, that's some mixed feelings right there.

2021-04-12 18:23:15,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre still up nearly 100k.. of course you‚Äôre saying that. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be shitting your pants and crying if there was a negative sign in front of that number
2021-04-12 19:58:26,wallstreetbets,Hello yes I‚Äôd like to liquidate my dads entire 401k. I need more buying power and the pawn shop won‚Äôt let me in anymore.

2021-04-12 18:13:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah these people that are a net positive and had 200k plus to invest in the first place get zero sympathy from me. Try investing 10k when you make slightly better than minimum wage then be down 30%
2021-04-12 19:34:10,wallstreetbets,It is a nice profit but still he held that deserves respect

> I'll give him credit for being a convincing snake

- And I'll give you credit for being a dumbass. Everything I pulled up is publicly available information, but sounds like you'd rather sit around short squeezing yourself than look it up.

> he wouldn't post proof of his positions.

- This is a fair point. The initial screenshot I posted to him was to provide proof that I did purchase shares at the time I said I did. I redacted the amount because it was a handful of shares across multiple purchases in small amounts. But, I was a broke senior in college working two jobs in 2016 who thought it was a good idea. Second I have friends that know my Reddit account that I'd rather not know my current finances. You're more than welcome to DM me, and I'll provide you proof directly.

You can do whatever you want. I always encourage everyone to look at anything on the internet with some form of skepticism and I always encourage everyone to do their own research. Ask him how that dying video game store is doing today."

 From u/Helmdacil commenting on this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mocpd2/edit\_everything\_tastes\_better\_crispr/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mocpd2/edit_everything_tastes_better_crispr/)

1. Crispr is mutagenic ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782611/)) ([2](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2623)). I would say actually that due to the way experiments are designed, the mutagenicity of CRISPR is strongly underestimated. This has lead to point 2.
2. CRISPR trials are being halted/cancelled because treated patients are developing cancer within months of obtaining treatment:[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/gene-therapy-trials-sickle-cell-disease-halted-after-two-patients-develop-cancer](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/02/gene-therapy-trials-sickle-cell-disease-halted-after-two-patients-develop-cancer)
3. Though there is much discussion of how to reduce the mutagenic potential of CRISPR, literally nothing yet has been proven, AFAIK, and I have been watching.

Crispr is a wonderful technology that will have dramatic impact in society, be it perhaps by engineering better crops (Roundup ready crops), cold resistant crops, drought resistant crops, and so forth. However, based on the evidence of mutagenicty, it seems highly highly premature to be bullish on near-term returns on crispr gene therapy trials, in my opinion.

Disclosures: I have no stock in CRISPR stocks. I research DNA mutation. I really, really want to believe, but I just havent seen any solid data. I would love if someone could give me hope, but I really have not seen it."""

2021-04-12 19:16:00,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the comment, it‚Äôs nice to see you linked several stories about the cancer not being connected, that was a concern for sure when first brought up in the comments here somewhere. 

Also completely forgot about the reasoning you gave for not showing much involving your personal investments, I can‚Äôt really argue with you wanting to keep private info hidden, not something to argue with imo.

Imo one concern I‚Äôve got so far that still lingers is how it spiked up to $99/share awhile back and is now so low, but somebody else mentioned to me that was because the company put out more shares or something at around $66/share? Forgot what he said. 

But yeah, nice to see that the cancer issue (which I suspected could be one from the start since the nature of the tests involves manipulating genetics) could be just a fluke

I still definitely have out in more trust than my own DD on this but we‚Äôre apes for a reason right? Lol

I never saw you mention anything about why the stock dropped so much awhile back, got an explanation for that one? I‚Äôd love to hear some reasoning other than just what I was told from 1 other guy"

There is nothing in this link about Editas. The players are the Broad Institute, University of California, and University of Vienna.

""The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) ruled on 10 September that a group led by the Broad Institute has ‚Äúpriority‚Äù in its already granted patents for uses of the original CRISPR system in eukaryotic cells, which covers potentially lucrative applications in lab-grown human cells or in people directly. But the ruling also gives the UC group, which the court refers to as CVC because it includes the University of Vienna and scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier, a leg up on the invention of one critical component of the CRISPR tool kit.""

Getting a license is not the same thing as having the patent, so your post was misleading in this regard.

2) Regarding claims of cancer: all of your links above are claims made by bluebird bio and the FDA has not cleared them to resume trials. This is from behind your paywall link:  ""But bluebird bio is not yet fully in the regulatory clear. The company is in discussions with the FDA to lift clinical holds from bb1111 and from Œ≤-thalassemia candidate Zynteglo (betibeglogene autotemcel), which uses the same vector."" Also, it should be noted that these are trials for drugs developed by blubird bio not Editas. 

3) Impacts every aspect of our lives: you just give a quote about the potential for therapies which isn't every aspect of our lives.

4) Short squeezing myself: I do enjoy that, point conceded.

2021-04-12 16:52:54,wallstreetbets,"It'll probably keep going down before it goes up. Or trade sideways. Yea I know its a meme no one can really tell you. Anyone who can tell you for sure is just bull shitting even me. 

So far my thoughts on AMC have been right and that's all the confirmation bias I need to say AMC will probably go down for another week or two and maybe when the vote comes around jump up and then dive down. My puts have been printing for the last month. I believe they will continue to print. 

Especially with the vote to dilute coming next month on the fourth. I'm unsure how I feel about playing it. On one hand if the vote to dilute passes its actually bullish for long term amc but bearish to all those hoping for a squeeze and might end up dropping it even more."
2021-04-12 16:24:46,wallstreetbets,Would like to know as well.
2021-04-12 18:06:25,wallstreetbets,"I think the math is pretty simple for a simple ape like me.

If I‚Äôm an institution with a short position I want to squeeze this this down as low as it can humanly go so that when i does pop the ceiling is lower than what it might otherwise be. 

I went back in for more because I just don‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs going into the 7,6,5 range. Who knows though.

I think that it will run up prior to the May 4th meeting date. Keep in mind that it‚Äôs not just WSB. It‚Äôs any institution that isn‚Äôt suffering from the shorts that are standing quietly beside us and praying for the same result."
2021-04-12 18:10:35,wallstreetbets,"Who knows though is a perfect summary to everything. We could both be wrong and it just does nothing but go sideways for a month lol. 

I definitely feel it can run up again before the vote and jump even if the vote passes or fails. That's why I'm scared to play the vote it could go either way for me. 

Personally I'd gladly jump back in but only under 5$."

2021-04-12 16:09:54,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt touch Apple anymore. The theta decay is horrible. Last year I had a couple calls that I bought around $115. It dipped and recovered over like 3 days but I ended up losing around $700 or something from the theta. Don‚Äôt say you weren‚Äôt warned.

2021-04-12 16:17:56,wallstreetbets,Biggest risk is when the gme and meme trades come to a halt on the 4 dollar options that have made so much money. That may catch some unaware and the price action hopefully doesn't bleed over. It's often good to blow off some highs on Monday and have a good rebound Tuesday.
2021-04-12 16:09:57,wallstreetbets,I actually am long apple and have calls expiring this week. I rarely add to a position I'm heavy in but I added today. We were due some selling but they say the ten year is the issue pushing valuation. But look at another core position msft apple and msft usually mirror p/e . So I added to a very large position. It wasn't the only add today but it was unusual. Something in my algo triggered the buy. So I didn't interfere.

2021-04-12 16:03:53,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I love this system. Morgan Stanley, who was a prime broker for Archegos, and was one, if not the first, of the PBs they did business with to offload their VIAC positions a couple of weeks back after the PBs agreed to unwind their collective positions back in a metered fashion. So, not only was MS involved in this from the get-go, but they now have come back and are offering new, down-graded price targets and analysis for VIAC, Credit Suisse, and Nomura - the latter two are some of the other PBs that Archegos did business with and subsequently lost their shirts on as a result of MS‚Äôs fuckery.

It‚Äôs absolutely wild to me that they can still be capable of making these PT assessments while all the meanwhile having been involved in this nonsense from the beginning. Not to get all tin-foil hat or anything, but I‚Äôm sure they made a ton when they liquidated their position ahead of everyone else and probably decided to short it all the way down for good measure and extra tendies, too. Wild shit.

Tl;dr: MS enabled crazy risk behavior in pursuit of profits. MS subsequently denounces the crazy risk behavior by way of downgrading PTs of the equities involved in the Archegos‚Äô debacle."

Buy about 20 points OTM to get a very small delta, like 0.1 (10 delta).  As spy rises, you lose very little, but as it falls.. that 0.1 will grow to 0.5 ATM, increasing your delta to 50 a point, and onward towards 100 if it continues to fall. 

So you buy like 10 puts for around 1k around a month out, which could ultimately turn into a -1000 delta in the event of a crash."

2021-04-12 17:55:38,wallstreetbets,The simplest advice I can give is get real good at excel and look at data science courses and you can get a decent role anywhere. Don‚Äôt waste big money and time on a law degree with little pay off until after you‚Äôre 10 years deep at the expense of all other aspects of your life.
2021-04-12 17:57:09,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs going to consolidate after making its big run from 120.  Slight pull back this week just trading sideways

2021-04-12 18:06:01,wallstreetbets,Good for you man. GME is a great stock to trade due to volatility. Just don't hold a position for long.

2021-04-12 17:26:40,wallstreetbets,Then why did you buy now instead of 2 weeks from now?
2021-04-12 17:21:06,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly. Definitely gonna take some time though

2021-04-12 19:13:54,wallstreetbets,"Just hope it doesn‚Äôt trade sideways for a couple days.

2021-04-12 19:23:10,wallstreetbets,"I have a $75 put for this Friday on GME that I picked up for like $20, so if it gets close I‚Äôll sell. I think it‚Äôs at $60 right now but I don‚Äôt think GME trades sideways this week. Steady decline of $20 per day"

2021-04-12 17:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen found a buyer for his midtown Manhattan penthouse. It took eight years and a 74% price cut.

Cohen‚Äôs 9,000-square-foot (836-square-meter) duplex at 151 East 58th St. is under contract in Manhattan‚Äôs priciest deal last week, according to a report Monday by luxury brokerage Olshan Realty Inc.

The sale marks the end of a journey that began in 2013 when Cohen, founder of Point72 Asset Management and owner of the New York Mets, listed the place for $115 million. The asking price was reduced several times since, most recently to $29.5 million, according to StreetEasy. The final sale price won‚Äôt be known until the deal closes.

A spokesman for Cohen, Jonathan Gasthalter, declined to comment on the deal. Cohen paid $24 million for the apartment in 2005.

The unit, on the 51st and 52nd floors of One Beacon Court, has five bedrooms, six full bathrooms and 24-foot (7.3-meter) ceilings in the living room, where the windows offer views of Central Park, according to the listing.

The property bounced among at least four brokerages, finally landing with Christie‚Äôs International Real Estate, which put it on the market in October 2019 for $34 million. A team led by Erin Boisson Aries had the listing.

Buyers are returning to Manhattan‚Äôs luxury apartment market, seizing an opportunity for deep discounts amid a mountain of supply. Last week alone, there were 51 contracts signed in Manhattan for homes priced at $4 million or higher, according to Olshan‚Äôs report. It was the 10th straight week with 30 or more deals in that price range, the longest streak in data going back to 2006."

2021-04-12 18:50:55,wallstreetbets,I read the article. Thought of posting it. Decided not to because it says he bought it in 2008 for less than what he sold it for. Title misleading. Just clickbait.

2021-04-12 19:49:14,wallstreetbets,"Well you have to think after massive property taxes since he's owned it, he is probably going to lose a lot of money."
2021-04-12 16:35:18,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention official rate of inflation. 

But let's assume he pays $0 in commissions (which is impossible but just for the sake of argument). That leaves him with 29.5\*0,7=20.65 mil.

Now let's compare it to a risk free govt bonds. 20Y bond in 2005 yilded anything between 4.3% to 5% annually, say 4.6% on average. Assuming he would've not reinvested the coupons and payed 20% cap gain tax annually, leaves us with ((24\*1,046)-24)\*0.8)=883.2 grand in annual income which translates to 13.25 mil + 24 mil principal as of last year's coupon payment and that represents roughly 180% of the amount of money he'd received after the deal was finalized (given he'd pay nothing in commissions and a 30% property tax).

Doesn't look like a solid investment decision by any means."

2021-04-12 16:42:48,wallstreetbets,So that was why he missed on all the gains from previous years because that property was clearly an investment? Yeah call it 'smart' if you'd like. It doesn't even compare to risk-free investment therefore it's dumb by definition.
2021-04-12 17:04:32,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't it be dumb to sell property if hyperinflation is just around the corner?
2021-04-12 18:03:50,wallstreetbets,Doubt he sold because of that. He‚Äôs worth $14B+. This is like me selling my toaster oven for $20.

Even by rough estimates.

2021-04-12 17:10:48,wallstreetbets,"I know we call ourselves here degenerates, autistic, apes etc but I really doubt either you, or I, or most of people here would've been that irresponsible with our money. Generally speaking I believe that the retail trader (or an amateur, or 'dumb money' as they refer to commons) acts in a way more responsible manner because the consequence is always there and he's well aware of it. While those guys don't give a slightest fuck -- it's their investors' money after all, and if shit really hits the fan hard like in '08 for example, govt will step it and bail most of their asses out. Moral hazard at it's best."

Buying the worst stock because you believe some low lives who live in their moms basement about GME. Literally the worst stock in the market. It was a momentum play but all you dumbos here somehow think you‚Äôre sticking it to the hedgies or that there‚Äôs a squeeze.

Enjoy . Your money just went to an institutional trader who bought puts on this turd. 

Hope you enjoy sticking it to the hedgies"

2021-04-12 19:59:44,wallstreetbets,All I see is a bunch of haters. No one knows OP's financial situation. The money could be a drop in the bucket for him.

2021-04-12 15:55:08,wallstreetbets,Taking even half his stocks bought now at the dip is an even better deal than half that money anyway

2021-04-12 16:37:06,wallstreetbets,Man chill your last 10 comments are all about GME. How much is the salary just tell me
2021-04-12 17:53:20,wallstreetbets,Nothing about spending money that is also your wife‚Äôs that was for a house down payment is inspiring.
2021-04-12 16:28:28,wallstreetbets,Or jumping off one.
2021-04-12 16:07:52,wallstreetbets,You're wasting your time.  The kind to secretly spend the entire joint home equity on GME is not the kind that has the attention span to read 2 sentences.
2021-04-12 16:24:23,wallstreetbets,Wtf you talking about?  You don‚Äôt need permission from anyone if you‚Äôre a joint account owner
2021-04-12 16:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Not how it works. Both people can empty the account on a whim and face 0 legal consequences. The point of a joint account is joint finances, both people have rights to the money and just because one person puts in ¬£1, and the other ¬£100,000, doesn't stop the person who put ¬£1 in taking out ¬£100,001 and running off. At least in the UK, and I'm pretty sure, the USA as well. Each owner has full rights."
2021-04-12 18:24:27,wallstreetbets,"Are you even old enough to open a bank account?

That's not how it works at all."

2021-04-12 19:11:27,wallstreetbets,What do your boyfriends think about you having two husbands?
2021-04-12 19:37:37,wallstreetbets,"She bought herself 10 shares when they were at $90 around February. 

Together we have 50 shares now."
2021-04-12 19:38:41,wallstreetbets,Thanks buddy
2021-04-12 16:53:29,wallstreetbets,Ahhh right right sorry my dick got hard
2021-04-12 16:38:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm salty because I saw a sub I really liked go down the drain for this GME and ape nonsense.
It's infuriating.

GME is devoid of reality. It's a dud company. Good momentum play, I hate hedge funds too. But this is insane. All the big players have adjusted. There's no squeeze to be squoze. Yet I see people Yoloing this rather than finding new names."
2021-04-12 18:14:54,wallstreetbets,Odds are hes fucking around as much as I am...
2021-04-12 16:09:22,wallstreetbets,"To be fair to them, they‚Äôre extremely adept at reading paragraphs upon paragraphs of DD that anyone who knows the first thing about markets can tell you is absolute gibberish."
2021-04-12 16:26:57,wallstreetbets,OP is probably unironically a child
2021-04-12 17:39:26,wallstreetbets,So divorce it is
2021-04-12 17:51:44,wallstreetbets,Np. I just wondered how many he had.  One is all I need.
2021-04-12 19:17:04,wallstreetbets,I am loyal and just game all the time. My husband's boyfriends are pretty kinky though
2021-04-12 16:43:18,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm curious why you think a squeeze isn‚Äôt possible
2021-04-12 17:10:25,wallstreetbets,Also hold till eternity nonsense. Paper handing is how to make money. Knowing when to take profit or cut your losses.
2021-04-12 17:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Open your trade station. Look at the put/call ratio. You have your answer.

This is a has-been play. Your 5 mins is up!"
2021-04-12 17:19:55,wallstreetbets,Well I don‚Äôt think anyone is holding forever lol. What‚Äôs the highest you think the stock will hit?
2021-04-12 17:20:56,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs hit it‚Äôs peak. 
There‚Äôs a small statistical percentage that it has not, but I would be shocked if all the institutional investors haven‚Äôt dumped this stock and cut their losses. There‚Äôs fish to fry. This is an old story"
2021-04-12 17:25:13,wallstreetbets,What about the executive  and board changes? You don‚Äôt think the stock has long term value?
2021-04-12 17:26:03,wallstreetbets,"No one cares. Companies make board changes and executive changes all the time. 

Why should that change the price of the stock? The entire microscopic focus on this one stock is beyond me."
2021-04-12 17:53:36,wallstreetbets,Not at the price it currently is lol
2021-04-12 17:35:44,wallstreetbets,"Well they are pretty big changes imo. People from big companies (Amazon, google) and a reposition of brand through a highly profitable E-commerce platform. And that‚Äôs not accounting for squeeze talk which is what has given it the most attention."
2021-04-12 17:54:22,wallstreetbets,Sure
2021-04-12 17:36:27,wallstreetbets,Hey its possible. But this is not a $100+ stock for sure.
2021-04-12 17:37:47,wallstreetbets,I respectfully disagree. But time will tell.
2021-04-12 15:21:18,wallstreetbets,Awesome!  My leaps are up over 60% today as well.
2021-04-12 15:21:55,wallstreetbets,damn! congrats and fuk u
2021-04-12 15:45:23,wallstreetbets,I assume you‚Äôre still holding these? Do you have a price that you will close them? I had 4/30 C but decided to sell today for a 20k gain. If it dips tomorrow I might open another position.
2021-04-12 17:33:16,wallstreetbets,Hey another 30 grand and you should be about even! Lol
2021-04-12 15:43:45,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-12 15:45:54,wallstreetbets,"No 

It was institutionalized investor from USA who bumped the price.

Does not mean retail will buy.
Enjoy your gains but it‚Äôs a non retail buy at this point."
2021-04-12 16:16:11,wallstreetbets,Cool man. What was your free stock?
2021-04-12 17:00:25,wallstreetbets,"This largely depends on earnings. Notice I bought all post-earnings. I strongly believe the rally will continue into earnings, with a few dips along the way to shake off paper-handed investors, nevertheless, I expect Alibaba to moon into earnings. I‚Äôll likely sell 1/2 my positions soon before earnings, and buy back in after if there‚Äôs a dip, if not, let the other half ride."
2021-04-12 16:00:23,wallstreetbets,What is your point? Its a global tech giant and there are plenty of high-up Americans that work for Baba. Its listed on the NYSE for exactly what OP is doing
2021-04-12 16:14:59,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-12 16:18:18,wallstreetbets,"Thats not my point. I only brought up Americans (very smart and highly qualified) working for Baba as a signal as to the amount of trust share holders have in trading the stock.

China also cant make the value go to $0. The price is driven by speculation , as you mentioned since no one actually owns it. Everyone involved would have to agree at the same time to stop trading it."
2021-04-12 16:21:58,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-12 16:23:47,wallstreetbets,"What ""ambiguity"" are you talking about? Its being traded on American markets, we control what companies we speculate on. China can't make the ticker disappear. They can rip out the company, but people will just sell. They cant fuck with the ticker, thats on us."
2021-04-12 16:28:55,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-12 16:43:06,wallstreetbets,"It is an actual company. Americans just don't actually own shares. They make hundreds of billions of dollars. If it was to be delisted again, we will know in plenty of stages in advance. China cannot magically make it go to $0. This isn't Luckin coffee or other China fuckery."
2021-04-12 16:48:52,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-12 16:50:41,wallstreetbets,Sounds good. Will worry about that when its at 400 levels
2021-04-12 15:31:12,wallstreetbets,Holy shit that's a lot of red.
2021-04-12 16:14:26,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs one of the most retarded bets I have seen, so it will probably print when the mother of all market crashes happens."
2021-04-12 18:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Hey, you got a green one!"
2021-04-12 16:10:31,wallstreetbets,So basically you did everything to amplify your play by going double down both ways? Cudos

2021-04-12 14:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Our numbers are very similar, 188 shares as of today üòÇü§£"

2021-04-12 14:57:08,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-12 18:42:52,wallstreetbets,My tendies are dangling under my anus for you to tickle
2021-04-12 17:48:09,wallstreetbets,Nice timing right before the spike! I got my additional shares at 139 since the hedgies didn't want to hit my limit buy at 135
2021-04-12 16:32:38,wallstreetbets,Great! Now get the fuck off of robinshit. Don‚Äôt be surprised if the sell button disappears.
2021-04-12 16:33:36,wallstreetbets,Thank you for holding with us.
2021-04-12 17:53:45,wallstreetbets,Nice! I averaged up to ~$130ish
2021-04-12 18:47:16,wallstreetbets,Juicy price avg.. I had it that low before but kept buying the dip all the way up and down
2021-04-12 17:24:45,wallstreetbets,Only at 137. You guys are whales ü§£
2021-04-12 14:57:32,wallstreetbets,"I also bout the dip, ape. This is the way."

2021-04-12 15:06:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's gonna happen guys. I'm in 5 shares, so not much and so can afford to piss it up the wall. But HF realised losses at 49%, no accurate figure on high SI other than a theory about EFTs (which I don't buy) and a solid cult mentality rather than sensible discussions on the associated subs (which is why I unsubscribed), lots of huge red flags and not many green ones."
2021-04-12 18:13:11,wallstreetbets,"Not just any gaming retailer, but a shitty one that gives you $5 for a used $60 game"
2021-04-12 15:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Hit 173 today, hoping to get more on paydayüçå"

2021-04-12 15:43:21,wallstreetbets,@$140/share this is a steal!! Even if the MOASS isnt real (it is). It literally cant go tits up. It's a fucking no brainer
2021-04-12 19:33:17,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a pretty sweet deal to me
2021-04-12 17:58:39,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-12 17:43:34,wallstreetbets,Just wondering why ‚Äúit literally can‚Äôt go tits up‚Äù. Not even a tiny part of you thinks there‚Äôs a 1% chance of risk here? This is basically the US treasury bonds of investments to you?
2021-04-12 18:20:07,wallstreetbets,"Of course, but I would take these odds to Vegas and bet the same amount. I think GME is a great long term investment."
2021-04-12 18:29:04,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the DCA of your GME investment?
2021-04-12 18:33:24,wallstreetbets,Why ask him? You know what he‚Äôs going to say. If you think it‚Äôs good then invest but there is a VERY good chance it can go down. Any stock can mate. Be safe with yourself and don‚Äôt fall for confirmation bias.
2021-04-12 18:35:42,wallstreetbets,Less than $100.
2021-04-12 18:39:58,wallstreetbets,I appreciate your concern. I've fallen on my face a few times.
2021-04-12 18:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Well I was just curious. Everyone who loves GME for some reason didn‚Äôt buy the stock when it was $4 or $20 a share, only when it hit $200 did people think it was a good investment. My point is if you didn‚Äôt buy the share at $20, why would you think it‚Äôs a good investment at $200. Weird stuff."
2021-04-12 19:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Of course. You won‚Äôt get any real advice from this sub, just letting you know. Look around and try and get all different perspectives."
2021-04-12 18:37:22,wallstreetbets,"Because greed and lack of knowledge. They built up the courage and are using the power of friendship to wish it to the moon. 
Make plays you believe in, not what others believe in, that‚Äôs how conspiracy theories start."
2021-04-12 19:03:09,wallstreetbets,Yeah I feel bad for some of the people here. There will be bag holders.
2021-04-12 14:58:46,wallstreetbets,Why are GME and AMC stocks negative beta??? Looks like a good sign but never seen this before...
2021-04-12 14:49:47,wallstreetbets,"I am a bot from /r/wallstreetbets. You submitted an image I've already seen before.                    If you're submitting a position screenshot use Gain/Loss/YOLO flair or it'll be duplicate checked.
                    If you submitted something and then immediatley deleted it... don't do that next time."
2021-04-12 15:11:55,wallstreetbets,"Profit takers, and options expires coming up."
2021-04-12 15:06:26,wallstreetbets,"Basically, this indicates the opposite of the market. As price goes down, risk goes down, and possible gains go up.

Cash is a beta of 0, so GME is better than cash right now"
2021-04-12 14:55:31,wallstreetbets,"its good VM, he was adding positions from original post"
2021-04-12 15:14:38,wallstreetbets,Short interest just jumped 50% to 73.82 million
2021-04-12 15:07:32,wallstreetbets,By why are they negative. This is rare. So the market crashes and they go up üòÇ
2021-04-12 15:16:49,wallstreetbets,"All hail the high priestess, silencer of the bot!"
2021-04-12 15:09:13,wallstreetbets,"They went down faster than the market, so beta went negative. If they shot up to $200 instantly, the beta would be high..

Low beta = price dip below normal

High beta = price hike above normal

Negative beta = bear fuk


This is just a generalization, and negative beta is indeed rare. This case is probably more hedgie fuckery~~~~"
2021-04-12 15:14:19,wallstreetbets,Short interest just jumped 50% to 73.82 million
2021-04-12 15:31:53,wallstreetbets,"Get fucked hedgies. They couldn't cover AGAIN. We held strong and bought more! 

Just wait til they get full share recalled tomorrow because they couldn't bring us down even to $100 lmao"

2021-04-12 19:14:51,wallstreetbets,I might jump back in depending on the morning
2021-04-12 15:20:08,wallstreetbets,I think we found someone who joined the last week of January and has no clue what this sub is.

2021-04-12 19:48:42,wallstreetbets,Are we supposed to shit 4 times a day?
2021-04-12 15:41:46,wallstreetbets,Did you not consider that IV is going to drop on investor day? I'm saying this as someone selling puts.
2021-04-12 18:00:35,wallstreetbets,"You are actually retarded. Its only traded publicly for ~6 months and has constant high volume, great liquidity and volatility especially intraday. Theres a reason so many people day trade it"

2021-04-12 16:15:36,wallstreetbets,i mean maybe for stuff expiring friday if theres no pop. but with earnings also around the corner IV should be building for the next couple weeks.

2021-04-12 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,"They have DC fast charging in a number of locations, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll add more. Electrify America doesn‚Äôt even bother with level 2 anymore (based on stations near me) so I speculate others will follow suit. I also paid to charge in at least a few locations using ChargePoint stations.

There‚Äôs some money to be made there for charging during weekly trips to plazas and grocery stores. Many of these ones cost money, some of which are overpriced imo, but ppl do it anyway. I think this is going to be a large part of the future, where gas stations will become more of a long-trip ordeal, and some miles will be obtained at parking lot electric stations, work, and home. Also, home charging solutions, where the standard outlet doesn‚Äôt quite cut it for many people, will be another component here.


Greed will prevent hydrogen from taking off, unfortunately :/ But that is a huge form of competition to worry about.

Many small top-offs of electricity will likely be a new norm. I know because I already experience it. Level 2 still has a life there, at least. Small numbers add up to big ones, and this is something that humans have a hard time seeing sometimes."

2021-04-12 14:17:28,wallstreetbets,True - GvK has its followers and audience. There is a conga line of great blockbusters that have been deferred and ready to bust out over the next 18-24 months.
2021-04-12 14:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Well you would have to watch it to know if it's a good movie or not, so this makes very little sense"
2021-04-12 14:18:42,wallstreetbets,Agree with #1 and #2 but to be fair - there is no comparison between AMC stock price and ticket price.

2021-04-12 14:22:06,wallstreetbets,u/Administrative-Tap93 respectfully disagree when all theaters in US are not yet open and those that are open are on strict capacity restrictions. The numbers globally with europe and Brazil closed down are even far more impressive. The Reading Cinemas (RDI) in New Zealand and Australia are quite full and doing well.

2021-04-12 14:24:04,wallstreetbets,u/isellgoodqualitygood Not all exhibition stocks are equal. WSB mods and rules don't allow posts highlighting small caps but there are a few that are quite compelling investments on re-opening trade.
2021-04-12 15:07:30,wallstreetbets,"I mean not really. A lot of people decide on seeing a movie (especially in theaters) based on word of mouth. I would've waited for a friend's review to see it if I didn't already have hbo max. About half a dozen people I know were on the fence about seeing it until I told them not to waste their time/money. So me seeing it led to 6 less ticket sales. Especially with it being in it's second week, I would say audience opinion is pretty important."
2021-04-12 14:20:01,wallstreetbets,agreed. but buying both for almost the same price gives me pleasure
2021-04-12 19:15:48,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs really grasping at straws.

2021-04-12 14:26:01,wallstreetbets,"u/ChefBoredAreWe Nope. Additionally, that $70MM is in the face of attendance cannibalization from GvK presently available for 'free' on HBO Max for the next two weeks."
2021-04-12 15:39:40,wallstreetbets,u/LegitCoder1 I certainly did. But it doesn't appear you have read the article and the cross linked article in it describing how GvK and its huge global box office has likely already exceeded breakeven and made Warner Bros (T) money on top of the growth of subscriber to HBO Max it has generated.

Due to a few different factors (it was 2008, the consumer market wasn't ready, the financial crisis, a couple of issues with accounting) the attempt failed but now he can draw from those mistakes and knock this one out of the park! The guy is always ahead of the curve, forward thinking and aims for the sky. Just what GameStop needs right now.

2021-04-12 13:57:20,wallstreetbets,He should be Head of Shareholder Relations.
2021-04-12 14:48:03,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, /u/DeepFuckingValue would be a better fit for some sort of VP of Community Outreach/Community Affairs role.

Back when he was first doxxed by the media, he did an interview and talked about donating money to his town for a running track (or something along those lines). That's just with his own personal money.

Imagine the community changes he could make on behalf of a multi-billion company that he arguably was a catalyst for....and that's assuming he'd even want to work. Being retired at ~35 isn't a hard sell."

2021-04-12 15:16:14,wallstreetbets,"There was a pretty big price spike seen when moment CEO news came out, was reading in post of u/Corno4825 that the spike was half million of volume in **2 minutes** right after the announcement, that's a rough **$69.000.000,00** in shares scooped up. 

>Okay. That was really interesting. That was over half a million trades in 2 minutes and the price shot up by $5+ . It was a VERY strange blip, and I have no idea what could have caused that.

>Alright, so this is very interesting. Gamestop announced right at 1:26 that it would be looking for a new CEO.

>**What I'm assuming happened was that someone with a lot of money waited for this to be announced so they can buy all those shares**. Seeing the stock price and volume bump would make people wonder what's going on. They would look for GME news and this would pop up.

The fact that the price was pushed down immediately is becoming a pattern here like on every other good news moment like earning report and Ryan Cohen chairman announcement there was immense downward pressure as well being pushed by most probably the short positions.

They think they are a store, just there to offer products to buy, but forget that their primary customer is the gaming community. I used to go to GameStop instead of Walmart because I can go talk about video games, and their staff were gamers too. 

In a market filled with online options for purchase, they definitely need to start reaching the community with local sponsors events.. like small esports competitions, and branch out to D&D and Magic groups, but of course their store front is not designed to handle such things as they only cared to rent out space for the shelving... Community is how Gamestop competes, because it was community that got us to shop there in the first place.

2021-04-12 17:33:04,wallstreetbets,"There are two types of retirement. Most people think of old people in Florida or Arizona golfing and attending potlucks. That‚Äôs type one. Type two retirement is where you don‚Äôt have to work for money, so you spend your time working on whatever you really want to work on as much as you want to work on it, and not have to worry about the money.

I have a friend that is type two retired. He is really passionate about giving opportunities to children with special needs, so he operates a non profit to teach kids how to sail and takes a $1 salary. He probably works 20 hours or so a week from April to October and then heads off to his house in Mexico for the winter where he just sips drinks on the beach all winter being type one retired.

He could probably make some money running the org if he needed it, but he just puts his efforts toward something that keeps him busy-ish that he really cares about."

I don‚Äôt know enough about DFV, but I do know that most big corporate CEOs can all retire any day they want to and live perfectly secure lives.

I guarantee you no one actually wants to get to $1 trillion in wealth more than Jeff Bezos, for example. The fact that it's realistic for him and the drive and ruthlessness to get to the point he's at now means he's that much more likely to get there, and he knows it."

2021-04-12 18:54:57,wallstreetbets,"You're right.  No business should ever try and put a foot in the door where a select few businesses already locked the market down.

Fuck that noise;  I'm ready to see where Gamestop goes now.  They are signaling hard that they are going to move towards exactly what the people are asking for, not profit-squeezing quarter-boosters that eventually steer the company into a landfill for several years straight.

If you want them to fail, that's ok I guess.  But I for one like watching a business completely change gears and try to actually do what customers want.  Otherwise, why should any company bother at all?  No company will ever bother trying if the response is ""nah fuck you, I still hope you fail."""
2021-04-12 19:03:50,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you understand the social aspect of what they're aiming to sell...

Coffeemakers and keurig machines didn't put coffee shops out of business.  In fact, starbucks in an extremely profitable business.  But why would *anyone* go to a Starbucks and buy overpriced coffee that isn't even premium when instead they can stay home and get their own coffee there?  Because it's a place to go, it's a smiling face selling it to them, it's a decent environment, it's got other people there, and it's on the way to wherever else they're going.  It may be selling something that people can get on their own for cheaper prices, but it's the service and the social aspect that draw people in and get them to spend.

So why would anyone go to a GameStop if they can buy their games online at home, and if the pc building is overpriced?  Because it's a place to go, it's aiming to be a gaming community center, it's friendly gamers behind the counter, it's a decent environment, it's aiming to showcase esports which many people can't actively go watch as a community, it aims to sell the pc building *experience* and not just the pc, and all of this builds up into something greater than ""where you go to buy a thing that's obsolete"".

I've never seen Amazon/Newegg/Ebay sell anyone a pc building experience.  That's worth something to plenty of people who haven't built a PC before but want to despite being too afraid to do it themselves.  And there's a lot of people like that.  Once you start bringing in people by providing great experiences, you gain lifelong customers.  It just doesn't matter, if the experience is great they would still consider it a bargain even if the physical product purchased costs more."
2021-04-12 19:29:05,wallstreetbets,"Amazon's search/browse functions are atrocious and them and ebay are so generalized that a company dedicated to gaming will be a more appealing destination. Newegg isn't much better, there are a lot of complaints about their customer service and return policies, and they don't have the infrastructure that Gamestop has."

2021-04-12 19:58:56,wallstreetbets,"That *was* their initial goal. To create negative sentiment by artificially dropping the price, and using media collaborators to say negative things about the company... this would *usually* lead to the company being unable to raise enough money to execute their growth plans, followed stock sell-offs by nervous investors, then eventually bankruptcy and de-listing. The problem is that this all backfired spectacularly. Now the most shorted stock on the market is also the most popular, and financially stable. It‚Äôs a short sellers nightmare scenario. Especially if they shorted it at $4 dollars, which I believe to be the case."
2021-04-12 18:42:07,wallstreetbets,"I mean, wasn‚Äôt it this very sub saying RC needs to be chairman to actually be effective, as the CEO just implements the chairman‚Äôs agenda? Comments like that are literally in this post."

Unfortunately, they aren't on the spectrum so they don't understand options and they don't care to try and learn.  They prefer to circle-jerk each other over gme, amc, and bb.

2021-04-12 17:32:13,wallstreetbets,GME and AMC isn't worth playing calls with unless you literally want to give money to MMs. Someone who bought and held when this was at 40 is going to make way more than someone who would get pennies to the dollar with the IV.

A million dollars is a lot of money to make all at one time, but for life savings I wouldn't really call it a lot of money.   Like, if I made a million on a single trade I'd be pretty happy, but I would not try to retire with a million dollars.

It's perfectly reasonable for someone who never makes a 6 figure salary to save a million dollars over the course of their lifetime. Max out your IRA contribution for 40 years, get a 6% return, and you're retiring with a million in your IRA.  It really isn't that much money."
2021-04-12 19:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but the context here is this guy is gambling a million+ on meme stocks, regardless of how much of a sure thing they are.

So I agree with you that when I retire I hope to have much more than that as in a few decades a million will be valued at even less. But assuming this guy is only investing what he can afford to lose and not a 50+ year old gambling his entire retirement savings, then my initial point stands that the saying ""mo money mo problems"" is incredibly ironic coming from a millionaire+"

2021-04-12 15:00:56,wallstreetbets,What are you on about? Intel invested 20 fucking billion in probably the most important industry for the coming decades
2021-04-12 15:18:31,wallstreetbets,Guess who bought intel at 68.
2021-04-12 15:09:48,wallstreetbets,It takes a lot to bring intel down and they all are trying lol
2021-04-12 19:12:10,wallstreetbets,Literally the most overvalued stock I've ever seen.
2021-04-12 17:23:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they stopped making processors and graphics cards about 6 months ago"
2021-04-12 16:25:54,wallstreetbets,"not really, tho"
2021-04-12 17:21:54,wallstreetbets,"Supply chains are fucked globally from covid. Couple that with high demand and it causes disruptions.

2021-04-12 18:37:50,wallstreetbets,"no sales.... lol you just arent wise to it yet.

gotta hit up a microcenter and harass the shit out the employees and stay late, buy a prebuilt for the same cost it is for a scalped 3080 and wait 2 months or spend 2500 and pick it up scapled.

&#x200B;

they are making shitloads of money"
2021-04-12 19:02:44,wallstreetbets,Nvidia is buying there own cards and reselling for triple the amount for 3x the profit. Duh. Dont need to make 3x the cards when you can charge 3x the price
2021-04-12 19:10:10,wallstreetbets,Guess that makes sense. Buy high sell low.

2021-04-12 16:46:21,wallstreetbets,"Your last sentence answered my question...  


Why wouldn't I just invest in both AMD and NVDA? Seems like they both are great choices"
2021-04-12 15:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but Apple has shown us that ARM can play in the general purpose computing space. Heck, every phone nowadays has shown us that. Chromebooks are much more popular now than they were 5 years ago.

x86 is fantastic right now because it's the fastest for sequential compute, and basically always has been. Nothing in existence can do what a CPU needs to do faster than an x86 CPU. But parallelization is becoming more and more a requirement in software nowadays, not just a nice to have. I don't believe ARM will ever beat x86 in terms of sequential compute without heterogeneous compute, but I think we are already reaching a point where sequential compute is already starting to be worried about less in the data center, and more just focused on compute density. And you see monster units like the Cerebras CS-1 really take that to the limit...

Really, the trend in the compute industry has always been heterogeneity. Multiply/divide/sqrt operations were even on a separate chip at one point. x86 is constantly adding instructions to keep up with this trend by adding more and more dedicated stuff, like what we see in AVX512. Now we have smart NICs to do some basic calculations on the network card before it even hits the CPU, graphics and ML offloaded to basically another whole computer in a box, Xilinx making some insane products that are real shit if you don't basically build your own silicon with their baseline, etc etc.

I'm not saying x86 is dead. It has its place. I just think that it's fighting to keep with its design paradigms, and the industry is growing with x86 not keeping up with the whole industry's growth."
2021-04-12 15:33:50,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure that would be called out as anti frand.
2021-04-12 16:02:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, their CUDA drivers are just always so far back from where the mainline kernels is releasing. I haven't checked in a while, but I was stuck on kernel 5.2 for the longest damn time because of them. It's just a pain to deal with them."
2021-04-12 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,"I realized in 2017 I could easily find my gpus purchases with the gains from NVDA. So long as they keep pushing forward, they'll be in my portfolio"
2021-04-12 19:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Nvidia primarily lives in the video card space, they have one primary competitor in that space, AMD.  For a brief period AMD stumbled in that space and Nvidia took a clear lead.  In that generation as soon as they realized this they jacked the prices of their top line cards up over 100%, a top line Titan ran you $2-3k when last generation it had topped out at around $1400.  AMD came back, immediately offered a card that cost $500 and performed as well as a $900 Nvidia card and Nvidia was forced to cut prices severely.  
  
Personally I won't support that sort of consumer price gouging, but you do you I guess, just hope Nvidia is never the clear winner again, because I don't like having to decide if I want to pay 3 months rent for a video card.  
  
Just capitalism things, ""informed consumers"" my ass."

2021-04-12 17:16:35,wallstreetbets,"my wife's son had better not fucking sell his inheritance, and just coast on margin withdrawals instead"
2021-04-12 15:49:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah not sure what that guy is saying. Intel has bad years almost like clockwork to avoid being a monopoly. They fall behind and magically pull out some shit they‚Äôve been sitting on.

This time might be different but Intel loves to pour infinite R&D money on when anyone catches up. AMD is also never building their own fabs again, and is 100% beholden to TSMC to get their chips made."
2021-04-12 17:21:08,wallstreetbets,"Amd literally murdered intel, it MURDERED it, stop taking drugs and come back to reality, intel it‚Äôs dead."
2021-04-12 19:20:57,wallstreetbets,"Oof, your AMD didn‚Äôt do so hot today. That doesn‚Äôt mean NVDA is overvalued lol. Price discovery is in progress. CPUs are a $100 billion market that NVDA is going to eat a big chunk of... they are growing and unstoppable in so many markets now and demand is only going to keep growing for the foreseeable future.

On the bright side, AMD should (hopefully) bounce off of $75 support. If it falls below $75, then hold on to your butts!"
2021-04-12 16:32:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes really. Dont let the downvotes fool you, these guys love  holding gme AMC and amd bags"
2021-04-12 17:16:59,wallstreetbets,They are at the moment. Both brilliant companies.
2021-04-12 17:19:31,wallstreetbets,"You rly should, just avoid intel, it‚Äôs a dead company."
2021-04-12 17:22:36,wallstreetbets,I mean they basically have an inverse relationship.
2021-04-12 15:16:09,wallstreetbets,"if you want to talk about paralel computing let's ditch cpus altogether and jump to GPUS.

AVX512 is a [power virus](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linus-Torvalds-On-AVX-512), and besides some very very very few edge cases, it's useless. Keep in mind I'm not saying [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD) (for the less tech oriented link) as a concept in itself is bad.

Also, if fast GPUS need to be fed data and told what to do, so i don't think x86 will be edged out.

As you mention it's fast for sequential computing, but to be fair, once you ""glue them together"" (thanks for the meme intel), it can be a brutal monster (see newest AMD server CPUs).

Altho at this point in time it doesn't really matter. Most things move towards either: fast general purpose or [ASICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit) (again for less tech orinented) .

ARM is good when you need to be LP.

&#x200B;

i think we agree on 90%"
2021-04-12 15:56:40,wallstreetbets,x86 is outdated isa and has to much legacy opcodes. ARM cpus have a significantly better isa with risc and are as a result are faster and more power efficient. The only reason we don't use arm in mainstream cpus is that most of the code in the world was written for x86.
2021-04-12 19:05:48,wallstreetbets,"At the end of the day it's the software stack, Nvidia is going nowhere in the desktop and enterprise space with this, you're talking about HPC and the cloud computing areas. I don't see the benefit to these companies such as Amazon or Microsoft buying the videos solution for their cloud, they already have or or are looking to create their own custom CPUs for some of their cloud infrastructure, But I really don't see the benefit here for Nvidia, it's a last gasp."
2021-04-12 16:53:24,wallstreetbets,what's anti frand?
2021-04-12 16:08:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean, they‚Äôre still on 5.4(in my build, we are a bit back on DGX OS), but they‚Äôre addressing A LOT of interoperability every time they upgrade. A year behind isn‚Äôt that awful in context of stability even if you don‚Äôt get the fanciest features.

If you‚Äôre in academia really poking this stuff I guess you have a point, but I want this stuff rock solid. Most driver firmware should safe harbor major versions for a while receiving fixes before it‚Äôs in my prod."
2021-04-12 18:09:45,wallstreetbets,Intel performed miles better the last 6 months
2021-04-12 19:52:51,wallstreetbets,"97% of the server market is Intel, and doing things the Nvidia chips cannot even do for the most part.  Nvidia is going to do like Apple, and that is to say they have been ""in the computer market"" for 30 years and STILL sit below 10% global laptop market share."
2021-04-12 18:00:40,wallstreetbets,Are u retarded?
2021-04-12 17:59:23,wallstreetbets,"Intel still is relavent since they have their own Fabs so they're not fighting for waffers.

Remember when TSM went on sale since they lost their chinese business, which was near half of their capacity and now they still fully booked?"
2021-04-12 19:26:10,wallstreetbets,It's really not.
2021-04-12 18:32:44,wallstreetbets,AMD is furiously dominating the CPU market right now. Even if their new graphics cards sold 0 copies (which in this economy the fuck they aren't) they would still be doing great as a company
2021-04-12 15:24:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, frankly I hate AVX512 because it's worthless to me. It's a waste of silicon for all I care about. And I'm not talking about anything that would matter in the quarterly timescale that everyone cares about here, heck the fasmath processors I alluded to earlier were 30 some years ago now. I'm excited for lots of new products, and I just think that ARM and RISC-V can take more market than they currently have. I still use x86 for nearly everything, I plan on continuing to do so because you just can't get better compute, but I want a tech geek world where I can keep up to date with a lot more than just 2 processor vendors."
2021-04-12 16:13:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's the door that I'm saying Apple is pushing open. Once software support for ARM that isn't just based around the android or ios hooks is more targeted by developers I'll be happy. I've been trying to snag an ARM server for a while, one of the old qualcomm ones or a first gen ThunderX system just because I think it will be cool, but damn are systems like that rare to find on Ebay. Maybe I'll bring Grace home one day, maybe when she's old and less loved than before, but she'll have a place in my heart if software support is at least somewhat there.

At least ARM has somewhat of an ecosystem, remember MIPS? There are MIPS servers you can find for super cheap out there. I don't think anyone wants to get anywhere near those. Not even I do."
2021-04-12 16:17:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm a hobbyist that is stuck with a normal job where we have to do things like develop for RHEL 6 machines. I have kernel 3.10.0 in front of my face right now. Screw this whole stability thing, I want cool stuff now."
2021-04-12 19:59:50,wallstreetbets,"Nvidia is going into AI, data centers, self driving cars, on top of their existing markets... what are you talking about? They are confident the ARM deal is going through and they are going to have Nvidia branded ARM chips. I assume you did not review what was announced today."
2021-04-12 19:02:22,wallstreetbets,This guys retarded
2021-04-12 19:02:18,wallstreetbets,"And yet their stock price has been in a downward trend for over 3 months...

I‚Äôm not shitting on AMD... so you can stop with the fanboi nonsense.

While on a fundamental level stock price should reflect investor confidence in a company to generate revenue. In the current climate you have to be pretty dense to lean on that as the only factor."
2021-04-12 17:04:09,wallstreetbets,"This sounds quite tech intensive -  I just want to clarify a bit:

NVidia plans to use ARM Servers to solve highly specialized resource intensive AI problems, but you hope this will open the door to a broader range of applications in the future. Is that summarized correctly?"
2021-04-12 16:22:57,wallstreetbets,"I want to have 40+ hour multi-DGX jobs that feed the products that pay my bills run correctly. Nothing against hobbyists, but I hate to say you‚Äôre not the main audience.

It‚Äôs a good argument for an upstream branch."
2021-04-12 17:06:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes. ARM is lacking in software support for more than phones. Apple has been changing that a little, and hopefully Nvidia can help accelerate that in the server world."
2021-04-12 16:37:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I know I'm not an audience that is even a blip on the radar. I'm hoping I can get a project up and running that'll get me an actual budget on its own so I can tinker with cooler stuff, and at that point yeah stability will matter more. But for the time being I'm just gonna be minorly irked by not being able to use my old rolling release system to do my fun projects on."
2021-04-12 19:07:46,wallstreetbets,"Nv's only avenue with this is cloud computing / HPC. Arm is never breaking into the desktop and enterprise market for at least another 20 years if that. Apple is Apple, even their m1 computers are having tons of issues from a compatibility and performance perspective."
2021-04-12 17:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bud, much appreciated infos you shared there!"
2021-04-12 13:25:01,wallstreetbets,good luck to you Brother
2021-04-12 13:58:00,wallstreetbets,"This is really silly drop. It has been known for years, NVIDIA is buying ARM to build CPU for the data center. At the same time, NVIDIA has no choice to build CPU to compete with other upcoming players like Intel. 

Only thing special about their CPU is that it has NVLink, something even IBM does not even want to support for their next generation of Power processor. Otherwise, this CPU is generic ARM server processor that was announced a week ago."

2021-04-12 13:41:00,wallstreetbets,that's a great idea !! i'll start looking into it right away - just need a bit of reversal i say to help out w premium...
2021-04-12 16:56:44,wallstreetbets,i say take your profits or at least decide on min you want to take and set stop limit (a bit harder on options due to spreads) especially if expiration is close; but i can't tell you how many times i'v given up considerable gains b/c i did not take 'em when things were going my way and not just given up gains but had my options expire worthless or deep in red after much green - take profits early and don't regret or kick yourself if next day it's more than what you have taken - it's a profit!!

2021-04-12 13:47:22,wallstreetbets,that's exactly what i was saying about $BB this morning :))... i have lots of shares - they had news out CAN gobment selected their services n still goes down...
2021-04-12 17:00:20,wallstreetbets,"30 80.5c expiring april 16 at 1.25 each, which is $3750 in premium

At the end of April 16th if AMD is at

$80.50 or below: he loses everything

$81.75: he makes nothing

$83.00: he doubles his money


Generally you don't hold options until expiration, but this is the second easiest way to say it, anything more advanced you'll need google, the greeks, and a calculator"
2021-04-12 16:48:18,wallstreetbets,"well these are options and moreover - weeklies - so totally different ball game than shares or LEAPS; so many variables at this point most importantly theta (time decay) is against me hard on this one; i paid $1.25 per contract (so 30\*$125 = $3750) when underlying SP was around $80.25 - my strike is $80.50 which means SP has to get to at least $81.75 (strike $80.50 + $1.25 premium = $81.75) to get to ITM; anything above that will start accruing as intrinsic value BUT that's not going to be enough as the premium i paid also included extrinsic value so what i really need for SP to do is to reverse from downtrend and start moving toward and reach strike price ASAP before expiration which is this Friday and b/c time is against me, time decay will start eating at the extrinsic value really fast here; so i was looking to actually start making money on these close to EOD w SP reversal and maybe hold a bit tomorrow and sell sometime tomorrow but looks like variables are against me - at close same contract was going for .67 so down close to 50% on the option thing - but i knew what i was doing - YOLO is a YOLO so can't bitch :) will see what extended hours and tomorrow morning will bring hope this helps..."

2021-04-12 14:47:03,wallstreetbets,So that is something that I gave a hard thought about. So this was my conclusion with the amount of cash that I had available I decided to go for AMC due to I was able to buy more shares  of AMC than GME that at the time I made the buy of the share GME price was in the 200‚Äôs and don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm not the type of person that just see the one stock I support everyone that is on GME as well as AMC we are in on both for the same cause.
2021-04-12 15:02:11,wallstreetbets,I was very sad when I heard the news that James Allison stepped down he has pushed the team in a good direction I hope the new guy is at par with him
2021-04-12 14:55:04,wallstreetbets,You a sir ü¶ç sir üòé
2021-04-12 14:55:47,wallstreetbets,And the way it is.....
2021-04-12 14:52:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah I copy that from him lol üòÇ I‚Äôm a big F1 fan since I was a child
2021-04-12 14:53:58,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt sell I just buy AMC 10,008.01 üíéüôåüèª"
2021-04-12 13:37:03,wallstreetbets,buy u bish
2021-04-12 14:22:58,wallstreetbets,Its close to its support. Its going to burst ‚¨ÜÔ∏è soon
2021-04-12 14:38:12,wallstreetbets,Literally the same. Sold to buy gme. May dip my toes back in though if it drops a bit more.
2021-04-12 16:34:48,wallstreetbets,You sir are a clownüòÇ
2021-04-12 18:30:09,wallstreetbets,Completely agree
2021-04-12 18:44:28,wallstreetbets,When I get some large cash flow (in the works) I might will
2021-04-12 14:54:29,wallstreetbets,Yes !!! You got it
2021-04-12 18:10:51,wallstreetbets,What I‚Äôm personally looking forward to watch is mortal kombat and top gun maverick. But that‚Äôs just me
2021-04-12 15:28:14,wallstreetbets,Do we have any idea as to how many days to cover shorts have? Or any kinda time frame of the AMC thing to do its thing?
2021-04-12 16:20:27,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre smart
2021-04-12 17:37:21,wallstreetbets,They won't even vote on that til May
2021-04-12 17:03:59,wallstreetbets,You obviously did not watch the CEO interviews. He will absolutely not release all those shares at once if/when they decide they need them. He is deeply indebted to what the WSB crowd has done for his company. üçåü¶çüöÄ
2021-04-12 14:58:53,wallstreetbets,No need to talk shit about AMC because you bought at the peak of GME bro..
2021-04-12 18:54:31,wallstreetbets,If GME turns things around their stock might be worth 20 bucks.
2021-04-12 15:52:05,wallstreetbets,"GME's been vastly overvalued since the 2 squeezes happened.

AMC at least has potential to grow organically once the pandemic is over since it's undervalued relative to where it was at pre-pandemic. Regardless of a squeeze, it's at least going somewhere upwards.

You're dreaming if you think GME's not going to be all red until it's back to where it needs to be. Thankfully GME's been making me loads of $ off of puts."
2021-04-12 14:53:05,wallstreetbets,"Ok i ve understood, it has been a choice about quantity. I‚Äôm in GME and AMC hoping for the best"
2021-04-12 15:02:45,wallstreetbets,share price is irrelevant.  A 100% gain affects a $10 per share stock exactly the same way as it would a $200 a share stock...
2021-04-12 15:06:49,wallstreetbets,Oh man you fell for the lower cost share fallacy
2021-04-12 14:48:57,wallstreetbets,Yea whatever..m to the moon. I heard that bullshit every week for the last 12 weeks... it's going nowhere ape
2021-04-12 17:15:39,wallstreetbets,"No he is not, AMC is like GMEs retarded little cousin. only reason why amc is doing what its doing is because of GME mooning and the shorts playing both. Fundelmentylly  AMC is worst in all cases, jesus christ dude, do some research. get on the right side of history"
2021-04-12 16:12:37,wallstreetbets,"No clue, one morning I am rich the next I am not. At this point I have desensitized myself to the shifts. If it's green its green, if it's red its red,"
2021-04-12 17:33:49,wallstreetbets,Shorts don't have to cover until they can't afford to pay the interest on the borrowed shares
2021-04-12 18:03:48,wallstreetbets,"no, AMC is already heavily diluted.

Dec 2020 100 million shares withstanding

Mar 2021 450 million shares withstanding

AMC already had massive amounts of shares dumped on you guys and they're planning to dump more. GME is a better bet.

2021-04-12 18:50:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure this guy-in-suit will feel terribly indebted to the WSB crowd after he's diluted the shit out of his company, paid himself a big-ass bonus and he's sipping his mojito on his new $30M yacht. He might even give WSB a few seconds of his thoughts!"
2021-04-12 15:22:36,wallstreetbets,There aren‚Äôt really many bullish signs for AMC short term or long term.  The squeeze has been vastly diluted
2021-04-12 15:02:25,wallstreetbets,"AMC has been good to me. Made a few hundred in the initial run up and another hundred putting in like 2w ago. 

Small stuff but profit is profit."
2021-04-12 16:45:52,wallstreetbets,"lockdown started in March. first US covid cases were in January. so going back before then, December of 2019, the price of AMC was $7.

https://i.imgur.com/HFT7W2E.png

the number of outstanding shares then was 100 million, making the market cap $700 million.

outstanding shares history here: https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding

the current number of outstanding shares is 450 million. at $8.55, the current market cap is $4 billion. so the current market cap is 5-6 times higher than pre-pandemic. not undervalued"

2021-04-12 17:01:27,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know why there is so much hate about it I don‚Äôt have any discrimination about who buys what for all the GME gang you guys are legends and you have all my support and the same for the AMC gang why can‚Äôt we just get along üòî.... it is the same goal in pursue to fuck some hegies and get some tendies AMC was my choice so be cool guys....
2021-04-12 14:59:55,wallstreetbets,Was your movie theater open? What revenue will they accumulate if no services are being provided at the moment
2021-04-12 17:24:03,wallstreetbets,I think you might be the retarded one dude. AMC is in for a big squeeze
2021-04-12 19:06:20,wallstreetbets,"random, but i wonder what trading's like for color-blind tards"
2021-04-12 18:13:17,wallstreetbets,"Which might be never, correct?"
2021-04-12 19:12:31,wallstreetbets,"If that is 4 times diluted, our AMC shares should worth 1/4, isn't it?"
2021-04-12 18:12:19,wallstreetbets,"Gme is severely overvalued stop trying to push this dying stock 

There is a difference between a sharp drop and recovery vs the arc decline that has been happening the past month"

2021-04-12 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,"Theres no hate, and I'm not telling you to sell or anything... Just saying specifically looking at share price to decide to buy a stock is not the way.

Owning 10 shares of a $100 stock or owning 100 shares of a $10 stock is the same thing- $1000 in either stock. When it goes up 5%, its $50 either way."

2021-04-12 18:04:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but you can't sell contracts with 10 shares..."

2021-04-12 18:56:47,wallstreetbets,"How about you guys find some evidence that GME is going to the moon? Literally all your ""DD"" is meme bullshit that is ACTUALLY retarded.

I dont think anything crazy is going to happen with AMC either.

2021-04-12 17:57:49,wallstreetbets,ok can you provide some evidence to support that claim then? i see 10.95% on yahoo finance and marketbeat. there are 400 million shares available in the float. retail owns about 80% of float. what's the case for a big squeeze? i'm all ears

Retail sales data comes out Thursday and it will be better than ""expected"" Or a ""surprise"" imo.. This should help both stocks but ASO is in an uptrend so it may take the news better if it it is not as good as I think it will be. It is like WSB has become GSB .. I think that hurts a lot of people. All good to bet on stuff but being married to one bet.. I dunno. I prefer to bet a bunch in order to come out a winner... not just bet one thing and hope. This is just another retard opinion. Puts and Calls are bets!  The puts on GME last week were 4-1 and that is why I cashed mine.. lopsided usually means the move is short lived. So I hope I'm right and GME rally's back to $160-$170 range."
2021-04-12 19:01:41,wallstreetbets,Exactly.. This is no longer WSB .. it is GSB and sadly that is not good. Getting married to one stock is not a great betting strategy. If you bet the same horse every time you don't always win.  You have to find the best horse each week or each month to make the right bet imo.

GME is not a trend. There are 2 main opinions:
1) there are 150%+ of shares in circulation (caused by shorts, not necessarily only one big HF to fuck, may be a systemic thing, also a lot of FTD). Sooner or later they have to be bought, squeeze or not it's a big buying pressure.

2) transformation (more long term) successfully changing from brick and mortar retail to e-commerce would change the view on the company. E.g. e-commerce are often valued based on price/sales. With current sales that would be around 1000$ / share 

I believe in a mix of both.

2021-04-12 18:59:50,wallstreetbets,150% of shares? I think you may be getting some misinformation. Lots of stocks show over 100% institutional ownership.  It's a misprint.  How the F would anyone trade the stock during the day if a few funds own it all?
2021-04-12 19:58:22,wallstreetbets,Please list the others with ownership over 100%.  I searched every highly shorted small cap I could find and found 2 other that were listed at over 100% as of 12/31/20 (one was lgnd and I can't remember the other). Bloomberg terminals with more recent updates are actually showing an increase in institutional ownership for GME since January.

2021-04-12 16:13:19,wallstreetbets,"**ASO looking fine as fuck.**

Strong buy pressure at the beginning of the day and sustained throughout the day WHILE the rest of the market dipped or ended up sideways. Volume coming in still shy of 3.4M but we gained and retained nearly 5% up on the day into close.

**On the 1 month 4 hr -**

MACD just crossed over to bullish.

RSI still within neutral territory

OBV trending up

TTM Squeeze indicator about to reverse

OI on 4/16 35c just a tad over 14k  
OI on 4/16 40c almost 12k

Tomorrow may dip a little or stay pretty flat, but idk. If it's a green day overall, this may continue to climb.

Potential positive catalyst incoming mid week? Shit could explode."
2021-04-12 16:32:33,wallstreetbets,"I think more of a catalyst is the fact that the 3/31 (settlement) short interest report was just posted on NASDAQ. Total short interest went from 12.5M as of mid-March to 13.4M on 3/31. I know we don't like to talk about short squeezes as much because it's a bit naive, but paired with the gamma squeeze for 4/16 if we creep up to 35 there could be a real event.

Thought after earnings we'd see a reduction in short interest, but they've doubled down. Now i'm starting to think that the company moved their earnings to the day before lockout was to prevent the shorts from getting off easy. Boost the price, shrug off the lockout expiration sell-off the next day, and the share price marches.

The price on the 31st was around $27. My gut tells me that some of the shorts covered (for a loss) on April 8th with that massive volume day and the weird news about JPM block sale. Either way, now ASO has bounced all the way back, and I'm hopeful that it really takes off from here. The P/E is still laughably low at 33 bucks a share."
2021-04-12 15:18:27,wallstreetbets,I think at this current point ASO is the strongest potential in my portfolio and yes I own GME but I think its a long haul.   This could boom much sooner I feel

2021-04-12 13:01:01,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. I like the stock because of the fundamentals, high short interest and high call OI. Lots of calls expire this Friday.  I chose 5/21 calls because if there is gonna be a gamma squeeze, it probably won't hit til next Monday or Tues since MM have 2 days to buy shares to cover contracts.

2021-04-12 13:15:37,wallstreetbets,"Just as a small note, a MM doesn't wait to buy shares to deliver on contracts ITM. They hedge by staying delta neutral, as in while the delta of a call gets closer to 1, they buy shares a long the way to cover.

For me it depends on what expiry date I‚Äôm going for. If I‚Äôm playing with near dated expiries, I favor ITM calls even when I‚Äôm extremely confident in an OTM price target, because sometimes the market just takes way too long to catch up."

2021-04-12 15:30:12,wallstreetbets,Same. I'm learning some dangerous lessons here
2021-04-12 18:43:14,wallstreetbets,8.3 is just pretty good? Simply HAVING a p/e ratio is a big deal for a stock on this sub.
2021-04-12 13:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Right. But $35, 40 & 45 calls are still otm. Are they hedged? It looked like the price could shoot up that high with the dd mentioned here. Wouldn't that cause a rapid need to buy shares to cover those calls? AKA, a gamma squeeze?"
2021-04-12 13:04:23,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a smart move!
2021-04-12 18:50:36,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-04-12 15:34:05,wallstreetbets,Expensive lesson but sometimes we gotta learn from expensive mistakes. Wish you the best and hope we can get some profit!
2021-04-12 13:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Yup. I'm not disagreeing with that, but if the price sharply increases say Wednesday or Thursday following the investor conference, they're not going to be waiting to buy shares. They'll be buying shares as the price increases. I'm pretty sure this just happens programmatically, so it's not like there is a person who says ""we should start buying shares now.""

This, combined with the organic price pressure of the market, is what creates the gamma squeeze. Considering how much OI there is at 35 and 40, sustained buying pressure in a short period of time would probably launch this, especially considering the low float and regularly low volume that moves the price.

For instance, ASO had strong buy pressure at the start of the day and has sustained so far against the broader market being slightly down. I think this is bullish AF that it's moving against the market right now while mostly everything else is red. Imagine what it would look like on a overall green day + with a positive catalyst in terms of just buy pressure? Couple that with the OI on calls and boom. Massive gamma squeeze.

edit: To answer ""Are they hedged?""

Assumptions would say that to be delta neutral, the calls are hedged by as much as the current delta.

35 calls at 0.23 delta = 23 shares per 35 call currently hedged.40 calls at 0.10 delta = 10 shares per 40 call currently hedged.

So there is room for the big boom if the price increases rapidly and the gamma starts increasing, reflecting in the delta becoming closer to 1.

Looking at today, if this keeps up before or into Wednesday, could absolutely explode."

2021-04-12 17:07:47,wallstreetbets,Me and my partner were just talking about moviepass! Truly a commendable way to see how quickly they could shovel VC cash into the furnace. I think we saw 15 movies each in a month for $20 total lol.
2021-04-12 17:32:00,wallstreetbets,Yo I went to a film school and everyone was like ‚Äúhow the fuck does this exist‚Äù shit was insanely popular mf‚Äôs seeing movies constantly for free
2021-04-12 19:06:18,wallstreetbets,What a summer movie pass provided. Saw a movie every day for a couple weeks straight at one point.
2021-04-12 15:05:28,wallstreetbets,"Drugs are a very profitable business. All drugs should be legal IMO. If someone wants to poison themselves with the booger sugar or other things, then they should be allowed to do so. But when it comes to businesses like uber whose job is dependent on being DOT compliant, then that shit is a crazy thing to manage."
2021-04-12 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,That's because the dope is bought on the black market in most of the country right now. The margins get a lot smaller when it becomes federally legal
2021-04-12 14:13:24,wallstreetbets,Not correct. Eaze is still a massive weed company in California.
2021-04-12 18:48:46,wallstreetbets,Not my opinion but it‚Äôs DOT that sets those things. I‚Äôm a libertarian on personal choices for the most part. Just keep my taxes low and we straight like a chicken wing. Ya feel me?
2021-04-12 19:27:28,wallstreetbets,Door dash is such a shit company

2021-04-12 18:21:51,wallstreetbets,They claim they made 1000$ in cash tips when reporting their taxes. Easy peasy. Obviously if you put an unrealistic amount they might begin to ask questions I would imagine
2021-04-12 16:53:00,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt do it and I didn‚Äôt really question how it works. I just know it‚Äôs a thing. Probably easy to do in smaller towns or late at night
2021-04-12 19:42:52,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the driver who reports a cash tip while filing taxes.

2021-04-12 15:57:08,wallstreetbets,Well they're not just gonna randomly offer you need to say something that makes you seem like you do drugs lol.

2021-04-12 19:22:54,wallstreetbets,"Honestly though if the theater was empty, it's still filling seats. And movie theaters make most of money in concessions anyways. The way HBO is handling things I think this is the only way for the movie industry to come back."
2021-04-12 18:49:46,wallstreetbets,Governments already make money from illegal drugs. Why would they legalize it so businesses can make money from them too.

2021-04-12 17:59:14,wallstreetbets,All drugs should be decriminalized. Not all drugs should be legal.
2021-04-12 17:26:08,wallstreetbets,All the more reason to hurry the fuck up then.
2021-04-12 14:18:52,wallstreetbets,Federal law trumps state law. I doubt they would risk interstate commerce with a known controlled substance. DOT would not take well to it. It should be legal IMO.
2021-04-12 18:51:40,wallstreetbets,"I feel you but my point is if any company is going to just do it and force the government to come at them and deal with it in court, it‚Äôs gonna be Uber."

2021-04-12 19:26:33,wallstreetbets,No.
2021-04-12 17:54:37,wallstreetbets,"Hence why they probably shouldn't want to be liable for stoners delivering to stoners. 

Also, growers would love to skip the retailer and send out their products via Uber, I promise. Lol"
2021-04-12 15:47:16,wallstreetbets,people who smoke weed usually dont plan far ahead and are sometimes/often lazy \^\^.

2021-04-12 19:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it was great for theaters, it was MoviePass that got raked over the coals lol. The only way it works imo is if the studios are willing to seriously lower their ticket prices for the app users because otherwise the app will just go broke again. I could see platforms like Netflix agreeing to this just to get their bigger productions in theaters at all, but there‚Äôs no way the big movie production companies are going budge. If they‚Äôre willing to play hardball and not release for months, eventually people are just going to give in and start going back to theater."
2021-04-12 19:20:02,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre right. My thing is personal freedom and supply and demand.
2021-04-12 16:07:08,wallstreetbets,So true.
2021-04-12 18:20:27,wallstreetbets,Fuck it let‚Äôs legalize adult drug usage of all kinds. What you eat don‚Äôt make me shit.
2021-04-12 15:44:43,wallstreetbets,This is correct. They would also lose all FDIC insurance and not be able to bank virtually anywhere if a portion of their revenue is marijuana related.
2021-04-12 19:19:17,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs going to be interesting if they do it.
2021-04-12 19:29:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean yeah, but I was talking about the stock fundamentals more than anything"
2021-04-12 18:50:39,wallstreetbets,Oh your talking about growers.Maybe jimmy your friendly neighborhood grower but real growers don‚Äôt care about selling grams or ounces especially if Uber is taking a cut and that‚Äôs how much you could drive around with legally so

2021-04-12 19:51:07,wallstreetbets,"On the plus side, your blow by blow description of money losing bright ideas, did make me chuckle. Honestly though - you are down less then 9K. You will make it all back and then some in less than 6 months if you are patient enough to hold on."

2021-04-12 14:05:27,wallstreetbets,"I only played with money I could afford to lose. Mostly a handful of shares, here and there, to see what would happen. ASO and VIAC were meant to curb the bleeding a bit, and they did for a few days, but I don't think anything can stop the runaway train that is GME. Still sucks to lose, though."
2021-04-12 13:24:48,wallstreetbets,"A hedge or hedgerow is a line of closely spaced shrubs and sometimes trees, planted and trained to form a barrier or to mark the boundary of an area, such as between neighbouring properties. Hedges used to separate a road from adjoining fields or one field from another, and of sufficient age to incorporate larger trees, are known as hedgerows. Often they serve as windbreaks to improve conditions for the adjacent crops, as in bocage country. When clipped and maintained, hedges are also a simple form of topiary.


*The word ""hedge"", meaning a line of bushes around the perimeter of a field, has long been used as a metaphor for placing limits on risk*"

The stock is still being shorted into oblivion and has not been covered. Every time they do a shady sell and the price drops, retail buys it up in a second. The new rules are slowly being rolled out.

People are programmed to attempt to appease the group constantly. They live for the rush of validation and dopamine when the up votes start ticking.This shit becomes such a powerful feedback loop that they really have no grasp on reality at all. It's socially retarded in an entirely unique way. This is an example of people who lack critical self awareness. They don't know how to differentiate internet humor from real life humor.  Its tragic. They're virtually lobotomized. Genuine NPCs.

2021-04-12 15:12:31,wallstreetbets,some of us have diamond hands and will grow out of this once we are rich or broke. This guy's got diamond balls cause this is going to be on him forever.
2021-04-12 15:12:40,wallstreetbets,"This is such a bad tattoo to get. Getting a tat of trends is a bad idea, it's like getting a tat of ""they did surgery on a grape"""
2021-04-12 15:13:00,wallstreetbets,You magnificent bastard
2021-04-12 15:13:14,wallstreetbets,I like how subtle this tattoo is.

2021-04-12 15:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Y'know, it's not something I'd put on my own body, but the art is beautifully done and whether or not you know what it means it's cool as hell.

10/10 would buy you a beer if I ran into you"
2021-04-12 15:15:55,wallstreetbets,"The tattoo version of ""I like the stock!"""
2021-04-12 15:16:19,wallstreetbets,"It was awesome until I noticed the dude with a mask on. Why, just why?"
2021-04-12 15:16:20,wallstreetbets,"At least it doesn't totally look like shit, actually pretty good. 

But yes, very retarded."

Secondly, mocked up/curated the design myself on photoshop with help from amyart and got a.j.tattoos to do the tattoo on me.

2021-04-12 13:45:31,wallstreetbets,This is definitively the correct interpretation.

2021-04-12 15:40:40,wallstreetbets,"Exactly - after this thing is over, this tattoo actually represents so much.  It's the year of the bull, WSB went viral,  we're still in the pandemic with a mask mandate, and shorts are fucked."
2021-04-12 14:58:48,wallstreetbets,Or covid.

2021-04-12 13:25:33,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I was wondering too.. never forget the time we wore make shift masks to protect us from this deadly virus. At least we made bank on stonks tho ü§ë
2021-04-12 13:28:41,wallstreetbets,That's my favorite part.  Really captures the current time we're in.

2021-04-12 14:33:56,wallstreetbets,"I knew a guy who got a big marvin the martian tat on his calf and regretted it majorly about 5 years later....when he was about 18.

Yes you read that right. I believe they had to get a waiver or maybe the dad did the tat (its been a while) but in middle school two brothers got matching looneytoons tats on their calves. Marvin and maybe Bugs? A lot of us fellow 13 year olds thought they were cool."
2021-04-12 15:49:34,wallstreetbets,Would you say they have no ragrets?
2021-04-12 17:48:36,wallstreetbets,Can can firm. Have tribal-hate tribal. Gotta love 1996

2021-04-12 14:38:36,wallstreetbets,Ohh it could have been SOOO much worse.
2021-04-12 15:15:10,wallstreetbets,This is my new life motto.
2021-04-12 15:21:46,wallstreetbets,"(eta: ""you"" doesn't necessarily mean **you** here, I just wrote it second-person.) Depends on the tat, right? I mean, if your 'dumb tat' was a face tattoo, or a visible swastika (in the west)... You could make only good choices from there on but still face some really tough consequences of that one big regret. And you could overcome them, of course, but the constant struggle to fight your own facade would probably limit your total overall happiness, unless you were lucky enough to find Zen somewhere along the way.

But that doesn't mean you're sentiment is flawed, I'm just being a brat. For most cases, you're totally right."
2021-04-12 15:34:00,wallstreetbets,That's how I justify life insurance. If the worst case is that I wasted my money because I didn't *die*... oh no.
2021-04-12 18:41:19,wallstreetbets,If you get that thought tattooed on your face you should be safe then.
2021-04-12 13:40:21,wallstreetbets,"That's what I thought. 69 years from now when his body is replaced by robotics and his skin becomes a tapestry on the wall in the basement, the grandkids will ask about the mask, the diamonds, why does he have a bear and a bull for friends, etc.

Then they'll ask who that guy is on the foreskin and he'll say ""oh that... that was Vlad, a Bulgarian boy who fucked everyone over, so I thought the placement made sense.""

Edit: the grandkids are in their 30's at this point."
2021-04-12 14:12:59,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the story? I did it for karma?
2021-04-12 14:42:26,wallstreetbets,"What's the story dude? One time in my thirties I watched charts for a month in a dark cave while browsing autistic memes on reddit and posting ""ape stronk"" and rocketship emojis as my main form of social interaction all so I could make $1000 from a meme stock?

Should we just shut down the whole country/planet because someone could possibly infect you via a sneeze?

Or if you were at high risk of getting lung cancer from smoking one cigarette at 65.

Sorry bud, they aren‚Äôt. Some 300,000 more people died than what was expected for 2020, which means there was something that caused hundreds of thousands more deaths than we expected. 

> I guess one good thing about covid is it completely got rid of the flu.

Gee, I wonder what might have caused a virus that transfers through sick patients to not spread so easily this year... could it be that we don‚Äôt have millions of office workers huddled in sick masses spreading viruses to one another in close quarters? The lack of mass gathering that would normally permeate the virus to large amounts of people? What about the millions of school children who weren‚Äôt in school for a while? Maybe something to do with hundreds of millions of people wearing masks, a custom that has kept the spread of the flu in many Asian countries extremely low when compared to our usually terrible flu rates?

Oh man, you totally got me there! I‚Äôm sure epidemiologists just totally forgot to log in a couple of digits as part of their mass conspiracy to lie about... flu deaths.

2021-04-12 17:19:56,wallstreetbets,"Canadian here.
Be wary of weed stocks. When we went through legalization, money flowed and these companies treated their staff like gold giving them wheelbarrows full of money and perks.
But, it took some time for prices to level out and people to come around to paying a little more per gram than off their buddy they were buying from for years.
Our largest company dissolved and lost a lot of people a lot of money.

You'll probably see a boost in your stocks, but don't cling on too long. Give it a couple of years."

2021-04-12 16:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Outdoor quality is garbage. It actually takes skill to make high quality weed. I know its a plant and it shouldnt matter, but the quality difference is huge.

Plus the larger companies are getting their hands in multiple markets: food, health, recreation, etc."
2021-04-12 15:11:21,wallstreetbets,"The book is: ""You can't grow quality weed outdoors."" Too much random pollen floating around; buds go to seed, sell as biomass.

2021-04-12 14:49:38,wallstreetbets,"Distribution. How weed is primarily grown vs corn. Subsidies. Company relationships. Looking at other countries who needed to import during high demand (this happens with produce in America A LOT).

You‚Äôre also assuming there isn‚Äôt weed grown in the US at scale already. There are several states where it is not legal, yet is already the top cash crop."
2021-04-12 17:38:06,wallstreetbets,"Apart from the outdoor/indoor argument, its a totally different skill set.  Growing cannabis is is horticulture, not agriculture.  

Also, cultivation is only one part of the supply chain and I think raw flower has limited upside.  IMO, as the industry grows, processed goods (edibles, vapes, tinctures, etc) will drastically outpace raw flower and pre-rolls."

2021-04-12 19:55:41,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been telling people that publicly traded cannabis companies have capped upside. I‚Äôve been growing for 5 years and it‚Äôs so ridiculously cheap to grow your own. Plus there are street dealers who are walking dispensary‚Äôs that have 10-15 strains/edibles/cartridges at any point in time that are all solid. They sell it for half the price of the dispensary‚Äôs. Plus there are MASSIVE privately owned companies that are in the game as well. People who think it‚Äôs the second coming of Phillip Morris or cigarettes is going to be highly disappointed. I hope people are able to make some cash on the stocks but I feel like most people will get burned on them. I‚Äôm a total idiot though and at the end of the day I will probably be wrong.

It is actually very low on their priority list. You will literally have zero problems flying state to state if both states are legal and you are within the legal amounts in both states. You fly from a legal state to a prohibited state you will still get through, just at your own risk once you land. Try to fly from a prohibited state to a legal state and TSA will likely (but not always) stop you and inform local PD.

2021-04-12 17:24:32,wallstreetbets,"But wait, what about The Twenty-first Amendment?  


IMO - I do think that forcing the adoption of restrictions on states for funding is a bit over-reaching. Maybe it's a waste of resources to research and develop restrictions before allocating funding to a state that really needs it? Maybe focus the time/energy resources on simply building/improving the shit as needed to meet the demands of population growth in some area?   


We could be inventing solar roads with Tesla or something and testing that shit while building these highways, but instead we're wasting money on developing a useless age limit that doesn't work. I grew up in a State that has had a 21 age restriction for alcohol since long before I was swimming around in the ol' mans sac. A large amount of people within that State, far younger than 21, drank. All of the time.   


Also, I've experienced the drug market in one of the most drug restrictive, most Communist countries in the world, China. If I can get a good high there, you can get a good high anywhere. Prohibition just changes the marketplace and makes it tax free. ;)  


Idk. I don't really drink myself, simply a 420 guy who's been high since before medicinal was even a term. I don't think any government should be involved in prohibition. It didn't work back then, and it won't based on some age limit now."

‚ÄúPresident Ronald Reagan on July 17, 1984. The act would punish any state that allowed persons under 21 years to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing its annual federal highway apportionment by 10 percent.‚Äù

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act

Basically, Regan got cucked by some women who were mad because their kids did some hot boi shit and punished all young adults. It still bothers me that we send people as young as 17 to active war zones and in operational areas but do not give them the freedom to drink or smoke, even in other countries where the drinking age is less than 21."

2021-04-12 17:43:06,wallstreetbets,"Can't ""legally"" cross state lines with it, which largely doesn't matter for consumers, but it means you can't distribute across state lines (introduces weird market distortions and prevents some scaling efficiencies).

Cannabis' federal status dramatically impairs financial services available in the industry (Safe banking act would help with this without full federal legalization though)."
2021-04-12 16:47:40,wallstreetbets,"Indoor will always be much better quality. The growers can control the light cycles, humidity, what goes into the soil, etc. They can basically play God with the plant and maximize it's potential."
2021-04-12 17:39:01,wallstreetbets,Consistency is a problem when you can't control the environment.  Growing indoors lets you control basically ALL of the variables.  Growing outdoors you control almost nothing.
2021-04-12 16:11:18,wallstreetbets,"I was referring to large scale grows. If someone can figure out how to grow great quality cannabis outdoors at scale, they'll put everyone else out of business.

Is it over-reaching? Any opinion will simply be that: an opinion. Doesn't alter the reality that is still the rule of law and we know where it resides.

Its fine that you feel that way about the age restriction or restriction in general. I might feel the same way, but our opinions don't matter here at all. 

Do minors drink? Is it easier to obtain some restricted things? It don't matterrr.

2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Containership Rates Still Surging: Update & Picks  **BUY: $ZIM $DAC**

I posted on here [a couple months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ldcdr7/container_ship_boom_update_rates_surging_higher/) sharing some top picks across the containership industry. Rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40‚Äô boxes you see on railroads and trucks) are still going ballistic and have already exceeded my most bullish expectations. More importantly, these are not just temporary spot rates, but we are seeing a plethora of charters signed for 2-3+ years at these elevated levels. The world's containership liners clearly believe the strong rates are here to stay through at least 2023-2024.

Link to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)

I‚Äôm currently long about every name possible in the sector and although I've taken some profits in certain names to be responsible and lock in profits, I've also added a lot to a couple key beneficiaries including Navios Partners (NMM) and Zim Integrated (ZIM).

Even after the huge surge in the stock price, the enterprise value to EBITDA valuation metrics are very attractive since 2021-2022 EBITDA is surging and net debt levels will also be much lower by the end of 2021.

As I noted above, containerships are ***not*** like tankers and dry bulk vessels which normally just get 60-80 *day* voyages. These ships are landing 2-3, or even 4+ year fixtures. Much of 2021 is already locked in for these companies and we're now looking at solidifying coverage into 2022-2023+

I‚Äôve covered the shipping sector extensively on Seeking Alpha for nearly 10 years and am also on Twitter (@mintzmyer). I enjoyed the conversation on here a couple months ago and figured I'd add another update. I also have a new webinar video available on YouTube, but I don't think I'm allowed to link that?

Nick First (@allthingsventured on Twitter) has recently written another new article on top pick Navios Partners with his own financial projections- highly recommend:

[Article on Navios Maritime Partners](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4417748-navios-partners-merger-complete-ready-for-the-next-double)

I believe we‚Äôre probably 4th or 5th inning here. For my disclosure, I‚Äôm \*still\* very long nearly all the key names in the space- $ATCO $CPLP $DAC $MPCC (Oslo) $NMM and $ZIM. Keep in mind that nothing here constitutes investment advice in any form or fashion! I'm just talking about stocks I personally like. Positions may change in the future and I have no obligation to provide future updates."
2021-04-12 11:38:56,wallstreetbets,"0 responses and yet you were calling this in Jan/Feb/March before $ZIM $DAC $NMM $NMCI all went up nearly 100%. I read your twitter. You made me a lot of money, thank you."
2021-04-12 13:06:20,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the responses so far. Appreciate everyone chiming in.

Biggest thing I would say is to not learn all the 'wrong lessons' from ""#tankers"" last summer. Huge difference between a one-off shock and an actual cyclical supply/demand mismatch. Contracts here at 2-3+ years as opposed to 60-80 days with tankers. When those rates spiked, they lasted a couple months at max... with containers, these firms are signing deals to 2023-2024.

Here's a recent webinar I hosted last week which talks more about the industry and top picks: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuIQpAJGF-w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuIQpAJGF-w&t=1395s)"

2021-04-12 14:15:31,wallstreetbets,Owesome DD and the articles were a great addition. I have all my money in GME at the moment but i do agree with you about the freight prices. üëçDon't mind investing in it myself when i have a chance
2021-04-12 13:11:12,wallstreetbets,"My main concern with getting in now is that the price surge is discouraging over seas buys.  

We outsourced a few parts overseas due to capacity issues in the US caused by COVID and now have increased reason to pull back ASAP.  Also gives us good opportunity to quote customers local tooling for better overall piece price on top of US based manufacturing."
2021-04-12 13:19:14,wallstreetbets,"J, keep up the great work. These valuations are still very low even after the run. Looking at the Baltic dry bulk rate's and the Containership rates, I am amazed we had a sell off today. When I saw the selloff in NMM I was checking to see if there was some bad news before I bought more. And I was very surprised to see the capesize index made a big jump."
2021-04-12 14:02:23,wallstreetbets,Thank you

2021-04-12 16:11:38,wallstreetbets,"I work in the Shipping Industry as a Freight Forwarder, so just my 2 cents from the understanding / likelihood of rates we're likely to see, for at least the next year.

Rates are currently 8 - 10x the cost of normal rates and has been like this since December 2020.
Rates were slowly starting to creep down, but with the fuck up at the Suez Canal, it's now going to cause rates to hold or more likely actually rise again in May and June due to the knock-on effect it is causing to the schedules / vessel space and container availability in all areas of the world, but most importantly out in the Far East.

This is already being seen in the industry with rates increasing for 2nd half of April sailings again back to Jan/Feb levels in most cases with the lines.

We may see a small dip in rates for July and August, as Summer time is usually lowest demand time for goods and rates naturally sit at it's lowest point each year (usually would include May and June if not for Suez Canal issue), but once September hits the rates will again rise for Xmas rish and will likely once again hit outrageous prices like we say in January just gone.

Next year the expectation is that rates would come baxk down somewhat closer to normal rates we see year on year, but could be very dependent on COVID and is rather a lot of guesswork currently, as lines are in a position where they can control the market rates and making huge profits for the first time in many, many years."
2021-04-12 14:42:45,wallstreetbets,"What do you think about dry bulk shipping?  I‚Äôve been long gnk and Egle but haven‚Äôt looked that closely at container shipping but will add these to my list to review, thanks!"
2021-04-12 16:26:15,wallstreetbets,"Doing well, but IV all 80-100%, even on long dated contracts, which makes it pretty unappealing to buy. Might keep watch to see if that lowers soon."
2021-04-12 17:10:52,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this DD. This seems really underrated and your Twitter is really good.

What are your thoughts on Textainer Group ($TGH) and Costamare ($CMRE)?

2021-04-12 13:00:51,wallstreetbets,"That's awesome to hear- thanks!!

Yeah hard to believe buying things like $DAC and $GSL at $5 last fall and $NMCI under $1.00.

Not many people wanted to look into the companies because everyone learned the wrong lessons from the ""#tankers"" story or were into total dog-sh companies like $CTRM."

$DAC from $5.05 and it's still pretty cheap on EV/EBITDA as one example."
2021-04-12 13:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Sorry to hear about the losses. Worst impact is the opportunity cost from people who associated ""#tankers"" with containers and totally missed the difference in the industry structure and contracts."

2021-04-12 13:02:06,wallstreetbets,"Amen to that! Has been an amazing one as well. I was unfortunately a bit late myself, tbh, I bought all my shares at NOK 5.20."
2021-04-12 13:13:49,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a good concern to have if the freight rates last longer-term, but important to differentiate between the ship leases as well as the ultimate freight rates. Two different markets. Freight rates should be topping out this summer and coming back down to more healthy levels. The ship leasing rates (which are relevant for firms like $DAC or $NMM) are still climbing and more importantly the duration is going up as well. 2-3 years is now the norm."
2021-04-12 13:25:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah didn't want to deviate much into dry bulk since that's an entirely diff topic, but that market is looking very strong as well. Best rates I've seen since 2011."
2021-04-12 14:37:58,wallstreetbets,"Disclosures at the end. Cheapest on valuation is arguably NMM. The raw price of a share doesn‚Äôt mean anything though, gotta consider share count and earnings potential."
2021-04-12 12:59:52,wallstreetbets,"2-3+ year charters getting signed, few 4+ years now, so don't learn the wrong lesson from #tankers"

2021-04-12 15:16:55,wallstreetbets,Yes taking Chewy  as a $30B+ company and Gamestop being at $10B right now.  If he grows GME to at least match Chewy's market cap then that PT is not that so much a pipe-dream anymore.  And that's not factoring the fact that the market size for the gaming industry is significantly larger than the pet industry.
2021-04-12 15:13:20,wallstreetbets,If Chewy has a market cap of $35 billion theres no reason the leader in ecommerce for videogames under RC can't be at least double that. That'd be around $1000 a share without the squeeze.

2021-04-12 14:33:45,wallstreetbets,I've been having this thought lately- that the Wall Street Pro's have decided to STOMP anything mentioned on Reddit- specifically WSB.  Call it payback for GME..The Cathy Wood Stocks and anything mentioned on reddit have been absolutlely pounded- with no bounce for like 6 weeks now. I think that they are shopping short targets here.
2021-04-12 14:34:33,wallstreetbets,I went all in on the EV market this morning. What a great decision! /s
2021-04-12 14:35:25,wallstreetbets,I guess you could try doing covered calls since you a lot of every stock. Won't make your return extremely big but it's better than nothing
2021-04-12 14:35:27,wallstreetbets,Next time you are thinking of buying something go have a look at the 3 and 6 month RSI.  If it‚Äôs near or above 70 then sit on your hands and wait for the correction or buy a few puts.  You‚Äôre welcome.

2021-04-12 16:47:14,wallstreetbets,"Do the opposite of what WSB does. GME was an anomaly.

By the time someone posts that they made money on something, that's when to avoid it like the plague. Alot of positive DD posted here is garbage, likely posted by someone on the opposite side of the trade.  Not all, but most. Been burned so many times but not anymore."

2021-04-12 13:05:37,wallstreetbets,My I don't have to run day
2021-04-12 19:10:58,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. You're making my point. There are too many people that hear ""it's not a loss until you sell"" and think they aren't losing money if they don't sell. Once you buy stocks, you traded your money for shares. Your money is gone. The goal is to sell the shares for more money later but if the stock keeps going down, trades sideways or recovers slower than market average is still losing money.  You're not only losing the opportunity to sell them at the price they are today (which may be less tomorrow) but you're also losing out on the ability to put that money into something that actually is going up.

For example when $ARKK went from $156 to $129 everyone that had the mentality that they aren't losing money until they sell was wrong because not only did it go from $129 to $122 they also lost out on the opportunity cost to capital of putting the money into better investments. Even sticking it into $SPY they would have gained 8% in that time instead of losing 5%. Sure, maybe they keep holding $ARKK for a year until it goes back up to $129, break even and say ""I didn't lose any money""  but by then the $SPY will probably be up another 22% on top of the 8% they already missed out on. 

Holding on to losers until they ""come back"" because you think you don't take a loss until you sell just isn't true."
2021-04-12 16:41:31,wallstreetbets,Or they could not go back up.  Don't assume everything eventually goes back to its old highs if you just wait around a little while.

2021-04-12 13:56:31,wallstreetbets,My alarm the last 7 weeks has been notifications mentioning a slew of my tickers being down more than 5%. I no longer look to tomorrow for better trading
2021-04-12 19:54:04,wallstreetbets,Ya!!! If it goes down 50% it only has to go up 100% to break even!

2021-04-12 17:44:39,wallstreetbets,We have been in a bull market since well before WSB existed. We have basically been almost been in a bull market since reddit began.
2021-04-12 17:36:22,wallstreetbets,Naah. Not the hedgies. Its the masses. Too many morons in here upvoting all the other dumb shit they want to hear. Cream doesn't rise to the top. Its just a giant GME echo chamber now. The people that actually have good information and the people that want to see it are drowned out by whoever is sucking off the most popular meme stocks with rocket emojis and the latest catchy lingo.

2021-04-12 19:29:24,wallstreetbets,"I think it's an easier pill to swallow after you've done it the wrong way a few times then start doing it the right way. Nothing feels better than exiting a trade you quickly identify is a loser and use that money to stick into a winner. As your account is growing larger you will peek back in on the one you walked away from as it keeps fading away and be so thankful you did the right thing minimizing your risk on it. 

A lot of people start off with that ""it's only a loss if you sell"" mentality. The quicker you can realize how flawed that mentality is, the quicker you can get on to being a profitable trader."

2021-04-12 10:28:07,wallstreetbets,"For real question, what makes you think they won't cheat if anything ever does squeeze? I mean, during the run up in march we saw it twice drop like 40% in minutes. Nothing was mentioned or done about it. What's the say they didn't sell a fuck ton of naked calls to make up for their loses, then pushed the price down drastically so that they expired worthless once they saw the price rocketing up to $340+?"
2021-04-12 11:51:47,wallstreetbets,My partial transfer from RH to Fidelity went in on last Monday and my shares were in Fidelity Tuesday morning.  They are not playing games anymore.

2021-04-12 11:28:30,wallstreetbets,Because they've already sold and claimed their losses on Q1's quarterly earnings? You can see their filings.
2021-04-12 11:25:18,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying... Who's to say if they see the squeeze incoming, they don't just fuck the price again? I mean go back and look on March 10. That shit skyrocketed with no real pullback. Then, it suddenly crashed from $348 to like $180. After that, it never got back over $280 and has been falling ever since.

Who's to say they're not just selling naked calls to make back some of their losses, crashing the price if those calls get close to being in the money, covering some shorts after the price crash, selling more calls, crashing the price, so on and so forth. If you go back and look, the price crashed in an inorganic way twice within like 5 trading days. Yes, after the crash the price recovered, but it never recovered to the price it was before the crash. It was always 5-10% lower and then dropped more after.

&#x200B;

For another example, the huge 50% daily run up on the 25 March with 50M+ volume. It's very possible that they covered a good number of shorts on that day, then they sold a bunch of naked calls as well since the premiums shot through the roof due to the crazy price increase. Yea they lost money on covering the shorts possibly, but they could have easily made it back selling calls that had like 10x inflated premiums."
2021-04-12 11:27:59,wallstreetbets,most short positions have already liquidated based on quite a few hedge fund's filings. They basically took the loss altogether and tanked their Q1 earnings. There's no reason to believe short interset is >30-35% at this point.
2021-04-12 11:31:24,wallstreetbets,"This isn‚Äôt true at all. 
A margin call gives you like 5 days to deposit funds or sort out positions.

A broker can liquidate, but that really only happens to retail, these guys will have terms spelled out in a contract.

Lol margin called.. when at 480 like last time ? Oh wait."

I switched from RH to Fidelity , but I already had some shares in fidelity So I had to manually update them.  You can pull up your shares bought on Robinhood and then put the info into fidelity.  

It asks for the Date, amount of shares, and total cost basis for that specific buy.  

Remember if you buy 5 shares @ 100, you put your total cost basis as $500 for that particular order.  Fidelity will do the math for you and you can add infinite rows of orders.  I had a LOT of small orders at all kinds of different costs."

I had tons of issues trying to do simple transfers from and to my bank, and that was common on r/Webull.  They have a flashy looking platform, but the backend (and some GUI stuff) seems like it has a lot of issues.

If you ever have the misfortune of needing to contact their support team, it should set off alarms.  It was an eye-opening experience.  Trying to have a basic conversation with them made me think that they might actually be retarded...then I realized it's a Chinese company, so I assume they just don't speak even basic English.  Along the way I had to teach and re-teach their support team a couple of basic points about options trading, I had to tell them the same thing a dozen times, and I had to keep sending follow-ups because their responses were unreadable most of the time.  Before it was all said and done, their buggy platform ended up costing me about five hundred bucks in missed trading opportunities.

2021-04-12 17:42:05,wallstreetbets,You have more fun as a follower. But you make more money as a leader.
2021-04-12 14:50:51,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not arguing with that but at least now we have something to discuss.

it‚Äôs 99% cheerleading online. It‚Äôs all about separating the coaches from the cheerleaders. For every twenty people shitposting, one guy says three lines worth of material inside of a half page that should be resonating.

There‚Äôs clearly something going on or all this would have evaporated Feb 1st."
2021-04-12 13:50:50,wallstreetbets,it's 130% fyi
2021-04-12 15:15:12,wallstreetbets,"I mean I've been on wsb for a few years and the massive drop in quality after the whole GME thing blew it up is really unfortunate, it's kind of a joke at this point. it's way too hard to pick out any quality DD anymore after it became national news and millions of people jumped in trying to get rich and manipulate each other"
2021-04-12 13:51:23,wallstreetbets,Either way
2021-04-12 17:48:34,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs 142%, it went up. Look at the Bloomberg terminal posts."
2021-04-12 15:53:20,wallstreetbets,"There might be as many as ten different subreddits committed to DD at this point, though, so it‚Äôs easy to discard the trash"
2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Gain Alibaba bought on Friday. Everybody said I was an idiot. 
2021-04-12 09:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, remember me from high school? I was your best friend or cousin."
2021-04-12 09:40:27,wallstreetbets,You'll always be my idiot ü•∫
2021-04-12 10:08:52,wallstreetbets,And no one ever called him an idiot again for now he was known as retarded
2021-04-12 09:39:19,wallstreetbets,Who‚Äôs the idiot now! Solid gains bro!
2021-04-12 10:00:47,wallstreetbets,Good job and fuck you
2021-04-12 13:34:40,wallstreetbets,"Baba is the most underrated stonk 
The  P/E is screamIng a buy"
2021-04-12 10:56:27,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre still an idiot because you bought weeklies, but you‚Äôre our idiot. Welcome home brother."
2021-04-12 09:59:05,wallstreetbets,Crazy to think a company would get hit by a huge fine and the stock goes up. Gotta love the market
2021-04-12 09:39:06,wallstreetbets,Mad man
2021-04-12 10:46:49,wallstreetbets,Everyone said that you're an idiot but I don't think they were associating it with BABA.
2021-04-12 12:22:48,wallstreetbets,you should add JD to your watchlist
2021-04-12 14:45:48,wallstreetbets,i've literally never seen any bearish comments on BABA in this sub. dunno who would call you an idiot when BABA is literally the most undervalued stock in the entire market.
2021-04-12 09:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Solidddddd, I have baba as a long term investment and its treated me well"
2021-04-12 10:00:12,wallstreetbets,"still an idiot, just a few cents richer...."

2021-04-12 13:28:41,wallstreetbets,You know who else was called an idiot? DFV.
2021-04-12 10:28:55,wallstreetbets,Well you are still an idiot.Just a lucky one
2021-04-12 11:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Don't you worry man. The true test is not to lose that profit, you can still be an idiot - I believe in you. Also, congrats and fuck you."
2021-04-12 12:45:34,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
2021-04-12 10:22:20,wallstreetbets,"If the fine was detailed a week or more later, your move would have been in the red. You timed it well so you got rewarded, but it is a fluke."
2021-04-12 10:26:24,wallstreetbets,"Gotta listen to your inner idiot, congrats!!!!"
2021-04-12 10:29:54,wallstreetbets,I thought idiot was a term of endearment on this sub...
2021-04-12 12:01:18,wallstreetbets,Just the beginning
2021-04-12 12:40:36,wallstreetbets,"They said you're an idiot, but in a good way"
2021-04-12 13:25:26,wallstreetbets,"Hello, I'm the nigerian prince. I see you have my money, can you send it to me?"
2021-04-12 14:44:00,wallstreetbets,"""Do you like to YOLO?""

""Do you like to YOLO on meme stonk?""

""Yes!""

""You're a retard"""
2021-04-12 16:31:12,wallstreetbets,"Not an idiot.

You're a Retard."
2021-04-12 17:40:27,wallstreetbets,"People are quick to tell you that you're wrong, but they're even faster to tell you they never doubted you when you're winning. Either way, good job and congrats"
2021-04-12 19:25:41,wallstreetbets,"Fantastic entry per TA.
Very good would have done the same trade if I saw it and had that‚Äôs much $$ willing to go into options ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2021-04-12 09:42:50,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain to a newbie what this means - so the OP bought call options for how much? And what bet were they making? That the price would go up by 16th April?  And it‚Äôs in the money because...?  Just would be useful to have an explanation of the summary sheet if someone could?
2021-04-12 10:19:36,wallstreetbets,"And it's higher now, congrats on gaynz"
2021-04-12 10:21:54,wallstreetbets,Are you going to sell the contract or wait till expire and buy the shares?
2021-04-12 10:46:42,wallstreetbets,You still were. You‚Äôre just a lucky idiot.
2021-04-12 12:45:44,wallstreetbets,can someone explain why alibaba jumped up nearly 10% after it got that massive fine? are the two events correlated?
2021-04-12 13:08:15,wallstreetbets,Baller! Nice work
2021-04-12 13:09:09,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, now tell them to go suck a fat one."
2021-04-12 13:18:14,wallstreetbets,Nice! I would just recommend some Risk Management assessment on BABA... you never know what will happen next haha
2021-04-12 13:35:02,wallstreetbets,Give this man a helmet!
2021-04-12 13:35:43,wallstreetbets,Congratulations retard

2021-04-12 15:05:19,wallstreetbets,"GG, well done mate"
2021-04-12 15:44:33,wallstreetbets,This guy f*ks
2021-04-12 19:46:34,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs because WSB upvoting basically amounts to a motley fool hot tip these days
2021-04-12 11:20:27,wallstreetbets,"Might be a strange question, but it appears that you, in fact, fuck. Can you confirm?"
2021-04-12 12:16:10,wallstreetbets,"About time we got some posts about stuff other than LameStop, FFS. Grats, and fuck you!"
2021-04-12 09:48:21,wallstreetbets,Nice return! Ive been watching them ever since the dip. Cant wait to be approced for options üò≠
2021-04-12 12:57:17,wallstreetbets,Genius move. That news was actually fantastic...but nobody can think outside of the box
2021-04-12 17:04:09,wallstreetbets,"Well you were an idiot at that time lol. It was going down, AND they got slapped with the $2.8 Billion fine. Typically that'd equate to a huge dip. 

But how it did the opposite was surprising, and it was basically because everyone felt like ""okay great. now that the fine is out of the way, we can go back to making money."" 

That is -really- backwards from how one would expect a fine that big to go. 

TL;DR : Congrats and fuck you. <3"
2021-04-12 13:27:49,wallstreetbets,I don't understand  why anyone is using robinhood. I can't take any robinhooder seriously
2021-04-12 10:44:24,wallstreetbets,Same. Want to dig up the threads from Friday to rub it in peoples faces but trying to be a bigger ape
2021-04-12 11:09:19,wallstreetbets,Congrats! You‚Äôre still an idiot and now asshole too. Congrats tho‚Äò

2021-04-12 11:47:37,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre a retard. You‚Äôre a lucky retard but a retard nonetheless.
2021-04-12 11:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Nice gains! Good job my man. Lock in those gains, and throw in a new LEAP on BABA. It's going up from here, and very undervalued.

&#x200B;

Get out of that short term theta burning call(s)"
2021-04-12 11:54:54,wallstreetbets,keep holding.
2021-04-12 12:02:53,wallstreetbets,Would you have made more had you bought the stocks outright versus options?

2021-04-12 13:55:00,wallstreetbets,When would you buy new calls? I wanted to this week but 8% is a lot for 650b market cap. Was thinking of day trading weeklies to catch a 1-2% up.
2021-04-12 13:57:34,wallstreetbets,Both can be true ü¶ç

5G is the next market to be in, 5G got pushed out of the news cycle due to Covid but kept growing. With the vaccine roll out seeing some continuity and cases slowly dropping, amazon already delivered the lube and 5G market penetration is inevitable. Soon bill gates will be pushing Windows Vista updates to our genome and we need some booty deep infrastructure to push all those Giggity-bytes.

Ericsson's business includes technology research, development, network systems and software development, and running operations for telecom service providers, and software. Basically they're your global super-genius IT and telecomm guy.

But this isn't no Tower play... this is the robot juice baby, the juice that's going to be fueling everything from autonomous vehicles to your wife's new IoT pleasure toy. it's not just the robots coming though.. 5G market growth is anticipated to see more than a [10,000%](https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/5g-technology-market) increase from 5.53 billion in 2020 to 667.9 billion in 2026.

this is good news cuz our boi $ERIC has got a solid share of the 5G market and [is projected to maintain and even slightly grow its market share in the near future](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4361829-ericsson-5g-winner-no-contest). Yeah $ERIC has got some competition from Nokia, KPN and Huawei... but a lot of world politicians got nervous when they thought about Huawei being able to see their pornhub searches.

With the 5G market projected to grow over 10,000% in the next 5 years, the pancake is getting bigger and $ERIC has got a consistent piece of the pancake. Offering both the hardware and software side of things makes my wife moister than bill gates giving vaccines to 3rd world countries üí¶üí¶üí¶

now lets follow some money üí∏üí∞

* Ericsson gross profit for the twelve months ending September 30, 2020 was¬†**$9.555B**, a¬†**15.89% increase**¬†year-over-year.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Yes, a 200%+ buffet indicator is absolute butt-fucking insanity but in this case it could be an indicator that currency is being debased. 

Stocks are stupid pricey because credit is stupid cheap.

The market is making a bet that the federal reserve and federal government are going to provide liquidity and credit in perpetuity. What that means is that valuations are tied to access to credit, not actual business value.

If the indicator reached 300% but the Fed still signaled it would provide rock bottom credit rates and the federal government is always ready, willing and able to inject fresh cash why would it matter?"

2021-04-12 10:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Trailing metrics *should* be higher at this point because they aren't pricing in the forward revenue and earnings of this quarter's stimmy bucks or the added revenue of 'reopening'.  A good example of this is looking at [phone shipments in China](http://www.caict.ac.cn/kxyj/qwfb/qwsj/202103/P020210311328926953317.pdf) - trailing numbers on phone shipments are so garbage compared to leading numbers and estimates to the point that there were >200% more phones sold in China in Feb 2021 compared to Feb 2020.  If one were to not buy into a company that sells phones because their trailing multiples are a bit high, they miss out on getting in before a couple quarters of earnings roll in and the trailing numbers are suddenly low.

Everything is practically a growth stock right now because earnings for practically everything sucked for the first half of 2020 compared to what earnings will likely look like for the first half of 2021.

You can either bet on the trailing metrics remaining high even after earnings or you can bet on the trailing metrics tanking after earnings but things look good for the people betting on the latter and jumping into things with currently high multiples in hopes that the next couple quarters of earnings are better than last years."

2) you spent a year offering 0% interest 72 month financing, free home delivery, free two year service, etc. and still didn‚Äôt match 2019 demand. Nobody positioned to buy a vehicle passed that chance up, so it stands to reason demand should be down this year as anyone capable of buying already did. 

3) 70 million unemployment claims. Let‚Äôs just assume that 50% of that is blue collar. Let‚Äôs also assume 1% of those folks wanted a truck. That‚Äôs 700,000 trucks not being bought. 2019 total truck sales were 900,000 (just Ford). Let‚Äôs make everything even and say the big four sold 28M units. So 25% of your demand should have been gutted. 

My point is that I feel the auto industry is inflating it‚Äôs numbers to keep stock prices high."

2021-04-12 16:04:55,wallstreetbets,"You must view this in perspective of interest rates.

OF COURSE securities are at all time high prices. When IRs are low, security prices are higher because it means that investors require lower returns due to the risk-free rate being so low. 

When returns are low, price is high. This follows from almost all asset-pricing models, most commonly occurring with bonds because rates change frequently while coupons stay the same. Therefore the price must be adjusted to meet the market rate.

It doesn't mean that asset prices can only go down though, it is just the theoretical maximum price at this very instant. Companies can become more valuable and then their theoretical maximum price increases.

Fed says rates are staying low until '23. No worries until '23 then. Once they go higher you will still be fine, you will lose some current value in exchange for higher annual returns."

2021-04-12 13:00:19,wallstreetbets,"People chasing yield in a widening wealth gap.  More money flows to the richest people.  They have to do something with it, they can't spend it buying milk and shit and they can't just park billions in a savings account.  So, they bought up bonds first and created a bond bubble.  Now, there is no yield in bonds, so they are chasing yield in equities.  You can get into Fed activity and the Fed buying bonds and money printing but the jist is that you have asset inflation raging into a historically unique situation of absolute shit bond yields (hell, in a lot of places yields are actually negative).  

So, basically, there's a shit ton of money being generated with nowhere to go.  Then, the rise of derivatives means nobody has to sell into risk when hedging is pretty damn easy.  Bull market rages on for foreseeable future as governments prop it up"
2021-04-12 10:16:45,wallstreetbets,So you are hedging against the market crashing by buying GME but you sold the rest of your portfolio because we are in a bubble so it'll go down when the market crashes? That way it's a winwin?

Every commercial building in the state is going for the incentives programs, because direct replacement is free to the customer and retrofit programs cost less than the saving they'll see in six months. On top of all that, residential jobs are coming in as quick as years prior. Typically before we only scheduled jobs as far out as a month. Just last month my partner and I had to pass on an $80,000 school district contract because we've already got four similarly large projects on the docket this year *on top of* the rest of the workload. 

Concrete guys out here are booked through until the ground freezes... So I guess we'll wait til next year to see if there's a slow down. But next year the new no-cost solar incentives go through... And the average age of an electrician is just shy of 60 years old here. So I don't see myself slowing down anytime soon.

And the cost of homes doubled in less time than it took construction materials to do the same. Frames hav been going up all spring. Only thing slowing that down is a real market pullback or the housing bubble popping."

2021-04-12 19:38:43,wallstreetbets,Just my first hand accounts. My neighbor replaced his roof yesterday. My other neighbor replaced his porch last month. Both with stimulus money. Other neighbor just bought a new car. I‚Äôm taking a long delayed vacation this summer. Parents had trees removed and bought a new pet. All stimmy money. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs people who are just saving it but I think there‚Äôs far more people spending it.
2021-04-12 19:43:26,wallstreetbets,"That's great, and they paid for these items after they were adjusted for inflation. Ask your neighbor how hard it was to find a contractor, how much extra the roof material cost, and how much more was the card due to limited supply, etc. Depending on your age, you may not know TRUE inflation. But, trust me, it's been here since Obama. Only not as strong. Now, after they printed or plan to print 9 Trillion dollars, it's mathematically impossible to go another way. You'll see. We can revisit this post in 6 months and see where we end up if you like :)"

2021-04-12 10:03:26,wallstreetbets,"Because the contracts are tiny and there are risks associated with those contracts.

Securing a big project/order/contract just means BB will continue to survive. Because that is their business line.

There are also risks with every contract, what if BB doesn't deliver? that can get expensive as fuck.

Look at NYSE: BW, they literally went bankrupt because years earlier they got fat contracts. Their stonk mooned, and then they failed to deliver and were on the hook for billions of dollars in damages. And I watched it all go down as a sub-contractor. Wish I bought puts, but that would have landed me in prison, maybe.

Everyone here keep spamming ""BB is not a phone company"" no shit. But what people get wrong is that BB is not a tech company in the traditional sense.

BB is a tech company with a project based revenue. They are much closer to Fluor, Bechtel, Technip than they are to IBM, Oracle, Salesforce etc.

BB has fat patents, which have been bankrolling them while they try and fine tune their post-phone business strategy.

BB has very good, very niche technology. They pretty much have no competition with their QNX offering. Don't believe me, name one competitor. And don't forget that the market for QNX is not as big as you think.

BB also has other technologies, IT security etc.

BB survives on winning contracts for new projects. Once a project is over, they move onto the next. Of course they don't do one project at a time, they have dozens if not hundreds, each worth millions. But each project has an end date, and some risk associated with it.

A stock won't moon because BB got a big contract. Because there is a finite amount of work that BB can get done in any given time frame. If they oversell themselves, they have to hire & train staff which takes money and time.

While NVDA is the opposite. They have so much money rolling in from their standard products that they can use the excess cash to bank roll new in-house ventures. Look at all the shit that NVDA has come up with in the last decade. That is how a stonk moons."

2021-04-12 15:23:25,wallstreetbets,"Not so.

The stock market is a leading indicator of the real world economy. It takes about 6 months on average for invested capital to hit the ground in the real world. So when the market rockets higher the economy is going to boom in 6 months time from all the new investments being made today.

When people stop investing in the future, and start protecting their capital the market crashes, and 6 months later the real economy grinds to a screeching halt.

In a perfect world we wouldn't all follow each other around like brain dead sheep, and there would be less market crashes, and their subsequent recessions, depressions. But that's just a pipe dream.

When it comes to gamestop, because of us apes they now have more money now to spend on building their business. When they spend that money all their employees, contractors, service providers, etc have more disposable income to spend buying gamestop products. This increase in sales puts upward pressure on the share price. And the magic of economic growth happens right before our very eyes."

# In the Kingdom of the Blind, the One Eyed Man is King

I know you are simple apes, so let us begin by asking one easy question: who made money in the goldrush? The people panning for gold flakes? Absolutely not. The people who made money in the goldrush were the people who sold pans, nails, and gear. $SPLK is the moral equivalent of being in the AI & distributed systems goldrush and providing the proverbial basic tools. Splunk's product allows tech teams to understand what is actually going on in their complex systems.

Splunk Inc. provides a product line of enterprise software for collecting data for all parts of a company. Splunk generates reports for business leaders on key performance metrics, as well as being highly used in public & private sector for security compliance reporting. The product shines best as a developer tool for real-time data analysis especially relied upon by large and small tech companies for site reliability engineering in critical moments. It integrates with paging and emailing technology for error handling and escalation. It's the ultimate first-class experience for DevOps fancy living.

Their competitors are generally not as good but, worth mentioning for a reader to look into if they are thinking about doing their own DD: DataDog ($DDOG), NewRelic ($NEWR), and AppDynamics acquired by Cisco. I often laugh about stock terminology because things like ""Bollinger bands"" are just a fancy way to say charting a standard deviation above and below a moving average price of a stock-- and that type of charting is as easy as one line of code in Splunk! 

Cloud providers will continue to innovate in this space as well and encroach upon specialized 3rd party vendors, but Splunk has counter-stepped this by integrating with AWS CloudWatch events and forwarding them directly to Splunk cloud which will absolutely sell to big, dumb enterprise because they are too stupid to manage cloud stuff correctly on their own. There are even SISTER COMPANIES which have moved into the Splunk ecosystem which do things like forward MAINFRAME data to Splunk‚Ää. They are also launching a product called [Business Flow](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/videos/splunk-business-flow-demo-video.html) which is some of the coolest software I've seen in a long time. 

They even have a venture capital arm of the organization which acquires startups that work in monitoring called ""[Splunk Ventures](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/enterprise-data-platform/splunk-ventures-funding.html)"". There is honestly no limit for this org. If you check out their [glassdoor page](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Splunk-EI_IE117313.11,17.htm) their CEO has a 93% satisfaction rating from the rest of the company. I urge you to look at [who is depending on them](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/customers.html) and likely never to leave this product.

You apes will love this one: fucking FINRA uses Splunk to protect investing data!! If that isn't the best thesis for boomers buying this shit and never getting off it I don't know what is.

# Speaking To The Investor

Okay, so that was a lot about software. Now you want to see some numbers because maybe you aren't an ape and you wanna know what the P/E ratio is for [Splunk](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/splk/price-earnings-peg-ratios) & [some](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/newr/price-earnings-peg-ratios) [competitors](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ddog/price-earnings-peg-ratios). Those NASDAQ links have all the numbers you probably need for short information and insider movement. I'm not a finance bro, so I'm not going to really dig into that for you.

Here's what the bears will say: [Ark dumped them.](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-splk) P/E is more competitive in their close competitors I mentioned. Yes, it's true [they got slapped on the wrist](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nasdaq-splk-investor-notice-lawsuit-111500894.html) by investors because they fucked up on earnings delivery and weren't transparent about it.

# Let me respond to these hangry burrrs: 

Ark making plays on them at all should have your attention. And look, Ark couldn't possibly know what I know-- which is the software developer perspective. New Relic will never be Splunk and yes, it's probably still a good investment, but ultimately if you had to pick a winner it's Splunk. I personally believe that the pandemic struck and budgets were immediately reorganized and probably they had licenses cancelled. Alongside the reallocation of budgets, there was probably also new work that came through because of 24/7 data analysis needs increased overnight DRAMATICALLY as IT systems had to scale up to meet the needs of remote life and more online services. This means they were probably eager to close these deals and report them, but ultimately these contracts take time to iron out. 

On value relative to competitors, like I said, investing across the board (check out Series B funded [honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io) for a cool innovative start up that will one day probably IPO) in monitoring is good sense long-term. Splunk is different, because it's a lot like Tesla's P/E situation. Splunk dumps money on its people and huge marathon sales conventions. It dumps money on customer experience. It HEMMORAGES money. Here's the thing though. It absolutely does not fucking matter. This product is crack and once baked in they sit back and collect. They are going to the fucking moon because they understand that quality wins and it's worth it to fucking delight your customer. They can't be easily outstepped in this either by cloud providers or competitors because it's **infrastucture**. Like a railroad, it is prohibitively difficult to build an enormous data empire with as many integrations they have. [You buying $BB these days?](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/forms/enterprise/blackberry-protect-splunk-integration) Splunk is everywhere.  

[Year Out Shot from Fidelity, Note All the \\""Bullish Long & Short Term\\"" indicators past month... Note the huge sell-off from the Revenue dip and subsequent lawsuit from investors in March which probably spooked institutions to sell off. However, check the NASDAQ links cause short interest is low.](https://preview.redd.it/t9c0vk03eqs61.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d7609999c3890f0235a8f8bd34efd0a54f57717)

The market is wrong. It doesn't make sense for them to lose value during a pandemic. Tech companies have to support more hours for digital tools both for public and private sector because of remote life which means they need more Splunk. More government money on coronavirus probably means more Splunk licenses with reoccurring subscriptions. It all probably means there is a lot more Splunk that's coming and people didn't immediately get their budgets finalized in time because of the scramble and so revenue probably dipped, but it's a fake signal. This stock should be worth 3x what it is right now. If you zoom out to a larger 5 year view you can see how it was trending before the pandemic.

2021-04-12 09:45:29,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôve got spunk promoting Splunk
2021-04-12 10:10:07,wallstreetbets,"To give you another perspective - I work in big data, not for Splunk, but for a big player & previously worked with other Splunk competitors. I have used Splunk, I have dealt with customers of Splunk, and I have done more Splunk migrations (away from Splunk) than I can count.

IMO this is awful advice. Pretty much everyone considers Splunk as a legacy vendor. They were huge at one point, with a competitive product - however, their tech is now old and they have not kept pace with the industry. Not only that, but because of their previous size, they whacked the licensing cost up and made it too expensive. Customers are leaving in droves to get away from their insane licensing structure - usually heading towards ElasticSearch or Graylog.

To be blunt, Splunk's tech is complete shit, overpriced, and their customers know it; it just takes big organisations time to untangle themselves, but they will.

I will be shocked if they don't join MapReduce in being sold for scrap at some point in the near future.

There are some great plays in the big data space - but you're 10 years too late for Splunk."

Sumo is the big paid competitor and many others are nipping at the heels (datadog now has a log product, logs.io, and many more).

Can you please check revenue, customers, and recognize that a fucking diy kibana/elasticsearch elk setup does not a Splunk replacement make? Can't believe people on here really told other people those are equivalent. Wild.

Like I've said they've attempted to correct this, but whatever the limitations of cloud are they will obviously be amortized and reduced as it's a relatively new product. Again, they won't win because they are perfect, they will win because they are the best at what they do. Just saying that as somebody who has built logging systems."

They care about not making headlines more than being over budget, largely."
2021-04-12 18:10:36,wallstreetbets,"Splunks largest selling point is its relatively easy search language and ability to easily create dashboards/content without experienced users.

2021-04-12 10:40:30,wallstreetbets,"ElasticSearch - they are branching in to the CySec area more and more with every release & many interesting acquisitions. IMO this is a great move as CySec is only getting bigger and bigger as a market. They have become more than just a point-solution company, which I think is important. 

DataStax - not yet public and I'm not keen on point-solutions (but hey look at Mongo so what do I know) but I find this one quite interesting and they've poached some top talent

Aiven - not public, still small, but this is my personal favourite to grow. Have poached some of the best engineers I know and their tech is so widely applicable.

Databricks - also not public yet, but they are becoming a big player and I think they will beat out Snowflake.

Cloudera - public, old player, and in my opinion about 50% undervalued at least - pinch of salt though as I used to work there so I may be bias. Great people, diverse product and well known in the industry.

Snowflake - imo, massively over valued and I just don't see how they grow to justify their valuation. That said, it's not bad tech, their customers are largely happy and they are a well known brand now.

Confluent - not public, but imo I think they are going to struggle. I love Kafka and these guys definitely do it the best, but they are also expensive as hell and they are too short focused. They have 1 product and try to engineer it to fit every hole - which it just doesn't. I really hope they diversify a bit."

2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CCJ Cameco Uranium stock watch - going nuclear Ahoy-hoy Apes!

So this month I've noticed some ridiculously large call option buying on $CCJ which is Cameco - the 2nd largest Uranium producer in the world.

Disclaimer: I am definitely ***not*** a nuclear tycoon who owns said nuclear stock or nuclear plant...

The stock closed down over 2% to $17.21 on Friday but here is what the Open Interest on the 16 April calls (expiring this Friday) looks like:

https://preview.redd.it/64r16xr3gqs61.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=5216d4d6567ede647819038058e5b95ecc5cfe46

Yes, you read that correctly. There's currently almost **130,000 calls** open at **over a** **6:1 ratio** to puts with expiration in five trading days.

There have been a few good DD posts on WSB in the past about $CCJ Cameco and Uranium. **TLDR:** uranium looks to finally be starting a bull run after a 10 year bear market and some of the big-name banks are predicting that the price of Uranium could double within the few years due a shortage of uranium and an increase in demand due to 'clean energy' requirements.

For all you fellow autists, here is the current daily chart of CCJ which is already clearly in an uptrend since December:

https://preview.redd.it/5sdcqvi6gqs61.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bd127147b8804406d792d152c6a4fc39324b1e

On Friday *after-hours* Cameco released the news that they will be reopening their Cigar Lake mine in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Cigar Lake is the world's highest grade uranium mine (Cameco owns 50% of it) and the mine has been shut since December due to Covid-19.

The closure is costing $CCJ $8-$10 million per month alone. In 2019 CCJ's share of the mine's uranium was 9 million pounds and in a Covid-disrupted 2020 it was still 5 million lbs. They haven't mined any in 2021 so far but have projected producing 5.5 million lbs.

Considering that they currently receive about $31-$36 per pound of uranium, this reopening should fundamentally be great news for the company as it would represent about 10% of their $1.8 billion revenue of 2020.

But the market may actually interpret this as *bad news* as the theory was that the closure was supposedly driving the spot price of uranium higher, even though Cameco have stated that they'll be using any mined uranium from Cigar Lake to fulfil existing contractual obligations (i.e. not flood the market with more cheap uranium to drive the price back down).

&#x200B;

**What does this all mean?**

The $24 and $25 calls probably have no chance of printing because whoever bought them did so on the day of the $19.71 high on 16 March (still interesting they haven't sold any). Oops.

However there has been quite a bit of movement in the last few days on the $20 calls in particular as well as the $19.

Also just of interest there is now almost 25,000 open interest on the May 21 $25 calls.

So it could just mean some beautiful YOLO'ing retard has blown hundreds of thousands of dollars on $19-$25 calls that are all going to expire worthless. Totally wasn't me.

&#x200B;

**But....**

Say the stock price spikes today or tomorrow due to Friday's news or because some of the uranium mines in eastern Europe are closing due to rising Covid cases or just because whoever owns all those open calls is trying for a gamma squeeze - or for any other reason.

Bringing the call options from $18 up to $20 into play creates a potential liability purchase of **over 5,000,000 extra stocks** if whoever sold the calls is short the stock.

Considering that the total average daily volume is 6.66M (seriously. lol), things could start moving very quickly...

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h91g1w2bgqs61.png?width=285&format=png&auto=webp&s=086940d4b2f717ffb015f8f5c151dd2f9d3bc4a5

Then considering there's an extra potential liability purchase of **7.2M stocks for the $21-$25 open call options** and things really could get interesting if a whale or a group decided to start driving up the stock price and create a gamma squeeze.

Of course the price could tank today because of the AH news and make all of this a moot point. But I figured it was worth watching this one. The implied volatility for the options is really low - *about 55%* \- so a quick price movement would bring big rewards to those holding stock and/or options.

&#x200B;

**What's going to happen to $CCJ this week?**

**Probably** ***nothing***. Heck, it may even retest the lower trendline and 50 EMA in reaction to Friday's news.

But keep watching this week for any sudden run and then again for May if someone tries to make those $25 calls print next month. There is a chance that Cameco stock is about to go nuclear.

&#x200B;

2021-04-12 14:03:52,wallstreetbets,"Dear Anti-GME,

Thanks for showing up with your FUD when the stock dips, it is important for us to know when you are looking for our attention. It is *this* precisely what gives us comfort. When it dips it gets us excited, when it soars it gets us excited. We like the Stock, not only when it soars, but even more when it dips.  Cover now, or cover later... *that's* the only control you have. GME is my first stock ever, I eat them melted; the crayons"

2021-04-12 08:49:04,wallstreetbets,All the DD out there is great and makes a ton of sense. But the biggest tell for me is Gabe's own words to Congress. He said the increase in price in January was due to options trading aka a gamma squeeze. Brokerages stopped the buying on the stock and only allowed selling so the price dropped fast. SO IF THE INTITIAL INCREASE WAS FROM THE GAMMA THEN HOW DID THE HFS COVER 140% SI WHILE THE PRICE WAS ONLY FALLING?

The normal trading range (20 days, with standard deviation of 2) for GME is between 139.50 and 228. The range is constricting/consolidating.

1 month ago the range was between -30.50 and 283. 

In other words, the price support keeps moving upwards.

2021-04-12 11:55:04,wallstreetbets,"On this day, April 12th in 1971, a secret team of German and Swedish engineers attempted a feat only the Americans and Soviets would accomplish for many decades to come. Details of the mission were finally declassified 50 years later.

The mission team for the AFFE-Zw√∂lf was comprised of the two experienced test pilots Hans Albrecht and Elias H√∂dl as well as two laboratory chimpanzees, with the goal of beating the Soviets to a possible moon landing scenario although officially only a moonshot attempt would be made.

During the mission, there was a catastrophic failure of the navigation system and Albrecht had to switch to manual controls while approaching the moon, and was able to avoid disaster with his keen visual insight to keep the craft 100km above the lunar surface. However, they would need to reduce the mass of the orbiter at their altitude to escape the moon's gravity, and Mission Control advised the two men not to descend to the surface as recovery would be impossible. They chose to place the chimpanzees into the lander and detach the module from the orbiter in order to return home to Earth while the lander made a controlled descent to the moon.

The two Germanic astronauts made it safely back to Earth, where Mission Control gave Albrecht the nickname ""Diamant"" for successfully navigating the damaged AFFE-Zw√∂lf and landing a pair of chimpanzees on the lunar surface. As it was a secret project which violated the Potsdam agreement and would have caused tensions with the USA and Russia, information on the project was only declassified in 2021.

*TL;DR: ""Diamond"" Hans brought the apes to the moon with H√∂dl.*"

2021-04-12 12:29:53,wallstreetbets,"What's the strategy here? Anyone that bought GME at ALL (esp those who have a cost basis >$100/share) will not sell it.

You could shake off the risk-averse traders by letting the price hit around 200, but then you risk FOMO buying pressure which is terrifying to the shorts (as seen during the January BLATANTLY illegal retail cutoff).

If that happens, there's no doubt someone would risk a margin call. All of the shorts here have to act together since the first to cover blows everybody's spot up. If someone gets called at 300, then the price covering jacks it up to 400 - someone else gets a call....and so on.

What do you do? BAIL THEM OUT with an ""investment"" (Citadel). Why the fuck else would Citadel invest in a fund that just lost billions?

I think this is an over-reliance on their HFT money printer that short-circuited because the people in this sub are so stupid that it broke any and all conventional logic. They've gone too deep down the rabbit hole and can't get out.

I don't know what their exit strategy is, but outside of the US government allowing them to continue to manipulate the price of this stock and the free market as a whole - it's over. And make no mistake, I fully believe that the regulating bodies know about the deep ITM calls, dark pool routing, naked shorting, covering naked shorts with borrowed shares and then selling another borrowed share for short-term profit (hello 2007), etc.

If the gov't lets me down, so be it. I'm YOLOing on a free and fair market. The fact that me doing this is risky is insane. I don't give a shit anymore.

EDIT: to add on to them being afraid of buying pressure, remember the flash crash last month. No, I don't think it was because one fucking dude tweeted something about exiting. The longer they play this game, the worse it gets. Paying off credit cards with credit and hoping the credit card company will panic and forgive the debt. wtf?"

Blame Ascendiant Capital Markets, which downgraded GameStop stock to sell today. According to StreetInsider.com this morning, analysts at Irvine, California-based Ascendiant cut GameStop stock to sell and assigned the video game and console retailer a **$10 price target** that implies there's another 93% worth of downside risk in the stock.

2021-04-12 17:54:20,wallstreetbets,"Worth remembering that after all this unexpected additional cost the Hedge funds have encountered, it won‚Äôt be good enough for them to take the stock down to 20 dollars. They now have to totally destroy the price (like sub the previous 2 to 4 dollars) to recover their losses and return the borrowed shares. This means the only option for them now is to try to bankrupt and / or destroy the reputation of the company. They did this already with ToysRUs. 

How can they destroy the company?

1. Drive the share price down to scare away investors and kill credibility of the board / management structure

2. Perhaps garner and exercise voting rights by buying a small but significant long position, allowing them to destabilise the management team and throw off other shareholder votes.

If however, I hold onto my shares, and oh I dunno - some other people were to do the same, then they can only drive the price down so far (way higher than 20 bucks) and large investors might actually be attracted at that price.

If no one sells them shares it also means point 2 is less likely.

I am now going to will my shares to whoever I regenerate into in the next life. Fuck these corrupt a holes... I‚Äôm going to become the worlds first multi-generational shareholder.

Retail is buying and holding the float. That's why they're desperate to shake you out.  
They can crash the price or do anything they want. This will not fix their problem  


Im calmly waiting for the moment something forces them to buy again.  
In the meantime I'm just buying all I can. Currently holding 178 shares and going up every time they dip it. This makes their problem larger.

Had a dream about GME. Was in some weird building, very posh, everything was covered in marble. And there was a huge screen with tickers and an anchor, saying the price of GME is plummeting.

People were wearing weird clothes, like from 19-20th century, bow hat, and black suit etc. I looked around,  I screamed diamond hands, and raised my hands while heading towards the exit.

2021-04-12 13:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Just a quick bit of DD, options are what's currently driving the price of $GME, but not in the way you might think. Options are created by Market Makers, and in the case of $GME almost entirely by Citadel. However, Citadel is also a hedgefund with enough capitol to manipulate the price of the stock. This is important because a Market Maker makes more money if more options are out of money when called than in money, thus if there are more calls than puts, the Market Maker has an insensitive to drive the price down by shorting shares. However if the puts start to outweigh the calls MMs will want to drive the price back up.

For the last 2 months calls have heavily exceeded puts, so Citadel has been constantly shorting the stock and finds themselves now with a huge short position that could cause a massive short squeeze. This is why they've been buying so much negative press. Not just to get people to paper hand for a loss, but also to get bears to buy puts on GME. Then once the puts outweigh the calls, they can close out thier short positions driving the price back up. Even if they loose money closing out the shorts, they'll make it back from the dumb bears who bought into thier propaganda.

So the moral of the story is: buy shares, not options. Of course I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just an ape who spends way too much time researching market mechanics."

The price dropped $22, there is approximately 3 times the volume as several days last week where it dropped 1/3 that amount. These are not natural price movements. I think they are digging with a back hoe not realizing that they have now dug the back hoe into a ten thousand foot pit. How much money did they just spend today to drop the price 13%? There were 500k shorts at IB friday, 200k got returned earlier after the big drop. Appears to be none currently at Fidelity. Every time they borrow shares they return less. So not only is it getting expensive to drop the price, they are still not getting anyone to sell, more people are still buying, and they still have to pay interest on the shorts they aren't getting (or giving) back.... WTF is their endgame, literally holding the market hostage?"

In the basic, I have 17 shares at $172, and in the TFSA (which I just started I think Thursday) I have six shares at $155.37.  


I considered buying some more at the $140 level, but I think it may continue to dip lower this week.  So, I'll wait.  If it does, then great, I buy more.  If $140 is the low and it just goes up, then I missed the chance to capitalize, but still, it's all good, since I'll be making some money.  Obviously at the moment I'm losing some money, but it's nothing that I can't afford to lose, so no worry.  \[not advice\]"

* Peel chop crayons into small chunks. Transfer to a large saucepan or pot.
* Add in water, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and let simmer 20-30 minutes until crayons are soft.
* Puree using a blender, food processor, or immersion blender for a smoother crayonsauce.

#### OPTIONAL ADD INS

* For sweetened crayonsauce, return pureed crayonsauceto pan. Stir in brown sugar and continue to cook, uncovered, until the crayonsauce thickens, about 10 minutes.
* For a more flavorful, dessert type crayonsauce, stir in butter, ground cinnamon, and vanilla extract until butter is melted.

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall. Not proven but someone told me: ETrade may apparently loan any margin share like TD. This is not what the agreement says but I would call them to be sure.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your margin shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

Vanguard - Securities Lending Program, but I don't know any details about it because they don't appear to be public. You'll have to probably read your agreement...

Merrill - If you have a margin account, then your shares are loaned out, regardless of whether they are bought on margin or not. I don't know if you can have them recalled, you should definitely contact them and ask about your proxy vote rights. A note, this is by far the worst margin account I have ever seen, their agreement allows them to liquidate your account without notice at anytime, it's probably not a good idea to have margin from here....

**Having a margin account does not mean that your shares will be loaned out, read your agreements or talk to your broker. After reading the above broker's agreements they loan out securities in these situations, but they may also loan them out if you bought the securities with margin, i.e. borrowed money to buy on leverage. You would need to ask your broker about that, they don't really appear to disclose that or it's probably in some addendum or some shit.**

**If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker.**

I'm gonna send this out one more time in about 1.5/2 hours before EOD to try to make sure as many people know as possible."

A) gave us some battlescars and taught how to take looses. When you see 80% drop these dips now ain't shit to us. We are now veterans ü¶ç

2) let us realize that 1k per share is nothing. Back in January i would sell at 500$ MAYBE. Probay less and on the way up. Now half of apes know exit strategy and what floor actually means (and that anything below 100k is basically a basement)

Green) they gave as time. We get wrinkles. They let our AI (Ape Intelligence) grow. I went from yoloing into my first share ever to read tens of DDs and watching financial YouTubers all day every day.

2021-04-12 08:27:26,wallstreetbets,"JUST A FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT TODAY MAY BE THE LAST DAY TO RECALL YOUR SHARES IF THEY ARE LOANED OUT...

The shares must be settled before the record date, which most likely will be 4/15.

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall. Not proven but someone told me: ETrade may apparently loan any margin share like TD. This is not what the agreement says but I would call them to be sure.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your margin shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

Vanguard - Securities Lending Program, but I don't know any details about it because they don't appear to be public. You'll have to probably read your agreement...

Merrill - If you have a margin account, then your shares are loaned out, regardless of whether they are bought on margin or not. I don't know if you can have them recalled, you should definitely contact them and ask about your proxy vote rights. A note, this is by far the worst margin account I have ever seen, their agreement allows them to liquidate your account without notice at anytime, it's probably not a good idea to have margin from here....

Having a margin account does not mean that your shares will be loaned out, read your agreements or talk to your broker. After reading the above broker's agreements they loan out securities in these situations, but they may also loan them out if you bought the securities with margin, i.e. borrowed money to buy on leverage. You would need to ask your broker about that, they don't really appear to disclose that or it's probably in some addendum or some shit.

If you are unsure if your shares are loaned out, you should contact your broker."

Nothing is over until the masses say it is, and many analysts have move their targets up cuz they are learning that.  Also, you don't lose the money until you sell.  That's why folks make comments like ""I went to take a dump and came back, it was back up"" (best dump they've ever taken?)...This is because cuz in shoring environments, the dips usually don't mean anything if the others don't panic.  We all know GME is ""volatile"" - volatile stocks dip up and down a lot.

I spent the rest of the weekend just squeezing them. In my hands, between my legs, big hug squeezes.
My hands are sore from doing nothing but squeezing  my shorts all weekend.

I dont know if it helped, i dont know if me starting to squeeze my shorts will trigger any more shorts to be squeezed but here's to hoping!  At the end it the day, i'm just tryin my best.

Am i on to something?

2021-04-12 15:24:17,wallstreetbets,"I wish I actually knew what I was doing.  I started buying GME on February 24th (10 tix).  Bought a few more all the way up to $260 (adding another 42 tix over the climb upwards).  Then... it started sinking... and with every major dip, I've bought atleast 10 more tix.  Even today I bought another 5 at $160.   

Guys... I now have 150 tix to the moon, at an average of just about where things are right now.

My üíéü§≤ are strong and the support I get from all you real OG apes keep me goin... but, I simply don't know what to look for or notice.  I mean, even when there's no shares for these punkass Hedggie bitches to buy, they still seem to dip the stock.  

Is this so rigged against us that going to the moon might not be possible?   It just feels like they're trying to kill us off by thousands of papercuts.    Help me focus.  

And please don't hurt my Karma for reaching out.  We are here to help each other reach the moon together."

2021-04-12 14:38:01,wallstreetbets,"70mil shares exist of GME.

Institutions claim to own over 100mil shares.

GME Insiders own another 15-25mil shares

Retail owns (insert#) shares?

I'd bet retail owns on the high side of 50mil-100mil shares!    
If each WSB member owned FIVE shares you'd be at 45mil shares for retail.  A lot of people don't hold any...then there are our whales like DFV and some of you YOLO'ers.  FIVE shares per head seems like a lowball estimate.

I am personally not worried about the price.  I can do the simple math above and see there ain't enough shares to go around when it's time to pay the piper.

2021-04-12 09:56:04,wallstreetbets,"GOTTA TAKE OFF FOR A WHILE SO JUST A FRIENDLY REMINDER THAT TODAY MAY BE THE LAST DAY TO RECALL YOUR SHARES IF THEY ARE LOANED OUT...

The shares must be settled before the record date, which most likely will be 4/15.

If you have shares that are loaned out, recall them immediately. If you are unsure, contact your broker and make sure your shares are not loaned out. If they are make sure you can get them back and opt out of lending if you can. Otherwise you won't be able to vote at the annual meeting. Here's some information on what I know:

RH or eToro - You're screwed. They lend your share out, you have no control. Maybe they are nice and get it back for you so you can proxy vote but I am betting not... Maybe try to contact them, good luck with that...

Fidelity - Fully Paid Lending, must have $250k in assets, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall.

ETrade - Fully Paid Lending, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall. Not proven but someone told me: ETrade may apparently loan any margin share like TD. This is not what the agreement says but I would call them to be sure.

IB - Stock Yield Enhancement Program, must apply, sign an agreement, specifically lend out your shares, and get part of the daily fee. You would know how to recall your shares.

Webull - Stock Lending Income Plan, must opt in, they pick stocks to short, you must leave the program to get stocks back unless they are returned. You should probably contact them.

Schwab - Securities Lending Program, must apply, shares become part of a fund or something? You should contact them if you are unsure. I think you may have to contact them to leave the program as well to get your shares back, IDK.

TD - Looks like TD loans your margin shares out but IDK if you can opt out or if they will automatically recall your shares. It may be the same fund as Schwab, you should contact them to make sure your shares are not loaned out.

Vanguard - Securities Lending Program, but I don't know any details about it because they don't appear to be public. You'll have to probably read your agreement...

Merrill - If you have a margin account, then your shares are loaned out, regardless of whether they are bought on margin or not. I don't know if you can have them recalled, you should definitely contact them and ask about your proxy vote rights. A note, this is by far the worst margin account I have ever seen, their agreement allows them to liquidate your account without notice at anytime, it's probably not a good idea to have margin from here....

**Having a margin account does not mean that your shares will be loaned out, read your agreements or talk to your broker. After reading the above broker's agreements they loan out securities in these situations, but they may also loan them out if you bought the securities with margin, i.e. borrowed money to buy on leverage. You would need to ask your broker about that, they don't really appear to disclose that or it's probably in some addendum or some shit.**

3. Buy if you can

2021-04-12 07:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Futures are a bit lower this morning, with major indices in the U.S. all down about 0.2% to 0.3% as of 0645. Not much action in the bond market ‚Äî 10-year yields holding steady around 1.657%. Asia is seeing a bit of selling, with stock markets in China and Hong Kong down about 1%. The Nikkei in Japan is down about 0.8%. This all follows another record close for stocks on Friday. 

This week stands to be the busiest in some time with first quarter earnings season kicking off. That isn‚Äôt until Wednesday though, when the banks report. Before that we have CPIs on Tuesday. A bunch of Fed honchos are speaking this week, perhaps as a result of the inflation report.

We already had Powell last night on 60 minutes. It does look a bit like the Fed may be preparing for a spike in inflation with Powell saying ‚Äúwe're at a place where the economy is about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly,"" due to vaccines and fiscal support.

Not sure that will matter if tomorrow‚Äôs CPI numbers exceeds expectations. But we‚Äôll deal with that tomorrow. Speaking of expectations, the forecast for earnings is quite positive indeed ‚Äî maybe too positive. But we‚Äôll deal with that on Wednesday and later in the week.

So for now it‚Äôs another day of wait-and-see, and of course pontificate. No shortage of that. Big picture it still doesn‚Äôt seem to make all that much sense to bet against the market."

2021-04-12 16:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I love this system. Morgan Stanley, who was a prime broker for Archegos, and was one, if not the first, of the PBs they did business with to offload their VIAC positions a couple of weeks back after the PBs agreed to unwind their collective positions back in a metered fashion. So, not only was MS involved in this from the get-go, but they now have come back and are offering new, down-graded price targets and analysis for VIAC, Credit Suisse, and Nomura - the latter two are some of the other PBs that Archegos did business with and subsequently lost their shirts on as a result of MS‚Äôs fuckery. 

It‚Äôs absolutely wild to me that they can still be capable of making these PT assessments while all the meanwhile having been involved in this nonsense from the beginning. Not to get all tin-foil hat or anything, but I‚Äôm sure they made a ton when they liquidated their position ahead of everyone else and probably decided to short it all the way down for good measure and extra tendies, too.

2021-04-12 14:31:03,wallstreetbets,I'm surprised that NVDA (Nvidia) has 3 times the market cap of AMD considering AMD sells both cpu's and gpu's.  I guess Nvidia must sell a huge amount of gpu's.

Analysts will take a few days to analyze."

NeuroMetrix - NURO
-Releasing update to product line this year
-Long standing company producing external devices for pain relief (electrical stimulation) and diabetic nerve damage monitoring
-Recently cut down on cost and resumed focus on growth
-Q1 results are coming out later this month and they are close to profitable
-Market cap under 15 mil. and related companies are MUCH higher than that

Zynga - ZNGA
-Due to recent IP licensing deals and branching into the cross-platform market, I think the market cap could grow to be more on par with Activision Blizzard, putting the share price in the same ballpark too."

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Rudeness towards other Redditors, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Spreading incorrect information, ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

2021-04-12 10:45:16,wallstreetbets,"Downvotes? Really, kiddo?

Why do you downvote? Are you really that sad of a person that you have little fits of spite and have to reach out through a medium that has nothing to do with validity? You do realize karma is worthless right? And that downvoting a comment doesn't do anything to the legitimacy of what's in the post right? Or do you just ignore all of that because you're butthut and have to lash out like a baby in need of a circumcision? I mean seriously! You can't have a conversation with someone on the internet without angrily clicking the downvote button? Do you feel like you've had vengeance on me or something? I personally don't care about downvotes either way (by all means, call your silly downvote brigade on me, it means nothing at all to me), but I just find it funny how seriously you and others like yourself actually take these imaginary internet points. Reddit really is all you have, huh? Damn do I feel bad for you. But you know what? I don‚Äôt care! I‚Äôll rake in the coal! You‚Äôre logic is flawed, kiddo. Don't like what people are doing with it? Downvote me, that'll show 'em! Go ahead and press that down arrow, I know you're itching to do it. Think you're contributing to the community? ""Doing your civic duty""? Nope. You're just decreasing a meaningless number on the internet. You just want to hop on the bandwagon. Well POUNCE! O can hear you as your feet land on the cold real steel of the inside of the wagon. You know what? Enjoy the ride, for now. Maybe even stick your head out the window and feel the breeze while you reflect on the importance of your downvote to me. I'll even give you my word, this isn't even my primary account, kiddo. Downvote away, downvote to your heart's content. But listen kid, please remember rule 1 of reddit. Treat the other people commenting as if they are human beings. It is fascinating, however, that people ignore the fact that I am right just because the first two people downvoted me. From that point it is just snowballs. When people see downvotes, do they neglect their own ability or reason? It is similar to the fallacy of poisoning the well. Once they see the fact that others disagree, they assume that the person must be wrong, even if undeniable truth is on the other side. It is an interesting phenomenon, and I am not sure how reddit should address this issue moving forward. There needs to be a solution that prevents cases like mine from happening. If someone posts something truthful, it should be upvoted, not downvoted. It is imperative that we allow free speech and the truth to be shared. I don‚Äôt care about the karma. Hell, I‚Äôll gladly rake in the coal! But we must remember that free speech and opinions are key to our society and, more importantly, reddit. So, next time you want to downvote something, just think about what you are about to do!"

2021-04-12 11:15:52,wallstreetbets,"As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ‚Äúhigh‚Äù speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let‚Äôs just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn‚Äôt previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ‚Äúwhat was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?‚Äù This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field‚Äîyet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet‚Äôs hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since ‚Äúthe pass.‚Äù Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ‚ÄúOne hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?‚Äù Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ‚ÄúOne hundred fifty-two.‚Äù We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever do that to me again!‚Äù And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer‚Äôs club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ‚ÄúIt was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.‚Äù Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It‚Äôs ironic that people are interested in how slow the world‚Äôs fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it‚Äôs always a good idea to keep that cross-check up‚Ä¶and keep your Mach up, too."

2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Estimated Taxes, and why you (probably) won't need to pay them [U.S.] ***DISCLAIMER: I am not a CPA, this is not professional advice. Please consult with your CPA / tax advisor.***

*Newsflash*: Uncle Sam wants your money. He wants his share of your tendies, and he doesn't like waiting for you to file your taxes at the end of year. Instead, U.S. taxpayers have the privilege of paying quarterly estimated taxes. The estimated tax for the period Jan 1 - Mar 31 is due Apr 15.

This could be relevant for someone with large gains in Q1 (let's be generous and assume this is due to expiring options contracts, and not paper-handed selling). Regardless, if you had any realized gains, Uncle Sam wants his due.

**The good news is that many of you won't need to pay this** because of a handy safe harbor provision described [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040es.pdf), which says you won't face penalties so long as your tax withholdings match or exceed the total amount of federal tax paid last year (or 110% of 2020 tax paid if your AGI > $150,000). In this case, you can defer the pain until you file 2021 taxes next year. Not to worry, this will give the rest of the year to give back any gains from Q1!

**Example**: If you just worked W2 job(s) last year as your only income, and you worked those same jobs this year (same level of pay and hours worked, or higher), **then you shouldn't need to pay estimated taxes this year under this safe harbor rule.** Congrats, you can continue to YOLO your gains for the rest of the year!

**You may however** need to tweak your W2 job withholdings (form W4), for a number of different reasons including:

1. Annual inflation adjustments pushing up federal tax brackets, which will cause you to pay less tax in 2021 vs 2020, all else being equal.
2. If your AGI is above $150,000 in 2020 (you need to aim for 110% instead of 100% of 2020's tax payment)
3. If you owed the federal government money on your 2020 taxes (i.e. your withholdings weren't high enough for 2020 to cover all the tax you owed)
4. If your W2 pay and/or hours worked will be less in 2021 (and therefore will have paid less taxes and fallen below the 100% threshold set by 2020 taxes).

Now if you already did have big gains last year from shorting $CCL etc, you may still be able to avoid estimated payments by adjusting your W2 job withholdings to compensate. Your target of course will be higher to meet the higher safe harbor threshold, but you can withhold more of your salary, even up to 100% of your paycheck if needed (see ""Extra withholding"" on [step 4 of your W4](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf)).

It's at this point where you need to pay estimated taxes, if you **still** can't meet the safe harbor threshold by end-of-year by adjusting your W2 withholdings. The good thing is that you are allowed to make the payments evenly over each quarter (you don't have to pay all the tax from a Q1 windfall in Q1). However I'm not sure how favorable they would view this if you repeated the same feat each quarter. If large gains becomes a pattern, Uncle Sam expects to be paid accordingly.

You can also choose not to pay estimated tax and pay penalties instead. The interest penalty is assessed on a quarterly basis, determined by market interest rates. Somewhere I think I saw a 3% penalty rate for Q1 2021, but am now having difficulty sourcing this number.

In any event if your investment strategy is yielding more than 3% per quarter, then you are better off forgoing estimated tax payments and paying the penalties when you file your 2021 taxes. (Or of course if you're dead-set on giving back your gains to the market.)

A few other miscellaneous items to note:

1. You can also be **penalized for paying too much**. I'm not sure how much or where the details of that penalty is spelled out.
2. 2021 Q1 **estimated taxes are** [**still due Apr 15**](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes)**.** It was NOT moved to May like the tax filing deadline was for 2020 taxes.
3. States that collect income tax have their own estimated payment dates and rules, which can be different from Federal. Move to a state that doesn't have an income tax to be rid of this added headache.

For you to get a loan of $1M, you need to offer them something worth $3M, so they can cover their losses from having to loan to SOEs. Don't forget that the business model in China, by example, is not for your company to make money on what your company makes, but on whatever asset/help the government throws at you when you are big enough. Most medium-sized companies survive due to their real estate arms, not because they make a product that they actually produce and sell. All big-sized companies are in this position. I once was offered a position as sales manager at a top company in China, and when I went there to discuss my conditions I was offered a house (villa) in a compound owned by the company's real estate arm, which was about 90% of their profits."

I would guess that the issue is over for him, baba and ant. Typically rich guys show up all haggard, paraded on tv and then prison.

The bigger take is the gov sending a message that they won't take shit from anyone no matter how powerful and popular they are. Even going as far as hurting their own investments like baba."

There are some massive money laundering schemes that I am sure billionaires can use to get around the restrictions, but that is a pretty large additional fee to anything you get in china and would probably be very heavily scrutinized for any foreign billionaire.

If that doens't scream ""yes sorry my lord... you said you wouldn't fine us again after we say this right"" then I don't know what does.

The Chinese stock tax is already well in effect on BABA, as it trades magnitudes lower than it should with the financials it has.  Next, huge funds like Blackrock here in the US hold metric fucktons of BABA stock.  China isn't going to fuck around and absolutely ruin their international financial standing by cutting off one of their most traded stocks in foreign markets.  

The whole argument is stupid.  If you were arguing that it could be delisted on our end from our government, that is a more realistic scenario than what you are suggesting."

2021-04-12 04:32:04,wallstreetbets,"it is not dysfunctional if you think about it... 

Companies are given state-aid based on the number of employees they have, not on their profitability or growth. The state aid (be it central government or local government) usually results in land being leased for ""expansion"". Part of that land is used for factories, part is used by the newly created real estate arm of the company to build and sell housing. The profits that sustain the company and their business model come from land that was agricultural (cheap) being redeveloped as industrial (more money) or residential (even more money). This is done with the help of officials at the local government. Factories expand so they can get more employees working, and get more land given to ""expand"". None is done with the profits of the factories themselves, but with the profits coming from the real estate sales. Factories usually operate on bare minimum profits or loss in order to increase sales, therefore increasing production.... 

This is the way..."

2.	A huge unemployment problem as the first thing those companies will do when they suddenly have to turn a profit is lay off a ton of their redundant employees that they had only hired so they could get grants from the government.
3.	An under skilled workforce.
4.	Tons of land locked up with derelict developments that are beyond salvaging and now will cost even more time, money, and effort to eventually be torn down just so that land can be used again.
5.	Reduced agricultural capacity.
6.	An aging and shrinking population.

I just don‚Äôt see how this could end well for China. They‚Äôre literally just throwing away land by building more and more developments as their population declines, and the government can‚Äôt prop up an entire market‚Äôs worth of failing businesses forever. They‚Äôre incentivizing decades worth of stagnation that is going to kill innovation and leave an entire generation of workers and management without the skills and knowledge required to succeed in a modern industrialized economy. Maybe they can reverse their population trend, but it‚Äôs too late to stop it from taking a serious dip, which will further impact the housing market and workforce. It‚Äôs definitely a good way to rapidly industrialize, but it‚Äôs simultaneously setting them up for failure once they reach that point. 

Obviously there is a lot that is wrong with the CCP, but they aren‚Äôt dumb I don‚Äôt believe for a second that they‚Äôre stupid enough to deliberately torpedo their entire country so I feel like I have to be missing something here."

Enter an economy where factories are competing for workers (not for skills), and you pay based on the salary required in that area to get people to be working for you. You will compete with other companies doing the exact same product as you (as you cannot afford CMC/Molding/whatever), and all becomes a ""who-sells-cheaper-wins"" market."

2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Still Holding: Six Figures Loss on $NNOX &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ac3a0zjhfns61.jpg?width=1167&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9920c37bee66ebe19751362885f791404d84c6c

Encase you are wondering how these impressive results happened: 1) Lots of volatility on the the short sellers reports, when I got through the volatility, I kept trying to swing. My biggest success was I believe $20k to $159k. I think I actually added $20k again to the account AFTER it hit $159k but not entirely sure. Either way I am estimating the loss to be around $149k to $169k of unrealized gains, and a monetary/personal loss of over $30k. 2) Short sellers attack this stock alot. On FDA, it went up 70% premarket (but I have options), when I saw it was going down towards the day I was traveling and it kept going down. I was thinking a possible short squeeze would happen on FDA. Short sell volume and negative sentiment though was massive.

The results: Trust me my personal life is falling apart and things aren't looking good.

Anyways, positive it may have another spike up prior to call expiration, but would be nice if short sellers get a decent surprise prior to April 16 puts expiry. That said, I have IBS right now and a girl who is furious at me. Invest at your own risk."

2021-04-12 17:58:37,wallstreetbets,"For those of you that are wondering, I will be just fine.

I got longer calls and now I'm just holding as this is all I can do at the price point. I have a feeling it will rally soon and the pain will be all over. That said, invest at your own risk. This is still a major setback for me at the moment, but it is okay. 

I have multiple startups and can also start taking on freelancer work, and if things get really bad try finding a secondary job. I work many hours a week (sometimes 80 to 120) and as long as I stay motivated, I have a positive outlook that this can potentially be profitable. Either way, I shouldn't let major setbacks stop me from being motivated.

At times like these, sitting back and reflecting is okay.

Some people though aren't fine however. If anybody w/ financial losses or personal problems is starting to feel depressed, take a breather and go outside. Have friends, family and faith to help you out. If you are feeling hopeless or suicidal, remember there is Lifeline for emergency situations: [https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/)

As for me, I will be just fine and at worst I'm a bit bummed out. I will hold for now, see what happens, and work extra hard on this and all my other ventures as this is how you grow and edify yourself at times like these.

Always have a great outlook in life as money is just money.

A lot of apes are looking for that quick fix but these stocks don‚Äôt always move fast.  Even GME was stagnant forever with DFV holding options for months.

2021-04-12 00:30:25,wallstreetbets,Here‚Äôs the thing... ‚ÄúParamount +‚Äù isn‚Äôt ‚Äúnew.‚Äù It‚Äôs a rebranding of the CBS All Access streaming service. It‚Äôs the same service and it was not successful so they double downed and rebranded it. The masters had their own streaming app and it was not exclusive to Paramount. The NCAA tournament was not exclusive either. The only thing is the champions league for soccer and ESPN+ has a stranglehold on soccer for the Serie A. I don‚Äôt think this is the play but we shall see
2021-04-12 12:01:16,wallstreetbets,I bought at 42.92 I didn‚Äôt think a dollar increase would be that hard to get to

And also, I forgot who but when they did the offering at $85 a bank had to underwrite that and take that on. It WILL go up. 

This is legacy media with strong fundamentals but now they‚Äôre a streaming company as well so, it will trade like one. It still has a lower p/e than Netflix, take that how you will

2021-04-12 00:29:20,wallstreetbets,"Might be stepping out of my lane here a bit, but wouldn't this interface be hyper-efficient from a data transfer rate perspective?  Sure, good looking interfaces are great but modern chips and GPUs with a fiber line could absolutely HAMMER through data packets if they were displaying this and not a whole bunch of useless html crap just to make it look better."
2021-04-12 10:45:15,wallstreetbets,What software is this?
2021-04-12 12:59:41,wallstreetbets,"not everything in life needs to look like roblox. I know the younger generation has never had to suffer through command line prompts and think that knowing how to use iphone apps makes them ""tech savvy"". Hence why they are all investing in garbage tech companies like pltr and bb"
2021-04-12 17:52:32,wallstreetbets,"Just because it's not flashy or pretty, doesn't make it ineffective.

People who do a lot of work with computers typically do it from a command line interface which is the least intuitive, but most efficient way you can operate a computer. The terminal is similar. It is not designed so that just anyone can be plopped in front of it and off they go, trading all the things. It's designed for someone who is professionally trained to work as efficiently as possible."
2021-04-11 22:11:02,wallstreetbets,I cannot find out in the terminal... more wrinkled brains need to work this problem
2021-04-11 22:26:14,wallstreetbets,Does this thing have legend? I have gone through a few manuals.

2021-04-12 02:27:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes you're a dumb dumb.
Even if that figure is accurate (which it isnt), VW squoze to Infinity on 12,5% SI.

The STUPIDLY high institutional ownership proces synthetic shares, therefor shortpositions other than direct shorts"
2021-04-12 12:14:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the reported SI is 14.55%. But there are ways for them to hide the true SI: synthetics, FTDs, options, ETFs, etc. The bottom line is that other institutions are behaving like sharks in the water(+10% since 4/4). We can analyze and discuss all we want, but the big institutions with lots more resources/knowledge are buying more even at $160+. So for me, that's all I need to know."
2021-04-11 22:20:21,wallstreetbets,YW!!
2021-04-11 22:48:19,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah. And especially if you charge any less than 20,000/yr you‚Äôll be rolling in dough!!"

2021-04-12 07:32:56,wallstreetbets,"This. 

They can keep printing synthetic shares forever to beat us. We unfortunately will run out of money. And we can demand our cash accounts have real shares, and the companies like Fidelity or RH can just outright lie and tell us whatever they want as we don't have real paper shares, and they don't either. It's all computers which can be faked."
2021-04-12 03:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Um.. yea... but if there were 0 synthetic shares the value would be closer to 25-30.  The only reason GME has any value at the moment is because a bunch of big money assholes tried to short it to oblivion and got their balls caught in the cookie jar.

All of the current market value is 'MARKET' value, not fundamental value of the company.  If these assholes never tried to pull this trick, GME would continue to be obscure and dying.   They unintentionally revived the company a million times over with this play that our lord and saviour DFV has shot down."

Their UI looks so much cleaner and simpler to understand at a glance.

2021-04-11 23:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but to be fair here, buy/sell ratio should reflect a 1-1 buy/sell of positions by retailers. When Fidelity posts buy/sell, they're displaying the purchase/sell power of *retail investors.* It would be a huge assumption to insinuate that those who sold would have sold 4x their position versus buyers. So, in the end, more people on average should be purchasing shares than those selling, by a 4-1 ratio."
2021-04-11 23:37:12,wallstreetbets,"They'd risk it in order to buy more shares from retail, (by attempting to artificially deflate the stock price with the sole interest of scaring off paper hands and triggering stop losses). Basically, they're trying to cover some of their shorts by suppressing/dropping the stock price."

2021-04-12 00:10:46,wallstreetbets,"DTCC rules which go into effect *soon*. You'll have to verify which rules apply to specific scenarios, but one of the more recent rules would require MMs/Institutions to provide collateral when opening standard or naked short positions. This means that they would not be able to inject synthetic shares into the market without having said shares on-hand. 

The theory here is that once the rules are in effect, Citadel and others will no longer be able to continue injecting synthetic shares without paying out of their pocket. If the current buy power continues to persist, the stock price would naturally increase, to the point in which it reaches margin call territory, and the rest would be history. This also does not take into account the annual shareholder meeting in June, and the process of recalling shares which would take place this week. 

Suffice to say, Shitadel & friends are now backed into a corner and will be royally fucked at some point in the future."

Something like 10% of eToro users own shares, 1/10 Americans own shares, GME being the top traded stock in Europe over the past few weeks, etc. Add on top of that an abnormal # of deep ITM calls/puts, and if you put two and two together it basically spells out that there are synthetic shares being injected into the market.

Hell, [even FINRA has confirmed that institutions own more shares than the float](https://i.redd.it/b8aqf56cvds61.jpg). There's also a SS floating around of Fidelity's Friday buy/sell volume which was like 4.3-1. So, yeah  it's pretty much confirmed at this point."

My reasoning here is if just over 10% of new wsb subscribers own ""some"" gme. We know that some own less than one Share and some own over 10k shares. I'd say it's safe to say the average is roughly 25 shares. And less than half of traders who own gme would bother with reddit.  So if we represent a full half of retail investors who own gme that's at least 50 million shares. Obviously everything I've said is retarded but it has served me well."

2021-04-12 00:40:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it always seems the first thing to happen when someone makes a ""modern"" version is they group and hide things behind menu's/buttons so now something that used to take 3 keystrokes takes opening two menu's, selecting options, and scrolling.  One of our testing applications did this and it became a nightmare, a test that used to take 5 minutes to run and document now takes over 30 minutes, before you could just type and press tab to go to the next field, in the new one you have to select all the options and click a ""new item"" button for each additional item, it was prettier but it took what used to be a nothing task and made it start taking up half my day every day.  There is a LOT of data to type in so when you have to take your hand off the keyboard and click through a few menu's on a mouse between each item it really adds up when you're running thousands a day."

I think this GUI is fucking piss poor and almost anything modern would be a drastic improvement given time to adapt to the new system.

Hopefully the crooks who over-leveraged themselves go to jail after they go bankrupt for illegally trading and hiding all of the nefarious activity."

Given that information short interest has to be high. How else could all those people own shares? Short interest doesn't have to be over 100% for it to be squeezable."

2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WWE Wrestling: A play on collectables, reopening, against the odds growth, & shorts WWE, isn't that that the industry where grown men fondle each other for a living? Yes, yes it is. They are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and have been under the radar for a while despite all they have going for them coming into this week.

**Part 1: Collectables**

As you read this, World Wrestling Entertainment is holding their 37th annual WrestleMania event over this weekend from Saturday to Sunday. What makes this one different? Well for one, it‚Äôs the first event to have ticketed fans in attendance since the start of COVID. However, I'm more interested in their newly acquired money printer.

Enter the world of collectables: Where tweets go for $2.5 million, pixels sell for millions, and your local mailman is scrambling to sell their farts as collectables for $400 a piece. The NBA was quick to take advantage of this craze, selling a collectable of lebron james for $200,000 and has seen $230 million spent in trading on their platform.

What's the profit margin on something like this? What could be the cost of creating these pixels? As you probably guessed, it's an unsurprising near 100% profit margin. Collectables are making a comeback and WWE has been quick to notice. They have for the first time released a set of them this weekend to accompany WrestleMania 37. As I write this, their Silver Card have sold out at a total price tag of $37,000. The Gold currently has a bid of over $13,000. Lastly, Platinum has a whopping $100,000 bid with 4 hours left to go.

This marks only the beginning of something that will grow to a multimillion dollar revenue stream for WWE. Collectables sell, and when you have such a cult following as the WWE crowd, there's no shortage of people willing to pay big money for ownership. The media has been covering various sales recently, and we could see media attention in the upcoming week once the sales are closed out tonight.

**Part 2: Reopening**

In 2019, WWE had 310 live shows with generally sold out crowds. In 2020, they had 42. Q4 earnings fell 26% from Q4 2019. Revenue was 238.2 million, EPS of 16 cents. Pretty well below expectations. Now, that shouldn't be all that shocking, nobody could go see the shows. 2021 will tell a different story. This weekend‚Äôs Wrestlemania 37 is the first event to have ticketed fans in attendance since COVID-19 started. The company has announced a sell out crowd of 25,675 fans in attendance for Wrestlemania 37, and the crowds will only get larger from here. It is already rumored that Wrestlemania 69 is set to take place on Mars.

Putting aside the obvious upcoming growth, WWE has already seen a year over year increase in operating income to 332.5 million. A near 74% increase from 2019. All of that with COVID, how could that be? The bulk of that increase is coming from rises in content fees. WWE knows what they are doing. They are smart with their money, and are ready to slingshot into orbit with old(Live Audiences) and new(collectables) revenue streams just now coming into play.

Which brings me to my next point. WWE has been in an agreement with Saudi Arabia to do two shows per year. The cost is $50 million per show. These shows didn't happen in 2020 and WWE was not paid their due $100 million. Instead, WWE has extended the contract until shows can resume and this agreement lasts for ten years.

Now, $100 million doesn't seem like a lot in the context of a company with a 4B market cap, but considering that WWE raised its operating income by nearly 74 percent to 332.5 million WITHOUT the expected $100 million from the Saudi's is nothing short of impressive. How can a company that should have been held down so much during COVID just keep prospering?

**Part 3: Shorts**

I know what most of you are probably thinking. ""GME first"" or ""ItS hEaViLy ShOrTeD"", but I just couldn't leave this one out. Nearly 20% of the float is short with 7 days to cover. This is a prime example of a stock that is turning everything around and is about to go ballistic in terms of revenue. Now I'm not saying a squeeze is imminent, but it‚Äôs not out of the realm of possibility. With all the news and new revenue, I see many exiting their positions this upcoming week, gradually driving the price higher. This is a stock that has hardly been touched by retail investors and has 40% insider ownership, so the possibilities are endless.

Disclaimer: I‚Äôm a retard just like anyone else on here so obviously do your own research before jumping in.

(read the entire post, its a shit tldr)**TLDR**: WWE is taking full advantage of the collectable craze and their cult following this weekend as they release their first collectables, with bids already at $100,000. They just keep financially prospering in a time when they should be suffering. 2020 was their most profitable year in WWE history despite no live audiences. This weekend‚Äôs Wrestlemania is the first show to bring in a live audience since COVID started, selling out and bringing in over 25,000 fans, and this is just the beginning. Revenue is about to explode from live shows, collectables, and reopening. The cherry on top is the 20% short that is going to send this to the stratosphere this week.

**Positions:** WWE shares and $5k worth of 4/16 60 strike calls in my IRA, individual, and RH play account.

2021-04-11 21:46:31,wallstreetbets,"I was literally just looking at this stock before I even saw this post. If that's not a buy sign I don't know what is. Fuck it, I'm in."
2021-04-11 21:25:34,wallstreetbets,Why do you think they had record profits this year? They didn‚Äôt have to travel. I‚Äôm staying far away from this one.
2021-04-11 21:47:49,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I'm been holding since their earnings dip. Even as a wrestling fan, AEW isn't going to kill them, but rather competition is key. They are pushing themselves to remain a quality product.

If you aren't a follower of the product, just listen to Bianca Belair's Hair Whip from last night: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzmGHP7PVoo

And people FUCKING LOVED IT.

Edit: Just to add, I visited Target over the weekend to see how WWE's toy sales were - nearly sold out.

Position: Smaller than OP, but still in it"
2021-04-11 21:12:36,wallstreetbets,"Not reading all this but WWE just had record breaking profits this year so can't go wrong. 



Typed while watching Wrestlemania."
2021-04-11 22:17:33,wallstreetbets,Their house shows were at best cash neutral and very very few were sold out
2021-04-12 02:24:07,wallstreetbets,Let's not forget that they did endorse eN eF Tees for some of Undertaker's iconic moments in between matches. NGL I'd get puts because I'm an AEW mark.
2021-04-12 01:44:03,wallstreetbets,"Why oh why did you put in the squeeze angle? ""For the redditors"" I assume. That's how I know this is B.S. Proof of positions?"
2021-04-12 09:38:00,wallstreetbets,"I have a different point of view here.

First. The travelling and live events are not a significant source of revenue compared to the tv deals.
I could argue that it's even a marketing expense.

Staying in the same place sure saved them a bunch of money buy made the product a lot less interesting... they lost more than 50% of thier audience which was already in decline before pandemic
This decline does not really have a financial impact yet because the tv deals are fixed for a few years. But once they have to renegociate... the revenue will fall like Mick Foley from the top of a cell in 1998.

Also, the deal with Saudi Arabia is sketchy. The last two shows litterally had diplomatic issues involving propaganda and military. Many talents do not want to go anymore, fearing for their lives. There is no way this deal will last 10 years witout someone getting shot"

2021-04-12 02:50:55,wallstreetbets,"New President and CRO Nick Khan is having them diversify away from their WWE Network streaming offering, into selling off their intellectual property and increasing corporate sponsorship, as content is king for many larger streaming services (such as NBC's Peacock), while their broadcasting rights (USA, FOX) will continue to grow along with other sports dominating the DVR advertising reality.

Former Etsy Exec and current WWE CFO, Kristina Salen has a background in finance including ""managing a global media and telecom funds with Fidelity Investments and working as a financial analyst with Oppenheimer Capital, Merrill Lynch Investment Managers and Lazard Freres & Co,"" which leads me to believe that the WWE has finally found an executive which actually understands the need to maximize shareholder value (as she mentioned in interviews upon receiving the position), as the company is grossly undervalued... worth 10X its $4.5B market cap!

In @ $49.78, can you dig that sucka ?!"
2021-04-12 08:27:41,wallstreetbets,"Knowing little about wwe, you can trust the stock to make money purely on the fact that a member of the McMahon family literally comes out to the song, ‚ÄúHere comes the money‚Äù. Also there is the fact that wwe will put a snickers logo on anything"
2021-04-12 15:24:24,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been following this for awhile. Significantly undervalued-analyzing the fundamentals alone show that.

2021-04-12 08:05:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm all over this wwe shit...bought low a few weeks ago and it's been rising every fucking day.
Mania was actually really good this year and hopefully we get a good Raw....fans are gonna be coming back and the money is gonna start pouring in.
We can turn wwe into the new meme stock lol"
2021-04-12 08:06:01,wallstreetbets,I thought WWE has new competition from other wrestling brands and that they don't really do Pay Per Views anymore.
2021-04-12 08:07:32,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't call it as popular as it used to be or anything even close to that.
In the 90s they were getting 8 million views a week for Raw....on thier best day this year they maybe got 1.4 million.

There's no big stars anymore that can draw in a large crowd.
No Rock...no Austin...just Reigns.

Wrestling will always be popular but it will never hit like it did in the 90s"

2021-04-12 10:17:38,wallstreetbets,"A buddy of mine got into WWE about 5 years ago when they first launched streaming and made a killing.  Money in The Bank came to Philadelphia so we got nosebleed seats and just drank beers while not being able to see anything.

What was amazing though is that every kid had like 3-4 articles, minimum of WWE gear on.  That's all IP at 100% margin.  Sure, the roadshow tickets don't make a ton of cash but they bring in merch and grow the brand.  They give local kids something to look forward to.  I""m in.,"

2021-04-12 15:30:44,wallstreetbets,"I also think that once this gets some momentum, which it will given price targets, the meme factor should not be ignored. Literally every day there is some WWE meme posted here. The nostalgia from when we were kids, and the perfect selection of memes will also push it further."
2021-04-12 16:03:43,wallstreetbets,Let's not forget about their 75 million subscriber count on YouTube.  Puts them in [the top ten worldwide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels)

2021-04-12 07:03:07,wallstreetbets,Brah you should've posted your DD a month or so ago after the earnings hit. I hate when people post their DD on a rise. I should write DD as it'll be at good buying opportunities
2021-04-11 21:54:42,wallstreetbets,"If you want some more support to OP's DD, $WWE ended last week PRIMED for a massive [cup and handle](https://i.imgur.com/REAjXzK.png)."
2021-04-11 21:37:19,wallstreetbets,Amen.
2021-04-12 10:43:17,wallstreetbets,Their TV revenue is higher than it's ever been. The travel schedule doesn't hurt the bottom line.
2021-04-11 21:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Correct, but if it was that simple then they wouldn't host live shows at all. I am betting on the fact that they were already so profitable in addition to reopening audiences and collectables. Everything is pointing towards exponential growth here and there is a lot that is not being priced into the stock."

With AEW, if you look at /r/SquaredCircle, the consumers are consuming both"
2021-04-12 10:23:35,wallstreetbets,Much of the market is red for now... Also profit takers and day traders getting out after making a play on the weekend.
2021-04-12 15:47:07,wallstreetbets,"While there isn't any official say, its pretty much expected to stay in the family - either his son Shane or daughter and her husband, Stephanie and Paul Leveque. Shane went out to China to make his own in business before coming back into the company; Stephanie and Paul have worked extensively building the WWE brands. I'd be terrified if it wasn't either of them"
2021-04-12 03:20:02,wallstreetbets,Its actually more popular over the last few years than it ever has been.

2021-04-12 08:36:57,wallstreetbets,"You def should, I agree I picked up on this a bit late but I think this has much more room to run."
2021-04-11 21:48:38,wallstreetbets,"But to me it does seem that simple. There‚Äôs a demand for live shows, therefore they will travel again. Haul ALL of their shit across the country, pay for all of the travel expenses for employees, etc.. On top of that, they‚Äôve got competition with AEW which is arguably a better product (just what I‚Äôve heard). It‚Äôs hard for me to see where they‚Äôre going to add any sort of revenue when they just made record profits during a pandemic. Wrestling is more fun with a live audience, I just don‚Äôt see it being more profitable."
2021-04-11 21:48:55,wallstreetbets,And they pay dividend or did?
2021-04-12 06:34:14,wallstreetbets,It metaphorically can go tits down
2021-04-12 08:37:36,wallstreetbets,"They're consuming both because Coronavirus and no concerts or dates or bars.

Just streaming and swiping on Tinder in the hopes of bumping into your ex.

Once the economy reopens, people will have to choose.

Plus I cannot imagine they make a lot of money off of Peacock. It just sounds like a throw in to keep their USA deal."
2021-04-11 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure they're all contractors. They get paid per appearance mostly. They pay their hotels and hire cars. The big boys get their own private stuff paid for from vince.
2021-04-11 21:58:25,wallstreetbets,"RE: AEW - While AEW has hurt their share price in the past, I believe this is more a matter of ""competition is king"". Plus, if you visit /r/SquaredCircle its not ""only WWE"" or ""only AEW"" - they watch both equally.

RE: Travel - I recognize that as a risk, but combined with their booming eStore sales from last year, partnerships with DraftKings, and larger exposure with Peacock, that will be offset."
2021-04-11 21:50:58,wallstreetbets,They do indeed pay a dividend but it was so low I did not bother mentioning it. Additionally they have earnings coming up April 22
2021-04-12 08:55:24,wallstreetbets,"In the super long term, sure. If AEW were to go public, then I'd imagine it would hurt WWE's pps, but as it stands I don't see that. I'm biased since I'm a wrestling fan, but they consume the crap out of it - WWE, AEW, indie wrestling shows. This is a niche market revenge buying play. Some people want to go on cruises, some want to go to Disney world, others want to go to big name wrestling shows."
2021-04-11 22:22:57,wallstreetbets,"They are. Think about equipment and behind the scenes staff. Cost of venues, etc. I get both sides, but I‚Äôm not bullish on this play at all."
2021-04-12 06:31:02,wallstreetbets,What is the partnership with DraftKings? Can you gamble on WWE matches???
2021-04-11 22:36:05,wallstreetbets,I'm really hoping they mention how much the Peacock deal benefited them
2021-04-12 08:59:29,wallstreetbets,"I'm like WTF about the Orton / Fiend match like anyone else.

But the fact of the matter is there WWE went from charging like $50-60 per WrestleMania to a Netflix like service where people can watch the event with a free one week trial.

I think you have to focus on the Economics. And I would be very concerned about the trends."
2021-04-12 08:29:20,wallstreetbets,"They did some ""guess if X wins/happens"" over the weekend for Wrestlemania, but I believe they've done gambling before. Also WWE [has investments in DraftKings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE#Investments)."
2021-04-12 09:07:56,wallstreetbets,"I acknowledge this isn't an open and shut case; this still has significant risk and from my own DD, the stock is heavily tied to fan sentiment. Despite a good earnings in Oct '19, the stock plummeted due to WWE's untimely Saudi Arabian show after the journalist was killed. I'm hoping for positive news toward their next earnings call that the Peacock deal was a successful turnover for the company."
2021-04-12 08:37:10,wallstreetbets,that's mental. wrassler a or wrassler b to win. House sees final amount at stake. Instructs Wrassler c to come in and win. House wins.
2021-04-12 08:58:50,wallstreetbets,"Some of the guesses last night were a little more focused - like whether Wrestler A or Wrestler B would do more ""spears"" or if a foreign object was going to be used in A vs. B's match; but yeah, people are on betting on scripted shows.

ALCON[:](https://u.teknik.io/m8DIr.PNG)

Be advised we think we found out who Canoo is using to contract manufacture the MPDV.

**INTEL** suggests it's [Metalsa](https://www.metalsa.com/global-presence) a Global Tier 1 automotive manufacturer and with a factory located in Hopkinsville, KY and announced an [expansion March 11th.](https://www.wkdzradio.com/2021/03/11/hopkinsville-metalsa-location-announces-expansion/)  That particular factory makes battery operated EVs. On  2/24/2021 [Canoo  registered a foreign corporate entity in KY](https://u.teknik.io/Ru32w.PNG) and their [director of launch quality](https://www.wkdzradio.com/2021/03/11/hopkinsville-metalsa-location-announces-expansion/) has a lot of automotive experience with ford in KY. Additionally, **Metalsa** is working [with another EV startup ](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2020/08/18/2080119/0/en/Xos-Trucks-Raises-20-Million-Partners-with-Tier-1-Automotive-Supplier-Metalsa.html) which is a startup ""L.A. based mobility company"" (sound familiar) that does larger trucks.  **Canoo** recently mentioned doing an even larger MPDV platform. They also mentioned working with medium/heavy oems in their 10k.

Obviously this isn't confirmed but with the [6 percent that Magna demanded from Fisker,](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/auto-supplier-magna-will-take-a-6percent-stake-in-fisker-and-build-the-electric-car-startups-first-vehicle-the-dollar37499-ocean-suv/ar-BB1a3IpW) I doubt that Tony would accept such terms...

Seems like the [the perfect people to manufacture a electric vehicle skateboard to me](https://u.teknik.io/m8DIr.PNG).

Also worth noting, Canoo does not have a business registered yet in Texas called ""Canoo"".  Nothing crazy here about that they have an office there and everything.

**Also worth noting that the address registered in to Canoo KY  is 4 miles away from that factory.**

Yet again WSB might be dabbing hard on the Tech Press.

**TLDR: Canoo registers foreign corporation in Kentuky 2/24/21, local news reports international auto manufacturer located 4 miles away is expanding to include EVs 3 weeks later.**

This is why I'm staying away from this stock. Statements like this, which are so absurdly non-sensical.

There was no failure?

If the CFO didn't implement proper financial controls, that means the CEO didn't properly monitor the CFO. That is a huge failure of the CEO.

This company sold itself to investors with a COMPLETELY different sales pitch: We're going to change the way you buy a car, and instead sell you a subscription EV.

NONE of that is any longer the case.

Hyundai is partnering with us.

Uh, no, they're not.

Every week, it's a new story out of these guys. CEO doesn't attend the first earnings conference call? WTF? Has that ever happened in a well-run operation?

Oh, you're going to manufacture your new EV in Kentucky? Have ya'll ever been to Kentucky? I have. I wouldn't let Kentucky retards pitch my tent.

Canoo finished their beta vehicles last year, and they are now working on their gamma vehicles which they believe will be complete later this year/next year. How does Steve Burns intend to jump from beta to production without fully testing? I can only imagine the tsunami of lawsuits of vehicles engulfed in flames from using untested and unvalidated hub motors that have never been in consumer vehicles due to inefficient cooling, lubrication and maintenance in such a tight package.

Steve Burns plans to begin production in 5 months from now. How will they complete (and pass) crash testing or even a 500k mile road test?

This race isn't a walk in the park.  Dozen's of entry's every year fail to cross the finish line.  The endurance makes it in the 16 hour deadline -- it will be a boost.  They make is significantly under that time it will be a huge boost.  if they fail to finish (aka break down, leave parts along the race course, get stuck and can't get out) it will be a huge blow to their stock.

Comparing LMC to Tesla... Just remember one has Elon Musk and the other has Steve Burns. I guess any poser can claim he can do what Elon Musk has done, but as for me, I will wait to see when you get a man to space before I believe that.

Beyond the ridiculousness of attempting to compare LMC to Tesla there is the simple reality that the support Elon Musk was given by those who believed in him is not something Steve Burns will ever get. If you are not sure, well 20 years between Workhorse and LMC of never successfully bringing a product to market (sorry a few million in revenue over the years is not a success by any measure) should be sufficient reason to be cautious about anything Steve Burns claims.

You really want to get down to it... In those 20 years, Elon Musk had been involved with Paypal (a company with $4B in profits last year and a market cap of $312B), SpaceX and Starlink (valued at about $74B and perhaps the most successful space flight company of all time), the Boring Company (which has dug a tunnel in Las Vegas already and is poised for major expansion),  Neuralink (well who knows what will be with this), and of course Tesla.

Note the differences between Steve Burns and Elon Musk. One has ideas and is able to go about implementing them with real products that have been major successes and the other... well... still waiting.

Please don't ever try insulting anyone's intelligence again by trying to compare the two (at least until Steve Burns can prove himself)."
2021-04-12 09:30:43,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think anyone is making this comparison. Tesla is in a league of their own. But before you try talking down LMC CEO Steve Burns, just know that he developed the patents that were eventually used for Apple‚Äôs Siri. He sold the patents to Nuance.

https://www.cincinnatimagazine.com/article/steve-burns-wants-lordstown-motors-to-build-the-worlds-best-electric-pickup-truck/

Also, news just broke (literally today) that Microsoft acquired Nuance.. for $20 billion. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/microsoft-to-buy-nuance-communications-for-19-7-billion-11618231523

My point being this: Steve Burns isn‚Äôt anywhere near Elon Musk, but he‚Äôs much smarter than you give him credit for. I saw your username frequently saying bearish things about $RIDE. You either have puts or are short. Regardless, good luck with your position. 

Come back and look at these comments in about a year and we‚Äôll see who‚Äôs right."
2021-04-12 15:52:26,wallstreetbets,"Wow . . . I hit a nerve with asking a question you didn't answer in all that rambling.
I've never said Musk isn't a highly intelligent person.  Quite the opposite.  I admire everything he has done.  One exception, his use of wacky Tobacky.  Hopefully he keeps that under control and doesn't throw away all that he can do in the future.
Lordstown is going after a different market segment than Tesla.  Just like Workhorse is going after a different market segment than Tesla and Workhorse.  Canoo -- I still havn't figured out what market segment they are going after.
And you can't deny with all his (Musk) intellelgence, TESLA didn't turn a profit for over 10 years.  He has competition coming.  Not only from Lordstown (trucks -- even though they will be marketing to different segments).  The Big auto makers are going to be switching over to EV.  China has some EV companies (and you know damned well China will protect them market when it comes right down to it).
I've got stock so far in Tesla, Canoo, Workhorse, and Lordstown.  Again, each will be going after a different segment of the pie.
I sure as hell hope you don't think musk will be marketing the cyber truck to construction companies, and other fleet managers.  Way that thing looks, and how the bed on it is fairly unusable.
If Burns makes his Fall production schedule, I believe he's positioned well for that market segment.
The one the Musk needs to keep an eye on is Rivian and their truck.  Oh wait, Musk DOES have his legal eye on them."

2021-04-12 16:26:35,wallstreetbets,"Best I can determine.  Workhorse was essentially founded in 2007 (14 yrs).  They have a product, they are selling it.  Lordstown is essentially a spin off from it they wanted to focus on the delivery vehicles (that they get orders for and produce and deliver).  Fall we should find out of LMC will have a product that can be sold.  I still think if their vehicle finishes the off road race, it will be a big boost for them."
2021-04-12 17:04:03,wallstreetbets,"Per wiki:

""The company was founded in 1998 by investors who took over the production of General Motors' P30/P32 series stepvan and motorhome chassis.""

Their revenues in 2020 were $1.4M... See my comment from two back where I clarified already that a few million in revenue is pretty much irrelevant.

Bottom line, when Steve Burns brings a successful product to market I will believe it then, until then I think the odds are that it never happens."

2021-04-12 01:59:45,wallstreetbets,"1 stock costs many monies. Too expensive. Make every one stock now 5 stocks. Stock now reasonably priced, more people buy. Everyone has 5x more stocks than before. Monke happy.

1x = 500  
is now  
5x = 100.  

Or 2x or 3x or 10x etc."
2021-04-12 03:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs say that bananas price is worth 500 tendies, but too high for little apes and that they can‚Äôt afford more than one. 

The banana issuer can say, ok we will split the banana price in 5, so each banana will worth 100 tendues instead of 500. And each one who already owns a banana will now have 5 bananas. 

If you own 10 bananas, you‚Äôll still worth 5000 tendies, but now you‚Äôll own 100 bananas. 

Basically same shit different pile, but a stock split is a sign that the company is doing well and little investors can enter the game. In the past Apple couldn‚Äôt get over the $700 bar. They‚Äôve split 7 for one and they flew over the $100 easily. Just a psychological bar that changes."
2021-04-12 04:13:58,wallstreetbets,Stocks split is okay but not great. However reverse stock split is the ultimate sin. Never go reverse stock split üò•üò•üò•üò•

Then because sentiment is *buy* at -2T the stonk is most likely due for a rebound so it's likely super high and anticipated to stay there lol"

2021-04-12 10:09:06,wallstreetbets,"Buffet would say that having a higher share price (generally) targets a different class of investor. Berkshire-A shares currently trade around $400,000 a piece, so at least he‚Äôs practicing what he preaches. 

There is also perceived value, despite having similar market cap‚Äôs some find a stock trading for $1000 to have more intrinsic value than one trading for $100. This is probably due to the fact that we have stupid brains that anchor to the first number we see. 

Finally, platforms that allow fractional investing have made it less necessary. In the past you had to actually buy individual shares of the stock, you literally got them on pieces of paper, but that isn‚Äôt how it works anymore so having an attainable price isn‚Äôt as important. Not to mention the stratification of people who are in the market as retail investors has shifted as wealth concentration has shifted. Your grandma buying 10 shares of Apple with her Christmas bonus money and then holding them until she retires is a lot less common."
2021-04-12 09:54:42,wallstreetbets,"The company itself chooses. Berkshire A shares will never split (according to Buffet) and they currently run about $400,000 a piece. 

Nothing forces them to split, it‚Äôs a choice."
2021-04-12 02:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Not true. It would lower the value of 1 stock but it isn't creating more shares and selling them, it would increase the amount of shares each shareholder has, while lowering the value of each share (1 share x $1000 or 10 shares x $100 =$1000 ) this could somewhat delay the squeeze but at the same time could speed it up because more people would find the price to be more affordable/attractive.

Compare this to the share sale AMC is considering, they're looking to add more shares to their company and will sell them - this would allow shorts to buy shares needed to cover, where as a stock split doesn't give them the ability to buy shares because it only affects shareholders, even if it did effect short sellers, they would now have even more short shares to cover(if they borrowed 1 share and 1 share becomes 10 shares, I believe they would now have 10 shares shorted)"

When the stock split (into 4), I suddenly had 200 shares of Apple, worth around $100 each. Guess what? Those shares rose to almost $150 each at one point. So instead of making $50 x 50 shares, it's $50 x 200. In 100 years Apple could go right up to $400 again (no doubt in my mind, in fact). That's $300 bananas x 200 shares for me!"

Like, if you buy (2) contracts of Stock XYZ for .50 at a strike of $50 and then XYZ (let's say) raises to 75/share. You obviously have covered Breakeven by that point. The premium is only $100 and would've ¬¢50/share so you really need XYZ to reach $50.5 at least. 
  
Do you then *only* get whatever profits come from the stock going down past the strike? The way I understood it an ITM call is worth the underlying as well. But now I'm thinking I'm dead wrong on that? Like stock XYZ is now worth 75 so technically you have (200 x 75) worth of gains. But do you only get the (200 x (75-50))?

In this case- you can basically forgo the premiums in calculation and essentially think of yourself owning 100 shares of that stock at 50.5$ per share. Every dollar share gain- you gain 100$ because you ‚Äúown‚Äù 100 shares. 

If your call is OTM then most of your profit will be from premiums and extrinsic value. But with deep ITM calls, your profit will be 99.999% from the intrinsic value."

2021-04-12 17:51:46,wallstreetbets,"Your 3rd paragraph is kind of wrong. 

It doesn‚Äôt really matter (fundamentally) if you buy 1 contract worth 5k vs 100 worth 5k. 

The gains would be the same if the stock moved same. Because a small percentage of the 1c is probably in dollars while small percentage of 100c is in cents. 

Essentially, the reason reason people prefer 100 contracts over 1 for same price is that the 100 means you bought it in cheap- means it was probably a stock that is more volatile and hasn‚Äôt found it‚Äôs true price. It‚Äôs essentially the same reasoning as buying penny stocks rather than blue chip or preferring 30 shares of Apple rather than 1 Amazon share. People ‚Äúthink‚Äù one is better because big number but usually it‚Äôs the same."
2021-04-12 13:57:42,wallstreetbets,I know. That's why the prices are so great on puts. Only need to right once to earn $100k on a $2k bet but so far lady luck has not been on my side.
2021-04-12 18:11:24,wallstreetbets,Hey thank you for educating me like this. Here I was thinking my PLUG 29c would be worth 2000+ just past the strike.
2021-04-12 14:36:19,wallstreetbets,"What kinda puts are you buying where you will get a FIFTY TIMES multiplier on your money??? Lol you'd have to assume it drops so hard by next week to get that. Just go to Vegas and go to roulette and put it all on a single number and you'll have far better odds.

Edit: Went to options finder and if you plug in expected drop to $370 by 4/23rd with entry of $2000 then you could indeed make $100,000, but that would be a huge fall in a short amount of time."

So even if the shorts start tomorrow with some initial short bs and Chong Li throws some dust in our eyes, we have to remember our training. The only way to finish this week with a roundhouse kick to the hedges faces, is if we keep our calm and remember our training. Remember our shidoshi trying to hit us blindfolded during dinner, and remember the dim mok!

2021-04-11 23:18:39,wallstreetbets,"I am fairly certain he already exercised or made up his mind to do so. Remember why he got into GME in the first place, and remember how he did not sell at the peak. The man truly believes in the company and did so when everyone else thought he was insane.

&#x200B;

To not exercise is to go against his thorough and well thought out thesis."
2021-04-11 23:52:15,wallstreetbets,I'm new to all this whats going on?
2021-04-12 00:02:15,wallstreetbets,Hes gonna make us all cry tears of joy

2021-04-11 21:12:49,wallstreetbets,What if this is a way to encourage apes to execute on their calls rather then just sell them causing there to be massive demand?
2021-04-11 23:12:04,wallstreetbets,the options only cost $600k. pretty sure he will exercise those options and probably double down with his $11mil. then RC gives him a seat on the board for the lulz.
2021-04-11 20:05:44,wallstreetbets,It certainly seems to me like this DFV feller is on to something...maybe I should acquire more of that tasty stock.
2021-04-11 20:14:24,wallstreetbets,"Is there anyone with the God-like Social Media status of DFV right now? 

Seriously this guy could probably start a twitter war with Elon Musk himself and probably win. Or at least give Musk a heck of a fight. He could probably sway elections in a lot of locations like San Diego or Austin by low-key endorsing candidates."

2021-04-11 20:18:21,wallstreetbets,"I remember someone saying that his options have already been hedged for, would him exercising really have that much of an impact on price?"
2021-04-11 20:24:27,wallstreetbets,LOL
2021-04-11 20:32:24,wallstreetbets,"Could someone explain what ""excercise"" means?"

2021-04-11 22:08:54,wallstreetbets,Has anyone looked at whether DFV exercising his options could trigger a massive FTD?  Whoever sold those calls now has to provide all those shares ... is it possible they can‚Äôt?
2021-04-11 22:25:10,wallstreetbets,It was 70% all when I voted a little bit ago.

2021-04-11 23:16:12,wallstreetbets,"From The yeet:

Recall your lent shares by switching from a margin to a cash account 

Why? Because when loaned shares are recalled by the owner, the short seller they lent them to is required to come up with tangible, actual shares to close out the position

So...call.¬† No, literally, screw the metaphor‚Äîactually call your broker if you own GME, and switch from a margin account to a cash account to recall your shares!¬† The winning hand is still on the table, and it‚Äôs up to the players to play it."

2021-04-12 00:09:14,wallstreetbets,Would would happen if he exercised or didn‚Äôt exercise?

2021-04-11 20:21:25,wallstreetbets,After and if he exercises would it be possible for him to hedge himself to get margin called on himself and sell to himself at an inflated price to push up the price?  I'm new to this part of the game.  Only cause I'm worried his calls are already hedged.
2021-04-11 20:23:12,wallstreetbets,"It would be priceless if he would do a countdown on twitter before he excersizes the options (and the squeeze starts). Fireworks someone?
Then again, better not because it‚Äôs better to not give HF‚Äôs the opportunity to do a short attack exactly then."

2021-04-11 20:56:28,wallstreetbets,"For his options, he should exercise ALL.  Tighten the float."
2021-04-11 20:57:44,wallstreetbets,Exercise all baby
2021-04-11 20:57:48,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock. Might as well go balls deep.
2021-04-11 20:58:08,wallstreetbets,"The year is 2025, DFV now has an OF for stock tips hahaha."
2021-04-11 20:58:13,wallstreetbets,Does he mean exercising his option calls???
2021-04-11 20:58:47,wallstreetbets,"If he keeps this up, he could eventually, literally, get a seat on the board.

My Roth transfer needs to come in and liquid already so I can drop another 15k on tendie tix."
2021-04-11 20:59:18,wallstreetbets,All dummy
2021-04-11 20:59:35,wallstreetbets,Surely for max pain it would be best for him to sell his calls and with that money buy more than the 50k shares?
2021-04-11 21:02:28,wallstreetbets,Arm Day or Leg Day. That is the dilemma
2021-04-11 21:02:31,wallstreetbets,Lol it's at 69% now
2021-04-11 21:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Its cracks me up thinking theres probably a Hedgie somewhere drafting an email right this second, asking the bosses for authorization to spend 10 million on Twitter bots to brigade this poll and vote exercise none."
2021-04-11 21:04:10,wallstreetbets,DFV owe me child support payments
2021-04-11 21:05:10,wallstreetbets,Exercise All üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
2021-04-11 21:06:20,wallstreetbets,"This has probably been said hundreds of times but can you imagine being the dude that wrote those calls? No matter how they‚Äôve played it since then, rest assured there was a LOT of GUH-ing"
2021-04-11 21:06:38,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an exit strategy‚Äù THE MAN SAID THOSE WORDS!!!! His conviction is higher now than its ever been
2021-04-11 21:06:57,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm confused, can someone less retarded than me explain por favor? Is he talking about exercising his GME options."
2021-04-11 21:07:26,wallstreetbets,And perhaps later friends of HFs will use this as some sort of conspiracy charge.
2021-04-11 21:07:45,wallstreetbets,"Excercise all,  but only if you like the stock"
2021-04-11 21:09:29,wallstreetbets,@69% in favor of excercising all right now
2021-04-11 21:11:18,wallstreetbets,Yeeesss! #All of it!!

2021-04-11 21:21:10,wallstreetbets,Trying to keep it on 69%
2021-04-11 21:21:52,wallstreetbets,Excercise at 3:30 to do maximum damage if they haven‚Äôt already bought shares to cover
2021-04-11 21:23:25,wallstreetbets,He gon exercise. Even from the grave X gon give it to ya
2021-04-11 21:23:49,wallstreetbets,"while i 100% think he should exercise, will this have any effect at all?  

50k out of ~50 mil is only 0.1%

domino effect could have a bigger effect though"
2021-04-11 21:24:19,wallstreetbets,Your vote matters!!!
2021-04-11 21:26:12,wallstreetbets,"I voted all!

2021-04-11 21:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't it be better if he sold the options and used the premium to buy shares?  The sellers of those options probably already have the shares on hand, but he could probably nudge the market by buying shares on the open market.

Edit: I really don't know the answer to this, this is not a rhetorical question"
2021-04-11 21:41:42,wallstreetbets,Greg is mah boiiii

2021-04-11 21:52:09,wallstreetbets,Kinda surprise he didn‚Äôt exercise when it topped $200 last month. Or during the January run up for that matter.
2021-04-11 21:54:11,wallstreetbets,So I should be all in?
2021-04-11 21:54:52,wallstreetbets,"If he doesn't get the answer he quite wants, he'll shake it again lolol.

Gotta love this mad lad."
2021-04-11 21:55:27,wallstreetbets,Why would I give a fuck it's his money?

2021-04-11 22:03:24,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah, but what will happen with the stock itself? Will we see more dipping, or could the price go up?"
2021-04-11 22:04:58,wallstreetbets,How many short sellers do you think  are paying Twitter bots to vote exercise none?
2021-04-11 22:05:33,wallstreetbets,Makes you fill out a poll but won't do as you say... definitely a kitty
2021-04-11 22:06:13,wallstreetbets,"Somethings wrong, it‚Äôs not at 69%"

2021-04-11 22:16:24,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt believe he was really asking for our opinion. The answer was already written. DontFuckingVend.... he will exercise all.
2021-04-11 22:18:21,wallstreetbets,"I would imagine that, if he doesn't exercise them then the hedged shares for them would likely get dumped back on the market by the MM. Am I correct in my thinking?"
2021-04-11 22:29:47,wallstreetbets,Apparently Owly doesn't support Polls or I'm too much of an Ape to figure how to see it. I just see the 8 Ball.

2021-04-11 22:31:35,wallstreetbets,Upvote.
2021-04-11 22:32:52,wallstreetbets,"You know why this is genius? Because any market manipulation lawsuit his defence would be, ""I did what everyone else told me to do""."
2021-04-11 22:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, how much would you make if you bought a single call option for like $500c 4/22 expiry, and the squeeze happened before then?"
2021-04-11 22:36:34,wallstreetbets,What the fuck has this come to lmao watch this shit manipulate the stock that day. Idfk
2021-04-11 22:40:32,wallstreetbets, Exercise daily! 6 daya if you can üòÅ

2021-04-11 22:45:31,wallstreetbets,what happens to share price in theory when he exercises?
2021-04-11 22:46:51,wallstreetbets,So blastoff is friday right!
2021-04-11 22:47:26,wallstreetbets,What would exercising all do?
2021-04-11 22:48:12,wallstreetbets,Exercise and sell 800c to the apes for a few more weeks.

2021-04-12 06:27:41,wallstreetbets,He should have excercised these when they cut off buy orders in January. That would have possibly set off the squeeze we were hoping for. Today these contracts don't have the same power and it doesn't really matter what he does at this point. It was a wasted opportunity imo.
2021-04-12 06:50:31,wallstreetbets,does this mean he's selling? am stupid ape

2021-04-11 21:55:38,wallstreetbets,"I kind of read is as ""Execute all now, half now half later, or all later"", since executing them now would help push the recall numbers faster and higher.

But who knows. Guess we'll get a yolo update at some point"
2021-04-11 23:42:14,wallstreetbets,Besides if he wanted to sell them they‚Äôve lost ass loaded of value since the first run up
2021-04-12 02:29:21,wallstreetbets,He could sell the contracts and make the difference in price plus time value.
2021-04-12 09:25:36,wallstreetbets,"I think he thinks that if he can blame it on the memestonk retards, then he can cash in and still retain his plausible deniability with respect to market manipulation.

2021-04-11 20:50:31,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, some people saying he won‚Äôt exercise them... I have to believe they‚Äôre jealous cuz they can‚Äôt be that stupid lol"
2021-04-11 21:27:53,wallstreetbets,Why would he exercise any? At this point the calls have intrinsic AND extrinsic value. At expiration they lose all the extrinsic value. Selling the calls before expiration while they still have extrinsic value will make more money than exercising.
2021-04-12 00:28:48,wallstreetbets,Move on to other investments?
2021-04-12 07:04:28,wallstreetbets,Because selling the options yields more money than exercising the options.

2021-04-11 21:28:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah he‚Äôs not turning to a Twitter poll now hoping for help in his decision making but what exactly is he up to ?  He could have exercise it In March when shares were run up past 300 or even after it halted and then rose back up to 270. He knows what he‚Äôs doing already .
2021-04-11 21:30:34,wallstreetbets,Well people are assuming the calls were already hedged in advance of him doing this so it wont move the share price supposedly.
2021-04-11 21:35:10,wallstreetbets,Hopefully it creates upward pressure but 50k like pissing in an ocean when millions of shares trade everyday
2021-04-11 23:22:59,wallstreetbets,"Another person who doesn‚Äôt understand options...The contracts have very little extrinsic value left now that it‚Äôs so close to the expiration date and are so deep ITM. If he exercises them, he will make nearly as much money as if he had sold the contracts."

2021-04-12 01:28:28,wallstreetbets,It's likely the MM has already purchased those shares to cover since they would be  expecting options so fully in the money to exercise.
2021-04-12 00:12:45,wallstreetbets,Vote on his Twitter
2021-04-12 05:38:19,wallstreetbets,Lmao I just came here to see that exact comment

2021-04-11 23:54:09,wallstreetbets,"....The options are to exercise them, sell the contracts, or do a mix. Literally nobody is saying ‚Äúlet them expire worthless.‚Äù"
2021-04-11 23:32:38,wallstreetbets,"He has April 16 $12 calls. Each of these gives him the right (but not the obligation) to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 each before that date. He has 500 of these options, meaning he has the right to buy up to 50,000 shares (500 x 100) of GME for $12 each.

So if he chooses to exercise all of his options, he can buy 50,000 shares of GME for $12 each and own them. His other option is to sell the options to someone else for them to exercise.

In terms of what will happen, not much. Maybe some small change based on ape hype but 50,000 is a drop in the bucket when volume is in the millions."

2021-04-11 20:24:13,wallstreetbets,He could sell them for a few mill instead. If I read correctly they expire on Friday.
2021-04-11 20:33:56,wallstreetbets,A few claim they thought he meant actual physical exercise and didn‚Äôt understand the question.
2021-04-11 20:20:25,wallstreetbets,Your shares multiply by 10 and the share price divides by 10.   E.g.  you own 1 share that‚Äôs currently worth $100. After a 10:1 split you‚Äôd own 10 shares and the share price would be $10.
2021-04-11 20:38:14,wallstreetbets,Most likely

2021-04-12 07:46:01,wallstreetbets,"You do realize exercising the call buys the shares yes? Lol there aren‚Äôt ‚Äúextra profits‚Äù from exercising to buy more shares than the contracts are worth aka the 50,000 shares for his 500 contracts.. so I‚Äôm a little confused what you are trying to say lol"
2021-04-12 07:44:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah bc they expire Friday.. what‚Äôs your point lol

2021-04-12 06:33:53,wallstreetbets,This comment tells me you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. He exercised calls during that time and not only that but the shares are already owned by someone. He owns the contract to buy them from that person at a lower price than the current share price.
2021-04-12 09:56:39,wallstreetbets,"No, it means he is exercising his options to buy additional shares at a low price. The options expire today."

I think if I remember he bought a LOT of call options at 4 or 12 a share. Meaning for each contract, he has the option to buy up to 100 shares per contract at that price.

Given how high gme is now, each share could be immediately resold for 40x profit, if it were $4 a pop.

Added wrinkle, his 15k in options translates to 1.5m in shares that need to be covered by the people who sold him the contract, if he had the money to call every option, which means price movement."

2021-04-11 20:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Because it was heavily shorted, a lot of people that missed out on GME bought AMC"
2021-04-11 22:32:15,wallstreetbets,"It was a cheap stock that had high-ish short interest.  People are retards, and don't realize that 1 stock at 120 = 3 stocks at 40 = 2 stocks at 60 and they like having ""more"".

There is no real AMC squeeze and I'm pretty sure it is and has been a HF campaign to distract from GME, but once a bunch of idiots on WSB bought into it you can't talk truth because they don't want to lose money. Fuck AMC, the GME squeeze would have gone off already if it wasn't for that insanely stupid shit.

AMC just took bonuses and sold stock when the price jumped.  It will still go bankrupt and the leadership have no intention of trying to save it. Ryan Cohen and the gamestop squeeze is entirely different.

2021-04-11 23:09:03,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs already got 100k, so this would be upping his position by 50% to own approx 0.2% of GameStop lol"

2021-04-11 20:43:48,wallstreetbets,Greg fucked my wifes boyfriend
2021-04-11 21:34:42,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs only 11 numbers
2021-04-12 01:07:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. He knew what the answer was going to be. Therefore he must have posted the poll on purpose knowing what everyone would say.

This seems like a clever way of telling everyone he‚Äôs exercising everything without just saying it outright."
2021-04-11 20:28:40,wallstreetbets,What's the profit if he exercises all and then sells
2021-04-11 20:38:39,wallstreetbets,The question becomes... When?
2021-04-12 04:08:11,wallstreetbets,"Do you know when his calls expire or in other words when he exercises?

Gonna buy the dip hard but want to be done average buying the dip before he exercises"
2021-04-12 08:50:11,wallstreetbets,What does exercise all mean
2021-04-11 20:13:27,wallstreetbets,"On the other hand, selling the options would be a taxable event with long term capital gains, exercising would defer any taxes.  So if he sells and buys shares, he has to pay taxes on $7-8M next spring (probably would cost him at least 2.5M), if he exercises, nothing until he sells the shares.

In my opinion he will exercise all, because a) the tweet, b) it may pump the stock higher, c) he can lock in gains at any time anyway with an options collar, d) MA has high cap gains tax and experts think there's a good chance the SALT cap will be liberalized by the Dems, so might be worth deferring, e) it's very tax efficient to to donate shares to charities like saving the apes, f) he likes the stock."
2021-04-12 00:35:19,wallstreetbets,This is literally not true and all the prices are public obviously so you can do the math yourself and see.
2021-04-12 04:50:56,wallstreetbets,"Nope, because he'd pay taxes on those gains"
2021-04-11 21:44:30,wallstreetbets,"It just means that instead of selling all of your contracts that you bought the rights to (your 'call') and taking profits you exercise your right to buy all of the shares at the agreed to price (in DFV's case it's $12/share). When he exercises he will buy 50,000 shares at $12/share ($600k) but the value of his purchase is ($7.35 mil)."
2021-04-11 23:44:14,wallstreetbets,That's understood. I think we interpreted this differently. I didn't think he was polling for market open. I just think he was trolling.
2021-04-11 20:27:14,wallstreetbets,"Is this about exercising early, or on time?"
2021-04-12 04:54:29,wallstreetbets,No reason? What about taxes ?
2021-04-11 22:09:29,wallstreetbets,Well he sold his last batch of calls.
2021-04-11 21:31:45,wallstreetbets,"I think you misread the comment, but i do agree with your sentiment."
2021-04-12 04:55:28,wallstreetbets,They have zero extrinsic* value at this point. Selling would mean paying taxes on the profit he made

2021-04-12 00:16:40,wallstreetbets,Because it‚Äôs more difficult to exercise 420% of them
2021-04-11 22:05:08,wallstreetbets,What's the difference between selling the contracts vs exercising them and selling the shares?
2021-04-11 23:19:57,wallstreetbets,"Even if the broker did not secure the 50k shares, that is such a low amount all things considered it will barely move the needle."
2021-04-11 20:51:14,wallstreetbets,But doesn‚Äôt he have cash millions in brokerage account also? Could he anticipate broker covering sell contracts and then use that cash to buy shares and would this be as profitable to him while moving the price up?
2021-04-11 23:49:33,wallstreetbets,"just to send a message, he should sell the options and then use the profits to buy at market price."
2021-04-11 23:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Current Delta is -0.0002, so more than likely the MM has picked up 0.9998% of shares required - 49,990 shares should already be purchased."
2021-04-12 02:12:04,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, who would want buy those contracts off him with only 4-5 days left until they expire? Wouldn‚Äôt the break even point be higher than the current market value of the stock? Meaning you‚Äôd almost certainly lose money if the stock price doesn‚Äôt jump since the EV is all dried up? Or am I missing something?"

2021-04-12 07:11:22,wallstreetbets,"When this is over he can start his own private investment fund. With 150.000 shares he only needs GME to go to 10k and he has 1,5billion dollars."

2021-04-11 20:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Thousands.  He owns 500 options (contracts) to buy at $12.  Each one is good for 100 shares. 50,000 shares @ $12

2021-04-11 23:07:30,wallstreetbets,"If he exercises and then later the stock stonks in a squeeze then he makes more money then selliing contracts now

What does he think will happen?

Are we at the peak now? Or not?

I guess we will see what he thinks. I already know what I think..."
2021-04-11 21:40:50,wallstreetbets,This is nonsense. His broker doesn't have to cover. The other side of the contract covers. And it definitely won't move solely based on him taking ownership...
2021-04-11 20:49:29,wallstreetbets,Then sell contracts and use the 11 million cash to buy more? Maybe it‚Äôs a stand-off and his broker doesn‚Äôt know wtf to do if it‚Äôs only a possibility covered in advance?
2021-04-12 02:12:38,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn't it be the same whether he sold first or exercised and then sold after?
2021-04-12 00:10:18,wallstreetbets,All of them bro. ALL OF THEM
2021-04-11 21:34:19,wallstreetbets,Understood but what about the 11 mill in cash ready to be used for whatever purchases he wants.  He can buy at current price. 11 million worth does that have an impact? I‚Äôm just speculating if he is using leverage somehow to prevent the calls from being covered in advance.
2021-04-11 21:24:23,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused and I really don‚Äôt see him holding this long as a symbolic gesture if they have already been hedged and won‚Äôt impact the current price. He‚Äôs up to something.
2021-04-11 21:32:38,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, I own shares and calls but the social sentiment and community surrounding GME is becoming obsessive, greedy, and flat out ignorant (I actually think it‚Äôs become a sickness). A floor of 10m is fucking insane/irrational and for people to even vote in favor of him exercising those calls is even more insane. In my opinion if people really cared for the man they would urge him to sell, it would be life changing for himself and his family. I wasn‚Äôt calling out anyone in particular."
2021-04-11 21:41:43,wallstreetbets,But why not exercise  calls on the way down from the 300 run up in March and make more than he would now by selling?

2021-04-11 20:29:59,wallstreetbets,And? He's never consulted anyone else about his other (now expired) call options like the ones in January. He's just doing it for attention and he's not taking this seriously. That sets off alarm bells
2021-04-12 01:35:54,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-04-12 01:50:28,wallstreetbets,"not what I asked, as per my question I specifically worded to not get this kind of answer."
2021-04-11 22:59:28,wallstreetbets,Then GME would immediately be back up to $100 from everyone buying the stonks.
2021-04-11 20:39:04,wallstreetbets,Lol. That video was great
2021-04-11 20:33:32,wallstreetbets,But he gets money and not a falling stock.
2021-04-11 22:10:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah but it would mean that twice as many shares would be out of the market when hedgies begin to cover.

2021-04-12 06:56:39,wallstreetbets,I understand how calls work. If those shares were owned by MMs then that would have been 50k worth of buys. When they cut off buys because it was about to pop. Were you even there bro?

2021-04-11 21:50:58,wallstreetbets,Is he playing the market or IS he the market?
2021-04-12 07:51:33,wallstreetbets,He bought at ~38 which I think was less than a dollar above the low for that day. So yea he timed it about as good as it could be. Also he didn‚Äôt post his Yolo of the double down till after market close. So he didn‚Äôt cause the reversal until after market close and we rallied back to above 40 by market close that day. I remember cuz I thought I got mine at a steal at 40 exact. And then he showed me the error of my ways.
2021-04-12 08:42:19,wallstreetbets,">Did he time the dip, or did him doubling down cause the reversal and MAKE it the low dip?

He timed it. Go look at the daily or average volume. It's being measured in the tens of millions. With spikes as high as 40-50 million. 

His buys might be enough to move it a little bit, but he's not big enough (even with WSB) to move it to 100+ points."

2021-04-11 22:45:20,wallstreetbets,And I wont think twice to put that stimmy straight in **GME**
2021-04-12 00:20:06,wallstreetbets,What if he sold 69% and used the cash buy a shitload of 6/9 call options?
2021-04-11 21:11:59,wallstreetbets,Do you mean sell the contracts early and buy more shares if the price dips? It's possible. DFV has impeccible timing.
2021-04-11 21:16:44,wallstreetbets,"Oh heck yes, I'd buy even more. ü§§"
2021-04-11 20:45:49,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I thought he had 15k contracts. Did he exercise some already?

If he had 15k contracts, that'd be 100 per contract, or 1.5m shares."
2021-04-11 22:51:16,wallstreetbets,I believe it‚Äôs actually in a retirement account
2021-04-12 02:31:22,wallstreetbets,"Eh, maybe not. He didn‚Äôt enter his GME position based on shorts, he entered it because he‚Äôs a value investor and simply thought the stock was massively undervalued. The short side of this whole story was seemingly not a big part of his analysis if you go back and watch the hour long video in its entirety. This was also kinda just a perfect storm of events, and while short squeezes happen, something like GME is really rare and won‚Äôt just happen as soon as DFV posts another DD."
2021-04-12 07:47:22,wallstreetbets,"It is impossible for gme to reach 10k a share...

Capitalitazation of gme is currently 11 billion.

At 10k a share the company would be worth 704 billion.

The current largest companies are about 400 billion.

It is literally not possible for it to reach 10k, I hope people who believe that it will reach 10k are like 10 years olds.

As an adult you shouldn't be that stupid..."
2021-04-11 20:57:31,wallstreetbets,"Goddamn.

That's such a bargain. I knew he had a lot of contracts, but 50,000 shares as a result?

He gonna take them all obviously."
2021-04-11 23:17:34,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-11 21:39:57,wallstreetbets,Why would he buy more contracts at this price? His strike is at 12 dollars.
2021-04-12 04:37:17,wallstreetbets,"If he sells the contracts, they still get exercised, it will just be by whoever buys them off him. By selling the contracts, he can get more money and put that profit into buying shares"
2021-04-12 00:11:06,wallstreetbets,Vote on his Twitter!
2021-04-11 22:06:48,wallstreetbets,this is correct and no one in here understands how options strategy works
2021-04-11 20:32:08,wallstreetbets,Last time you ppl Here said that 3.5mil is nothing.
2021-04-11 22:07:11,wallstreetbets,As deep as these are ITM whoever is short on those calls is likely already fully ready to let go of those shares.  Should be minimal pressure on stock price.
2021-04-11 21:36:32,wallstreetbets,DFV is not running any squeeze plays. I hate to break the news this way but he‚Äôs loooking at reported numbers at short interest and probably considers there being no chance of an upcoming squeeze especially not a moass. He‚Äôs a value investor.
2021-04-11 22:06:36,wallstreetbets,What are you asking? These calls are almost 100% already covered. If I sell a call short 100 shares of mine are locked away until it expires or is exercised.
2021-04-11 21:54:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah don‚Äôt think for a second he‚Äôs really basing his decisions off a damn Twitter poll lol he already made his mind up.
2021-04-11 21:52:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah obviously but long term holding is going to be a profitable investment. The floor was 1k when I got in and I held that as the utmost highest  possible outcome from RYan Cohen involvement and move to digital commerce. DFV still holds a position for many reasons but 500 million a share is definitely not one of them. Long term play four shares of GME amounts to beans
2021-04-11 21:42:19,wallstreetbets,He would be selling the contract for a premium not selling shares he already owns.
2021-04-11 20:04:23,wallstreetbets,Take money where you can
2021-04-11 21:53:14,wallstreetbets,Because he has a gambling addiction
2021-04-11 22:00:54,wallstreetbets,Hindsight is 20/20. When this hit 420 in January he probably SHOULD have sold and bought this dip with all those tendies. But he clearly believes that gme is undervalued and there's no way he could have predicted some of the price action we have seen. It's basically the ethos of Diamond Hands.
2021-04-11 21:32:40,wallstreetbets,I have smooth brain
2021-04-11 23:24:57,wallstreetbets,Your puns did not go unnoticed
2021-04-11 21:21:53,wallstreetbets,So let‚Äôs assume that DFV has assumed that in advance as well. Does the cash on hand in his account that he can just use to purchase shares at current price have any sort of leverage to prevent the calls from being hedged in advance?
2021-04-12 11:02:32,wallstreetbets,"If they already bought the *50,000* shares to hedge, that means functionally the same thing happens, just the bump is already accounted into the price. Either way, I'm fairly certain they don't have the underlying shares to hedge considering they, like HFs, were likely trying to play the long game and drag the price down enough before they covered to make it less detrimental towards their overall position."
2021-04-11 20:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Poor response to an actual explanation. Your post tone/rhetoric took a 180 a few days ago. Let me guess, bought out by Melvin?"

2021-04-11 20:40:00,wallstreetbets,"He has decided himself 100,000 times that he ‚Äúlikes the stock‚Äù, so in his opinion it‚Äôs worth a lot more, so it‚Äôd make sense for him to have an appreciating asset rather than depreciating cash. He is under the impression (and so am I) that the stock price will sky rocket soon, so it‚Äôd make sense for him to do it, although I could understand if he was looking to cash out, that selling the contracts would be easier"
2021-04-12 13:17:42,wallstreetbets,Show me where ? NOWHERE he says such things get lost Melvin's intern and nice try ü•±üñï
2021-04-11 22:45:27,wallstreetbets,"He has 500 contracts expiring Friday. If he exercises them he will be buying 50,000 shares at his contract price"
2021-04-12 07:01:59,wallstreetbets,"He bought them way last year. They were already hedged a long time ago. It‚Äôs a transfer of ownership and brokers stopped buying. They weren‚Äôt preventing the exercising of contracts either. I have owned since before the January spike so yes, I was there and I still don‚Äôt think you understand what you‚Äôre talking about. Even if they needed to buy the shares, 50,000 volume isn‚Äôt a crazy buy order. Especially when the volume during the spike was 100 million plus."

2021-04-11 22:05:34,wallstreetbets,"He exercises the option for shares. Each option is worth 100 shares. So if he has 200 call options at $12 strike he can exercise them for 20,000 shares for $240,00. Then he can sell them for whatever the market price is. If market is $200/share his proceeds are $2.4M for a gain of $2,160,000."
2021-04-12 01:05:06,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs 500 calls at $12 strike. So he‚Äôll need to pay $600,000 to buy 50,000 shares."
2021-04-11 21:18:25,wallstreetbets,"I can't easily find his more recent updates, but he had a number of them, including at 4, 8 and 12 bucks.

He very well may only have the highest priced options remaining, and his contract seller has probably been quietly buying shares after how odd the stock has been moving.

Or not, I don't trade for a living and offer no advice"

2021-04-12 08:37:39,wallstreetbets,Want to talk luck? I was dressed as his wife April 9th 2021!
2021-04-12 04:02:15,wallstreetbets,Same here. Waiting list is huge. He likes to talk with them too or some weird shot like that I heard.

2021-04-12 11:11:00,wallstreetbets,I don't see what any of that has to do with my point. Besides it's not like Lehman Brothers was even in that sector
2021-04-12 13:37:00,wallstreetbets,"Right. So why do the lines move together?  What could possibly be happening here?  Hmmmm... You‚Äôre gonna say something like ‚Äúoh blah blah blah market timing and sometimes it does that. No correlation ya ya ya‚Äù.

2021-04-11 20:52:37,wallstreetbets,Oh wow. That‚Äôs insane if he managed to make this play in a Roth
2021-04-11 21:20:59,wallstreetbets,"No, you‚Äôre wrong and this is an easy point to prove empirically. Look at the most ITM call for GME. The spread at any time will be significantly wider than the stock spread.

EDIT: To further clarify, why are deep ITM options quoted with a larger spread than the stock? It‚Äôs because for a number of reasons, the stock leads the options, in delta space. Meaning that if the stock moves, deep ITM options instantly become worth a different price by simple math. Market makers in those options need to quote wider to account for this uncertainly. 

There are derivative relationships where this relationship does not have to exist in a fixed direction. For instance, the S&P 500 future (ES), despite being a derivative, actually leads most S&P 500 stocks."
2021-04-11 21:25:51,wallstreetbets,Maybe I misremembered then. What's the strike on his 4/16 calls?
2021-04-11 23:18:38,wallstreetbets,"If you have a spare 2.5 hours, I recommend inthemoney's [intro to options](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjRnKpwDyw) on youtube, he does a good job of explaining how it all works."
2021-04-11 20:49:01,wallstreetbets,Intrinsic value is just share price - $12 x 100 shares per contract.  Theres also a bit of extrinsic value left on these that theta hasn't eaten up yet.
2021-04-12 00:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if the share price is $150 and the strike price is $12, the contracts are worth at least (150-12)x100 each, which would be $13,800. There‚Äôs also a bit of extrinsic value there too, so they‚Äôre worth a bit more than that."
2021-04-12 00:34:04,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs small but not inexistent. The price can still change to be deeper in the money before Friday. It has a delta of 1, meaning that the contract will increase/decrease in value by $1 for every $1 the share price changes."
2021-04-12 13:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Why would the price dip? If anything, it'd rise. More likely, nothing happens because whoever sold him those assumes they'll be exercised and already owns the shares."
2021-04-11 20:53:22,wallstreetbets,Well it's tendies that I neeEEeeEEeeEEeed
2021-04-11 22:03:21,wallstreetbets,"there are so many things wrong with this post. you have zero clue about how options work. first of all, his broker wasnt who sold him those calls. it could be anyone. could be someone on this sub, could be a mm. more than likely, it was a mm. either way, there are two possible outcomes: they were covered calls or they were delta hedged and were bought up by the seller as they got closer to the srtike price.
here‚Äôs the deal: either way, at this point, these calls are now covered and will not require buying by the contract writer. even if dfv sells and doesn‚Äôt exercise, whoever buys them WILL exercise because they‚Äôre so in the money. his actual position will not affect the market value because there will not be buying, however, his tweet could build hype. 
point here is.. there is so much wrong information in this thread"
2021-04-11 21:49:12,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't it cost a brokerage $7mil? That's a lot of money to us apes but that seems like it would hardly be a blip to a broker.
2021-04-11 22:08:15,wallstreetbets,I mean the brokers risk management would‚Äôve gotten screwed ages ago. No successful brokerage would do something like that or they wouldn‚Äôt be in business lol
2021-04-11 23:32:26,wallstreetbets,">  if his broker hadn't covered these and is hedging that he sells the options

who would he sell the options to?   
surely someone eventually exercises the options anyhow?"
2021-04-12 02:29:45,wallstreetbets,"If they were expecting to buy back the option, they'd already be prepared to drop most of the purchase price of the shares in cash. To hedge against price fluctuations, they'd want to buy some combination of shares and calls...."
2021-04-12 02:35:05,wallstreetbets,The market maker is the one who buys and holds these shares and it‚Äôs done and adjusted automatically
2021-04-11 20:52:51,wallstreetbets,Is that why DFV has cash on hand? Can he just sell his contracts and then use that  what 11 mill cash to buy shares? Or does it balance out ?
2021-04-11 20:36:16,wallstreetbets,Each contract is an option to buy 100 shares
2021-04-11 21:20:22,wallstreetbets,If he exercises the game is over right? GME stock will devalue to a non-hype price?
2021-04-11 20:38:46,wallstreetbets,He is asking now bc he know the squeeze is not gonna happen and he want to justify the sell.
2021-04-11 21:59:14,wallstreetbets,"Even if he purchases shares, again why would he at markets price when he can exercise them for the 12 dollar strike. His shit is deep ITM.

It would cost him 600k for 50k shares. He would have shares rather than cash. Shares are worth 150 dollars rn lol I personally would exercise."
2021-04-12 05:10:14,wallstreetbets,"DFVs broker might have bought them for him already in anticipation of him exercising the contracts, so it won't make it move (or at least not by much). By selling and rebuying, it would make it move more.

That might not be the case, I was just answering the question with one potential benefit to not exercising"
2021-04-11 21:28:29,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-11 22:32:09,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a wash, the calls have no extrinsic value anymore so sell or exercise will be just about the exact same value proposition."
2021-04-11 22:16:50,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs still plenty of us trust me.

2021-04-11 22:05:38,wallstreetbets,"That's true he sold all 1,000 of his 01/20 $20 & $10 calls and 500 of his 1,000 04/16 $12 calls. I was referring to his current position."
2021-04-11 21:46:43,wallstreetbets,Because I‚Äôm an idiot who took adderall way too late today. Say he chooses to do whatever with his calls. He can just buy shares out right with that cash and it will move stock price despite the hedging of his calls? I‚Äôm just speculating .
2021-04-11 23:18:38,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not how this works, but you‚Äôre being condescending as if you know what you‚Äôre talking about. The blind leading the blind...

DFV gets them at $12, but he is not the person who SOLD the calls, he bought them. If the seller sold naked calls, then they absolutely WILL have to buy the shares at the current market value and immediately sell them to DFV for $12. So for every contract they wrote, they lose (current price - $12)x100, which is about $14,500 per contract.

If they sold covered calls (i.e. they already owned the stock at the time of selling the calls), then they obviously don‚Äôt have to buy the shares because they already have it, but it‚Äôs the same result: they will have to sell their shares for $12 each despite being currently valued at $157, a loss of 14,500 per contract.

They also could have bought the shares in between selling a naked call and now, since the contracts would obviously be ITM, but the end result is again the same. Losing a net value of 14,500 per contract"
2021-04-12 02:11:58,wallstreetbets,"No. That is short selling.

Options are premium contracts you can buy or sell that give you the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell shares at a fixed price. Contracts for buying are called call options, and contracts for selling are called put options. They also have expiration dates, and if the share price is above the target price (for a call option) or below the target price (for a put option) they aren't worth anything. You can trade options just as you would shares of a stock. Most people, especially on wsb, buy options with the plans to sell them prior to expiration. If the price of the underlying stock goes up, generally speaking, the value of call options goes up and put options goes down, and vice versa if the underlying stock goes down.

Deepfuckingvalue owns quite a few call options for GME stock that expire at the end of this week. Their target price is like $12 (way below current share price) so the contracts are extremely valuable. Those contracts give him the right to buy several thousand more shares of GME at a much much lower price than it's currently worth. Once he owns them, those shares would instantly be worth their current price, so if he were to make the purchase (**exercise the option**) he would probably make several million dollars instantly and it might be an upward catalyst for the stock in general, so a lot of people want him to do it. The price he originally paid for the contracts is like a fee that he's paying that allows him to buy shares at much lower prices. That's what exercising means in this context.


He could also theoretically just sell those options before they expire as they are worth several million dollars. Whoever buys them may choose to exercise them, or wait even longer before they sell. The last person holding them on Friday before they expire will be forced to either exercise them or, if they lack the funds to purchase the shares at the specified price, I think they expire worthless.

Prior to the GME short squeeze becoming really popular and the subscriber count of WSB doubling in like four months, options trading was the dominant topic on this subreddit. You can make a lot more money with a much smaller cost basis trading options, but there is higher risk because they all have expiration dates and even small changes in the underlying share price can cause option prices to be volatile. I really recommend doing your own research before trying to trade options."
2021-04-12 02:09:42,wallstreetbets,if he exercises he gets 50k shares for 600k which is a steal ... he won't sell because thats gives the hf 50k to short of actual shares not synthetic shares. SI  should be at 148%
2021-04-11 23:09:34,wallstreetbets,People that exercise there calls are basically gambling with their earnings thinking that it‚Äôs gonna be worth more later
2021-04-12 07:09:02,wallstreetbets,"That is a huge assumption that they were lending them out. We have no idea who wrote the contacts and the volume had not slowed that much. Don‚Äôt blame one guy for something that would have had almost no impact. A single order or a callback of 50,000 shares wouldn‚Äôt do anything. People even tried coordinating a buy at a specific time with volume over 50,000 orders and it rose for a total of 2 minutes and the downward pressure kept it going. We are small fish. Even DFV is small compared to the big players. We are just along for the ride."

2021-04-12 03:20:55,wallstreetbets,That's what the smart move always is. ;)
2021-04-11 21:32:35,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs say I stupidly take the bid for his $12 call at open. It‚Äôs $145.10. That plus the $12 strike is $157.10. So, exactly the price per share where we left off on Friday.  So how the fuck does he get beat up on the spread?"
2021-04-11 22:15:19,wallstreetbets,"Best bid on deep ITM options is typically from MMs looking to arbitrage. No one buys deep ITM 5 DTE options, so the intrinsic value often exceeds the bid and the only reason to *not* exercise is if 

1. It's a LEAP and you don't want to hold the position longer and realize gains under LT taxes

2. You do not have the capital to exercise

There's a reason american options carry early assignment risk and this is an expression of that. Should you wish to exit and the spot to strike is larger than the best bid, early exercise is preferable to selling the contract. The opportunity cost of carry to expiration is a cost and therefore should be avoided if you do not wish to own long-term. If you wish to maintain a position (like it seems DFV wishes) then there is no opportunity cost and therefore the difference between a deep ITM call and the underlying is essentially zero."
2021-04-12 00:57:41,wallstreetbets,"You seem to have a very tenuous grasp of how options are priced. Your ""delta of 1"" statement is a little concerning. You're not wrong, but you don't seem to understand why that's irrelevant at this point. I'll tell you what. Why don't you use the Black-Sholes equation and calculate the difference in extrinsic value of DFV's calls, between, let's say, April 1st, and April 15th, with theta being different and all else being equal, of course, and then get back to me."
2021-04-12 09:30:40,wallstreetbets,"That is true only on super liquid options. As there are only 549 options in circulation at his strike, with 500 being his, it is impossible to close that position by selling. Anyway, he should exercize them, even for the lolz"

2021-04-11 21:52:34,wallstreetbets,"If DFV sparks a new rally, it will be a slow grind higher as the shorts are forced to cover before they go completely bald from the cronic stress that builds up when days of green become weeks then months. 

If you live in a state of perpetual stress for more than 3 weeks it also starts to change your neuro chemistry, and rewire your brain, or in other words, you start going batty. At that point your wife will kick you out of the house and her boyfriend will move in. Your old neighbors will be relieved that you're not living on their block anymore. Even your pets will forget you, while your children are left to live with the shame.

2021-04-11 23:05:33,wallstreetbets,I'm dozing off and picturing a single M&M that's holding a fuckload of shares.
2021-04-12 00:20:43,wallstreetbets,New around here eh?
2021-04-11 23:31:55,wallstreetbets,"no because the call sellers make money by hedging, in this case gamma hedging. As the stock price approached $12 they would purchase more shares to reduce the exposure on the calls going ITM, after $12 they have 100% covered and so do not need to purchase any shares, they purchased those shares back around $10-15 already"
2021-04-12 02:37:16,wallstreetbets,Since the moment he bought the calls unless they were covered calls the MM who likely sold it has held shares to hedge against the calls and the position is adjusted accordingly like adding when the calls go ITM
2021-04-11 21:42:46,wallstreetbets,Why would he cash out and pay more for the shares? Exercising his contracts gives him 50k more shares at a 12 dollar price. Makes no sense to sell them and buy shares @ market price.
2021-04-11 20:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Got it, thank you for the explanation! ü§ô"
2021-04-11 21:35:44,wallstreetbets,That makes no sense.
2021-04-11 21:39:19,wallstreetbets,"Not at all. The shares are ready. Whomever sold him that contract already hedged. In other words, they slowly bought shares leading up to this moment, so when they expire, they say okay sir that'll be $625k and the shares transfer ownership from contract writer to DFV.

At that point, DFV owns 150,000 shares of GameStop and who knows what his next move is. He could theoretically exercise and still afford 50k more shares at $150, to bring him to 200,000 shares. Fucking nuts."
2021-04-11 21:57:11,wallstreetbets,Yup dude lost like 50 million
2021-04-11 22:01:05,wallstreetbets,I know I was just speculating about the calls being hedged already but didn‚Äôt even think how long ago they were made.
2021-04-11 22:55:40,wallstreetbets,Because 3.5m ADDED to the pool. This is 50k taken away from the already small pool.
2021-04-11 22:35:28,wallstreetbets,Got it thank you for clarifying for me.

2021-04-11 22:07:20,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm just trying to understand he‚Äôs been working people up on Twitter all week with cryptic shit and the poll now . He obviously already knows what he plans on doing just speculating for amusement.
2021-04-12 06:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but he'd be buying shares at a much higher price and therefore he'd be buying a lot less shares, which would take up a much smaller percentage of the float."
2021-04-12 00:35:15,wallstreetbets,"He didn‚Äôt say he sold the calls. He merely said  DFV has the option to exercise his $12 calls, and we don‚Äôt know if the seller sold naked calls. And assuming they did, it‚Äôs not unreasonable that they would‚Äôve long hedged given the shitstorm back in Jan"
2021-04-12 02:16:12,wallstreetbets,thank you.  wow

2021-04-11 23:16:14,wallstreetbets,"What happens if they don‚Äôt exercise their calls and let them expire?

Do DFV have covered calls or what kind of calls?"
2021-04-12 07:47:19,wallstreetbets,No one is blaming anyone for anything. You're just looking for an argument. And you're also missing my point. I specifically said he needed to excercise those *right when they cut off buys*. It could have created enough buying pressure to break it loose after they cut off the gas on our rocket. Maybe if he and others could have coordinated their excercising of their contracts. Coordinated buys placed days or weeks later don't mean shit and are completely beside my point. Good luck this week.

See that's a reason to chose to invest in a company. All I was saying was that short interest alone is not a good metric to chose to invest in a company, and Lehman Brothers was a good example of why."
2021-04-12 13:49:18,wallstreetbets,Line go down bad. Line go up good. Except when my line goes down slightly I‚Äôve lost significantly less than a GME holder. Same when it goes up I‚Äôve gained significantly less than GME.  It doesn‚Äôt matter. The lines move together. If I‚Äôm watching AMC and see a sharp dip I don‚Äôt even have to look at GME. It‚Äôs a given. It has gone down too.

2021-04-11 21:38:35,wallstreetbets,"Sure - then the option market maker who sold that bid for exactly fair value needs to hand it off to someone else to get rid of that risk. They aren‚Äôt going to get *paid* for offloading risk, they have to pay for that privilege. 

Maybe they try to get rid of that risk in the stock market, and have to pay the spread in the stock market to do that. If they have to pay 1 cent of spread in the stock market, they aren‚Äôt going to trade that initial bid unless they collect at least 1 cent of theoretical value. 

No one trades in an market making capacity for ‚Äúfree‚Äù. There‚Äôs no edge in doing that"

2021-04-12 01:08:25,wallstreetbets,However much someone is willing to pay. The contract allows someone to acquire 100 shares worth ~165 for $12/each so probably just a little less then the theoretical gain. Someone might pay something like (155-12)*100

Suck a dick for cornbread if I had to. They didn't have honey but that's ok. I learned how to play spades so I could get more cornbread. I got pretty good at spades, or at least I got a lot of cornbread. I know one day I'll eat cornbread again and I will look forward to that sweet sticky crumbly goodness.

Something about the sweat and puddle in her sneakers made you want to be with her the rest of your life. It wasn't a good smell, objectively speaking, but it smelled like effort.

She realized she didn't love you anymore when she first smelled you after a day of bad losses. She couldn't name the scent, but it was desperation. It was the same smell she'd noticed on your pillow case each night at 2 AM, shortly after you picked up your phone. She didn't know that you were looking at Futures, or what Futures are, but she knew what it did to you. It wasn't a good smell, objectively speaking. It smelled like failure."

Not sure if any of you follow less alone even believe in technical levels however based on several ranges & measurements such as; Fibonacci, Directional, Sequential, Momentum both the DJI & S&P 500 entered the PERFECT SELL space.  For individual stocks these indicators are often wrong or delayed however they are hardly ever wrong when they make these type of calls on 2 of the 3 largest US Indexes (they also make Index level calls Perfect BUY or SELL only a few times a year).   

Most of you will tell me to fuck of, sounds good.  However these signals tend to carry a very high probability.  They are also not predicting a horrible correction but if we do hit a temporary slowdown the S&P 500 support level is at 3,909 which is a 5.5% drop.

And so it begins!!!!"

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."

2021-04-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Aerospace & Defense: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Long the War Do you smell that boys? **War is in the air.**

**Russia** is lining tanks up around [Ukraine](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-56678665), complete with [robots](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/vladimir-putin-deploy-fearsome-russian-23890805). A Ukrainian soldier just died today by [artillery fire](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/11/ukrainian-soldier-reportedly-killed-russia-backed-troops) from Russia backed troops. WaPo says they are sending a message about political [clout](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-military-biden-donbas/2021/04/09/99859490-96d3-11eb-8f0a-3384cf4fb399_story.html) to Biden. The last time they did this they took Crimea. They don't really fuck around, they don't have our kind of money to waste. For the students of history: you don't just wait until spring to move troops in Russia and not use them. Ukraine has said it [will not back down](https://thehill.com/policy/international/europe/547541-ukraine-says-it-will-not-back-down-to-russian-pressure) from aggression. They aren't in NATO but have been [trying to get in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine%E2%80%93NATO_relations). Worrisome situation over there.

**China** is acting pretty fucking ballsy, talking a lot of shit at the [Alaska summit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/asia/us-china-alaska-blinken-intl-hnk/index.html), with the Chinese media hailing Wang Yi as a hero for his criticism of America's history of oppression and racism. They are using our arguments against us, and their people love it. The same ambassador just [warned the US](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3128371/chinese-foreign-minister-wang-yi-warns-asean-be-alert-external) against getting involved in Myanmar. They are throwing down in the middle east with a brand new [25-year accord with Iran](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iran-set-to-sign-25-year-strategic-accord-with-china-during-fms-visit/). Chinese jets are [running sorties](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-flies-warplanes-near-taiwan-in-show-of-force-prompting-u-s-warning-11611513299) past Taiwan. Kinda sketchy, yeah?

**Myanmar** is in a full state of civil war, which many of you will know about because of that [fucking dance meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/myanmar-coup-dance-instructor-videos). Allegedly it's not [all](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2BX0D5) [dancing](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/asia/myanmar-coup-protests.html). The EU just said Russia and China are [undermining the international Myanmar response](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-eu-idUSKBN2BY0CO). [Piles of bodies](https://nypost.com/2021/04/10/piles-of-bodies-seen-in-myanmar-as-violence-escalates-reports/) have been spotted. Seems sort of brazen, right?

Well, this is the world on the brink. It's happened before in history. **Powder kegs happen**. The stresses to the international system by the virus sort of guaranteed this would happen. The goal of China is to become the new reserve currency, and things are going great for them in this regard. The Chinese [Belt and Road](https://fortune.com/2021/03/24/china-belt-road-initiative-soft-power/) initiative is killing it in Africa and other developing parts of the world. They are getting 99-yr leases and debt-trapping small countries, whose leaders walk away with big fat Chinese money as they sell their countries down the river. I wish they had a ETF.

I am no psychic, I cannot predict how war will happen. I can't tell you how we'll get dragged in. But I can tell you that we are the biggest weapons manufacturer in the world, and war has been historically enormously rewarding for war profiteers. Again, **powder kegs happen, and you want to be invested in the explosion when you see one.** Here's how:

**BA**\- These fuckers [drop engines](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/dutch-investigate-boeing-747-after-engine-parts-drop-after-takeoff-netherlands) on houses in flyover country and go on a run. Insanely bullish, with vaccines and travel lining up at the same time as international tensions rise, BA is in an amazing position for the rest of 2021.

**RTX**\- Biden's cabinet is full of Raytheon guys. They are positioned to cash in on air-to-air missile contracts, air defense systems, missile interceptors, fucking everything. Tensions are the best thing for this company because they can get in there and start moving their defense equipment. They are on the cutting edge of advanced technology, not only landing defense and civil contracts, but also cybersecurity solutions. These guys are the fucking best in the world, and they have been landing contracts nonstop. The Pentagon just gave them and LMT a contract for [missile interceptors](https://www.defenseone.com/business/2021/03/next-generation-interceptor-thing-contract-announced/172870/). This is a company dabbling in money and power most of us can't fathom.

**LMT**\- This thing has been [outpacing the broader market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-lmt-outpaces-stock-215009624.html) lately, as it goes on an earnings run. Up 11% in the past month, it's the strongest in the class. Earnings are estimated at $26.32 per share, year-over-year change of +7.43%. This company is a big fat juicy hog and lined up to make a killing off increased tensions. Dumb money isn't the reason this is going up, I promise you that much.

No it wasn't. ""EU expansion"" led to situation when European goods could have moved freely to Russian market thanks to preferential treatment Ukraine had. Russia just removed preferential treatment and that was that, and Ukrainian goods are now follow same custom rules as Polish goods.

Russia took Crimea after new Ukrainian government wanted to kick out Russian fleet from Sebastopol and started plans for schools for children of US sailors in Crimea.

Aegis in Black Sea would have covered most of European part of Russia, enabling USA First Strike doctrine.

Russia developed Poseidon - salted stealth nuclear torpedo, not to conquer Ukraine, but to prevent MAD. You can't conquer anything with device that has sole purpose of making coastal regions unhabitable for thousands of years. It's a weapon of revenge and not weapon of conquest.

Russia doesn't care about EU, and Ukraine would not be part of NATO - Russia wouldn't allow that. But Ukraine can become part of EU, though German taxpayers aren't fond of that idea it seems.


> believe they are the main Corn and Crop supply, this Im not 100% on.

Russia is one of the world leaders in corn exports. Ukraine is useful as a buffer between NATO and Russia,  nothing more. They fucked up all advantage they had in 1991, now their crumbling infrastructure and declining population is useless.

Crimea is important, but Russia already took Crimea."

**APRIL 9, 2021**

**Company and Industry**

Tesla was founded in 2003 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. The company operates two segments: automotive manufacturing and consumer solar energy. The automotive manufacturing segment builds and sells automotive vehicles. The consumer solar energy segment manufactures and sells solar energy generation to residential customers (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). Tesla‚Äôs core business model across both segments relies heavily on state and federal government subsidies in order to operate (‚ÄúTesla 10-Q‚Äù, 2020). The company is traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker, TSLA.

**Market Capitalization**

On February 3, 2020, Tesla had a market capitalization of $136.9 billion. On March 1, 2021, Tesla had a market capitalization of $557.9 billion (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). This represents a 307.52% increase in Tesla‚Äôs market capitalization between February 2020 and March 2021. At the time of this writing, on April 9, Tesla had a market capitalization of $649 billion.

Tesla‚Äôs current market capitalization defies all rational explanations as it is being valued more than Ford, General Motors, Tata Motors, Honda Motors, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Mazda, Nissan, Porsche, and Volkswagen all combined (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). To assert that Tesla is more valuable than the worldwide automotive industry is a ridiculous proposition that is not substantiated by either business fundamentals, nor future growth prospects.

**Stock Price and Employee Information**

Tesla stock price also had parabolic movement as the stock price increased 360.53% 

between February 2020 and March 2021. On February 3, 2020, Tesla closed at $153.00. By March 1, 2021, Tesla closed at $718.43 (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.).

As of December 31, 2020, Tesla employed 70,757 employees. This represents a 47.36% increase in employees when compared to December 31, 2019, when Tesla had 48,016 employees.

**Response to COVID-19**

Tesla was affected by the Covid-19 epidemic that disrupted global trade in 2020. At the start of the pandemic, Tesla received an undisclosed amount of government assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program (‚ÄúTesla 10-Q‚Äù, 2020). When California went into lockdown on March 18, 2020, Tesla‚Äôs Fremont, CA factory continued its operations. Elon Musk was defiant in his insistence that Tesla‚Äôs operations not be disrupted even with the virus spreading throughout California (""Elon Musk v. Public Health"", 2020). 

After public outcry, Tesla shut down the California factory on March 23, 2020. However, by May 11, 2020, Elon Musk resumed operations at the Fremont, CA factory in defiance of the state law. By May 13, 2020, Alameda County, CA withdrew their enforcement of the law and allowed Tesla to continue operations as long as they followed social distancing measures (""Elon Musk v. Public Health"", 2020). It is unclear if there was any actual oversight or enforcement of those policies. By November, 2020, California had granted Tesla ‚Äúessential workforce‚Äù exemption (Kolodny, 2020). While there are no consistently reported figures, it is estimated that over 400 Tesla employees contracted SARS-CoV-2 between May and December 2020 (Boudette, 2021).

**Analysis of COVID-19 Response**

Tesla‚Äôs source of value is derived from automotive sales of the Model 3 and the Model Y, both of which are only manufactured in Fremont, CA and Shanghai, China. Going into 2020, Tesla only had $8.2 billion in quick assets and $10.7 billion in quick liabilities (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). With a quick ratio of 0.76, Tesla was in a vulnerable position when the COVID-19 pandemic started. Shutting down the Fremont factory in accordance with state law would likely have been catastrophic to Tesla‚Äôs financial health, as the company has often been in a precarious financial balance between solvency and insolvency. *(Note: Tesla has nearly gone bankrupt in 2008, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Elon has a gift for doing magic tricks and buying himself more time)*

This uncertain situation is likely what drove Elon Musk to be so defiant about the company‚Äôs operations and eventually caused him to rebel against the state‚Äôs legal measures to shut down all but essential businesses, of which Tesla is not. This is also the likely motivation behind the stock dilution seen in Q3 and Q4 2020, when Tesla issued more stock and raised $12.686 billion (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). A curious observation is found when looking at the cash flow from operating activities and comparing it to cash flow from financing activities. Year-over-year, Tesla is a company that consistently subsists itself through financing activity, not operating activity (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.).

When looking over all of the relevant information, it is clear that Tesla did what it had to do in order to remain solvent. However, it is also clear that they were entirely fixated on staying operational at any cost, even if it meant its own employees were put at risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2. Employees should re-evaluate their relationship with Tesla and decide if the company views them as an asset, or an expendable resource. Tesla‚Äôs efforts in this regard were found wanting.

**SWOT Analysis**

Tesla‚Äôs strength is really down to the cult of personality surrounding Elon Musk. For better or for worse, without Elon Musk‚Äôs personal brand, Tesla would have gone bankrupt long ago because it is not a sustainable business model. Tesla has survived through a combination of a secular bull market, dovish monetary policy, generous fiscal policy, corporate welfare, and legions of wishful thinking investors (Strauss & Smith, 2019).

The weakness surrounding Tesla is that despite what seems to be carefully crafted earnings management, the core business of Tesla is not profitable and may never be profitable. A counter argument may be that other automotive manufacturers also have razor thin margins and not the best balance sheets. This is a fair argument, but it is important to point out that Ford Motors and General Motors have vastly higher revenues than Tesla, and they rely on cash flow from operating activities, not financing activities, to stay solvent.

There are many threats that Tesla is facing. Tesla has many eerie similarities to Enron (NYSE: ENE). Enron executives were publicly hostile towards short sellers and Elon Musk is particularly vocal about his disdain for short sellers (Niedermeyer, 2019). Enron was routinely hailed as a futuristic, innovative disruptor that was changing the world. *(Note: You can read more about this in Niedermeyer's book. Also read more* [*here*](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/bq06lc/the_smartest_guys_in_the_room_eerily_describes/)*,* [*here*](https://fortune.com/2020/12/10/tsla-tesla-stock-overvalued-investors-jpmorgan-spx-s-and-p-500/)*, and* [*here*](https://nypost.com/2021/01/20/jim-chanos-still-shorting-tesla-just-more-cautiously/)*)* 

Tesla is also facing increasing competition from well established automakers like Ford Motors and General Motors. These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle (EV) than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers. As such, they will continue to take market share away from Tesla, and may eventually take over the company (MacDuffie, 2018).

While China has been seen as the promised land for Tesla's profitability, China has many state-sponsored investments into their own companies such as XPeng (Kharpal, 2021) and Nio (""Nio Motors Has"", n.d.). From a geopolitical perspective, it is unlikely that the Chinese government will allow a U.S. business to dominate their own EV market. *(Note: they absofuckingloutely will not allow this to happen)*

The opportunity that Tesla really has is the new administration in Washington D.C., which has recently unveiled a bill entitled ‚ÄúThe American Jobs Plan‚Äù (""American Jobs Plan"", 2021), which will invest up to $3 trillion over the next 15 years. Much of this bill will involve infrastructure and clean energy initiatives. This is something that Tesla will undoubtedly capitalize on and enjoy the juicy resources provided to them, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer. Regardless of sentiment, this fresh capital influx will likely stimulate the company‚Äôs operations and allow them to continue operations for the foreseeable future.

**Recommendations and Predictions**

Using a valuation based on comparable firms (Berk, et al., 2017), Tesla‚Äôs intrinsic value is much closer to $32.82/per share with a current book value of $24.03 (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). With 959,854,000 shares outstanding, this fair value would give Tesla a more realistic market capitalization of $31.5 billion (""Tesla Financial Statements"", n.d.). This market capitalization would be comparable to other auto manufacturers, like Ford and General Motors. However, this represents a 95% decrease in the current market price of Tesla. This would still be a generous valuation for Tesla as at $32.82 per share, because the PE ratio would be around 51 and still far higher than the industry average of around 24.

To be even more generous, one could give Tesla a valuation based upon the discounted free cash flow (DFCF) method (Berk, et al., 2017). This would give Tesla a market capitalization of $312.9 billion, and a valuation of $325.89 per share, yet this is still 51.86% lower than where the market is currently pricing the stock at. This DFCF valuation uses a discount rate of 11% and operates on the assumption that Tesla‚Äôs earnings will grow by 50% every single year through 2026 before leveling off at a 10% earnings growth rate from 2027 onward. This simply is not practical, as Tesla‚Äôs revenue growth has only been forecasted to grow at 33% every year through 2023. It is safe to say that Tesla has already been ‚Äúpriced to perfection‚Äù and then some. 

While the story of Tesla has largely been a successful example of ‚Äúfake it until you make it‚Äù, reality will eventually catch up to Tesla, whose brand is inseparable from the brand of Elon Musk. Were this a street report, the coverage would be initiated with a ‚ÄúStrong Sell‚Äù recommendation and a $33.00 price target.

In order for Tesla to justify its unreasonable valuation, the company will need to demonstrate that it can achieve sustainable profitability without the extensive use of government welfare in the form of rebates and subsidies that are paid for by U.S. taxpayers. To that end, it needs to increase operating margin expansion and drive new revenue growth through licensing. The licensing of its proprietary software and intellectual property to other automotive manufacturers might be its only saving grace in the years to come as more experienced auto manufacturers take market share from Tesla in the EV space.

How about one claim you make:

 ""Tesla is also facing increasing competition from well established automakers like Ford Motors and General Motors. These automakers can undoubtedly make a better electric vehicle (EV) than Tesla at a more attractive price point for consumers.""

That is a mighty assumption, not backed up by facts. In China recently the Tesla's were rated #1 in quality. I suspect with the new factories in the US and Germany opening later this year, the new cars coming out of them will be improved in quality. Right now, in Fremont, they are running a few production lines that are pretty much their first ones built for the cars they are making and they have little ability to stop them in order to improve quality. With more capacity and better factories many of the issues should easily be resolved. I can also get into the 4680 cells and the single casts (not one major automaker is known to be doing anything close to this. This is huge) but you would probably not understand as I am not going to provide a list of references at the end of this.

We can also talk about your issue with Tesla being worth more then so many other automakers combined and one has to wonder what the total market cap of the various cell phone makers were a few years back an then look at the market cap of Apple to see why such an assumption, lacking context, is a fallacy.

I am not even going to get into the stuff with China, as you clearly don't understand the issues China is dealing with and why they are opening up their economy more. This is a process that has been ongoing since the 1970's in an accelerating manner. To suggest it will magically reverse itself because you don't like Tesla is a bit absurd.

Finally the Tesla is not profitable... Well they are profitable, so let's clarify you don't like the EV credits. Well I don't like fossil fuel subsidies and I think ICE vehicles should be taxed for their negative impact in terms of carbon footprint and contribution to pollution. Regardless, Tesla is building more factories and will be able to build cars for cheaper (just factoring in single casts and 4680 cells, which will both reduce costs and make the cars way better) plus achieve various efficiencies of scale which will make them more profitable then ever. I won't bore you with an analysis of FSD, Solar, Batteries, etc as that is probably a bit beyond you, but suffice it to say the potential profits Tesla can and should be able to make is more then sufficient to justify the current price."

Keep looking at Tesla through this lens and please please put your money where your mouth is and short it with every penny. I‚Äôll keep buying shares and LEAPS and we can compare who made more by 2025. Tesla bears are so blind they literally don‚Äôt see what Tesla is ALREADY doing never mind what Tesla is WORKING ON/WILL BE doing in 5-10 years‚Äô time. This post is pure FUD and offers nothing of substance. These are the bears‚Äô speaking points and it‚Äôs getting old. 

Competition is coming? Ok let‚Äôs see. Name one legacy automaker selling a (current) EV that is better than a 2017-2018 Model S as far as range, technology (mainly software), autonomy (yes its beta but go check out YouTube videos), acceleration/speed, battery efficiency and most importantly cost/efficiency and new technology. Also name one company building an Ev that has 25% margin or is even making ANY money selling that EV. You can‚Äôt answer any of these questions so please keep dreaming that ‚Äúcompetition is coming‚Äù because this is a pipe dream. 

In any event, it‚Äôs important to note that Tesla does not need to be the only show in town, it just needs 20-25% market share to justify this valuation if you actually know how to value it and it‚Äôs various segments. Good luck with your short.

2021-04-12 15:47:12,wallstreetbets,"That is a very good financial analysis that looks like it is written by someone with exactly 0 business leading expertise. 

My main point of contention:

1) while other automakers undoubtedly can produce an EV for lower price, what will be their %margin on the vehicle? While Tesla can be in the mind of average consumer be compared to a Lamborghini, a Ford is just that, a Ford. A vehicle you purchase for its intended use, of a great value and good price/performace ratio. 

Lamborghini does not care about price/performance ratio, and can therefore sell their products on 1000% profit margin, while a Ford is still just that, a Ford. Profit margin lets be generous and say 10%. 

In order for a Ford to produce same amounts of profit for the investor, a Lamborghini produces one car, and a Ford has to produce 100 of them. 

Now to a Tesla. Obviously, it is overvalued. But by how much is impossible to tell, because you just cannot put a price on brand perception when it reaches the same consumer impact levels of Gucci, Apple, LV and other similiar brands. Value proposition goes out of the window when you realize that consumer DOES NOT BEHAVE RATIONALLY. Some consumers are forced into a rational thought, but lets be real, would you want to own a Ford or a Lamborghini? 

Target market of Teslas is the same portion of consumers that purchase Apple products. While there are some really great features, main point is to purchase that brand, no matter it does the same thing other brands do ten times cheaper, its shiny and other people perceive it as a valuable item, and consumer feels like a better person. From company perspective, App store is the entrapment of consumer and a vehicle to extract even more money though services. A tesla is basically a big battery, steel cage and wheels. It can become a living home if you make a cage bigger, it can become a truck if you give it bigger wheels. It doesn't matter one bit what its real value proposition is from a mathematical and fair value perspective, just as Apple does not make sense when considered from a mathematical perspective. The invisible added value creates simply too large X% difference for any calculation to be remotely correct. 

My prediction is some growth for a while, then sharp fall, and back to the top just like Apple we go.

It involved everything going perfect for Tesla, no competition factored in AND it still trading at a 70 P/E ratio. I think that bull case actually shows how idiotic the current price is.

The goal for tesla's autopilot is to be fully autonomous, with current incremental advances they will not get there until at least 5 years. They have been riding on innovations in the Deep learning research field and increasing their model size by creating domain specific chips. But this will all not matter if they are not able to squeeze out those last bits of performance in the model. They need a very big innovation on their neural network architecture or possibly on their data side by generating edge cases from data. Otherwise, the hype that autopilot has had for years now will die down as people realise that tesla cannot get there in the foreseable future."

This is a fair argument, but it is important to point out that Ford Motors and General Motors have vastly higher revenues than Tesla, and they rely on cash flow from operating activities, not financing activities, to stay solvent.

I would contest this point. This has been the main criticism of Tesla's long term earnings potential for at least a decade. And GM and Ford still have yet to put out a comparable product. This assumption is why short sellers bet against Tesla and a big part of the reason why they lost."

Tesla recently bought into a lot of coins. Is there not an alternate plan. Valuation is reliant on coin purchase (to some degree) and as coin increases so does the value of the company? How could the value of the company not be tied to coins after they bought 1.5B of it?

I get it. The point is that the company isn‚Äôt making a high enough profit on what they sell and financial reliance is more of the financial transactions as opposed to products.

I don‚Äôt think that Ford and GM can make a better EV at a more attractive price. It was just 12 years ago that they made shit cars and needed a massive government bailout. They still make shit cars."

On the topic of fraud, you are not the first one to allege this and likely not the last. I personally am weirded out by two recent things:

1. Car buyback scheme in Germany mid March, where Tesla allegedly offered to buy used cars back (at a profit for the customer), on the condition they buy a new car (also getting double subsidies).
2. US customers being overcharged on their purchases in March (as if they bought two cars instead of one) and refunded in April.

Someone more experienced than me should look for signs of this in their quarterly earnings report when it comes out. It sounds like the car sales were artificially inflated. This is not a good sign, in my opinion, and bulls should not dismiss this."

Jesus, I see this being trotted out every single thread on Tesla. If we're looking at Europe, the region with the most amount of large EV competitors  then we're looking that these numbers for market share VW Group (23.4%), RNM (18.6%), Tesla (13.4%), Hyundai Group (13%) and Peugeot SA (9.6%). Quick points to get out the way, each of these motor groups own multiple brands so using pure sales numbers for their most popular vehicles is misleading (as I see people advocating for Tesla's supposed supremacy often do), VW Group alone has something like 13 different electric vehicles (two of them trucks) on the market. Most of these competitors are only rolling out their products in North American and Asian markets in the next two years and VW in particular is looking to have significant production in Asia (between 500-600,000 units within the next 2 years or so) very soon. As a result, it is *patently* clear that in reality other manufacturers *are* catching up. Please do remember that in Europe hybrids have been popular for quite some time and European car companies have been experimenting with BEVs since the 1970s.   


"" Tesla has completely reinvented the car industry, with the combination of engineering talent, foresight, and sheer fucking will/brilliance of Elon.

Tesla may be on the bleeding edge right now, but there will be huge amounts of demand for the first company that can make a decent quality EV at a low cost; something which the big 5 are in a really favorable position to do and GM probably has the advantage.

At some point the battery will become a commodity (just like gas) and the name of the game will be who can produce the cheapest rolling chassis - that's not Tesla.  

Also don't discount Toyota - they will never be 1st to market with something; but there's a reason Toyota Truck run forever.

10. 2020 Nissan Leaf Plus (226 miles, $38k)
9. 2020 Jaguar I-Pace (234 miles, $70k)
8. 2020 Kia Niro EV (239 miles, $39k)

6. 2021 Chevrolet Bolt (259 miles, $36k)
5. 2021 Polestar 2 (275 miles, $60k)
4. 2021 Tesla Model Y (326 miles, $50k)
3. 2020 Tesla Model X (328 miles, $80k)
2. 2021 Tesla Model 3 (353 miles, $47k)
1. 2020 Tesla Model S (402 miles, $80k)

So the Tesla Model 3 beats its nearest competitor by 28%, with the Model S beating it by 46% in terms of Range, and with the Model 3, also price.

But not only that, Apple and other new solar fallacies are choosing Tesla over its competitors because again, they have the best batteries. But the nice part about Tesla is that they aren't resting their laurels while ahead. They're putting more research into battery technology. Because they know how much they can improve.

Seriously, do more research on their batteries, how they're all in on batteries. Understand that batteries suck and whoever can make them not suck wins capitalism. If we can get a lightweight highly efficient battery, it'll completely revolutionize our society. From EV planes to everything else we depend on each day. Since we use batteries to charge batteries so much, any small gain is multiplied against itself, making it an exponential function.

Could another competitor catch up? Sure. But until that happens Tesla's growth and valuation will continue."

They made a lot of phone companies obsolete and certainly have made many companies transition/adapt or die. Now, I would say iphones aren't as important as the future of electrification, batteries, vehicles, or infrastructure, but you get my point. Tesla obviously doesn't have a patent on electricity, or the concept of a car itself, but that's not the right way of looking at it imo. They're forcing the competition and others to adapt regardless, *if the lack of patents was a real issue, you'd see other Tesla level cars on the road- there aren't any.* Things they have that others don't the aggressive expansion/time, RD/knowledge of batteries, consistently improving their mfr processes, supercharging network, great engineering bits all over the car that help widen the margin for profit (many patents on these ones), and FSD, which will be huge. 

Tesla certainly doesn't control the space if we look at gross cars on road (EV's + ICE + etc). But in the EV space they are the benchmark and well ahead of others. I believe they do have very compelling products which are certainly novel to Tesla. You don't slap on an electric motor and some batteries and call it a special or a road worthy electric car. Ford EV Mustang? Some are getting (temporarily) bricked due to software issues. Lack of supercharging/charging infrastructure. Jaguar?

But if they can take a portion of the energy sector, with their battery packs (I‚Äôm not sold on the solar panels), along with offering HVAC systems for homes, and other expansions, while keeping all the manufacturing in house, a case can be made to still be a bull.

Reliability: I'm at 62k with my Model 3, '17. Haven't done shit to the car except for tires. I abuse the shit out of it and have tracked it. No brake pads, no oil changes, etc. My costs for maintenance therefore are really really low.

Safety: Not much to say, safest cars across the board. I've seen a few crashes or my friends have gotten in crazy crashes, they all walked with no injuries. On an engineering perspective with the chassis, crumble zones, traction control (very good), etc it all makes sense.

Quickness: Fun, acceleration is great. The chassis is a great platform. Wish they would make a hardcore track version of the cars though.

AP + FSD: I use to commute tons, AP has been amazing. AP vs. like say supercruise is fundamentally different. Tesla's approach is to have the AI/AP/Neural net learn so much that it fundamentally will behave like a human, or able to react in any real-world situation at least to the level of a human. Supercruise or many other AP-like systems work by essentially being on rails, as a previous car would have had to driven that route, etc. You could take AP and FSD in a completely new area and it would be able to handle it, that's the goal either way.

Battery/Range: I mean I get about 300 miles of range. I drive to LA a lot and yes I have to spend about 20 more minutes per charging, but that's nothing imo. Also, vs. gas, I've saved about 1/5th the overall price it'd take to fill up a gas car equivalent. My car before was about 22mpg.

Software: It makes every other car out there feel slow and weird. The simplicity is refreshing. Also, I can get software updates. As easy as that sounds, on a technical level, for highly regulated cars, this is huge.

As a car guy, my next car is going to be Tesla and will be until there's a massively better option. I hate gimmicks, idc about watching Netflix, idc about emissions mode, idc if there are easter eggs.

Edit: Personally, I doubt Tesla would have sold as many cars as they're doing right now. We can both agree that people fall for gimmicks, but to have ALL these people buying Teslas? Nah. I've meet with incredibly smart people, people who have invested and help start up some of the big companies you hear of today, lots of smart engineers, etc, if they like the car, make it their daily driver, and come back for more, I'd say the car isn't a gimmick."

Both Toyota and VW sell twice as many vehicles in a month that Tesla sells in a year... When the two biggest car manufacturers in the world together have a lower market cap than a small player that relies on financing activities and subsidies and not profit from sales to stay afloat then you know all logic has went out the window, you just need to decide if you want to ride the hype train or not... 

What's crazier is how many times the company has been close to bankruptcy yet people still believe in it... They had to defy health regulations and put their employees at risk so they wouldn't close their doors? Stock goes up! They took preorders as an interest free loan and then told people it wasn't first come first served like they thought it would be but the orders would be filled based on trim level? Oh yes please, give me some more Papa Elon! Far from learning their lesson, people pre-order again! Knowing full well that people who don't still get their car before people who do! Might as well put that money in their stock instead!


Honestly, this presents such a dilemma for someone who wants to invest ethically... They pushed electric cars forward when other manufacturers should have done so decades prior, but they act in ways that people wouldn't accept from other companies! Amazon fighting unionization?

They did, not really with specific innovations, but by putting a lot of tech that was lying around into a unique product. In any way, the ""reinventing"" (however you define it) isn't really as important as a good business plan.

-


>They're forcing the competition and others to adapt regardless

Adapt to what? They don't need to adapt because of Tesla, since Tesla's business model is not profitable or new in any way and Tesla isn't eating away much of their profits with its >1% market share. What is forcing them to build electric cars is governments imposing huge penalties on ICE cars, that is why actions of the EU have forced all car manufacturers to introduce EV models, since penalties are making ICE cars more expensive and less profitable. __But this will decrease Tesla's main source of profits - CO2 credits.__

>you'd see other Tesla level cars on the road- there aren't any

Huh? There are tons. Not just the high-level Porsche, but there are a lot of electric cars in all varieties on sale, from ~$25k and upwards. Mostly in markets where the government is forcing manufacturers to sell EV cars - Europe. You can buy a perfectly reasonable EV for $25k there, or a $150k insane Porsche. 

-

>Things they have that others don't the aggressive expansion/time, RD/knowledge of batteries

VW doesn't need aggressive expansion, they sold almost 10 million cars in 2020. Tesla buys their batteries from 3rd party manufacturers, just like everyone else.

-

>consistently improving their mfr processes

Everyone is improving their mfr process, Tesla is just improving it faster than others because they are so behind. Tesla still isn't making as many cars per week in Fremont as Toyota did when they made cars in the same factory until 2009.

-

>great engineering bits all over the car that help widen the margin for profit 

Tesla's margin is nothing special, it is close to industry average, the only really profitable thing is FSD...

>and FSD

Yea, the thing that won't work. Tesla admitted to California regulators that FSD will be a ""Level 2 autonomy assist for the foreseeable future"".  [As you can see here](https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/imageserve/6022ee8077538f5c1e758363/960x0.png?fit=scale) Tesla is well behind on autonomous testing as well. FSD is a pure scam, even industry leaders don't expect their products to actually be fully autonomous for a long time.

>But in the EV space they are the benchmark and well ahead of others.

Most of their range advantage seems to be pushing identical batteries a bit harder than the competition. They really have no other advantage and there are lots of [competitors](https://static.ed.edmunds-media.com/unversioned/img/car-news/ev-range-leaderboard-infograph.jpg) coming.

u/Xillllix isn't high, stupid, or delusional and certainly not a mix of all three.

FYI, when MS finally got smart enough to realize after Jonas kept saying he could no longer analyze the business as it's no longer ""a car company"" and they threw more analysts at it, voila, a bull case.

The amount of quality issues feed the service requests. The response to the service requests has been an issue for a while. 

It didn‚Äôt help when Tesla closed the official customer forums last March to read only. Gave the feeling that they are actively ignoring it or trying to reduce visibility on this problem.

My favorite particular incident though was the creator of entourage calling out Elon directly for his service experience.

Tesla is unique because when a Toyota needs service you don‚Äôt call Toyota, you go third party and blame them, not the manufacturer.

So I'm currently 100 @ $23.30 and I'm about to buy 10 call contracts with $21 strike that'll expire 4/23. This is my first options play.

This literally is my rent money going into those contracts, so if this goes tits up I really am fucked for a bit.

This is absolutely not financial advice and you shouldn't bet what you're not willing to lose. To me, the risk is minimal and the chance of reward is actually quite high. I'm expecting the price to go to at least $25.

2021-04-11 20:17:04,wallstreetbets,"GME cultists all say the same thing, sounding like a broken record. Errrr share dilution, errr cash bonus for execs, errr float too large.

If you guys actually knew anything about AMC, you'd know that the chances of actually having a share dilution are pretty slim and even if there was approval its not as if theyd dump all 500 million shares all at once or in case there is a large partnership with Amazon could be many things. Cash bonus for execs is nothing new and is normal and nothing wrong about giving incentive for execs to work harder.

Meanwhile you have Gamespot, a dying business trying to stay relevant by selling physical copies of games which will literally become obsolete in like a year, so what business do they have after that? Buying your games for 50 cents and trying to sell them at 1000% of the paid price back to people that no longer buy physical copies of games?Sounds like a very promising business to me LOL.

I have shares in both btw, so I do hope they both moon, but its just annoying to deal with GME cultists that continuously bash AMC cause of there"" expert analysis"" and believe it will tank and GME will moon, basically wanting AMC people to buy GME at over a 150 dollars so that that those people buying at the top will be left holding the bag, I would personally not buy GME over 50 dollars, the risk/reward just isnt there"

2021-04-12 14:48:08,wallstreetbets,"The reason the market cap declined from 2017 to 2019 was the accrued debt from acquisitions and improvements to existing theaters.

2016 - AMC acquired Odeon and Carmike Theaters at a $2.3B value. I believe with that deal also came spending on rebranding and improving those theaters.

From 2017 to 2019, AMC underwent improvements to a good majority of its locations including the ones acquired in 2016.

Improvements can be described as upgraded seating, updated screens, and also architectural exterior and interior improvements to theaters which I believe costed around $2B to $3B in terms of materials and labor to do so. With that being said, they also added alcohol licensing and vending services to their theaters as well. 

Leading up to COVID I think the main reason the market cap went down was due to increasing debt. I do not fault AMC for spending on improvements to make the movie going experience better. The timing of COVID was something no one could have accounted for. 

Take debt out of the equation for AMC and I think you have a $15B to $20B company in regards to assets and average gross revenue from 2017 to 2019, $5B+ a year."

 1. That the vote for 500mm shares authority is approved 

2. That no short squeeze occurs before the vote, and for some, that a squeeze is not likely at all. 

I'm playing it day by day but assuming the vote is a no. Watch for AA to try and influence that by being on Trey's Trades before the vote. Depending on how the stance is communicated, maybe the vote swings to a yes. 

Even if they get a yes vote, they would not instantly dilute by 500mm  if a squeeze is occurring.

Other explanation that‚Äôs often offered doesn‚Äôt work either because you can‚Äôt trade 1 share back and forth to lower the price. You can‚Äôt choose your buyer or seller when trading on the exchange. And for orders to impact the market price they need to be traded publicly on the exchange (so basically the first point about dark pools not impacting the price).

All the other movies that year weren‚Äôt appealing. Haven‚Äôt seen a horror movie since alien covenant.  Again you keep being up debt like you bet the entire cinema industry would go bankrupt and die so you shorted and can‚Äôt cover.

Potentially not helpful in traffic but excellent when collecting berries or harvesting monkeys, which in the absence of true feral wilderness have been supplanted by collecting figurines and harvesting tendies."

I won't live to see 59 1/2, too sick.  So, if I suddenly find myself swimming in tendies.. I'm going to talk to a tax lawyer and a financial accountant and find out what they recommend.  It might be best to leave most of the money in the ira and make withdrawals each year.  I figure if I had $10mil in there, I could probably take out 500k a year (which is crazy money to me) and never drop past the 10mil mark.  But again, I'm going to consult with experts and see what they say.

2021-04-11 21:54:24,wallstreetbets,"Somewhat. First of all just to be clear, it needs to be cash from compensation/earnings(i.e. a job), not proceeds from selling any stock you may currently have. Also, with a Traditional IRA you are deferring the taxes, so yes you'd be paying taxes when you take a distribution, which is why the Roth IRA might be more advantageous since you wouldn't be paying taxes at retirement. You can rollover a Traditional into a Roth IRA, but there could be tax implications if you claimed deductions for contributions to the Traditional in the past. Maybe call Fidelity customer service and see what they say, and reach out to a tax-advisor

2021-04-11 20:56:35,wallstreetbets,No capital gains on Roth IRA as it‚Äôs taxed money/clean money.  I essentially day trade/swing trade in my Roth.  You do lose out on capital losses in a Roth tho.  50% of my GME trendies we‚Äôre tax free because of this

2021-04-12 06:55:59,wallstreetbets,I think I'm understanding it. Sorry I'm ignorant to this stuff as I'm still learning. So can you dumb this down in a few sentences for me? So I need to max out my Roth IRA contribution from my own income (not stocks) for me to somehow pay less in taxes on my stock?
2021-04-12 07:22:50,wallstreetbets,Fucking bravo.
2021-04-11 20:52:31,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm qualified to answer this.  I put 6k in 2020 but pltr and job gains got me over the 125k.  Your options are depending on what you want to do for taxes.  The most normal is to pay 6% taxes on the 6k and the recontribute the next year aka 2021 which vangaurd will automatically do for me.  The associate told me about back door Roth IRA but you would have to pay income taxes on it for the year to convert it to your Roth (35%+; 125k+).  It would make sense for most people to do that to get the contribution in for 2020.  I did not do that as I turned the 6k -> 25k (Pltr to GME).  I didn‚Äôt want to pay 35% on the 25k so i just told them to withhold the contribution for my 2021 and I‚Äôll pay the 6% on 6k and will continue to pay the 6% every year until I‚Äôm eligible to contribute to my Roth IRA.  On the flip side I can still invest my 25k tax free in the RothIRA I just have to true-up the Roth IRA contribution eventually
2021-04-11 21:18:53,wallstreetbets,Backdoor ROTHs 9 is a great flick
2021-04-12 05:08:33,wallstreetbets,"You pay the taxes now on whatever you‚Äôve already gained. Then once you‚Äôre in Roth, doesn‚Äôt matter if the rocket ship takes off, you don‚Äôt have to pay any gainz taxes. 

So if you‚Äôre already up 5k, you‚Äôll pay short term capital gains taxes on the 5k when you convert to Roth. Then once your money is in the Roth, doesn‚Äôt matter if it turns into 50 million, you pay nothing in taxes.

This is how rigged the system is. Under informed people just wouldn‚Äôt know about these tricks. Where as rich people take full advantage."

2021-04-12 07:16:21,wallstreetbets,">purchasing your first home

So if GME squeezes first ---> immediately buy AMC in a ROTH or vice versa?"
2021-04-11 21:14:46,wallstreetbets,"So if you had 4x your 25k and it became 100k....that would mean 6% on that for a long time. Say next year your outside investments keep putting you over 125k. That would mean 6% but also not eligible to contribute?

Wouldn't it make more sense to recharacterize into a traditional? You avoid the 6% and your gains can continue to compound without getting taxes."
2021-04-12 00:23:24,wallstreetbets,"You can withdraw from an Roth before retirement age. All of your contributions can be withdrawn with no penalty, but they have to have been in the account for ~5yrs. Roth‚Äôs are extremely flexible and have enormous tax advantages if you start young. Anyone gambling on Robinhood with more than $15k should fund 2020 contributions while they can."
2021-04-12 11:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Idk if the timing can work out that way, but definitely reinvest the money some how since you can't use the gains now, so might as well compound it."
2021-04-12 00:49:26,wallstreetbets,"If your tenders from rocket are too much to be eligible for roth and you have already contributed to roth


Call the bank and ask them to re characterize it as traditional and then do the backdoor."
2021-04-11 21:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no.  I still need the liquid so I decided to roll the contribution to 2021 to avoid a 10k tax bill 

If I recharacterize into a traditional Ira to convert it to Roth IRA.  I would have to pay 40% of the 25k in income taxes and get a net of 15k in Roth IRA after conversion.  The benefit is that this would count as a 2020 contribution and allows me a 2021 contribution.  I decided to roll my 2020 contribution  to 2021 so I would pay 6%/ year on the 6K the contribution since I would classify as ‚Äúovercontributed‚Äù  (RothIRA doesn‚Äôt care about growth I wouldn‚Äôt get taxed on growth just the 6k) until I can contribute to my RothIRA.  That way I would only pay $350 in taxes instead of 10K but it would use up my 2021 contribution and I would be able to invest/trade 25k instead of 15k"
2021-04-11 20:33:47,wallstreetbets,"not 100% sure, but i am in the same situation and my understanding is it isn't calculated based on which portion of stock it came from, only on dates of contribution and removal. So even if i added in 6k , left it as cash, then had to pull it out I also have to pull out the gains on the fraction of my account that is the 6k. If I have 60k, 6k would be 10%, so 10% of gains also need to be removed."
2021-04-11 22:00:52,wallstreetbets,Wait Roth Ira doesn't care if you over contributed 6k and turned it into 200k? You only have to recharacterize the 6k?
2021-04-11 20:54:22,wallstreetbets,"Yea, as long as your taxable bananas is below 125k bananas.  Don‚Äôt forget to contribute your bananas to things like 401k to reduce your taxable income to below the threshold"
2021-04-11 22:10:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes, from my experience with the Vangaurd representative.  He first suggested I backdoor it, that thinking the gains were minimal.  I told him I 4X it and didn‚Äôt want to pay the gains on it.  He confirmed with me that I would have to pay 6% on the $6,000 every year until I am able to make the 6k contribution to my RothIRA and that I can do this multiple years in a row as long as I pay the 6%.  

Isn‚Äôt that the point of a RothIRA tax free growth.   Tbh my RothIRA has been my personal investing account since you again short term taxes, it really works well with the rolling semi yolos."

If he had spent 4.5k on a call back when it was 45, and sold that call when GME hit 400, he'd of legit made 350K, and thats just me doing the rough math assuming he'd fuck up the bid-ask, lose some to theta, and bought in with shit IV. The delta move alone from 45 to the mid 300s with the worst theta, shit IV and bad trading, with ONE option contract would be insane, and would cost a whole lot less than 100 shares of GME at 45."

2021-04-11 23:14:45,wallstreetbets,Lol okay
2021-04-11 21:22:38,wallstreetbets,"The most common way for an ordinary shmuck to lose more than the original investment would be to trade on margin, which some brokers will let you do even with a relatively small account. That is, to borrow money from the broker to buy more contracts. So let‚Äôs say you want to buy an option contract with a premium of $1.00, you pay the $100 for the contract and that‚Äôs the most you can lose. But, you feel quite confident about the play, so you borrow $100 from the broker and buy two contracts. One with your money and one with theirs. 

If the stock price shoots up after you buy it to say a premium of $3.00, & you sell both at that price your profit would be $600( the premium) -100 (what you paid) - 105 (money you borrowed + a bit of interest for the loan) = $395. Whereas if you just bought the single contract your profit would be $200 (300-100).

If the play goes south though your loss could be a maximum of $205, (the money you paid plus the money you borrowed) however it‚Äôs still capped at that amount.

Hedge funds can often borrow much more than this and can thus have much larger gains and losses. They can also write contracts without owning all of the shares that back them (naked calls). 

In addition to these, there are all sorts of myriad strategies that institutional investors can use to leverage debt and potentially have losses greater than their initial investment.

However most guys with a few hundred in their Robinhood account only have access to buying call & put options. When buying these contracts the amount you pay is the maximum risk. Call options have unlimited upside as the stock could theoretically rise forever, put options have a capped return because the stock could only fall to $0."
2021-04-11 21:41:30,wallstreetbets,"Another thing to note about **buying** option contracts. They give you the *right*, but importantly, **not the obligation** to purchase/sell shares at the strike price.

Buying these contracts won‚Äôt force you to buy the stock. Some brokers will exercise them if there‚Äôs money in your account and it would be profitable to you to do so, but it‚Äôs an option you can turn off. Robinhood sells your contracts an hour before expiration if they‚Äôre in the money, and you don‚Äôt have the capital to buy the stock yourself.

I really only like to trade options contracts, but I don‚Äôt usually hold them for more than a few days.

There is way way more risk involved with respect to your initial investment, but also much greater reward if you correctly pick the direction of a stock."
2021-04-12 03:07:58,wallstreetbets,"But why do you buy it so far out of the money though?  If the stock price today is $50, why buy it at $58 strike, when you could buy it at $51 strike?  Wouldn't it be easier for it to go from $50 to $51, than $50 to $58?"

2021-04-12 01:32:21,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I think I get it now I never really liked the idea of using margin as I didn‚Äôt want to risk playing with me net that I didn‚Äôt have. Yeah feel more confident now. I‚Äôve always felt intimidated to actually speak up and ask questions in the threads so I really appreciate the insight you guys provided!
2021-04-11 23:15:00,wallstreetbets,I mean if the guy wants to be the epitome of your average wsb poster this honestly is the way
2021-04-12 03:30:20,wallstreetbets,"If you're talking about buying and losing more than what you have, chances are you're talking about buying a put.

Let's say you start with $300. You spend $100 to buy a put option at the $10 strike leaving you with $200. This means you are obligated to sell at $10 regardless of where the stock price moves.

 The stock price goes up to $15. Since you agreed to sell the stock for $10 regardless of the price, you will be forced to buy the stock at $15 and sell it at $10. Since this is 100 shares, you will lose $500 on the contract, putting you in the hole $300.

Put options give you unlimited downside risk. You could lose all your money and then some. This is why buying puts can be risky."
2021-04-12 02:10:42,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm glad I could help my man. I don‚Äôt know how into trading you‚Äôve gotten, but if you don‚Äôt have much going on, the best way to learn about options is to buy a couple contracts and watch them move. I learned more putting actual skin in the game than I did in my actual college investments course. (I‚Äôm sure that fucking helped, but I wish I had a trading account back then).

A few other tips I can give just from what I‚Äôve learned.

Don‚Äôt hope for consistent moonshots, especially for small accounts green is green

Buying options on stocks less than like $10 is enormously more risky than betting on bigger tickers (eg netlfix moving from $550 -$555 is less than a 1% move but could net $500 on a call contract) whereas a stock going from $3 to $5 constitutes a 40% change in the price of the company. And only would net like $200 if the move actually happens.

It definitely takes a bit of money to make money,
But you aren‚Äôt necessarily priced out, and it‚Äôs important to know what your risk is.

Earlier in the week I look for stocks under $100 who have gapped down like 5-10% and basically bet that they‚Äôll recover the next day. (On Robinhood the contract will say down 40%-70% today) provided the move wasn‚Äôt because of some terrible news or some shit.

Past Wednesday I might buy very close to the money contracts on higher value stocks, but again, especially with smaller accounts it‚Äôs quite important to manage day trades. It‚Äôs safer to buy at the end of the day and sell the next since you can only buy and sell like 3 times in a week without $25000 in the account.

And obviously this is literally the opposite of financial advice, but it‚Äôs hard to make any money in the stock market, it takes money to make it. If you have a little money & a lot of fuckin time, you can make bets that pay off on options, but buying stocks won‚Äôt make you anything serious over night.

Lastly, if you do buy a rather expensive call and it starts going south; sell the shit out of it. if you aren‚Äôt confident, if it‚Äôs a company you don‚Äôt know, and there‚Äôs not much time in the contract, even if the price recovers, if it doesn‚Äôt go up more, it‚Äôll be worth less increasingly going forward."
2021-04-12 09:24:31,wallstreetbets,Do you mean selling a put?  I thought with buying puts/ calls your losses are limited to the premium.
2021-04-12 15:10:36,wallstreetbets,Thanks again. I‚Äôve lurked for a few years mostly for the laughs and to see the crazy wins and losses. Didn‚Äôt really start following along until purple this past summer lol. I let a bunch of contracts just expire back then ITM because I thought if I sold them then I‚Äôd be assigned to them with no way to pay. I just bought a 5/28 $12 $BB call for $38 just to watch and try selling. Just to learn as you instructed.

2021-04-11 20:48:27,wallstreetbets,">US gov is also looking at Chinese companies on the NYSE, because they obviously don't like what's they're seeing.

If you look at the actual regulations, they have I think two years to comply with US accounting standards (lol I just realized as I was typing this out this is basically US protectionism/job creation for big accounting firms), and disclosing (not banning) CCP membership on company boards. Should not be a major problem for Ali Baba, but could cause issues for smaller and shadier Chinese companies.

While US-China tensions are no doubt an investment risk, I think both governments will continue to play up the threat of the other for internal political reasons while still maintaining the extensive ties that basically underpin the entire global economic and financial system. Yes, there could be a major whoopsie, but if it ever gets really bad the entire global economy is fucked. US-China tensions getting bad enough to really screw over BABA means Boeing, Apple, Yum!, Starbucks ect. would also be fucked too. Could happen, but BABA is no more at risk than other major publicly-traded companies. The fact that the US government is basically run by large companies should help keep things in check.

People who think really silly things, like the US and China actually being likely to go to war in the next few years or decades, should in all seriousness move to Ecuador or Paraguay, because that is such a SHTF scenario that our investment accounts do not even matter at that point."
2021-04-12 03:50:45,wallstreetbets,"They aren't #1 by market cap in China anymore. I seriously doubt the US will delist Alibaba, don't the companies have 3 years to comply with the new rules before getting delisted?

>  people already get arrested under false charges, and that's with human judgement, yet you want to trust fallible software systems. 

Another logical fallacy (""Fallacy of the single cause"").  Judges who incarnate people without due process are a huge problem, but using AI to gather irrefutable evidence is *the solution to that problem*, not a nominal issue.   If facial recognition evidence is unclear (for example, lighting condition are not enough to determine if the suspect matches a perp's description), you throw away the evidence, not the entire system!  You're throwing the baby with the bathtwater here!!!

Again for the cheap seats: surveillance is invisible, it does not interfere in your daily life unless you act like a shit head (murdering, hitting someone, stealing), in which case their  actions are flagged and punitive actions are taken *if it's proven beyond reasonable doubt that they're  guilty!*  It's been proven in research studies that people behave better when they know they're being observed, which is the added value of these systems, they're both punitive and corrective.

If you had critical thinking skills you'd recognize that my argument isn't about some ethereal ""principal"" which is unidentifiable. I've stated multiple ways that surveilance states do not serve the people, they serve those in power while reducing the liberty of the people.

There is no way to guarentee that a computer system will be 100% accurate, and the evidence it gathers will still be used by people, which means whomever is in charge of that system can skew it to  bias towards whatever group they want to harass. Your idealism is honorable, but it is ignorant to assume such a system would not be taken advantage or or lead to false charges. Additionally, the way you keep referring to its use makes it sound like you're advocating for ""red flagging"" or worse yet ""pre-crime"".

>Make the world a better place, and start thinking for yourself!

This is exactly the poor conclusion that your ""red-flagging"" leads to. You come to the false conclusion that people will be safer and more liberated as they are oppressed by unseen eyes and cannot face their accuser. It may be true that people behave better, but that's at the cost of our mental state and degradation to our trust in the State and in one another.

You're so convinced in your goodwill to round up everyone on mere suspicion to save the few that you forget the plight of the many in doing so. There is no system which can prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", that's why we have prosecutors. Please kindly gtfo with your presumption of guilt, it leads to a totalitarian system where no one trusts anyone and everyone feels constantly afraid. Big oof.

We aren't going to see eye to eye, so I don't care to read your reply. Make one if you want but since it'll only be a pro-authoritarian, anti-liberty spiel promoting a system which serves the few at the expense of the vast majority, I'll not be reading it."

2021-04-12 10:17:26,wallstreetbets,"TQQQ has been my best-performing investment. I think we‚Äôre about to see a multi-year run for 2 reasons. 
1) because the sentiment post-Covid is going to be singularly big and positive. We really are about to move into the roaring 2020‚Äôs, fueled significantly by retirees who are quietly furious they worked for 40/50 years holding onto the promise of balling out in retirement only to have 1 of their few retirement years ripped from them so they‚Äôll be spending angry and last I heard cash in checking and savings accounts is insanely high (so motive and means) and;
2) I have older, generally tech-averse and change-averse coworkers who now talk about getting groceries delivered, ordering off Amazon, zoom social events etc etc. These people represent last adopters. Some of them won‚Äôt go back to the old way of doing things. Of course, my teenage baby sister and all her friends are obsessed with their phones. So I think COVID has significantly accelerated tech adoption and spread tech through more of the population. 

I see the above as evidence we‚Äôll see major cash inflows into tech, above and beyond what is currently expected. GME taught me that absolutely nothing was learned from 2008 so I do think the party will end in a similar fashion to the 1920‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm gonna be real dumb and buy calls/LEAPS on TQQQ. They‚Äôre expensive as hell and there are plenty of reasons not to buy insanely expensive calls, but this is where I see the world going. And TQQQ calls allow you to ~10x tech and I agree with OP, tech ain‚Äôt going anywhere. Bonus: all the new money printed may drive up prices as well."

2021-04-12 11:32:54,wallstreetbets,Got a summary of conference findings?
2021-04-12 14:54:11,wallstreetbets,I bought a few calls today. I like to buy a little bit of whatever pops up on WSB. It‚Äôs basically my own retard index fund.
2021-04-11 20:46:37,wallstreetbets,Just gonna buy and hold ARKG and let them worry about picking the winners/losers. Good DD tho
2021-04-12 06:55:08,wallstreetbets,Is the bullish volume the only reason for 4/16 calls?
2021-04-12 11:08:22,wallstreetbets,"I'll be stalking you your profile in the future, I think you're right but all 2k of myoney is in GME lol"
2021-04-12 14:46:42,wallstreetbets,Wtf happened here ü•¥
2021-04-12 00:44:24,wallstreetbets,They hold patents on inferior CRISPR variants and will not succeed.
2021-04-11 22:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Side note, Since EDITAS work with BMY. BMY just got FDA approval for their BCMA CARs. Floppy POS  i think someone here was yolo on there FDA approval. Johnson and Johnson lining up to get there FDA approval for their BCMA CARs."
2021-04-11 23:36:15,wallstreetbets,What trials did they present over the weekend? Is data from Brilliance trial out?
2021-04-12 04:03:40,wallstreetbets,"This really has potential to change the world, not just making us some profit. Thanks for the DD, i‚Äôm in with 172 shares"
2021-04-12 10:32:10,wallstreetbets,"I like the CRISPR play and I have a question.  Why is the eukaryote patent so critical?
Also, the only thing I found linking Editas to the patent through the broad institute was through their investment relations page (https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-announces-us-patent-and-trademark-office-grants).  I'm really surprised this wasn't bigger news.  Most of the news on this is pretty old, and I don't see any positive technical indicators for this thing moving soon other then multiple touches around $38 for support over the past month. So, why not buy May and June calls instead?

But thanks for this, I've been meaning to read more into CRISPR but science hurts my brain.  I picked up 1000 pre-market at $38, les go!"
2021-04-12 10:47:57,wallstreetbets,Nah waiting for that early May $30 buy-in
2021-04-12 11:44:11,wallstreetbets,Played this around $60-$80 awhile back. Thanks for the reminder to get back in.
2021-04-12 16:22:24,wallstreetbets,"Im already making money on my $48.50 4/23c. I'm somehow losing on my $46 4/16c.. This is actually my first options trade.... Can someone help me. Why am I losing on the 4/16? Thanks... Not the brightest bulb in the shed, -Hans"
2021-04-12 16:25:46,wallstreetbets,"Got shares near the close. Been intending to get in in the pullback and the pullback has been going for a while so this entry looks good. Glad WSB didn‚Äôt cause it to run away this morning. 

Already deep in CRSP. Don‚Äôt have any NTLA yet."
2021-04-11 22:08:55,wallstreetbets,"When he says ""this shit"" does he mean Editas or CRISPR in general?"
2021-04-12 10:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Same, can't find nothing nowhere. Definitely should have looked it up before buying calls this morning. I'm about to cut bait ü§°"
2021-04-11 20:53:04,wallstreetbets,"So I‚Äôm going to be straightforward: I don‚Äôt know, and I‚Äôd doubt anyone can give you a definitive answer. Biotech has a mind of its own, and the markets have been weird lately. Do I think it will hit $50 at some point in the future: yes. Do I know when it will hit $50: no."
2021-04-12 06:58:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and I went into them knowing they could be worthless so I spent only an amount I‚Äôm fine losing. I noticed the weird volume last Monday, and wanted to find an explanation. Because the patent trial is so complex, and covid delays I avoided options for the most part.. I plan on buying leaps before the next court date."
2021-04-12 11:09:36,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs completely fine! I‚Äôve been telling everyone that it‚Äôs biotech so there‚Äôs always a better time to buy. No reason to FOMO into it.
2021-04-12 14:49:56,wallstreetbets,"Everything‚Äôs down, and I advertised it as a long play. I‚Äôm not worried, and still going to hold."
2021-04-12 11:40:37,wallstreetbets,Your fears were not justified lol.
2021-04-12 10:56:53,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fair. I have been telling everyone never to fomo into biotech. There‚Äôs almost always a better time to buy, and sell."
2021-04-12 16:25:56,wallstreetbets,"So I kind of fucked the options chain because I didn‚Äôt expect anyone to read this. There‚Äôs multiple reasons why it could be up, but the 4/16 ones are down because there wasn‚Äôt a spike. I‚Äôd really really recommend shares, or long dated calls."
2021-04-12 16:29:36,wallstreetbets,"I know shares are kind of the antithesis of Wallstreetbets. But, it‚Äôs biotech lol. The volume wasn‚Äôt there today, but the order book showed that there‚Äôs a lot of people who bought in. Just got to wait for a whale. 

I‚Äôd put off buying NTLA right now because it has had a big run up this week. Trust me when I say there will be another chance to buy in. Biotech is extremely volatile so patience is awarded."
2021-04-11 23:58:08,wallstreetbets,Can they do gruel next?
2021-04-12 15:22:16,wallstreetbets,"I was jumping in and out too, but I‚Äôm shifting to just long, GME death grip style, hold.  Just averaging in more money at this point.

I‚Äôve also got ARKG as a catch all for other companies"
2021-04-11 20:49:23,wallstreetbets,"All good, thanks for the honesty. I look forward to reading your DD on SGMO if you decide to make one."
2021-04-12 07:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Alright cool. Thanks for taking the time on this, good DD. Been doing some browsing and it definitely seems Editas are on track for securing this patent. Are there any upcoming dates to be aware of? I've noticed some comments about release this morning but I can't find anything on it."
2021-04-12 11:43:30,wallstreetbets,Bro I got FUCKED on this. I bought at open like a retard and guess what. Down 40%. I am convinced I am never going to make money.
2021-04-12 18:40:17,wallstreetbets,I got may 21 calls
2021-04-12 08:35:52,wallstreetbets,Well looks like not today but a good time to get in?
2021-04-12 10:40:45,wallstreetbets,Bought 5/7 41$ calls .
2021-04-12 15:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Honestly just holding is probably the smartest move especially for biotech plays. It takes a long time to develop a drug, and timing the market is difficult. 

Personally not too big of a fan of some of the holdings in ARKG, but it‚Äôs still decent."
2021-04-12 08:25:27,wallstreetbets,"So I put up a google alert for news. Covid has delayed a lot of drug trials, and court cases so I‚Äôm expecting it to ramp up as everyone started getting caught up. I do plan on posting a bit earlier this time around important dates."
2021-04-12 11:45:11,wallstreetbets,Piece of advice: Never go in big at open after reading something like this. Everyone else has the same idea and you will get dumped on. Had you waited an hour you could have bought calls when edit was -4% and already flipped them for a nice profit
2021-04-11 20:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. You might want to invest more into crispr, so it can cure your child's autism some day. Maybe even yours, who the fuck knows."
2021-04-12 10:40:38,wallstreetbets,"I think the analysis is OK, he has a good point on the catalyst when it spiked to 100 at the end of December.  If it breaks support at 37.50 I'm out, or I start selling July calls.  Hopefully positive news breaks out of the conference and this bad bitch moons."
2021-04-12 14:20:39,wallstreetbets,nah I like where I am on the spectrum tbh
2021-04-12 09:05:46,wallstreetbets,Hmmm what‚Äôs ur cost average hopefully not 5.00 a call like me averaged down to 2.2
2021-04-12 09:03:57,wallstreetbets,Big fucking titties smack down

2021-04-11 20:55:42,wallstreetbets,You have sell limits set?   Or stop loss?
2021-04-12 14:02:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the info! I really appreciate it.
2021-04-12 14:02:17,wallstreetbets,"Oh. I forgot. Again if held to expiration, price must be above $26.69 just to break even."

2021-04-11 22:09:42,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm going to have to leave a comment here. 4G is generally all you need for something like a cellphone or tablet. 5G is a bit excessive currently new technology may come out that needs it but that hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Most routers already have a 5G band and cable running to that router making towers useless unless in remote areas. American tower builds the towers and phone carriers attach their antennas to them. With 4G 30 to 40 miles is standard range but 5G has less then a 1/3 of a kilometers of range and doesn‚Äôt need super tall towers making stuff like lampposts and such usable.

I would imagine that automation is something that young adults looking to be truck drivers would be considering and if that‚Äôs also hurting the hiring.

2021-04-12 02:42:13,wallstreetbets,"BMW, Samsung are not listed in US. Pinksheets names are not considered listed as they don't present any information to the exchange. Neither do they have any volume.
Chinese exchanges are not good for raising capital at all because they're restricted for foreigners. That means Hong Kong or US would be their first choice, Europe second. It's common sense for them to list in US."
2021-04-12 10:16:28,wallstreetbets,"I am very glad that you caught bmw and samsung being listed IN THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN and not in Usa. Thats exactly why i would not touch chinese company being listed in Usa, but not in China or Hong kong (which is autonomous or whatever but is China). No shortage of cash in China, and people were investing. Have the locals considered exchange as unstable and trust only in say real estate?? (If so why would it be)."
2021-04-12 02:44:20,wallstreetbets,"I've lived most of my life near Russia. 47% of the market is owned by Yandex Taxi and Uber, so what are you talking about? Majority of people in large cities use phones to order cars. What's so impossible for you to understand?
Didi has a share of Taxify, now Bolt, and is a strategic partner, they operate across Europe. There are others as well. So Europe is very relevant."
2021-04-12 12:29:24,wallstreetbets,"So the option is - capital from China only vs capital from all over the world and most of China. It's a simple choice, US exchange it is.
Are you trying to claim that the capital available in China is same or more than the rest of the world combined?"
2021-04-12 10:03:09,wallstreetbets,"As for Russia, i was born there so telling you that taxi in Russia for didi would not bring any reasonable money, so value of Didis investment is almost zero there. Uber has not posted a single profitable quarter (as a whole company ever). If Didi wants to be in Russia and be like uber in a sense of not making money thats fine. Russia has only Moscow and 5-7 ok financially places.70% of population has income under 18k roubles which is around 250 dollars. Does not seem as much profit potential.

Europe has places where Uber had troubles. Thats in uk

Very first article when i started to search it.
Company was valued 62B in august, they now aim 100B in July. Hard for me to justify it.

Yet they want 1.5B right now, which does not look that good either.

Plus all other issues. Their robotaxi is being developed, meanwhile Gm today signed exclusive deal for its cruse in Emirates till 2029, so others might be ahead.

Personally, i do not like the value,
 i do jot like that company is Chinese (russian, north korean, persian) for political reasons alone. Korean, japanese, european, american or whatever does not have such complications.
 Involvement of softbank raises question marks for me.
 
Plus whatever else i wrote before. I am not going to invest in it. If you want, go ahead. I pass. Good luck to you.

2021-04-12 12:31:39,wallstreetbets,"Plenty of people in Russia use ride-hailing services. Income level isn't a big indicator at all. Where I live now, the income is below that of Russia and ride-hailing services are dominating and competition is significant."

In the long run, debt is cheaper than equity."
2021-04-12 12:48:42,wallstreetbets,"Point i made about Russia is that didi can not make tonne of money. People in russia are poor, they have yandex, private cabs and unlike say India or even China internet is not that widely available. Therefore, there would not be a lot of cash and i would expect zero or negative return. Significant competition if you like."
2021-04-12 10:27:54,wallstreetbets,"I would not touch political concerns if it was Japanese or European company being listed in Usa.
 China and Usa have tensions. These affect markets.

 How dividends would be paid to american shareholders from profits generated in China? How easy it is to get funds moved out of china?

Latin America is not cash making machine. That is what i said. Lets go to extreme example. Venezuela, how much money can taxi generate there? I did not say that Latin America would not provide something, or Didi would not generate share of the market. I said its not big Financially market, can not be deceiceve. Yes, 1 billion people there, but only say 30 million of them can generate meaningful cash.

Essentially, you trying to prove that as taxi company it can generate cash. Well, i started with idea that 100b for a taxi company is too much. Technology and self driving can work in China, usa, europe (but not in Russia or Latin America)

Uber either way was not making money. With granting rights in uk they would be losing even more cash. 

Either way i would not touch this didi. For tonnes of reasons."

 Whether the company is gping to get market cap of 150b by end of year (something like that, as you clearly think that the number is going up, can be 120b or 200b, you get my point) or maybe 70b ( as i consider this overvalued and risky and might be totally wrong).
It does not matter to me. I wish you all the best, but for whatever reasons i have (even if i am wrong) i am not goung to touch it.

I am not going to touch any chinese company, assume that this is for Tibet, does not matter.

I can see how you'd think that, but it wouldn't work for puts, since you'd have to pay more for a stock that has gone down.

>I also didn't realize that selling options rather than exercising them was even a thing.

I'd say the majority of options contracts end this way, being sold to someone with the capital to exercise (or back to the market maker themselves). This would be especially true for high value stocks, since taking possession of 100 google shares would cost a pretty penny.

Specifically with gme, it would be a bad idea to sell the options on rather than exercising if you can help it, since exercising means the short sellers have to hand over more shares which people will hopefully hold until the squeeze."

2021-04-11 23:14:55,wallstreetbets,I think its a good play. I am confused on your expirations but overall it looks ayte. If the price jumps on to around 30 at some point leading up to demo day you should probably close some portion or your calendar spreads  (you would hit a local max in the next week if pltr hit 28-31). Then maybe close another portion as it hits the range again hypothetically after demo day. Basically this would be like DCA'ing

2021-04-12 01:35:23,wallstreetbets,"Just so you are aware, institutional ownership is not at 200%. People in this sub don't understand the way ownership is reported. But it is done once per quarter with a window of multiple weeks where companies can post their holdings. This means that most of the data that 200% is based on is from December and the rest is from the few institutional investors that have already reported. Since there is such a long window for reporting though it means that stock can very easily be double counted if one owner reports on April 2nd, then sells shares and another owner who bought those shares reports on April 8th with the same shares. Once again, that isn't even getting into the fact that most of this data has that problem AND the issue of being reported over 3 months ago.

I would highly recommend reading the DD on here with a skeptical eye as much of it is being blindly upvoted by people who never owned a stock before January so it is going to be very difficult to tell what is legitimate vs what is just confirmation bias."
2021-04-12 10:23:22,wallstreetbets,yup i realized the 200% is incorrect after i commented. I did my own research on the numbers and its definitely over 100% but yea the double counting in finra's data can be a problem if not removed

When the stock went parabolic, the volume was four to five times average which would mean you would divide 19 by the multiple the average is up.

2021-04-12 04:36:48,wallstreetbets,"And when it's not the truth? You'd rather have your delusion confirmed as truth, and proceed to lose everything than learn the truth and save yourself from even more losses?

Not saying GME investment is a delusion, just trying to give some example"
2021-04-11 21:30:54,wallstreetbets,"I didn't downvote you, but do you have me a little concerned. There are obviously basic concepts of the market that you are not aware of that such I would be very very careful of making any investments if I were you.

In order to explain the SI of 226% you have to understand that SI is not the float and it does not change the float. The fact that short interest was at 226% did not add a single share of GME to the float.

Many brokers have agreements with their clients in which they are allowed to loan their clients held shares of a given stock. Let's say you have the same agreement with your broker and you own one share of GME. Now the agreement with your broker does not change your broker's obligation to have your share available the moment that you decide you want to sell it. So even though your share is loaned out, the moment that you decide to sell your share your broker has the obligation to find a share to replace it for you. 

Now let's say the person who borrowed your share sold it short in the market. When it is bought by another investor, it is no different than any other share, so in essence now you own one share, and the person who bought the shortage share also owns one share. 

Clearly there is only one share between two people who are holding and above that there is the obligation of the person who borrowed your share to return it. Now let's say that the other person holding their share also has an agreement with their broker in which their broker may lend it out. Every time the share changes hands, that is your original share and everyone else holds some type of obligation or write to obligate,  rather than actually holding a share.

This is how the short interest gets above 100% and it is exactly this scenario that causes a short squeeze that drives the price of the stock to the Moon, because it suddenly everyone is scrambling to buy back the stock they shorted and return it before they lose even more money or get margin called because they do not have enough assets in their account to cover the loss.

Suddenly, bingo, short squeeze to the Moon."

2021-04-12 03:05:18,wallstreetbets,"I think there's a little misunderstanding here :) I meant that some people were downvoting you, so I gave you my upvote, I appreciate when people are able to discuss.

Also I know what you explained about the short interest and how shorting works, so no worries about that. Someone said the short interest now is 15% or so, you said that them to cover would require 0.25 days. I'm asking how the SI could be as HIGH as 226% in late February if you are right? if SI was 226% there's no way they did cover during March, and there's no way they'd need only 0.25 days to cover now.

Best guess, that huge SI was wrongly reported?"

you made a inference in thinking I thought trump cared based upon my comment. so your baiting. 

both sides are playing with same play book but using different colors.  

The Dems are going back to infighting on the bill and only have 50% of the senate. The only way they can pass anything is abusing rules of the senate and using the VP to break the tie.

It is still yet to be seen on if this trillion(s) dollar package will pass even with enough dem support. 

i make a comment about moving to a domestic supplier that dealt with a money equation and you jumped into politics."

2021-04-12 15:16:17,wallstreetbets,"The problem is that Spy puts are generally a loser. I made money on them during Covid last year, but the vast majority of people who got involved lost. For it to be easy, there has to be a very strong catalyst, or you have to have backtested your theory to hell and back. Have you done that? What's your sample size? How did you perform your backtesting? Most people who say the bullshit you are saying have seen it happen a few times (tiny sample size), and think that's just the way it is. 

To come on here claiming exact price points (404) while talking about bollinger bands, seasonality, and other TA bullshit without providing any data as to why you believe them is stupid and the things you are saying should just be completely ignored. 

None of what you said is particularly outlandish, but your margin for error is low and it's really easy to make a bet like this, have it be a winner and still fuck it up because you either sold too early or too late. That can be fine on a single bet, but most people try the same thing over and over again and ultimately get wrecked because they are playing feeling and don't actually understand the statistics involved. Hard numbers are the only thing that matter. So, like, provide some with historical evidence that this has happened over and over again."

2021-04-12 07:30:53,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has led virtual power plant trials in residential and commercial space, and develop them for a living. Also did a lot of work for international renewable energy agency.

1. VPPs are all AC connected systems. So loss
 concerns are unwarranted. Sure generation is dc but everything is DC/ AC inverted.
2. VPPs need very good load centres, for example I will not build a single VPP if 2x massive load centres are 40kms apart. It's likely going to be 2 seperate VPPs.

VPPs are a complex topic and can be easily confusing, it certainly will continue to grow significantly, there are however 10's of companies that can build such solutions.

Amongst them is Tesla, Who are on the way to become worlds largest distributed energy company. 

Anyhow just my 2c."

2021-04-12 07:44:51,wallstreetbets,"I conceptualised, led and built VPPs. 

And I agree with you, distributed energy resources ( solar, battery, micro wind) cost stack and commercials around customer use cases will dictate how much and extent to which they will grow. I see them increase over the years.

Some places where I am seeing their increased uptake are for following applications.

1. Network deferral  ( capacity augmentation)
2. Commercial and industrial ( shipping centres, industrial zone etc)
3. Edge of the grid ( remote townships, mining)
4. Large property developments ( where developers want to own the energy generation and supply).
5. Residential customers ( very standard).

Good luck and keep up the good stuff."

2021-04-12 17:13:41,wallstreetbets,"I love this trade. If BRK.B drops to 230, where it was at the bottom of the last correction, vol would shoot up. Vol was around 29% at the bottom of that last dip. If it drops to 200s, where it was last Nov, vol was at around 35% then. So if vol stays even close to that, even with a significant drop, you'd breaking even on this trade! It's trading at its support IV post-COVID right now. Biggest risk is if it does revert to its pre-COVID IV, you'd only need it to gain about 5% to break even

I think I just talked myself into YOLOing this"
2021-04-12 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Chris Bloomstran was arguing fair value was in the [$325-$365 range](https://imgur.com/a/PZMD2FZ) based on Q4 numbers.

By Jan 22 fair value will likely be >10% higher, so $357-$401 and above."

2021-04-12 17:29:51,wallstreetbets,"My point was trading on the assumption that IV will increase is simply ridiculous. IV has been reverting to pre-COVID numbers and no reason to think why it would not continue doing so.

I think this trade only makes sense if you think BRK.B will continue to go up in value."
2021-04-12 19:08:59,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, completely. The way i get $330 rough math is 5% buyback yield, 10% growth in bv = 15% growth in BV per share @ 1.5x re-rate gets us $330 by year end... could be way higher."

Recall your lent shares by switching from a margin to a cash account

If I recall correctly, guys rate girls on a bell curve centered around 5. Girls rated guys with a heavy skew.

It is probably important to take into account the expectation of the person asking when rating is all I am saying, because OKC shows that it can have a pretty big impact."
2021-04-11 23:34:56,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not a shallow person... but anyways.

Short winded answer: hard to say you‚Äôd have to ask them what they‚Äôre looking for. Could just be a personality thing and they don‚Äôt care about looks. Some just looks. Some just body.

Long winded answer:
It‚Äôs hard because some dudes use the grade 1-10 scale where anything below a 7 is bad cause it‚Äôs like an F. So saying someone is a 6-7 would be not good. Some dudes know that 50% is 5 so it‚Äôs an average above average person. I‚Äôd think a 6/7 is someone that buddy is more likely to click with on a personal level but they might not have a ‚Äúbangin body‚Äù however they are probably cute to them tho."

2021-04-11 22:03:34,wallstreetbets,Trying to help since you seem lost. Thought the article might educate you. You roll for either a credit or debit. End of story. I don't give a fuck if you don't like the terminology. That's what happens.
2021-04-12 01:31:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your concern, but I can assure you I don‚Äôt need education from an advertisement. 

You‚Äòll eventually notice that it‚Äôs not just my personal opinion, but a rather common discussion in the community. Just because things are called a certain way doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs what they really are. Credit and debit have just established themselves as quick and dirty ways to describe it. 

There‚Äôs no actual credit or debit, only gains or losses from two separate trades (to go even further, there‚Äôs no immediate gain from selling an option - same as any trade, it‚Äôs a neutral action in your portfolio). 

To make my point more obvious: Despite the name, there are no birds, neither organic nor metallic, involved in an iron condor."
2021-04-12 16:18:30,wallstreetbets,"Credit = realized gain

Debit = realized loss


It's a lot fucking easier and literally everyone who understands options knows what it means. Stop being an options grammar cop. No one cares if you don't like it. It's commonly used. 

Roll for realized gain? Roll for realized loss? GTFO."

I could never justify a $950 rent on a $1200 income. And I know all about high rents. Over here you're most likely unable to even get such a lease. Lots of renters have set their minimum income limit (pre-taxes) to trice the rental amount. (This is the other end of the spectrum and also complete shit)"

950 for a room was cheap, and this was already with a 1hr bus commute (2hr bicycling) to work. 

I remember looking before I lost my apartment, I couldn‚Äôt find anything at the time for less than $1000 a month. Not sure how it looks now; I‚Äôve lived at home for two years now.

I‚Äôm in Southern California now, rent prices are even worse, but retired parents own their home (moved here in the 60s when it was a small town with a dirt road and a post office) so they offered me a place to stay, rent free till I got back on my feet.

MSOs are making their money from the markets they operate in. Not because they are actually good companies. They are 100% reliant on restrictive marijuana laws. MSOs will lose massive massive amounts of market share in the switch from medical to recreational. 

LP's on the other hand are great companies who are simply overbuilt for their current markets. They currently bring in $0 from the best economy in the world (US.). These earnings everyone is so disappointed over, are actually bullish as fuck. 

Here's the thing people don't get....MSOs are guaranteed to LOSE market share. LPs are guaranteed to GAIN market share. It's just a waiting game."

You think this short term shit is an issue for an investor? I'm not trading this shit. 

I don't care if your brain is too small to comprehend this or not, but US MSOs are just legal cartels clinging on to their dying vertically integrated business models. Their markets make them special. There's nothing ""special"" about any of them, and all their branding is trash tier.

If i am doing a side project stock account i can't afford to also be doing lots of buying selling options on that account.

I ran the numbers from Dec 1 to present - the Senators have purchased the following shares (estimated the value of each based on their buy amount as listed and without exerting alot of effort going too deep into the actual # of shares) - I will use a robinhood account and buy this many $$ worth of each share - and add or sale based on everything posted from tomorrow and beyond....until i get tired of doing it. I will post update here once per month if i remember.

&#x200B;

Instead of buying this many shares - $1 will represent the buy in value - \*(for a total value of $1000 to start)

According to Pre-Timing, we may see a climb up to ~$22.50 with a close ~$18 on Monday,  followed by a consolidation phase until the following Thurs/Friday (4/22 and 4/23), when the next big breakout to ~$28.50 with a close ~$23 will occur. If we see that breakout on Monday, I‚Äôm going to sell my April 16th calls.

2021-04-12 17:05:57,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I took the opportunity to pickup another 50 shares today @$12.95.  Yeah I think we will see $80-$130 this year."
2021-04-12 16:51:56,wallstreetbets,Never too late. Just got in myself.
2021-04-12 17:07:21,wallstreetbets,I'm really excited about the stock. It has the best reinforcement to be above $12-30 just with that contract alone. It's a safe investment IMO.
2021-04-12 18:13:29,wallstreetbets,"Here‚Äôs something to chew on... MVIS gets a royalty from MSFT for every MVIS component in the Hololens 2... imagine when the other US Military branches (The Marines, Navy, Air Force) decide they want IVAS too... and our allies... the Australian Air Force is starting to use the Hololens 2... we‚Äôre talking $100B+ potential just for the military... not to mention it is also being used by medical/surgical, infrastructure/architecture/construction, industrial/Hi-tech manufacturing, gaming and entertainment (Niantic, the developer of Pok√©mon Go, is only testing their next gen sequel on the Hololens 2, and they are developing gaming headsets that will also use MVIS tech)... this will be the new normal in the next 5-10 years, and MVIS is an integral supplier. That‚Äôs a lot of royalties... The value of the AR division alone is difficult to assess..."
2021-04-12 18:28:18,wallstreetbets,Unbelievable. Thanks for the info. I'm definitely liquidating TSLA tomorrow haha. I was 30 seconds away from doing so at $703 (average of $641) at 3 shares. Should be enough to get me a decent size to buy for now.

2021-04-12 12:47:41,wallstreetbets,"Wall St are shorting palantir for sm f up reason, so much hate for its ceo"
2021-04-12 18:21:44,wallstreetbets,"Worst case, it gets exercised, I make money as the strike is already well above my acquisition price.  

I can always get back in or sell puts until it gets assigned."

2021-04-12 12:06:01,wallstreetbets,Long $NTLA $EDIT $CRSP $BEAM and $ARKG here. Gene-editing is the future but the market is undervaluing the intellectual property of the companies in my opinion.
2021-04-12 13:20:33,wallstreetbets,"I feel like everyone thinks I'm exaggerating with the tech company comparisons, but everyone thought the early proponents of the tech companies were exaggerating too. We'll ask them again in 20 years"
