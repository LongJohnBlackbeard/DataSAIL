Funny, I thought growth was cheaper right now based on a future p/e perspective, and in terms of long term viability. Cyclicals seem overpriced considering there is an industry right behind it ready to take it over, and everything tech is equally cannibalistic but with a semiconductor shortage expected for 2+ years, my money is going to gamble on tech, and bio pharma carries a long patent. Not to mention Cramer warned that a rotation back into tech was coming up and oil would see a temporary drop as hedge fund managers hedge their long positions. In short, I think tech is about to hit a 6 month bull market, but I could be wrong."

2021-05-11 18:41:33,wallstreetbets,This is a good play. Beef prices were down because most restaurants were closed for a bit during covid and slow to restart. Most of the expensive cuts go to restaurants but with them closed it was all hamburger as that‚Äôs what consumers mostly buy at market basket or stop and shop. With increase restaurant demand the beef should increase anytime now.
2021-05-11 19:37:56,wallstreetbets,Any reason why?
2021-05-11 17:35:24,wallstreetbets,"Not investment advice. I am not a financial advisor and this is just my opinion.     

You don‚Äôt think commodity prices will get capped soon? All the fed has to do is lower yields and commodity prices will drop slowly. With good weather around the corner which should lead to bountiful harvests, why would you bet on commodities increasing in price when supply will be greater than last year?"

2021-05-11 18:53:20,wallstreetbets,"There's some theories about how much more people cooked/learned to cook over the last year but I haven't seen anything concrete. Beef should be stocked up on while they continue to be loss leaders in the store. Wholesale values have been increasing, but the stores make so much on the rest of the cart that the price in store is not much higher."
2021-05-11 19:46:49,wallstreetbets,"One of the last ag commodities that haven't gone on a big run yet. Meat Packers are making $1000 per animal and the producer is getting hosed because the cattle are so big from covid delays. We have really high grain prices all of a sudden and that will make the producer puke. I made a lot when it did from the huge spike in corn in 2012 to the high in cattle in 2014. It might not look the same, but it will rhyme. Prices doubled in that time."
2021-05-11 17:42:43,wallstreetbets,"Do you lump all commodities together? Grains have seen the biggest of their move, but cattle prices are still at historically low levels while meat packing margins are the highest in history. Cattle prices take the longest of the meats to react to input and demand shocks. Hog prices have had an awesome run the last few months while cattle have been relatively quiet because of the turnaround in the production cycle. A hog cycle is close to 8 months while the calf cycle could be up to 2 years. I have no doubt cattle will catch up in time as they have done historically. The 2012 drought caused $7-$8 corn like we have now, and cattle prices nearly doubled...after a year of consolidation. History will repeat itself.

Edit: HAVE YOU LOOKED AT CORN AND BEAN CARRYOUT"

2021-05-11 17:50:49,wallstreetbets,"Hogs have China and Swine Flu to thank(yes it is a huge issue in China). Grain prices likely went up because last year‚Äôs harvest was low in quality and quantity. Idk much about cattle as it isn‚Äôt a field I have really looked at from an agricultural perspective(farming or commodity trading), but I don‚Äôt think lower yields will help any of the commodities. Again, not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. It is just my opinion."

2021-05-11 18:43:45,wallstreetbets,The UI reminds me of Fidelity
2021-05-11 17:56:32,wallstreetbets,"This is live cattle which is a physical, deliverable contract for 40,000lbs of fat (ready for market) cattle. Every other month the front month you can make an intent to deliver (if short) or you could be delivered on (if long). Feeder cattle are a cash settled futures contract. You are essentially buying/selling a non deliverable paper contract worth the amount of 50,000lbs of calves."
2021-05-11 17:50:28,wallstreetbets,"Regs on cattle/beef? Demand is worldwide and very strong. Could go either way long term, but the main thing holding cattle back is supply and high grain prices will lower carcass weights substantially. I could see regs decreasing supply long term also, will be interesting for sure."
2021-05-11 18:02:01,wallstreetbets,"You think prices went up because quality and quantity was lower, but you don't think lower yield (supply) will increase price? I'm familiar with African Swine Fever if that's what you meant? It's something that will raise all boats, imo."
2021-05-11 19:13:31,wallstreetbets,Stonk or steak perspective?
2021-05-11 18:14:30,wallstreetbets,if it doesnt work out u wanna take delivery and start a burger chain?  Like your style though best of luck with your thick stack of meat.
2021-05-11 18:30:41,wallstreetbets,You only get delivered if you don't close your contract out prior to expiration though right?
2021-05-11 18:12:02,wallstreetbets,"First part was contradictory. That is exactly what I meant... with good weather and supply going up, how much will that impact commodity prices vs inflation expectations?        

Yeah I was talking about African Swine Flu. As far as I‚Äôm aware, America eradicated it while China is having to slaughter all of their piglets before they are ready to eat. I do believe it raises all the boats, but I was saying it would directly impact pork prices the most(pig is a staple food for China).         

Overall I think your trade will be a winning play, but I think it might take some time to develop. Aren‚Äôt futures contracts a buy and hold/can‚Äôt trade out of? I‚Äôve never played with futures because I‚Äôm still trying to understand stonks where I can make 5-10x returns per month before I rotate to something new.       

Also, I dmed you about a production plant, is there any chance you might be able to read over it and give me a reply? Thanks for your time!"
2021-05-11 19:59:15,wallstreetbets,Whatever is tastier. I would certainly pass on some top notch steak if I would get some GME stonk in return. I can delay gratification for the bigger picture.
2021-05-11 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, there's first notice day 2nd week of contract month so anytime after that you could get delivered on or you pay a fee to get out of it but it's like $400/contract so you're kinda playing with fire. Its first in first out so you kinda know when it's coming."

they'll print whatever number they need to tomorrow to keep the wheels from coming off"
2021-05-11 17:47:29,wallstreetbets,"CPI definitely not showing the whole picture... the statistics provided by governments also exclude any asset inflation (housing + stock bubbles). Personal gold stock pick and positions: $KL 300 shares - one of lowest All in sustainable costs, safe jurisdictions of Canada + Australia, extremely shareholder friendly with massive free cashflow to support dividends and share buybacks + greater upside with leverage to gold price."
2021-05-11 17:44:46,wallstreetbets,From what i understand gold has been on a rise for quite sometime now due to the growing demand and  inflation has been known to happen for quite sometime. We will see if the overal market will view that the inflation is already priced in the current price and will look for opportunities from other commodities or will gold and silver indeed soar.
2021-05-11 19:11:28,wallstreetbets,I YOLOed 5/21 $27 SLV calls so...I hope this comes to pass.

2021-05-11 18:04:46,wallstreetbets,It could definitely have some effect but its hard to say to what extent imo. The market could rally behind base metals due to the infrastructure projects that has been announced but the rising pressure on those commodities has been crazy recently so gold and silver might not be such a bad choice.
2021-05-11 18:07:45,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm balls deep in silver ü§£ I‚Äôll even buy a copper round next time I can. Do you mean paper copper or physical?

2021-05-11 17:16:17,wallstreetbets,"OP mentioned they moved up earnings to a Monday the 17th. While options expire on the 21st. If a squeeze happens probably, post earnings. Still have 4 trading days before options expire... this is setting up nicely I'd say."

Look at SPY, QQQ, IWM, and DIA.  Those are the main indexes.

Clov is on the QQQ and you can see that‚Äôs the only thing dragging it down, the fact that it recovered completely today is good, I believe the dip for this stock technically is anything under 10$ we are in the dip.  Now is the time to buy or average down."
2021-05-11 18:23:04,wallstreetbets,The delta on 10C is only 0.23. Part of the recent decline is MMs unwinding positions due to the delta decline.

2021-05-11 19:53:20,wallstreetbets,Clearly you haven‚Äôt done your own DD because legit word for word this is 100% true. This is an easy squeeze. LFG!!!!!
2021-05-11 18:44:57,wallstreetbets,some companies schedule earnings before they've actually done all the accounting. why would a company *move up* earnings to a pre-market on a Monday the week of options expiration if they know they missed? that literally gives them their stock maximum downside exposure to the market.
2021-05-11 19:30:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah only problem is none of those companies have this type of setup for a squeeze.  The amount of open interest says it all.

2021-05-11 18:47:09,wallstreetbets,"but that sets up the gamma squeeze if earnings blow out expectations. all those far otm calls aren't hedged by many shares. if CLOV jumps 25% or something ridiculous like FUBO, it'll go nuclear on market open with its options chain."
2021-05-11 19:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes! Everyone...buy shares, not options."
2021-05-11 19:01:48,wallstreetbets,Is that not what dynamic delta hedging is for?  The stock has been going down so MMs have been unwinding from their positions with decreasing delta.  They'd possibly be buying more as it gets closer to expiry IF the price action improves. If we're lucky they'd get pinned on a price target that triggers the squeeze with options getting exercised.

2021-05-11 18:33:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the weight is small. However, my point is that the hindenburg short report had no weight and didn't hold. So, Do you think institutions would be buying CLOV if the report was true? Why throw money away... 

For instance, Nikola after the hindenburg report? How many institutions bought in after the report?"

2021-05-11 17:09:03,wallstreetbets,"The ‚Äúinstitutional investors‚Äù are passive funds so using them as a bull case doesn‚Äôt make any sense. As more people buy the fund itself- the more the fund buys. 

Movies are not dead, i agree. Let‚Äôs just say that people do go back to move theaters at pre pandemic levels. (cause the whole ‚Äúlots of people like this stock so they will go to movies more‚Äù argument is comically stupid). AMC is trading at 500% the market cap it was at pre pandemic. 

The AMC ceo said he does not expect profit levels of 2019 until at least 2023. At the end of 2019 AMC had a market cap of 780M it has a market cap of 4.52B right now. 

AMC got almost 360M attendance per year in 2017-2019 and pulled a loss 2 of those 3 years. If you think there are enough investors in AMC to make a dent in this number you are delusional. 

In order to JUSTIFY current price point, movies need to be a LOT more than just ‚Äúnot dead‚Äù they need to come back at multiples, 2-3 times as hard in theaters as before to justify the CURRENT PRICE. 

It amazes me how these plays that started off as a unanimously agreed zero fundamentals short squeezes have now turned into people trying to justify absurdly high valuations using never seen before metrics."
2021-05-11 16:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock has primarily passive and smart beta strategies. They‚Äôre not investing in AMC because it‚Äôs a good company... it got picked up on a screen or mandate and was added to the fund... blackrock, like vanguard and state street, has equity ownership in almost every publicly traded company in the world.  This is not a relevant or even positive signal for the company. 

As for your analysis, volume is great, but they‚Äôve peaked at 4-600mn in ebitda prior to covid and have 5.5bn in debt plus lease expenditures. There is negative working capital and at current burn, they‚Äôll need to raise more equity. Cinema doesn‚Äôt have to die for this company to die‚Äîit would die based on it‚Äôs pre-covid trajectory. 

I love the movies too, but that‚Äôs not an investment case."
2021-05-11 16:23:31,wallstreetbets,"u sir are an idiot. Box Office hits translate into big money for Studios. Overhead is tremendous, they make most of their money on pop corn and soft drinks. Movie Theatres may not dissapear but increasingly less and less will survive the dwindling number of patrons."
2021-05-11 16:56:55,wallstreetbets,"I think traditional movie theaters are headed out the door. Going to see a movie is very expensive. By the time you pay for tickets & the wildly overpriced food, you're out $100+ for a family of four. Just for a 2 hour movie. Which you can easily watch in the comfort of your own home on your big screen tv for a fraction of that cost. Movie theaters need to be investing into the experience. There needs to be pre-movie activities, such as really nice arcades, etc. The theater area needs to be really nice too. I have noticed many theaters now investing into luxury seating & even serving beer. That's a step in the right direction. But just having a movie & some expensive popcorn isn't cutting it anymore."
2021-05-11 16:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Tell me the last time you streamed a movie off one off your streaming subscriptions, recommend that movie to all your friends and family and they came back with the same great reviews. I have not in the last few years seen that happen. How long do you tirelessly scroll through Netflix trying to find something and just can‚Äôt ? Well because it‚Äôs mostly trash!

The theaters project the movies and the streaming companies show those as their ‚Äúrentals‚Äù . 

Economy is getting almost to the point it‚Äôs fully open, vaccinations are raising every day and capacity limits are starting to be removed . People been locked up for a year and want to go back out and enjoy life . 

One of those things was going out for dinner, watching a movie and getting ice cream after. That experience is hard to beat , and of course the great sex after üòâ. That makes for an awesome date! 

Who doesn‚Äôt love taking the family to the movies ?

It only took a pandemic which is sad, to show people what they had all along and took it for granted.

I'm sayng their product lines are old and dated and while some are capable of generating profit, they are in no way even scratching the surface."

2021-05-11 16:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock and vanguard has only increased their stakes this year.  It doesn‚Äôt need to be picked up on a screen or mandate. 

Yes indeed you are right there is a negative working capital. But my argument is loyal investors turning into loyal consumers, the ability for AMC to raise more cash stay afloat and slowly pay off debt is more real then ever before.  They could raise cash before the hype, this event made it even more possible.

Something is brewing."
2021-05-11 16:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Box office hits also translate to big money for Theatres, more ticket sales = more profit from food and drinks.  

Theatres made more  ticket sales  in the past 10-20 years then in the past 100 years. If you take the entire NFL,MLB,NHL,MLS ticket sales for one season, cinemas still sold x7 more tickets .  

All this happened without the current hype over theatres and AMC.  Sure some companies will shut down, others like AMC will thrive because of its current loyal  consumer base that keeps growing."
2021-05-11 18:36:34,wallstreetbets,"This right here. I‚Äôve invested heavily into my home theater gear to recreate a theater experience (and to game on an amazing setup haha). If I am slightly interested in a movie I just buy it outright, still cheaper.

2021-05-11 16:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Have you thought about why Hedge Funds wanted to short AMC & GME so much? They wanted to make billions off of streaming services.

2021-05-11 18:28:17,wallstreetbets,"they increased their holdings in passive funds- as fund flows increase, so does their shares in AMC. literally means nothing. BlackRock and vanguard are not necessarily ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù they have combined invested in over 14,000 equities with over 15T AUM with AMC being a very very small fraction of their total assets. They have a bunch of indexes that track various parts of the market. As the original commenter said it is very likely they entered it through a screener."

submission or execution, either by IBKR or by the market. Filters may also result in an order being cancelled or rejected. IBKR may also cap the price or size of Client's orders before they are
submitted to an exchange. IBKR reserves the right in its sole discretion, without notice, to impose filters and order limits on any Client order and will not be liable for any effect of filters or order
limits implemented by IBKR or an exchange, market or dealer."

No reason for it to be worth half of not-a-real-company like $FCEL.  There's also another company that does the same thing on a smaller scale called futurefuel and they were up 30% today even though it's a strictly worse play.  Oh, and they had yet more good news (about the 15th case of it in the last month) with a new agreement with $CVX, so of course it was down 3 points.

&#x200B;

That said, when you jump in, you now have to acknowledge that some bad faith hedge funds are artificially suppressing the price (probably because we like it).  It'll get there.

2021-05-11 18:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! That actually looks really positive, you had me scared. Seems to be branded content for creators, slipping past original content as networks might view it.

2021-05-11 17:04:09,wallstreetbets,You re not sure anymore?
2021-05-11 16:48:24,wallstreetbets,it means that there is a short squeeze in play. Did you read about GME or something and just think that whenever a stock goes up it means it squeezes?
2021-05-11 19:47:56,wallstreetbets,"Calm down guys.  What your jerk off friend here means is that ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù is an actual trading term. And what the other jerk off friend is saying is, I want a squeeze like scenario of 20%+ gains.

   Anyways FUBO is the way. And as always, buy me lunch."
2021-05-11 16:54:32,wallstreetbets,"Lol, my comment was kinda sarcastic and implies some hope given fubos 20% short interest as per today morning (although I think they might have covered at open hence the run). Yes, I heard about gme, in fact I had a 7500% return"
2021-05-11 17:09:16,wallstreetbets,"So it squeezes tomorrow? but there was a short squeeze today but it was covered at open? Even though the main increase in price happened AH, when the ER was? 

Actually, don't reply please. this conversation makes my brain hurt..."
2021-05-11 17:13:10,wallstreetbets,"You re stupid.

Fintel short interest info is as of 05/10. That was 20%

My hypothesis is that if the shorts haven‚Äôt covered their share today at open then this could potentially squeeze tomorrow.

Hypothesis

Do you know what this means?"

2021-05-11 17:16:13,wallstreetbets,I sold VUZI AND DKGS just to get my losses back. Bought in at $67 as it was going up. Worth it.
2021-05-11 19:01:14,wallstreetbets,Literally bought yesterday at 67.1 then sold today at 66 right before it shot up because i wanted to do some other trade. Im too impatient

So how are they making money? Kids don't have cash to spend online, unless parents nowadays are just giving the credit card to their ~~retarded fortnite/roblox~~ kids.

I know what they do (I did my DD before IPO). They have no IP that is of any value. No moat. Little advertising potential. Likely legal issues in the near future.

I'd expect liquidity of the stock to be very low. Try and sell even a billion dollar of that stock in a day and see how the stock craters."

2021-05-11 19:09:00,wallstreetbets,Roblox is way over valued and nothing can change my mind about that. I think it's a good company to invest in if it's valuation wasn't insane.

2021-05-11 19:03:09,wallstreetbets," I like the games on roblox but , trading the stock is uneventful. It opened at around $74 and now it‚Äôs still around the same price. Lol 
I get the value but It should have opened much lower as an ipo. More retail investors would have embraced it. I bought 100 shares at open then dumped after a couple months ,it cause it was worthless holding it, my money could have been more effective in other stocks. . Just being real."
2021-05-11 19:44:36,wallstreetbets,the guy's head is tiny. whoever PS'd this did a half assed attempt

The product is a platform, it‚Äôs like steam for kids.  Who wouldn‚Äôt invest in Valve if it was public?  They buy activision and that company is a poster child for wasted potential.  The only reason for the uncertain guidance is because they can‚Äôt be certain what will happen after kids go back to school full time.

I‚Äôm not playing short term to save my heart from dumb dips like this."
2021-05-11 19:04:54,wallstreetbets,Lol I wish. Jumped in one day one. I'm back to start.
2021-05-11 19:05:05,wallstreetbets,I bought some more around $64... glad I did

2021-05-11 16:54:09,wallstreetbets,"I was this close to selling them since it seemed like RBLX had turned into dog doo, but I said fuck it, they're not worth it."
2021-05-11 19:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Fuck. Dumping like $500 would be 150k if you bought this morning. Instead I bought $500 of shitty ABNB

E: Imagine the retarded level of correcting someone‚Äôs math and being wrong. 

Try typing in 500 x 300 and see what you get. The comment said 300 bagger and not 300% or whatever else you apes are pulling. Must‚Äôve never made baggers before"
2021-05-11 19:24:51,wallstreetbets,That was a $1 not for a penny. If they bought 5000 and sold for 300. They would gain over million in profit.
2021-05-11 17:18:06,wallstreetbets,I noticed that too late.

2021-05-11 16:06:38,wallstreetbets,65-85 seems to be its trading window. It keeps poking north of 80 for brief periods.

2021-05-11 19:58:11,wallstreetbets,Citadel bought it probably.
2021-05-11 16:47:29,wallstreetbets,Where?
2021-05-11 16:07:11,wallstreetbets,They had like 140% YoY revenue growth. And I think most of the shares are on lockup till September.
2021-05-11 15:58:00,wallstreetbets,It's fucking rigged! Especially in the US!
2021-05-11 17:15:25,wallstreetbets,"Their earnings call showed growth in their player base which could potentially become individual revenue streams. Overall they lost more money this quarter but their player base went up and so that's why people are optimistic. Naturally they say the growth is sustainable after covid as lockdown begins to relax but a lot of their growth was DUE to covid and I'm not confident they'll maintain the momentum. It's one of those situations that highlights the gambling nature of stocks. It may mean it'll do better, it may not."
2021-05-11 16:34:55,wallstreetbets,Double the estimate is shit earnings? Did the earning call push the price up?
2021-05-11 18:28:05,wallstreetbets,Roblox revenue numbers are a lie. Look at Bookings. They do this weird accounting thing where revenue is recognized as bookings divided by 23. Their bookings grew a shit ton and beat expectations by 60%
2021-05-11 17:20:51,wallstreetbets,"they have USER base.  i.e. facebook status.  if the eyes are there, there are people that want to see how roblox can maniuplate or generate revenue from those eyes.  Look at youtube.  it was unprofitable for the longest time and costing google BILLIONS.  but google knew what they had."
2021-05-11 18:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I sold at $72 thinking earnings weren‚Äôt that great.."
2021-05-11 18:53:45,wallstreetbets,players went up. thats all that matters. If other households are like mine they have a 3 year old and a 2 year old that are obsessed with roblox but aren't quite old enough to steal my card to buy robux. Its only a matter of time.
2021-05-11 17:51:34,wallstreetbets,Gamestop kills it with house clean up plans... -50% lol. The US market makes no sense to me.
2021-05-11 19:39:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah just found out by accident tbh. Since when? Is this thing gonna go up? üò¨
2021-05-11 16:25:30,wallstreetbets,bro RBLX usually dips to $69 when it dips.. it's a fun stock imo.
2021-05-11 16:32:29,wallstreetbets,when I dump your mom via text?
2021-05-11 18:28:47,wallstreetbets,"My limit orders all triggered today, I'm all cash at the moment. I think I'll stay that way till Monday at least, it's been a weird week in the market already and it's only Tuesday!"

2021-05-11 19:49:24,wallstreetbets,Same! I only have 15 shares but wondering myself if I should buy more or sell tomorrow.
2021-05-11 18:43:50,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs geared towards younger kids right now, but that is changing. They are focused on creating a huge metaverse where you can create anything. Think Ready Player One in real life. 

Imo this company is pretty misunderstood as being just a kids game like you mentioned. 

From a financial standpoint their revenue also just doubled yoy and they have no debt."
2021-05-11 18:56:10,wallstreetbets,"Me and my friend are college-aged, and we still play it because it's one of the few games we can agree on. It can't compete with other major game engines technology-wise, but what it does have going for it is a huge community and a universal way to access the games created with it. Despite the technology used, there are some gems on the site. It's also fun to fuck with the more toxic communities.

Also, yes, parents are just giving their kids money to spend on the site. It also almost certainly collects a fuckton of user data to sell."

Yes the rest are owned by match group, everyone who says you don‚Äôt have to use them or they don‚Äôt control them are fucking delusional. Sure they are free and they steal your data, but they‚Äôve fucked the apps so hard now you don‚Äôt get much activity unless you subscribe. I remember 3-4 years ago I‚Äôd have like 800 matches in my apps, now its a struggle unless you pay and swipe until they ban you lol"

2021-05-11 19:58:35,wallstreetbets,"Is it growing exponentially or very gradually? Because all it takes is a release of a new game to take away the player base. I get that it's been around for a while and still remained popular, but do you really see Roblox reaching new heights with the already crowded market? For short term gains I'd say go for it, but long term seems a bit off to me."

2021-05-11 16:43:10,wallstreetbets,"Definitely! That's why I'm asking for more details. 

Can you explain the context how you were seeing with your own üëÄ Bill Gates eating children? Because from where I stand you sound suspicious to have been witness to it and didn't do nothing to stop Gates from chewing on a kid"
2021-05-11 16:47:23,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre funny you act like he‚Äôs doing things for humanity especially kids. Kick rocks.
2021-05-11 16:49:08,wallstreetbets,"No, no, no, you're trying to get away without answering where you were when you saw it with your own üëÄ

I can look for and find what his foundation has done, but can you provide proof of him snacking on kids?"
2021-05-11 16:53:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I said I saw him eat children with my own eyes, get a FN clue you and your peeps always run with shit that you take out of context with something that wasn‚Äôt said. I said I see with my own eyes and I think for myself, which is something you don‚Äôt do! Media HOE!! Pound sand"
2021-05-11 17:15:58,wallstreetbets,"Just because the media that you watch and People magazine that you read tell you that he‚Äôs this great man and he‚Äôs doing all of these great things for humanity. I call BS! I didn‚Äôt see him eating anyone but I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump but I sure miss him as President. You probably hate Trump because people, media and Facebook told you to. Open your eyes think for yourself and wake the fuck up!!!"
2021-05-11 17:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, I don't think for myself, that's why I want to know more about your allegations.

So if I understood correctly, you never saw him eat underage kids or saw proof of him gnawing on a child, am I right? But you saw something with your own eyes that is not Gates munching on munchkins that makes you believe that he has a taste for younglings. 

Just to be clear and stop dancing around the pot. 

Do you think it is probable that he his a cannibal or is it an absurd idea? Honestly, at this point, I'm confused on where you stand on this question."
2021-05-11 17:27:15,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for proving my point and adding on top üôÇ over the past few weeks I've noticed an increasing number of similarities between QAnon and what is happening on investment subreddits, my current theory is a lot of delusional followers of QAnon fell lost after the failed attempt to overtake Capitol and have been looking for a new home where they can interpret reality through their distorted views. You can see similar myths and concepts.

For what it's worth, I had more fun with Trump as president, way more entertaining if you ask me, I even made money off his election by betting on his victory on BetWay. But tbh it was more of a bet against Clinton than pro trump.

I don't follow American media very closely, nor do I follow Facebook posts (I only use Facebook for the marketplace and keeping in touch with close friends), and honestly haven't looked inside a People's magazine since the 80's. 

I just find it intriguing that you find it easier to believe there's a cabal of baby eating then that the Gates foundation does caritative work. It's almost as if the more improbable the ideas is the easier you find it believable, while I'm on the other end and am more of a Occam's razor kind of guy.

But hey as they say, it takes all kinds to make a world!"
2021-05-11 19:34:50,wallstreetbets,"If Gates is a cannibal does that mean puts on $MSFT or calls on $KHC?  Far too simp, read on...

Did Gates acquire so much farm land to ultimately farm children? I mean, an all child diet requires a lot of farmland to support the mothers and their children. Do you think he uses breastmilk butter to oil the skillet? Does he personally breed them or were his biotech stakes to fund synthetic artificial insemination with the actual end goal of GMO baby meat (a whole food source). 

So many questions the media just don't have answers to. 

The investment answer is buy farmland since Bill clearly wants to commercialize the sale of baby meat for billionaires. The billionaire market is just now becomming large enough thanks to economic inequality and COVID. It's perfect. Land mortgages offer significant leverage with government backed financing. The monthly premiums are a bitch but you can hedge that with cannabis and beans. Those two crops are prime baby making feedstock. Gates will swoop in and 10X your money. 


One thing is for sure, Bill's conscious will live on forever after he joins Jobs in the cloud."
2021-05-11 18:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Baby eater??? Wtf. He is a depopulist, philanthropist who ""donates"" computers to school districts. Then makes then sign a contract to buy Microsoft software. Hmmmm, that's of no benefit to him. Starting ""no profit"" orgs. Then hires his children to run them for millions. And dont forget his buddy Epstien who hung himself in jail. Bahahah  Oh and another one was his vaccine that was mandatory in India, hmmm sideffect sterility.. Let's not even go down the rabbit hole of his ties to the Wuhan laboratory, that'll make a great book someday. 
In short: Bill is not a great person"
2021-05-11 17:35:18,wallstreetbets,"He just gives money he doesn‚Äôt do anything for people, people gave to him and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so rich because of the people. If you go back and listen to things that come out of his mouth Gates mouth like the pandemic & vaccines before any off the BS started, population control, global warming. blocking out the sun Get the fuck out of here this came out of his mouth.

You have to realize that most of wall street, whales, and large institutions are filled with very old people who are good at one thing and thats numbers and seeing whether a company is currently undervalued or overvalued. Foundry isnt meant for the general public to see or use. Its highly technical and most people who look at it might aswell be staring into space. Gotham is the real money maker and thats just rolling out. Most people cant think 2, 5, 10 years ahead. In 5 years when half of the S&P 500 is using Gotham you will see why PLTR will be a trillion dollar market cap company."
2021-05-11 17:36:26,wallstreetbets,"You do what for a living? Wall Street does exactly that, they look to understand the company and their products. You're an idiot if you think they don't. 

The fact you've got Foundry and Gotham mixed up just shows how little you know about the company. If ""normal"" people can't use foundry, then it has completely failed its mission."

2021-05-11 17:54:23,wallstreetbets,"Bro thx for your courage showing this, i can relate the pain is deep. I am also down 350k I been averaging down since 27 and it keeps going lower. I am planing to hold at least 3-5 but I can‚Äôt lie, i have lost faith in the market."

2021-05-11 19:34:52,wallstreetbets,Is that really smarter?  There's no guarantee that you'll put your money into something that will make money.  It's part of the reason why over 80% of people lose money in the market.
2021-05-11 13:28:58,wallstreetbets,I can respect that.
2021-05-11 14:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Dude, where's my car?"
2021-05-11 19:21:58,wallstreetbets,It helps to hear I'm not struggling alone as well. :D Although I wish it was better for you! I'm actually looking at using RKT for mortgages now too. lol.

2021-05-11 13:19:04,wallstreetbets,How much were you making off covered calls a week?
2021-05-11 19:46:58,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt want to shit ok RKT any more than the market already has but the exodus and shorts are hammering the stock. The earning call conveyed lower price further driving it down. The majority of the smart money already left. 

To your point. It‚Äôs true to a degree, all contingent on the investment strategy. Sticking with a poor performing company is no different than buying another poor performing company. We are supposed to be learning from past experiences. But we are all retarded right?"

2021-05-11 14:36:28,wallstreetbets,I love RKT but may I ask why so much üòÇ like what made you so confident in buying so much?
2021-05-11 13:20:27,wallstreetbets," None actually. Although now that VIX is spiking, might be worthwhile"
2021-05-11 13:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Wish I WAS long on them at this point, lol"
2021-05-11 14:37:38,wallstreetbets,No worries! :D
2021-05-11 17:59:39,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs the correlation between the VIX spiking and CC‚Äôs ? Curious, still new in generating income via options."
2021-05-11 18:17:21,wallstreetbets,"Implied volatility rises - therefore premiums rise. 

I‚Äôm if not mistaken..."
2021-05-11 19:14:16,wallstreetbets,"Yep, this. Options sellers price options based on market IV which most of the time correlates to \`$VIX\`, which is a measure of market volatility. So it's better to sell when IV is high and buy when IV is low."
2021-05-11 19:20:42,wallstreetbets,Thanks guys!! The more I know :)

2021-05-11 15:20:06,wallstreetbets,But he did not specify that he is not a financial analyst... A financial advisor should not recommend specific stocks typically but rather strategies. An analyst would advise on a specific stock... So I am left with the conclusion that the poster is a financial analyst and therefore I am compelled to follow his advice as to this stock and if he is wrong I will have to file at minimum a criminal complaint.
2021-05-11 15:01:28,wallstreetbets,Maverick also crashed and killed Goose

2021-05-11 12:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Worth mentioning, though, that in 2019 the stock was trading at maybe $13-$15 and on the way down. However, in the past half-year, they've diluted shares by \~75%. So, is he saying this is optimistically a $4 stock, 2 years from now?

 The part I don't trust is his long term plans. If gme goes to hell they have made some incredible plays towards the future so I think holding gme is a good short and long term play at this point. Amc doesn't seem that way to me. Maybe I need to read more dd's.

2021-05-11 16:55:59,wallstreetbets,He mentioned that he did buy shares on the open market himself. He also mentioned that he is required to hold a certain amount of shares that represent a percentage of his salary. He greatly exceeds the requirement.

I was saying I wouldn‚Äôt buy the first buyout unless he agreed not to give himself a bonus from it... and then he does it twice in 1 year before people finally got smart and he agreed to take it off the annual voters meeting.

2021-05-11 15:06:03,wallstreetbets,"Understand something. The value of a company no longer has anything to do with market cap. It has everything to do with the sentiment of the shareholders at this point. If you actually want to do the Mind exercise, taking the number of shares timesing it by the current stock price. That number you can come up with. Well almost always be way more. Then whatever company in question is actually worth. You can take just about, any company today. And perform this exercise. If you would have sell Everlast Fang that company had. The money you would receive would never come anywhere near close to the value of the total shares of stocks. Therefore stock prices are currently based on investors sentiment."
2021-05-11 15:00:48,wallstreetbets,They also diluted shares. It is actually trading at well over a 500% increase in market cap. [https://imgur.com/gallery/cwK5p9W](https://imgur.com/gallery/cwK5p9W)
2021-05-11 14:56:55,wallstreetbets,It is currently way undervalued. AMC has something most have no clue about. It has a reoccurring subscription plan. It is called the A-list.

We need to keep it apart imo. Not that it wouldn't be good to get a merger done, just wanted to point out the benefit of staying apart. 

Merger would benefit individuals invested. Keeping them apart would benefit the economy and America as a whole.

2021-05-11 15:07:13,wallstreetbets,"What can I answer for you u/fsdx13

&#x200B;

I've been following for 6 months and know as much as I will tel you.

Debt shouldn't worry you. 2/3rds of debt are on hand. Meaning, 1.5 billion is owed but has 1 billion in cash.

Dilution... Had 70 million left from 2013... Half (1/3rd) have been issued (17 million) and in the 6 days we saw the stock drop .90 cents about and all the shares were bought up. Id assume another dilution of remaining once it hits 14-15. cash is the name of the game.

AMC is making moves to cut debt and expand. The bought out osedion (Something like that) or another movie company.

&#x200B;

Pandemic is opening back up and people are buying AMC gift cards and seeing movies like no other because of what GME/AMC started... Remember... The two MOST shorted stocks were...

GM3

and

A /\\/\\ C

GM3 was 140% when this started

A /\\/\\ C was 85% when it started.

&#x200B;

These two stocks were the start of this whole crazy bull/Ape market.

GME sky rocketed and they screwed a lot of people over putting life savings into it. This is where AMC comes into play. People missed out on GME and brokers screwed others. Everyone who couldn't afford GME or didn't trust it to stay this high put money into AMC and held it like it was a New Born baby.

AMC Apes have done the same DD, same Memes, and had the same manipulation/issue. AMC and GME were shorted by the same companies. Who.. Idk. Prob Citadel and Melvin.

&#x200B;

So... I can tell you from my history in AMC that we are going to roll this stock harder than a rock.

I don't want to keep typing. So ask me anything. What are your concerns. Ill see if I can answer them for you and provide proof and sources if it helps.

Every Ape matters. Meaning, you matter. Im not asking you to sell your GME shares to buy AMC. I am asking for you to spread the word about AMC. If I can convince you, maybe you will convince another ape.

I am so confident in this... Just not confident in the SEC/Market/ What comes next because they(Gov. Hedges, billionaires.. etc... WANT TO KEEP US POOR). I can guarantee a squeeze...YES (No guarantees and not a financial guy, just my opinion) How high this will go depends on a lot of factors.

Based on the SEC preparing for a new market maker... Id say, its going pretty high.

&#x200B;

Just buy some calls! At or around 10-20 dollars. Maybe a lower cost and when it pops, exercise the contract for 100 shares and sell that shit at peak!

&#x200B;

LETS GOOOO!!!! WE. NEED. YOU."
2021-05-11 15:48:00,wallstreetbets,I guess you're not familiar with AMC's a list. Subscription service. That for $24 a month. You you are allowed to see three movies a week. Any movie from a standard all the way up to an IMAX 3D. To do the simple math. You can watch 12 Movies a month for $24 at the theater. A list also give you discount on concessions. A list also has a separate line for concessions. Where your line is served before anyone else. If your theater offers reserved seating then you get to pick your seat in advance. You can show up whenever you want and have your guaranteed seat. If that's not DFV i don't know what it is
2021-05-11 13:29:17,wallstreetbets,Can I ask why you like the stock? Is it the actual value of the company or just the theaters?
2021-05-11 12:22:27,wallstreetbets,"I like this stock, squeezed or no squeeze. Are you familiar with AMC's A list. You can watch 3 movies a week. At any AMC Theatres. Any movie format from standard all the way up to IMAX 3D. So to recap that would be 12 Movies a month if you used up all three per week. Plus you get discounts on concessions. And you have a special concessions line ,so you don't wait with everyone else. Reserved seating is also benefit in most theaters. So you can show up anytime and have the seat you want. All of that for only $24 a month. If that's not a DFV I don't know what it is."
2021-05-11 13:14:15,wallstreetbets,They sold a few million shares last week. They also removed the 500 million shares (mentioned in that old video) off the table.

Going to just one high-end premium movie just about covers the a list for the month. Yet keep in mind you can see up to 12 movies in a month. This is why I like the stock long-term. The company has a subscription model. Which is actually beneficial to the subscriber.
2021-05-11 19:28:17,wallstreetbets,Because the AMC ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù is not organic anymore. The January ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù play was based from the information that it was 80 million shares...that has now grown to 465 million today.

2021-05-11 16:05:10,wallstreetbets,"LOLOL! Let me stop your nonsense right there. They issued 300+ million shares to stave off bankruptcy. It makes no difference that they were purchased - that's a completely separate issue. The fact remains that their shares have been diluted 75%. For not-so-bright people like you, that means they need to turn 4X the profit to return to the ""value"" the stock had in 2019 at $6-7 per share. The CEO said himself that they're hoping to achieve that level in 2022. So, next year, you MIGHT see 1/4th the EPS it had back when it was $6-7. LOLOLOL!!!!  


And they CAN'T pay their debt, genius. ALL THAT CASH you think they have is already spent -- it's for keeping the lights on while they continue to operate at a massive loss, without taking on FURTHER debt on their way to bankruptcy. How do you not understand this? They didn't massively dilute shares with new issues just for fun. They did it just to stay afloat for another year.  


You also don't understand covered puts at all, apparently, and I have neither the time nor the crayons to explain it to you. You truly belong here."
2021-05-11 13:35:19,wallstreetbets,"LOLOL!!! Sure thing, cultist. I'm not employed by anyone and don't know anyone who is. I have 300 covered puts on AMC at $9 for next Friday. If they happen to be executed, I'll sell 300 covered calls at $9 for the following week or two. Rinse and repeat.  


Sorry I hurt your fragile feelings by not confirming your bias, but now how bout you point out anything I have said that isn't correct? I'll save you the trouble. You can't, because it's true (not that you'd look it up anyway, because ""Reeee! Short Squeeze!"" is all you know about the stock and company.). Maybe you'll get lucky and a short squeeze will bail out your bags one day and maybe not. A SS would actually benefit me, as would any substantial increase in price.

2021-05-11 17:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, market cap is the public valuation of the company. Whether that company has a higher private valuation is besides the point. Also, headwind for current valuation is dilution of shares... even if people are willing to buy, they will have to buy at a much faster clip just to maintain share price. Amc just authorised Goldman to sell another 43million shares on the market.. of those shares they have sold 15 million. Any time share price gets over 10 dollars, Goldman will come in and sell a large chunk of shares... making it incredibly difficult for retail investors to maintain share price."
2021-05-11 17:49:34,wallstreetbets,"Did you just create an account to reply to this comment?

The guy says all companies are worth less than their market cap. That's completely wrong, there are loads out there that if you liquidate their assets are worth more than their market cap, which is my point. Market cap isn't even a valuation metric, it's one of the only things when you discuss a stock that isn't a valuation metric. It's just the value of the company on the stock market (without taking into account net debt).

Book value and p/b is just as relevant as it has always been to value a company. It's a factor that can help you make a decision along with loads of other metrics."

2021-05-11 15:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Market capitalization, commonly called market cap, is the market value of a publicly traded company's outstanding shares. Market capitalization is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding.¬†"
2021-05-11 17:24:13,wallstreetbets,You seem to be overlooking a key component. What the revenue derived from the sells is going to.
2021-05-11 18:08:12,wallstreetbets,"And sometimes enterprise value depending on industry and levels of debt. Book value is still relevant, it‚Äôs just much less relevant than it used to be. Book value used to be the gold standard to assess a companies valuation against ‚Äòwhat the market was valuing the company as‚Äô. It‚Äôs becoming less relevant over the last 50 years. It‚Äôs probably better to assess a companies Earnings Power Value against Enterprise Value. Unless of course the company is struggling and destroying shareholder value then I agree price to book is better in liquidation circumstances."
2021-05-11 18:00:50,wallstreetbets,Haha no I‚Äôve had the account for awhile just often look at people‚Äôs comments. Market cap is definitely a value metric. Market cap against all sorts of fundamentals. Just like price to book the price in this calculation is essentially referring to the market cap divided by # of shares. Yes enterprise value is used if you‚Äôre adding net debt onto market cap... but without a doubt market cap is a valuation metric. What is the metric that you compare all fundamental valuation techniques against? I‚Äôll help you if you don‚Äôt know the answer... it‚Äôs market cap:)

2021-05-11 14:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Well, AMC isn't a very good long-term investment. There's nothing in their financials or overall strategy that will actually produce a significant amount of growth -- especially when you consider they have 4x the number of shares compared to what they had \~6 months ago. Not to mention the fact that producers are all-in on mostly-concurrent release of movies to streaming platforms as well, which will remain a drag on their profits forever. For people that are holding, it's basically a squeeze or bust sort of play. AMC's outlook is simply hoping to return to pre-pandemic-level revenue. They certainly aren't going to double/triple their screens, revenue, or anything of the sort.

&#x200B;

GME, on the other hand, is a very different story. The bet there is whether or not RC can actually transform the company into the kind of ecommerce and esports giant that he has in mind. They won't be the same company a year or two from now. Maybe it'll pan out, and maybe it won't, but the potential for multi-fold growth exists. They're also in excellent financial shape to support the effort."
2021-05-11 15:54:22,wallstreetbets,It's just the number share share price is what the investor is determined. I get the feeling you think market cap means there's some limit.

2021-05-11 16:03:08,wallstreetbets,"No, I don‚Äôt think market cap means there‚Äôs some limit. Jesus dude. It‚Äôs not just the number of shares. Please shut the fuck up, you sound more and more stupid by the minute."
2021-05-11 15:07:55,wallstreetbets,"They spent a year doing nothing while streaming services inked all the deals for new releases. Why would people pay $20 a month to see movies they're already paying for through their streaming services? Few will. It might help them get back to profitability, but the growth boat has already sailed. They lost their exclusive rights for new releases and are never getting them back. That's how they put butts in seats. Now it's gone.   


Anyway, I have other things I'd rather do. Good luck with your shares."
2021-05-11 16:06:32,wallstreetbets,"It's the number of shares times the current price of the share.. What part of you missing. About the current price, being determined by the sentiment of the investors."
2021-05-11 15:14:12,wallstreetbets,Do you really believe that people only went to movies. Because they wouldn't be able to see it somewhere else. As if bootleg copies were not available immediately for streaming before. People go to the movie theater because it is a ritual. Not any different than going out to eat dinner. People don't go out to restaurants because they do not have the ability to cook at home. They go because they prefer the ambience and the change of scenery. A big Blockbuster movie. Does not hit the same on an 80 inch screen at home. As it does on an 80-foot screen in a theater.
2021-05-11 16:09:54,wallstreetbets,Yes. It‚Äôs the number of shares times current price per share. Not just the number of shares. Re read what you‚Äôve written before this.
2021-05-11 16:31:09,wallstreetbets,"People will still go to movies, for the exact reasons you mentioned. However, Blockbuster movies aren't going to be anywhere near the cash cows that they used to be. Theaters used to have exclusive rights to new release for 90 days, I believe. That revenue stream is permanently crippled. They're going to have to sell popcorn for $50 a bucket instead."
2021-05-11 16:38:45,wallstreetbets,"Did I inform you of the A-list. It is AMC subscription service. For $24 a month. You can watch free movies a week at the theater. Any movie from a standard all the way up to an IMAX 3D. If you do the math. You can watch 12 Movies a month for $24. The A-list also gives you concession discounts. There is a separate line that is prioritized 4 a list members. You get served concessions before anyone else , if you are a member. If your theater offers reserved seating. Then you will also have your seat reserved in advance ,so you can show up whenever you want ,and have a guaranteed seat. Tell me that is not a DFV."
2021-05-11 17:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Remains to be seen whether that is worthwhile or not for the company. They're essentially sacrificing ticket revenue in the hopes of making it up with concessions. While they do generate a majority of their profit off of concessions, they count on ticket sales to pay for the movies they rent. So, if they aren't making up more than the $10-$20 they're losing on the ticket in popcorn and candy per person, they aren't coming-out ahead.  


I don't know too many people that would say, ""Hey, I don't have to pay for a ticket, so I'll buy two buckets of popcorn instead of my normal one."" You'll just have to wait and see whether this ends up being profitable or not. It could go either way. I think it'll be mildly profitable, but not game-changing. Sacrificing the entire ticket price for the 2nd or 3rd movie and beyond is pretty substantial."
2021-05-11 17:21:40,wallstreetbets,The profitability comes from if we guaranteed $24 a month for them per person. You seem to forget they also collect money from the advertisements that run before the movie. Just like social media platforms. The more guaranteed subscribers they have. The more they derive from advertisement Revenue.

Several government officials have come out and said that U.S. military has had several encounters with physics-defying vehicles. Based off this evidence, defense stocks have a direct relationship with UFO disclosure. I recommend purchasing U.S. defense stocks due to recent UFO activity and human emotions. **PLEASE READ, THIS POST IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME**

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first time posting on this subreddit. I hope this post can be welcomed with open arms like many other posts on this platform. This is a rather long post but it is definitely the most important one for not only this subreddit but Earth as a whole. I beg of you to take this post as serious as possible as I lay out claims that might not be considered ""realistic"" by some of you. Again, this is one of the most important issues of our time and I thought that it would be a great way to share this information with you guys since the spread of information on this platform is unmatched.

The issue that I am referring to above is the growing contact/sightings of possibly extraterrestrial or extra-dimensional beings and crafts on Earth. This is an issue that everyone in the world should be familiar with and allocate their greatest interest in order to find the truth behind this. This post is very unusual compared to the others on this subreddit as most posts are stock market related. However, I promise that I will show the intersectionality between this global issue and finance throughout this post.

I first began to become interested in this issue in December of 2020 while quarantined in South East Michigan when the former Israeli space security chief, Haim Eshed, announced to the Jerusalem Post that aliens are indeed real. He later stated in the interview with the reputable news source that extraterrestrials from distant planets are engaged in a ""Galactic Federation"" where important policies regarding issues between civilizations are made. Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars. The former space security chief states that the main purpose of the research is to understand ""the fabric of the universe"". Around this time, America's former president, Donald Trump, established the seventh branch of their military, the Space Force. Haim insists that Trump was briefed and is fully aware of this situation. He even says that Trump was ""on the verge"" of disclosing their existence, however, he was stopped by the Galactic Federation as they didn't want to cause ""mass hysteria"" due to the many conflicts we are facing today such as political divide, COVID-19, and degrading international relationships.

Keep in mind that Haim Eshed is the one of the most credible, reliable, high-ranking, and intelligent individuals in regards to this issue. This would be comparable to if the head of NASA announced that intelligent life from other planets is a reality and that they are in communication with our highest-ranking officials. It is also important to mention that Israel's space agency is one of the best as they are one of only seven countries on the planet that build and launch their own satellites into orbit. Not only that, but Israel and the United States have a very good relationship regarding not only trade but military operations as well. This means that information is without a doubt transferred between the countries' military in regards to warfare and space. You may be asking why Haim Eshed is going public with this reality-shattering information nine years after his retirement in 2011. He claims that a lot has changed in the scientific community and that ""if I had come up with what I‚Äôm saying today five years ago, I would have been hospitalized"". In the end, he stated that he is one of the most respected individuals in the academia setting and that he has ""nothing to lose. I‚Äôve received my degrees and awards"". Again, this is a man who served for 30 years as head of Israel's space program and is a three-time recipient of the Israel Security Award.

Here is the original Jerusalem Post article \*PLEASE READ\*: [Jerusalem Post Article](https://www.jpost.com/omg/former-israeli-space-security-chief-says-aliens-exist-humanity-not-ready-651405)

In December of 2017, the New York Times published an article entitled, *Glowing Auras and ‚ÄòBlack Money‚Äô: The Pentagon‚Äôs Mysterious U.F.O. Program.* This article was one of the first publications to give an in-depth investigation of the current state of U.S. intelligence about UFO's (unidentified flying objects) or UAP's (unidentified aerial phenomenons) as they are known today by the U.S. Government. In the NYT report, it provides evidence to prove the U.S. Government's involvement in research programs investigating UAP sightings. According to Defense Department officials, included in the $600 billion annual defense budget was a virtually impossible to find $22 million allocation of money to an unknown Pentagon program called the Advance Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). The program's main responsibility was to examine proof of UAP's provided by various military sources and to determine whether or not it posed a threat to our country. The program was ran by a former military intelligence official named Luis Elizondo on the fifth floor of the Pentagon's C ring. The Defense Department has never acknowledged the existence of this program before and when asked about it recently they said that they shut it down in 2012. However, when the program's backers were asked about it, they confirmed that the Defense Department stopped funding back in 2012 but the program still continued to investigate several more episodes provided by service members until October of 2017 when Luis Elizondo resigned from the Pentagon to protest excessive government secrecy about this issue.

[New York Times Article \*PLEASE READ\*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html)

One of the most fascinating things about this program was the examining of videos showing encounters between these unknown objects and U.S. military aircrafts. Three videos on this subject were published by the New York Times entitled ""FLIR1"", ""GIMBAL"", and ""GOFAST"". The videos were taken by Navy fighter jets belonging to the USS Nimitz and USS Roosevelt. All three of these videos show cockpit display data, infrared imagery, and even audio communications between the pursuing pilots. The UAP's displayed in these videos showed unprecedented and ""impossible"" aerial maneuvers that is unmatched by any technology present on Earth at this time. One of the fighter pilots, Commander David Fravor, who was part of the F/A-18F team that attempted to intercept the UAPs in 2004, had only this to say to the *New York Times:* ‚ÄúI have no idea what I saw...It had no plumes, wings or rotors and outran our F-18s.‚Äù Another fighter pilot witness named Chad Underwood described the movement of the craft as ""not behaving by the normal laws of physics"". Furthermore, he described the UAP to not be ""behaving in a manner that‚Äôs predictable or is normal by how flying objects physically move"". In addition to this bizarreness, all the pilots involved stated that the crafts didn't produce a heat signature, fumes, or even a propulsion system. Overall, these crafts can only be labeled as otherworldly as they clearly aren't capable to be developed by our current standards of science and innovation according to these pilots and other significant figures in the scientific community.

[""GIMBAL"" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TumprpOwHY)

[""GOFAST"" Video Evidence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUrTsrhVce4)

Although these videos showed compelling evidence of extraterrestrial existence, it still was not confirmed by any government officials to be raw and genuine footage. Some of the videos actually surfaced on the Internet as early as 2007, as they were being passed around in various website forums. It wasn't until September of 2019, when a spokeswoman of the Pentagon confirmed that the released videos were in fact 100% real and recorded by Navy aviators. She also added that this was ""part of a larger issue of an increased number of training range incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena in recent years."" This was one of the first incidences of the U.S. Government confirming that unknown and physics-defying air crafts have entered U.S. airspace.

[Confirmation of Video Authenticity by Pentagon Representative](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ufo-video-authenticity-pentagon/)

More recently, in April of 2021, a new video published by [Mystery Wire](https://www.mysterywire.com/) showed yet another case of an unidentified aerial phenomenon. The video took storm on the web and showcased a swarm of pyramid shaped aircrafts hovering over a U.S. Navy destroyer in night vision. The UAP's flashed with bright lights and performed physics-defying maneuvers. Additionally, what stood out about this incident was that the crafts were ""transmedium"" vehicles, meaning that they could transition from air to water seamlessly. Also, three photos supposedly taken by Navy fighter jet pilots displayed three different shaped UAP's. The objects the Navy Personnel captured on his iPhone included a ""sphere"", an ""acorn"", and a ""metallic blimp"". Although the video clip and photos originally didn't seem to standout from the other UFO videos found on the Internet, it wasn't long for a spokeswoman from the Pentagon to confirm the authenticity of the video and photos. Susan Gough, the spokesperson for the Pentagon said that, ‚ÄúI can confirm that the referenced photos and videos were taken by Navy personnel. The UAPTF has included these incidents in their ongoing examinations.‚Äù As you can see, this is an ongoing issue that most likely happens very frequently. It wasn't until now that the people of America can really see what secrets the U.S. Government is hiding from its citizens.

For anyone that doesn't know, a rider is when an additional provision is added to a bill while having little to do with the main subject matter of it. In this case, the rider mandated that the director of national intelligence works with the secretary of defense on a report to detail everything the U.S. Government knowns about UAP's. The small provision in the 5,500+ page bill also warranted that the report be released within 180 days of the bill being signed. Donald Trump signed the bill on December 27th, 2020 so that means that UAP disclosure should be released in early June. Some speculate that this report will contain all the secrets the U.S. Government has regarding unidentified aerial phenomenons while other say that they will only release the minimum amount of information in order to be labeled as a ""UFO report"". What do you think? I'd love to hear your opinion!

[UFO Disclosure Article](https://nypost.com/2020/12/29/covid-19-bill-started-a-180-day-countdown-for-ufo-disclosures/)

While this is potentially one of the greatest ongoing issues in human history, I'd like to take a minute to fulfill my promise of connecting this global issue to the stock market. All the evidence I provided were confirmed by some of the highest-ranking individuals on this planet. This means that there is a high probability of similar events occurring in the near future. These events could be increased UFO sightings, more government confirmations of UAP encounters, or even extraterrestrial contact. Overall, what is absolutely certain if any of these events take place, is the growing awareness of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings by the general public. Based off human emotion, people will not take this news lightly. I truly believe that many humans will panic after hearing the startling news of unknown crafts traveling over their countries airspace without their country's military able to do anything about. People will instinctively go into a defensive state meaning that they will purchase more weapons like guns, knives, and ammunition. Some people will most likely even commit suicide due to the feeling of insignificance and defenselessness by this devastating news. Additionally, there will be a massive pushback against the U.S. Government because of this unprecedented and excessive government secrecy regarding this issue. Most likely the government will stay intact and billions of dollars will be put into the military as it is the only structured organization that can defend against this off-world threat. However, this will be the start to a new concept of what us humans call life.

What I stated above sounds absolutely horrific, however, our species need to recognize the fact that we may not be alone in this universe. New information we find on this issue will happen inevitably, it is more of a question of when. Investing in military defense stocks like Lockheed Martin ($LMT), Raytheon ($RTX), and Boeing ($BA) will be a great long term investment because I hypothesize that this situation is caused by only three scenarios. The first scenario is that there are extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings navigating the UAP's shown in the evidence above. The second scenario is that one of our country's nemesis like China or Russia has technologically leaped frogged us and created aircrafts that has defied our current understandings of physics. The final scenario is that the U.S. military has developed these crafts and in an attempt to keep our rivals from figuring out this information, they made a massive effort to hide it from the general public. All three of these scenarios ultimately conclude with the U.S. military's capabilities being expanded along with a giant budget increase. Higher budget means more money for big military companies like the ones stated above to develop cutting edge technology for the government. Again, whether this happens in June when UFO disclosure is released or 10 years from now when aliens make contact, this is an asymmetric trade meaning that the potential gains of buying defense stocks FAR exceed the potential losses.

Now if you can take one thing from this post, it is that information is ESSENTIAL. What the U.S. Government has held from its people, is the greatest intelligence failure in United States history. This global issue affects us all significantly and as people of Earth, we deserve to have this information told to us in full.

It makes no sense that an announcement to the world would coincide with a huge uplift in defence spending, (we saw a decrease after the Cold War but still knew about UAP) - if anything, international markets would be rocked and money would move into Gold/Silver which are the typical Safe Havens in times of ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô."

Fact: The military downplays this because the objects have never done anything overtly hostile, and there's nothing we can really do about them. And the military would rather focus on things they can control like stomping small countries, or flexing on China, Iran, and North Korea.

Fact: Certain members of congress (Harry Reid, Daniel Inouye) have successfully pressured the military to reveal what they do know (which isn't very much, but is pretty fucking fascinating), and that's why we're starting to see authentic videos like Gimbal, Go Fast, and Tic Tac.

If we just take the gov released videos, fravors interviews, AATIP's existence and elizondo, politicians like rubio speaking about it to the point it got included in the bill , I would think that is enough to get the message across without it being too... alienating.  Also note this has gathered enough attention that there was an article in bloomberg along the same lines.

2021-05-11 12:56:54,wallstreetbets,"This is wild. I already feel like most of these sightings have been glossed over. 

The one thing that I still can't get on board with is this part though... 

>Eshed exclaimed that the United States is in talks with the Galactic Federation and even have American representatives participating in meetings and research with these extraterrestrials in an underground base on Mars. 

seems a bit too far fetched and the one item that there isn't any kind of evidence about except for one person's claims.

EDIT - Also, OP, your post history is weird. Are you a 14 year old app developer who is really into the stock market and selling puts and playing Smash Brothers? And did you only recently get into UFOs? Why is this so important to you?"

2021-05-11 13:36:10,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, thanks. Betting on the US military though as protection against the Galactic Federation (capitalized out of respect, for the future Galactic Federation reddit archive) looks kind of retarded. It's like betting on an ant against USS Gerald R. Ford warship. Lets assume for the sake of an argument that aliens exist and reports about UFO defying laws of physics are true. If they have technology so much more advanced that ours, it would be futile to resist and military would be obsolete. The best way to react would be to peacefully surrender to one true overlord of the Galactic Federation and bring them our rulers to sacrifice as a peace sign (also instagram influencers, no one likes them anyway).

I do agree to an extent on what you said and recently the government has been using the term ‚Äúnational security threat‚Äù when discussing the phenomenon. I don‚Äôt think the people are going to freak out. The government might though. Pretty sure our HUGE leaps in tech have come from reversed engineered tech in the private sector.

That said, the openness with which the government is discussing the videos is intriguing.

As for Haim Eshed, you have to consider Occam‚Äôs Razor. Mental illness, senility (he‚Äôs 88) and/or lying is common, and must be considered much more likely than a ‚ÄúGalactic Council‚Äù unless he can provide *any* proof of his claims."

2021-05-11 17:02:01,wallstreetbets,"I been waiting for this post. I just ran down everything you said to a friend who gave me a ride to the airport.

As a matter of fact, the Director of Lockheed Martin's advanced aerospace research development department, 'Skunkworks' publicly retired to join Luiz Elizondo with the 'To the Stars Academy' started by Tom DeLong, (yes from Blink 182) with the assistance of high profile US Generals. They are actually doing a private equity offering currently.

Mind blowing. Your right that there are 3 outcomes to the release of the report, either its the: a. US will finally disclose the technology they have, b. its a foreign earthly adversary, or the c. 'Galactic Federation' i.e. extraterrestrials. 

Even if all three are true the US will not admit B or C because it would cause panic and make us look weak. The only acceptable outcome, for the US, is to say it is ours, which it probably is. All three are probably true.

I don't think they will go with the 'I don't know' position because that makes us look weak and powerless as in options B and C above.

Going long on Lockheed could be a good move.

Not a financial advisor, just a Galactic Federation ambassador."

2021-05-11 17:44:26,wallstreetbets,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/n9f812/recent\_academic\_paper\_from\_korean\_university/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/n9f812/recent_academic_paper_from_korean_university/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The UAP/UFO are extremely old and can be found even in religions.

During the first world war these objects were simply considered as potential danger for the aviators and nobody paid attention to them or talked about them because of fear.

During the second world war it was totally commonplace for all the countries that encountered these luminous balls that followed the pilots very frequently, and they called them ""foo fighters"". Each camp thought that they were either enemy experimental devices or their own experimental devices that were kept secret. So the Nazis made prototypes based on their observations because they were extremely open-minded in science and had a huge budget and almost no restrictions.

During the cold war there again everyone was afraid that it was the devices of the enemy, documents at the time of the fall of the USSR have invalidated this hypothesis.

Today in the world the armies often meet these UAP/UFO and are more and more alarmed, hence the call for the participation of civilians launched by the USA. They have also created a task force which has already produced many clear images, some of which have been [leaked](https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/4137224153001/6dc0166c-8064-47a3-8416-54c04f56e34c/f00a7ca8-a60e-4bce-8bb2-9e4ceb31ebc3/1280x720/match/image.jpg).

Governments have always taken this seriously since the cold war and now that we have clear images and descriptions everyone is afraid.

I also think that massive investments in defense will be made even if it is obviously futile considering the technological difference."

2021-05-11 17:59:59,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know if your post is satire or not, but I will explain why there aren‚Äôt and never have been intelligent extraterrestrials visiting Earth. It is basically impossible for any alien civilization to find Earth, let alone travel to it, due to the speed of light limitations and vast distances between star systems. The energy required to accelerate anything of mass to the speed of light is infinite, and it would take years traveling at light speed just to reach the nearest star to our solar system. Additionally, there is a long chain of events that needed to occur, with perfect and stable conditions for tens of millions of years, for life to form and for human civilization to get the point that we are at. That we even exist at all is highly unlikely, and the same can be applied to other potential alien civilizations. 

Personally, I think any ‚ÄúUFOs‚Äù documented by the military could possibly be the experimental aircraft and/or stealth technology of foreign governments. Or they could just be light artifacts on the recording equipment."

2021-05-11 19:05:03,wallstreetbets,"So.. 

As a kid I saw a red sphere in the clouds.  Me and my friend were looking through his new telescope on a cloudy day.  We were young and thought it was fun. We spotted a red sphere in the clouds. My friend thought it was Mars, lol.  I told him it couldn't be Mars because it was in the clouds. We looked at it for awhile before we lost interest and tried to start catching bees in 7-11 nacho containers.

A couple weeks later, that same red sphere was hoovering above my neighbors house. Probably like 30' above his house, just spinning and stationary. My same friend was with me. We were scared to shit. Didn't know what to do. He suggested running home to his mom. I told him ""don't do it!"". We had no idea what was going on. Well after a slight pause, he took off running down the street to his house. I stayed watching the red spinning sphere. After about a minute, it went straight up into the sky. 

I've been a believer in this ever since. Except I don't think it's aliens from another planet. I personally believe they are fallen angels or demons. Who the fuck knows anyways... But the bible describes spinning wheels with eyes and what not.  

Spooky either way."

2021-05-11 16:10:09,wallstreetbets,"My personal favorite UAP sighting is when I saw a glowing light slowly moving at low altitude, came within 1 mile of the house. Looked at it with binoculars only to see the brightest point of light one can see. It's like looking at the sun basically. With a defined edge about the size of a basketball and a Corona like effect around the defined edge as the light radiates outward in a 360‚Å∞ sphere. 
Also seen one stop over Vancouver area and accelerate so fast it looked like it traced a arc in the sky then stop on a dime over our town for about 15 seconds and again perform the same maneuver leaving north over the coast mountains.
Also one time on the squamish chief we saw 3 red lights in a triangle floating above the summit doing a French braid pattern, after a minute they rose in unison straight up till they blinked out from being so far away I couldn't see the light they were producing.
Also at a friend's house sky watching on a wierd stormy night. Would rain then the clouds break as the wind pushed the air mass north leaving patches of clear sky visible. A blue light flying in straight line above storm clouds stopped in a open patch and blasted straight up to space leaving a tracer like in the first observation.

I'm blessed to have had 4 friends, 2 of my sons and my wife see these events with me. As those of us who have had experiences like this know its not something that is easily comprehended by those who have not."

2021-05-11 16:14:32,wallstreetbets,"Three cheers for xenophobia masquerading as not financial advice!

If the UFOs are indeed alien, given what we've seen they're capable of, there's no reason to believe our defense industry will be of ANY use. Either the aliens won't be hostile, and feeding into defense industry hysteria will only cause more problems here on Earth, or the aliens will be hostile, and every piece of available historical evidence suggests our defense industry will be woefully inadequate to keep us from getting torn apart.

ALSO: if you've only been paying attention since 2020, you have a LOT of catching up to do. This is not at all the first time a high-ranking official has retired and publicly said that there are aliens being hidden behind the scenes. This situation has been developing for literally decades, at a snail's pace, so take it all with a grain of salt. There is no urgency; disclosure will happen when it happens. No need to pump defense stocks; if you care that much, buy GME and use your profits from the impending squeeze to build a bunker."

For a civilization to be so advanced in technology they managed to invent interstellar travel, they would‚Äôve had to exist way before us, thousands or millions of years ahead of us.

We might be able to trade with them for some tech or whatever plant they use to get high on their home planet.

2021-05-11 18:23:22,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think talk of aliens and their existence by the government is a ploy to direct more funding towards certain areas of government by said branch.  By bringing their department to the forefront of public opinion because they are keeping tabs on those pesky aliens. Once said department is in the spotlight, publicly denying more funding is harder to do. Much like how retired NASA employees go online and ‚Äúsuggest‚Äù they saw things in space, it just increases awareness of the department. It‚Äôs a sad truth that this has to be done for more funding as I absolutely love space and physics and everything NASA does. It is what it is I guess. 

So when you hear shit like this take it with a grain of salt but know that whatever department is claiming aliens is probably going to ask for more funding as well, so gamble accordingly."

I imagine that's the first thing governments would say, seeing as everyone would expect panic. Damn, I'm convinced by your argument."

2021-05-11 17:27:33,wallstreetbets,"I'd like to add to the fact that the military downplays UFOs with something I read in the New Yorker recently. It's very possible the US government tried to ridicule and drown out UFO sightings in the past because the amount of reports became overwhelming. There's a point where too many sightings and hoaxes start drowning out real sightings and it's likely the DoD were worried they won't be able to identify and respond to real threats (i.e. incursions from other countries like Soviet Russia) in a timely manner.

Now it's gotten to the point where even military personnel are afraid to report any sightings because they do not want to be ridiculed. So the DoD are worried that they have scared folks from reporting real sightings because they do not want to sound like lunatics. Seems like Navy and Air Force have recently changed their tunes and are encouraging personnel to report any sightings no matter how ridiculous they sound."
2021-05-11 15:07:56,wallstreetbets,"This is the correct response. Even in the off chance that there has been contact, there's no reason to believe it will be announced in the June disclosure. I expect some more sighting reports and hopefully some more videos."

""A limited hangout or partial hangout is, according to former special assistant to the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Victor Marchetti, ""spy jargon for a favorite and frequently used gimmick of the clandestine professionals. When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting‚Äîsometimes even volunteering‚Äîsome of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further."""""
2021-05-11 18:18:34,wallstreetbets,"Because the military acronym stands for unidentified flying object. Navy sees them all the time out at sea. Does it mean they are aliens? No. It means it's something in the air that doesn't have any official identity. That's a UFO. Not aliens. But if I were buying defense stocks, I'd buy Leidos all day long."
2021-05-11 18:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Yep. People have been calling me crazy and they‚Äôre prob right, but I‚Äôve been feeling a false flag US alien attack coming since Covid. First get most ppl to stay home w a virus...if that doesn‚Äôt work, alien attack. Meanwhile all the people who swear they‚Äôve had contact, including 1000s from Italy in early 1900s claim any outside beings warn against violence and are very peaceful.

I‚Äôm not totally dismissing it.. but there are folks who need a bump in their defense stock holdings  which is also a plausible answer.. especially with the percentage of Dems against defense spending .

I just think because of the risk of immediately pushing people away due to the topic, you want to make sure you don't come off as a true believer, and you want to deliver only the best information we have. A decorated fighter pilot said he saw a craft that is far beyond any known capabilities, backed up by (admittedly not the crystal clear picture we would have wanted) footage. 

High ranking officials to the levels of john ratcliffe have said US military are enountering UAP's on a consistent basis. Either this is something we need to be concerned about, or it's all a hoax for some unknown reason, which would be equally as interesting."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BNGO earnings tomorrow! üöÄüöÄ + My Expectations for Earnings. $BNGO has earnings tomorrow (Wednesday, May 12) and they should be great. They have an expected EPS of -0.05 and an expected revenue of 2.9 M. The revenue is insanely low considering they brought in 4 M last quarter.
This quarter should be even better because they have reached deals with different large labs, with the labs agreeing to buy $BNGO products. 

The EPS is a little more tricky, and I would imagine that they should match or beat the -0.05 expectations. They should have less expenses this quarter due to their Lineagan acquisition being fully integrated into the company. 

Either way, this is a great long term hold. Buying at this extremely low price before earnings should be a great place to buy, destroy the Shitadel shorts, and make some fucking money. üöÄüöÄ

TLDR; $BNGO make big money and you you should buy before earnings. Also Shitadel hates cancer patients so we want them to lose money."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Palantir's (PLTR) fundamentals just became even better ( As management said: ""We are a few steps away from becoming Skynet"")  

First of all let's take a look at PLTR's Q1 financial performance.

* Total revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $341 million
* US commercial revenue grew 72% year-over-year
* US government revenue grew 83% year-over-year
* Cash flow from operations of $117 million, up $404 million year-over-year, and representing a 34% margin
* Adjusted free cash flow of $151 million, up $441 million year-over-year, and representing a 44% margin
* GAAP net loss per share, diluted of $(0.07)
* Adjusted earnings per share, diluted of $0.04
* Cash and cash equivalents- 2.3 billion
* The company managed to pay almost all of its outstanding long-term debt

These numbers look amazing,especially when you take into account the fact that as the management stated numerous times on the earnings call, the company is just starting to expand and acquire new customers. Many people think of Palantir as this old, mature company that is still unprofitable and with limited growth opportunities. The thing is that despite being 17 years old, Palantir is just starting to get recognition on the world stage. They spent years just developing their software and investing heavily into R and D( over 2 billion dollars). Foundry was launched in 2018 and already is experiencing very high-levels of adoption despite the fact that it is a very complex and expensive software( It is way easier to grow your revenue and acquire new customers on a quarter basis when you are selling cheap and rather simple software solutions, not a complete OS for businesses) . PLTR is also just starting to build a proper sales team ( more than 50 new salespeople hired in this quarter alone) and partnering with organizations like IBM that can pinch their soft. to potential customers. The only slightly negative thing is the fact that currently their european commercial business growth is lacking behind the U.S one, but it is mostly because european economic recovery from the Covid pandemic is way slower. They still managed to close some deals and on the earnings call announcead a new client in Peugeot. Also the Covid crisis definitely helped PLTR in a way, but this does not mean that we should expect a slower growth rate in the future, but qute the opposite. For example, video game manufacturers experienced huge growth during the pandemic, because people stayed at home and had nothing better to do, but that would not be the case in the future. On the other hand, the pandemic helped companies to realise how important is for them to be able to make sense of their large databases of unfiltered information and make better-informed decisions to protect their operations from future geopolitical or macro-economic events.

Palantir is also well positioned to increase their revenue significantly in the government sector, due to the fact that their Gotham software proved its worth throughout the years and they just started their AI based Appolo software.( The Biden admin will apparently invest billions in AI technologies in the coming years).

I would not dive deep into other financial metrics, cuz this DD will become too large, but their margins are insane, cost of revenue grew way,way less than actual revenue, adjusted free cash flow is now positive( insane growth also, wink, wink to all analyst who use DCF) and PLTR somehow managed to expand its business operations while at the same time increasing their cash at hand and having almost non-existent debt.

Let's adress some retail investors worries now. WSB and r/ PLTR are constantly complaining about the high amounts of SBC the employees receive. They of course talked about this on the earnings call and the CFO said that the SBC will normalise in the future( very common for growth companies), but they will still give SBC to employess to align their personal interest with interest of the company ( also very common, especially for soft.companies) and to have more cash for expansion and future investments. Also, they said that Alex Karp is selling shares for tax purposes and he plans to continue being one of the biggest shareholders in the future.

A lot of people also complain about the fact that ""the management does not believe in the company, Karp told me to sell my shares"". The truth is that their believe is actually a bit cult-like. Management again stated that they are convinced of the fact that PLTR will become the most important software company in the future and they even literally said that they are a "" few steps away form becoming Skynet"". Furthermore, they invested in Lillium and Sarcos robotics, cuz they think that it is an incredible opportunity for an innovative startup to use Foundry from ground-zero and not waste years of its development having to deal with data silos and so on. When talking specifically about Sarcos, they said that their are vision for Foundry is to become a digital ""IronMan suit"" and Sarcos is trying to build a physical ""IronMan"" suit and they want to combine their efforts. Yes, that is right. Management thinks that their software is so good, that instead of just selling it to other companies, they can just invest in startups, give their soft for free and reap even bigger rewards in the future.

Another interesting thing we learned from the conference call is that PLTR accepts (the currency that rhymes with groin) as a form of payment. Investing in PLTR is giving you some indirect exposure to the ""forbidden word"" market.

In conclusion, I want to say that my personal opinion is that PLTR's fundamentals actually became better and as Jeff Bezos said the stock price does not always reflect the state of the company correctly. If you did not FOMO into PLTR expecting it to moon immediatly it is probably better to just wait and stick to your conviction that the company's financials will justify its generous valuation in the coming years."

The one slide that actually made me start laughing was the comparison to competitors‚Äô ‚Äúmarketecture‚Äù. Palantir can begin data collection for new clients within 3 days of onboarding. You read that right; 3 days. Competitors begin data collection 3-7 YEARS after initial consultation (onboarding).
Also, Palantir is giving away the Commercial Foundry system free to non-governmental accounts. Then the new customers begin paying for the service within 12 months. This isn‚Äôt stickiness, its more like Gorilla Glue.  Once these new customers start relying on PLTR they‚Äôll be hard pressed to ever leave."

Why is paying down long term debt when interest rates are low a good thing? Wouldn‚Äôt that money be better spent on acquisitions? Unless of course they‚Äôre trying to keep the price high so their VCs can get a good exit after they overpaid for it.

From an investor‚Äôs standpoint, a significant growth in this figure would point to growing customer traction, indicate that Palantir was successful in securing several new contracts/deals in Q1 and suggest that its revenue growth momentum may remain intact or accelerate going forward. Conversely, a muted or a declining remaining deal value figure would suggest that Palantir is losing its customer appeal, or that it faced operational setbacks which got in the way of securing new contracts/deals, and it would present the distinct possibility of an impending revenue growth slowdown.

The stock has already seen an approximate 140% 52 price jump, however, it is still greatly undervalued as these projects are nowhere near initiation. When we commence the majority of the national rail projects, Nucor may be a primary supplier of the raw materials used in construction.

Many players are using far OTM call options with long expiration dates (well above 135).

The company is a solid stock in its own right, so even if the ""prediction"" doesn't come true, it is unlikely to bottom out and leave me with useless stock... right?

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is the Market Right about $UWMC?  TL,DR at bottom.

**\*A Couple Disclosures\***

1. I'm kind of an idiot.
2. I only lose money when I invest.
3. $UWMC is the first company I went YOLO on... so that says everything you need to know about me as an investor.
4. This doesn't discuss their earnings. 

Here we we go:

**Cyclical vs. Growth:**

Cyclical companies are companies that are commonly referred to as ""value"" companies. This means they trade at relatively low P/E ratios in comparison to growth companies. Sound familiar? This is because their TAM (Total Addressable Market) is well defined and fluctuates with the economy or other macro conditions outside of the companies control. Cyclical companies will trade at low P/E's in boom conditions and higher P/E's in slow-down conditions. A natural outcome of investors understanding of what is causing the growth and decline in earnings.

$UWMC is in a cyclical industry. Mortgages are a mature market that is defined by the economy and interest rates. UWMC has no control of either. It just went through the best macro environment \*ever\* for refi's and 77% of its revenue is directly tied to this incredibly rate sensitive product. This is why its P/E is so low right now and may even trend lower. But is $UWMC a cyclical stock? I'll revisit later.

**Interest Rates:**

As mentioned above, $UWMC just went through the best revenue opportunity ever presented by the Fed. There is still a large refi market available but math tells us as rates stay low or raise it will dry up quickly. As interest rates rise that might shrink the mortgage market and offset any potential gains from the loans being worth more. Unless rates continue to trend lower, this will create a significant headwind to $UWMC's earnings.

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Short Interest:**

Fixation on short interest seems dumb to me. If you invested in $UWMC in hopes of catching a short squeeze... you should hop out now. If you have made it this far, perhaps you understand there are perfectly logical reasons for $UWMC to trade so cheaply in regards to P/E. I don't think a conspiracy theory about price manipulation is the \*most logical\* conclusion but.. maybe?

**So why invest in $UWMC?**

What's above is kind of my bearish information on $UWMC. These are the reasons I invested in the stock:

1. Founder(ish): Mat Ishbia is the #1 reason to invest in this company. Do you trust him? Do you consider him a talented and driven executive? Can he make good, long-term decisions to grow the company and the brand? To me, the answer is yes. There are a lot of threats facing $UWMC particularly and every company generally. Mat is a guy who has taken a company from 15 to 8,000. Do I expect that trend to stop here? No, I don't. There may be some bumps but I consider him a talented executive and a winner. He may have to pivot the company into other loan products like RKT has, but hopefully he will navigate that well. He just can't let the company stagnate. He has a track record to prove he'll grow responsibility and consistently.
2. Brokerage Channel: Is the brokerage channel the best way to get a mortgage? Can $UWMC grow the channel AND their strength in that channel? Can they educate consumers about the best way to get a mortgage? To me, the answer is yes. I had a Rocket Mortgage and hate them as a company. They call incessantly. Talk down to you when you don't take their advice. Rarely friendly and only helpful in origination. I tried to refi with them anyway just cause I thought it would be easy. Ended up going with an independent loan officer who educated me on the process and was a dream to work with. The loan officer saved me $4k and tailored a solution to me needs that Rocket COULDN't have done. Remember, the mortgage market is mature so the only way to get a higher P/E from the market is to take market share. This isn't a ""rising tide lifts all boats trade"". For $UWMC to grow market cap it has to shrink RKT, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo's mortgage market share.
3. Publicity: One reason that Mat went public was a marketing move. He gets to tell investors about how the brokerage channel is the fastest, cheapest and best way to get a mortgage. Does this hit revenue in the long term? Does this help $UWMC increase mortgage market share? To me, the answer is yes.
4. Growth: This is the summation of my first three points. $UWMC is trading as a cyclical stock, but perhaps it is a growth stock. I'm investing because I do believe it will overtake RKT as the #1 mortgage provider in America. As it shows in earnings over time that it is increasing market share the stock market will reward it with a higher P/E.
5. Dividend: I don't go out of my way to find a dividend stock, but $UWMC does some unique to me in that it can pay a high dividend on Class A shares while not messing up the balance sheet. It is currently at 5.8% which is plenty. I'm just hoping for a modest bump every year in dividend pay. No specials please.

**TL;DR**

$UWMC is trading as a cyclical company but may prove to the stock market to be a growth company. We are investing on the brokerage channel and Mat Ishbia to pull market share away from the other top mortgage originators. This is the only way to grow market cap as the TAM of refi and originations will almost assuredly decrease in the next few years.

2021-05-11 13:15:30,wallstreetbets,"The Gain on Sale Margins are what's going to drive the stock price in the short/medium term. Mortgage Originators are coming off a great year in 2020 (volume/originations for the industry went up to about $4 trillion and Gain on Sale Margins went up to record highs). Somewhere between $3.0 -$3.5 trillion is the expectation for volume in 2021, but GoS margins are the big unknown. They've dropped significantly already, but the question is what direction they are headed now.

I think Matt/UWMC can produce a ton of volume and gain market share, but the question is how much revenue will that volume generate? Producing $1 billion of mortgages at 200 bps of GoS Margin yields $20 million of revenue. Producing $1 billion of mortgages at 100 bps yields $10 million of revenue. The expense base probably isn't going to change that much relative to the volume and the Servicing segment should do better with higher interest rates, but the GoS Margin is the big unknown.

UWMC has the potential to be a big winner in the long-term, but there are some significant short-term headwinds. I don't have any position in UWMC btw."

2021-05-11 18:15:17,wallstreetbets,Sounded like it
2021-05-11 15:47:16,wallstreetbets,Why
2021-05-11 17:30:25,wallstreetbets,Yes that is what I‚Äôm referring to. The discrete form of your purchase I guess depends on your personal situation.
2021-05-11 10:15:51,wallstreetbets,I love your username
2021-05-11 15:13:15,wallstreetbets,AMC is actual dog shit
2021-05-11 16:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Because he is short selling the stock and doesn‚Äôt want to get screwed. 

There are some legit times when buybacks could be seen as a bad use of funds, or even morally wrong, but none of those would apply to this case in particular. The shares are being retired so it not even going to inflate the market cap. The employees are probably super happy as they receive a lot of pay in the form of stocks and options. It‚Äôs a deal for the company as it will save them on dividends and it‚Äôs far below the ipo price. Stock holders will be happy because it will increase the value of each share. The only people who would be unhappy are individuals or entities with short positions."
2021-05-11 17:56:17,wallstreetbets,"Repurchases were illegal in the US until I think 1982. Because they‚Äôre fucking market manipulations. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúinvesting back into the company‚Äù, it‚Äôs ‚Äúdistributing our profits to the richest 10% instead of our own employees.‚Äù Btw, did you know that 80% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% off people?

Interestingly, this change happened right when conservatives decided the ONLY PURPOSE of a business was to create value for the owners. Before that, they still somewhat considered social costs as well."
2021-05-11 10:19:03,wallstreetbets,Thanks bro. Wanted u/depressedfuckboy but it was taken. Had to settle for boi like a tool but it works haha
2021-05-11 16:18:06,wallstreetbets,"Hey now, I got in at 9 and change and promptly got off at 12..dumped it into mvis instead üòí"
2021-05-11 17:58:07,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd rather they just paid their employees more actual money. Buybacks are just a way to concentrate lore wealth into the top end of the pyramid. And I‚Äôm actually long on UWMC, although after this buyback I‚Äôm out of stocks. 

Turns out there are basically no moral companies."
2021-05-11 18:09:31,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs always funny to me when people say the ‚Äúwealthiest 10% of people‚Äù like it‚Äôs the same 10% thru the ages and not transitioning every decade. Look someone has to be the wealthiest 10%, even if it‚Äôs the one guy behind the dumpster with 9 of his buddies and he‚Äôs the only one with a damn hamburger. That‚Äôs just how shit is, jealousy won‚Äôt change it."
2021-05-11 10:29:42,wallstreetbets,Yours is better.
2021-05-11 18:48:51,wallstreetbets,". . .how much turnover do you think there is in there? Sure, maybe it‚Äôs technically different individuals, but it‚Äôs all fucking generational wealth. It‚Äôs rare that someone breaks into it."
2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I bought more. I will buy more. 
2021-05-11 11:18:08,wallstreetbets,"This is on margin. Holy shit.

I guess as the saying goes: if you owe the bank $10,000, you have a problem. If you owe the bank $10,000,000, the bank has a problem."
2021-05-11 10:01:17,wallstreetbets,You are exceptionally retarded sir

...To make millions ;D"
2021-05-11 14:49:29,wallstreetbets,That's great but buying any stonks on margin is a double edged sword. Yes you have rights to the growth of your share but most don't know that when you buy or even have a margin account you shares are leant out and most often shorted against you. Total fuckery
2021-05-11 15:20:57,wallstreetbets,I bought 9 more. Anyone else see the new tweet from gamestop?

2021-05-11 11:42:22,wallstreetbets,These posts get me hyped. Can anyone explain why on Charles Schwab GME shows to have 104% of shares held by institutions? How is that even possible?
2021-05-11 11:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Question. How do you save this much money and decide to yolo it on a single ticker hoping for long term growth on something that's already been driven up?

2021-05-11 13:18:48,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the account type. I guarantee this guy is not using a margin loan to buy GME. Margin accounts get around the T+2 settlement period as your broker allows you to trade with cash obtained from closing positions before the funds have settled.
2021-05-11 13:40:06,wallstreetbets,"This is fidelity, it will always purchase on margin if you have it turned on for your account. You have to have the cash reqs to back it up."

2021-05-11 16:42:13,wallstreetbets,"He likely has a margin enabled on his account which converts the holdings to margin status after the cash settlement clears. When OP (same as myself) views their holdings in detail, it specifies that the security is held in 100% equity, if it was indeed purchased using cash, meaning none of it is ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù or whatever."
2021-05-11 17:25:31,wallstreetbets,"I have a margin account through fidelity. I have a feeling that he‚Äôs just buying as ‚Äúmargin ‚Äú instead of cash. I did the same thing on fidelity .

Also you enable margin and you have x,000,000 unused in your account you can buy on margin or cash and margin doesn‚Äôt charge you anything until you go past your cash balance in Fidelity, I think

2021-05-11 12:38:37,wallstreetbets,"If you have enough money in a trading account the company (Fidelity, Charles Schwab, etc.) will let you buy stocks on credit. This can amplify your gains - but also amplifies your loses which can easily wipe out your investment. 

As an example, say I have 100k in Fidelity. I purchased a stock and it goes up 10% - it's now worth 110k - a nice 10k profit. However, if I wanted I could purchase on margin (credit) - using Fidelities money I buy $1 million in stock. This same 10% rise turns my 100k + 900k from Fidelity into $1.1 million - I see a profit of 100k on a 100k investment by leveraging the banks money to increase my position. This works great when the stocks (or options) value rises - the gains are amplified.

The opposite side occurs as well. Take the same example - $1 million in stock, $100k cash + $900k borrowed on margin - but the stock goes down 10%. If using only your money your $100k goes down to $90k. You lost 10%. Now with margin - your $100k + Fidelities $900k goes down 10%. However Fidelity is going to cover their loss. They do this through a margin call. Basically they have the right to sell all your assets they hold to prevent loss. They sell your full position - all $100k leaving you with $0 to make sure they get back the money they borrowed you (your now $90k + their now $810k = $900k you borrowed). 

Basically margin calls can wipe out your full position if the stock you bought on margin drops too much. Look at the recent collapse of Archegos Capital if your curious what a margin call in the billions of dollars looks like. Banks registered big losses because a Hedge Fund made some bad leveraged trades to an extreme scale."

But dumbass that I am I went heavy into margin two weeks ago so all my losses have been extra bad and I've had to pour money in to cover margin calls and most likely I'll just wipe to near zero but the idea that I could end up actually wiped out and owing money that's pretty scary.

Someone went through his post history and saw just 2 days before that post, he was posting on this very subreddit saying how he was poor and wanted someone to donate just 1 share of GME to him so he can feel a part of something and promised to give half his gains to the donator."
2021-05-11 16:34:27,wallstreetbets,"Plus interest, because he bought those shares on margin, so he is definitely paying some interest rates in this precise moment, and in case it goes down it will be really hard to pay a loan like that."

2021-05-11 17:03:44,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity moves cash to margin automatically as well if you have the margin feature enabled. I purchased shares in cash before, and 2 days later it got converted to margin, that's just the way margin accounts work for some reason."
2021-05-11 17:09:55,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a fidelity order page...
2021-05-11 17:02:02,wallstreetbets,"So this happened to me back in january before I left RH for fidelity. I already had ""risky"" options positions in GME (that were up 350%, not like i was even down) that even though my cash cleared they considered margin. So they locked me from buying any more positions until I sold.

So what I was able to find is that instant deposit is enabled by default on most if not all RH accounts. Well, it turns out that having instant deposit means that your account is classified as a margin account.

I only connected the dots when I transferred to fidelity, even tho I was under 25k balance, I was confused why I couldn't find any info on daytrading restrictions. Well thats because daytrading restrictions are only for margin accounts, not cash ones.

TLDR: RH considers instant deposit accounts margin accounts therefore all your positions when transferred are considered margin"
2021-05-11 16:42:26,wallstreetbets,Thank you that clears everything up for me
2021-05-11 17:50:16,wallstreetbets,What does that mean?

2021-05-11 14:43:52,wallstreetbets,It's not multigenerational wealth but it easily could be. Assuming you lived for 50 more years and all of it went to inheritance thats $49 million for the kids at only 7% return per year and no other contributions. If you get 10% returns its $218 million.

2021-05-11 12:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Oh no not saying that.  

Just that they can use the shares to lend due to being on margin..most likely. 

And if this is in a margin account the net value of the overall account  is likely many times the margin balance so the brokerage can cover their butts. 

Some are asking for 800% cash equivalents to lend or short GME right now."

1,5M times 4% = 60 000$

*Haphazardly turns on margin investing* LETS GO CRAZY BOIS"
2021-05-11 15:37:24,wallstreetbets,Whoopsie
2021-05-11 15:41:35,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I think I‚Äôd take that chance for a million dollar wager."
2021-05-11 16:11:44,wallstreetbets,Wait a minute... what if I don‚Äôt own anything? I don‚Äôt have a car or a house and I don‚Äôt have an IRA or 401k or anything like that. Could I take out a major gamble like this and if it hits I score big but if I lose then I just have to wait 7 years before being able to start over anyway?
2021-05-11 18:01:36,wallstreetbets,BR stays on your credit report for 10 years iirc.  Other adverse items drop off after 7.
2021-05-11 16:23:11,wallstreetbets,And whatever portion of the margin call isn‚Äôt covered by the liquidation of your assets becomes a debt you owe the brokerage or broker dealer. Having uneducated retail investors buying shares on margin at volume is the easiest way for institutions to cover their shorts.
2021-05-11 16:27:55,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äòs not the worst that could happen and I suspect you know that.

If only every margin call was, ‚ÄúOh, sorry... let me cover that debt immediately.‚Äù If it was that simple, the Duke Brothers would still have their seats on the exchange."
2021-05-11 19:12:14,wallstreetbets,"I know what margin means, but this is assuming there's not enough to cover your margin after they liquidate everything. I assume they don't just shake their finger at you and send you an irritated email."
2021-05-11 19:13:16,wallstreetbets,Or it‚Äôs on margin
2021-05-11 17:06:56,wallstreetbets,I do the gym mini games for video gains.

2021-05-11 18:56:17,wallstreetbets,I think there is a fine margin to this thread becoming boring
2021-05-11 17:24:16,wallstreetbets,I think they meant grains - fibre helps if you're shitting yourself watching red tickers
2021-05-11 16:18:40,wallstreetbets,"No problem so assuming you‚Äôve sold the stocks and and have realized gains and losses. I‚Äôm not sure what platform you use but they will send you a form tax season anyway that summarizes the activity. But let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve sold and got gains of 10,000 and sold at losses for a total of 20,000 the total on your taxes would be a loss of 10,000 but law is you can only deduct 3,000 so that would be deducted from what makes up your taxable income (the 7,000 will carryover next year and offset any gains or you can use 3,000 again if you just have a loss again) Now let‚Äôs say the roll was reversed and it was a 20,000 gain vs a 10,000 loss then you would pay taxes on the total of those 2 together being a 10,000 gain added to what makes up your taxable income (now the rates will be determined by whether it was long term or short term but whatever tax program you use will do this for you) hope that helps and makes sense!"
2021-05-11 11:41:24,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-11 11:49:19,wallstreetbets,"4% is very low. 
Diversifying in real estate rentals , fixing up and flipping houses as well as stock market investments can easily become multigenerational wealth, money grows fast when put in the right places. There‚Äôs more places to put money then in meme stocks from wallstreetbets"
2021-05-11 15:25:35,wallstreetbets,"Also the 60,000-80,000 a year keeps you flat. So if the market goes down at all you have to reduce your spending. It sad to think if I suddenly got $1M my life would change, but not dramatically. I would suddenly be much more comfortable, and my retirement horizon is drastically different. I am not able to quit my job, or even feel I can suddenly live lavishly."
2021-05-11 17:42:41,wallstreetbets,1.5M can easily become multi-generational wealth. But unfortunately that requires not actually spending it yourself.
2021-05-11 17:43:29,wallstreetbets,"Dump most of it into index funds and don't touch it for 40 years... it can quickly become generational wealth. I know, wrong subreddit for that kind of talk but it's very plausible"

2021-05-11 16:40:14,wallstreetbets,Looooool
2021-05-11 16:30:11,wallstreetbets,Yes that‚Äôs correct. I take back my comment.
2021-05-11 16:09:31,wallstreetbets,"Si, se√±or! And in 7 years that shit disappears quicker than my Dad on a cigarette run."
2021-05-11 17:04:53,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt you need to prove you have some bank before they let you do this at this level?
2021-05-11 16:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Well the actual worst is if you have more of your portfolio with that brokerage or broker dealer, they margin call you late, and then they liquidate the rest of your portfolio to cover your margin debt.  

*Then* they start the process of going after the rest of the debt once you‚Äôre sufficiently wiped out to guarantee you need to BK (so their insurer will cover a portion of your debt to them)."
2021-05-11 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,"""DD""s been done and the cake is baked. Fuck em we ball."
2021-05-11 18:35:10,wallstreetbets,"But I did this, I enabled margin, and I don‚Äôt know how to turn it off, is there a way to remove margin from my account? I tried contacting them, and this is the first time I‚Äôve gotten a less than satisfactory response, the guy basically avoided the question. What should I do?"
2021-05-11 18:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Basically what my ex boss did.      
Made a marriage contract with his wife, bought a super expensive house, sports car on a loan and transferred all his assets (house, car and so on) to her, waited a few years and when it was obvious that he couldnt pay he just declared bankruptcy.       
Still had his company though. And he did the same with that one, after essentially pissing off every other company he bought stuff from.        
Made a new company, bought back assets from the bankrupt one for super cheap, paod himself a minimum wage for 7 years and lived a luxury life with his wife.        

Most toxic person (and boss) i've ever had."
2021-05-11 16:44:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm laughin my ayyyyus off over here
2021-05-11 16:25:52,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm no lawyer, but I‚Äôm pretty sure fraud comes in to play at some point?"
2021-05-11 17:25:08,wallstreetbets,This better not be my husband!
2021-05-11 16:24:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure that necessarily means he is using margin (although probably).  They are just called margin accounts because you can't use margin on Roth IRAs, etc.  The borrowing power is based on the value of your holdings and they charge a shitload of interest unless you keep over a million in cash at most brokerages."
2021-05-11 16:49:34,wallstreetbets,"If you have no assets, you have no collateral, so most places would not give you that much on margin"
2021-05-11 17:06:53,wallstreetbets,With not much assets or income I doubt they are going to give you much margin to play with.
2021-05-11 18:34:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and between that time you go after the company for ever allowing you to put yourself in a position that they should have known you would never be able to cover to begin with.  You would be surprised at the amount of people that got out of a lot of money during the real estate collapse simply by fighting the fact that the bank lied and that they knew there was no way they would have ever been able to take on such a loan regardless of what they signed."
2021-05-11 19:02:06,wallstreetbets,Damn this has really got me thinking.  I declare bankruptcy too
2021-05-11 19:03:18,wallstreetbets,best part is you can own a car and a house as long as they are not too valuable and keep them!
2021-05-11 19:42:29,wallstreetbets,"If you don‚Äôt have any of that stuff, then you probably don‚Äôt have any credit and you can‚Äôt get a margin account with credit."
2021-05-11 19:12:29,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-05-11 16:27:35,wallstreetbets,"It does! thanks so much!

And yeah, unfortunately options have been majorly up and down but ended up down, so these are realized gains and losses, lol"
2021-05-11 12:29:50,wallstreetbets,If we're assuming the money is invested in high returning assets and that we're also going to work on building it then $10 might as well be multi-generational wealth.
2021-05-11 12:14:20,wallstreetbets,You'll buy 2 properties that your kids will eventually inherit and become too broke too afford so they lose it to the bank. Money also disappears fast when given to the wrong people. You'll need a lot more than 1.5M to safely pass on without it drying up faster than Janet's udders.
2021-05-11 13:57:47,wallstreetbets,Quick math says his cost basis is around $143 but this person has definitely bought at different price points.  Either way if he is green it's only by a few dollars a share.  Not really confidence building for a margin account.
2021-05-11 12:40:43,wallstreetbets,...I love you

2021-05-11 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,"What would the fraud be? Unless you lie about your income or assets you haven't committed fraud, it's the brokers risk of lending money."
2021-05-11 18:37:38,wallstreetbets,"Its only fraud if you lie in order to get the actual loan/margin.  Someone giving you a stupid amount of money with no due diligence of verifying you could ever pay it back, that is indeed, their problem."
2021-05-11 16:36:02,wallstreetbets,"How much time would you do for fraud? Does it outweigh potentially getting millions? Asking theoretically of course, for someone with nothing to lose lol"
2021-05-11 16:31:07,wallstreetbets,I knew that accounting degree would come in handy sometime lol
2021-05-11 12:36:31,wallstreetbets,Exactly- most multi generational wealth has grown from a lot less then 1.5M
2021-05-11 14:10:03,wallstreetbets,You don't have to make payments to the bank if you own it.
2021-05-11 13:35:36,wallstreetbets,No you just need to give it to the right person.  If it's an inheritance then you are raising the person it's going to.
2021-05-11 12:20:55,wallstreetbets,Sure buddy
2021-05-11 14:10:10,wallstreetbets,"If i were in his shoes, I'd dump it as soon as it dropped below 150."
2021-05-11 15:24:23,wallstreetbets,I love you too
2021-05-11 16:13:26,wallstreetbets,"Yes, change for the worse is still change."
2021-05-11 17:21:35,wallstreetbets,"In the four states that don‚Äôt allow wage garnishment, the result often ends up being worse for the debtor, because when the creditor can‚Äôt tick off that the debt is being serviced, even at a very, very slow pace, they keep going after other forms of attachment and other means of recouping the debt.   

Having an attached debt/judgment against you, especially a large one, completely changes your economic prospects in life. And to go from being able to borrow $1 million, to having literally every one of your credit accounts closed against you and having every affordable avenue of prospective credit closed off potentially for the rest of your life is a reality many don‚Äôt appreciate when trading extremely volatile assets on margin.  

Greed is a killer."
2021-05-11 16:56:45,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôve just made the same calculation that people in the financial sector make.
2021-05-11 16:53:06,wallstreetbets,Risk vs reward lol

2021-05-11 16:56:39,wallstreetbets,Not paying property taxes will send your properties to the banks all the same.
2021-05-11 14:13:40,wallstreetbets,Stoner math is telling me his actual cost basis is probably around $165-170 so he can't go that route because he's on margin lol.  Ahhhh GME the gift that never stops giving

2021-05-11 10:28:48,wallstreetbets,The value is what all his contracts are worth if he sells right now. Simple math - 1.93 = 100 shares costung 193 per contract times 30 contracts = 5790 off the 19$ call 6/11 alone. Hes got roughly another 500$ in the other contracts. Thr cheapest calls arent even ‚Äúin the money‚Äù till roughly $20.80 and its still trading sub $20.

""Right now"" means nothing, this is a screenshot from just prior to the sale, he already stated he sold at the top and took his gains. Are you actually looking at the value of these contracts in real time ? LMAO

If you don't respond I won't blame you, since there's probably a black monolith that appeared and distracted you."
2021-05-11 10:35:38,wallstreetbets,As long as you buy while the stock is going up and sell before it goes flat or drops you can generally scalp options like this. Volatility causes IV to increase which increases the premium which you can then buy and sell based off of just the premium.
2021-05-11 10:33:08,wallstreetbets,Doesn't matter he sold and profited. Welcome to options. Strike price doesn't mean much unless you're exercising or holding until expiration

Regardless of my portfolio size, I'm not the dumbass that didn't know how options worked but still commented on someone's perceived loss. Wear that badge with honor."
2021-05-11 10:43:40,wallstreetbets,It's the gambling side of options. Trading off of strictly premium with no intention of holding until expiration or even having it go ITM. quick way to make some nice gains or lose your shirt just as fast. Essentially a game of hot potato nobody wants to get stuck with an OTM option the closer it gets to expiration.
2021-05-11 10:50:11,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense. Ive been trading for 5 years and only recently started looking at options, so my portfolio is very nice from normal trading but I havent dabbled enough in options to understand the passing off the contract to a sucker. I was under the impression you go into them with the intent of holding till expiration, guess I didnt realize you can sell on the upswing for calls and not be out the full premium, but it makes sense as your premium would be covered on the contract sale by a premium from the next buyer.

Here I am acting like a know it all ass and being schooled. Thanks for the lesson."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC: My Final DD on UWMC in Light of Q1 Earnings and Guided Q2 (Though Prior to Earnings Call) Righty-o. This is my final DD on the stock. I'm going to continue purchasing more and more shares, selling way OTM covered calls to be able to buy even more shares up until such a point as my cost basis is below the share-price (My average being roughly 7.5 right now), or the share price nets me a dividend yield below 5.5%. I'm currently wholly allocated to this, and that's why while it would be attractive at a 3% or 4% yield, I'm not going to keep continuously purchasing it. After a certain threshold is reached in regards to the share-price I'll just use the premium on covered calls, and the dividend as a backboard to purchase other securities at that point in time. Considering any shares I buy at 6.38 will net me a dividend yield of 6.26% yield, and the premiums on monthly options that are at 7.5-10 can range from 40 cents to 13 cents for that month for May 21.., I'm well capitalized to receive a minimum 15-20% annual interest on this stock while ensuring significant upside protection in that if my covered calls are exercised they would be exercised at a significant premium to my average cost basis.

T Stock currently has a 6.4% dividend yield. Look at it's balance sheet. Look at UWMC's. Then look back at T's. You'll understand why it's considerably safer to park your money in UWMC. The Payout Ratio for T stock also takes up the majority of earnings per share and by a strong degree, whereas UWMC by dint of its Class A dividend shares only being 1/16th of the shares has a dividend payout ratio that is essentially nothing at 41.5 million dollars a year.

Add to the fact that UWMC has just declared a 300 million share buyback, when the public float is equivalent to 693,000,000 and you see why I think things are going to change by dint of the fact the company is flat out going to be able to buy 43.2% of the float  of exactly 110 million shares. Considering that the dividend is over 6.2% while their senior notes have interest payments of 5.5%.... It makes complete sense for them to immediately start doing buybacks starting today, which is the day they are allowed to start.

Here are some of my thoughts after reading the earnings report please be aware that this was with the share price at roughly 6.5:

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that: ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. RKT  is expecting closed loan volume of between 82.5 to 87.5B. That's a sharp decrease in origination volume of between 15.5% and 20.3%. This is an strong indication that the UWMC ultimatum knee-capped them. Please remember that the UWMC Ultimatum deadline was March 15, and Q1 is for the period ended March 31 for RKT. Please note that the Partner Channel isn't just wholesale broker's as they also lump other things in there like their correspondent (referral) channel there. I also found the 7.5% increase from 37 and something to 40 billion from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021 to be quite small regardless, but Q2 makes clear you can expect downward guidance on their Wholesale channel. Now, while UWMC may have won the wholesale volume war, it's paying a price. The entire wholesale channel is. While rates rising means a lower gain on sale margin, the pricing wars are cutting deep into gain on sale margin to. With that said, there is eventually going to be rationality as this cannot go on forever. No one likes to sell something for ninety cents when they can sell it for a dollar. So I call the gain on sale margin variable in essence. Finally, I expect investments to bear fruit and increase margin offsetting some of the pricing wars affect on GOS (for both sides to be fair).
11. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally 317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because: ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides ‚ÄúAdjusted net income‚Äù, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. ‚ÄúAdjusted net income‚Äù is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario.

My positions: Roughly 7200 shares, and 49 7.5 call options for May (Those have taken a shit lmao). "

2021-05-11 09:59:56,wallstreetbets,"Been buying down a bit, in for 2108 shares at average price of 6.86. This puts my dividend rate at 5.8%.

I don't see rates rising until we are clearly recovered economically and based on recent job reports we are not there yet. Housing market is hot but being stifled by supply chain issues and new construction backlog. This will continue to improve and the market will stay hot until it is made up which could take years. Strong buy and hold stock with little downside at this price, solid dividend, and good upside."

2021-05-11 09:46:31,wallstreetbets,"Edit: I'm truly an ape. You asked for one sentence: Best upside is massive income stream?

Let me put it this way. Selling monthly covered calls that are out of the money by a good degree, and the dividend will net you 15-20% in income a year. The share buyback program is almost half the public float. And the dividend has at one point this morning dipped to like 6.45%, which out yields T stock (which has a terrible balance sheet) on a company with a fortress of a balance sheet. The short interest is high at roughly 15%, the sector is beaten down, but the company only has good problems as the next 5 years are going to have significant purchase volume and it just needs homebuilders to build more, which they are doing.

It was valued at 10 dollars on 2019 numbers. -2019 numbers-. The analyst consensus even if slashed still nets you upside of almost a third to sixty percent under slashed numbers. The current average analyst expectations are at 11 dollars.

I don't want to tell you this is a get rich quick scheme. It's a solid company that's been beaten to hades itself, and that's what makes it attractive. Especially because it's fundamentals, even if not as great as i had once hoped, are still really good."

(Special ACB Only Addition) Part 1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5k7s7/the\_case\_for\_canadian\_cannabis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5k7s7/the_case_for_canadian_cannabis/)

&#x200B;

So I'm sure a lot of us in cannabis are feeling some heat this morning. Since my main position is ACB, I wanna take a moment to just talk about what's going on this morning, and why it's negligible, and market positioning. 

This morning, the S&P has taken a big, fat dump, a bank downgraded ACB, and TLRY had a less than stellar earnings report. Here's why I'm using that as an opportunity to buy average down and buy lower strike calls. Everything I just said is an artificial dampener on the stock that is not directly related to the stock. The S&P dropping oftentimes drags stocks down like a motherfucker for no reason other than the 500 stocks in the S&P are having a rough day. Bank downgrades aren't that serious in my opinion. I've found that banks are generally inaccurate on their predictions for most stocks, and their grading system is closer to market manipulation than anything else. They simply downgrade stocks to snap up shares for cheap and then upgrade them again to send them on a bullrun once they hit the lower price target. As for Tilray's earnings report, that is going to dampen the entire weed market today. Especially when you consider the massive short interests that permeate the weed market, one submarket stock slumping will bring down the others. However, this can be reversed by heavy retail volume. I'm gonna be continuing to buy and doing my part to make sure shorts don't get to just decide that some of these stocks don't deserve to exist in the market anymore.

Now let's talk shop on market positioning. ACB's new CEO did an interview over the weekend that 100 percent convinced me that they finally have a CEO that knows his shit. He directly stated that the Mexican legalization is good for the company, but they're not going to put all of their eggs in one basket. ACB is consistently purchasing American CBD companies that will allow for them to push into a legalized American market without problem, they maintain their position as the sole distributor in Mexico upon legalization, but the CEO has highlighted a new focus on Euro markets. Euro markets are going to be a key player in deciding which companies become profiteers upon American legalization. I've heard plenty of talk about American MSOs, but the fact of the matter is that those companies aren't going to have the necessary infrastructure and market penetration powers for wide-scale national and international distribution that companies like ACB, VFF, and TLRY have had built up for half a decade now. From here, profits in Euro markets are going to be the deciding factor on who gets to even play the game in the American market. A widescale push into these markets for ACB is going to result in a massive international market share down the line with trade domination in North America and Europe.

Overall, the existing infrastructure and market positioning that ACB is currently working on, outweighs any of the artificial dampeners that have hit it this morning. I'm not overtly concerned and am remaining bullish on the overall cannabis market with a major focus on Canadian cannabis and ACB particularly."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DOX - A Leader in Media & Communication Digitization (Long DD) &#x200B;

**Introduction**

Of the many forces of society, the advancement of technology is one that is truly unstoppable. From how we obtain information to how people communicate from a distance, technology has changed the way people live their lives. The service providers of our everyday lives are consistently looking for ways to automate & improve their offerings/operations. This created a market and demand for Amdocs Limited (Nasdaq: DOX), a technology and software product/service (such as consulting) provider that serves companies in communications, media, finance, entertainment, digital, etc.

**Company Overview**

Established in 1982 In Israel, Amdocs Limited is a multinational software company headquartered in Missouri, US. For 40 years, Amdocs has been offering advanced software products and related technology services to optimize their clients‚Äô operations. With 26,000 employees, Amdocs is currently in business with 350 service providers in more than 80 countries. Their clientele comprised of leaders in a wide range of industries: telecom giants AT&T & Bell, financial institutions like HSBC, and general crowd favorites such as Amazon, 7Eleven, and Microsoft.

Most of Amdocs‚Äô offerings are provided within ‚ÄúamdocsONE‚Äù, a comprehensive collection of products/services consisting of: Digital Experience & Monetization; Media & Digital Services; Enterprise & Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks & NGOSS; Services & Hybrid Operations; Technology & Practices-Driven Innovation. With its ‚Äúcloud-native, modular and open offerings‚Äù, Amdocs helps clients smoothly and fully transition into tech-automated, digital operations.

In such a demanded market with high-ticket clients, Amdocs recorded $4.16B in revenue during FY2020 (ended September 30th, 2020), at a 33.9% Gross Margin, 19% EBITDA Margin, and 11.9% Net Profit Margin. DOX also has consistently growing Operating Cash Flow, recording $910.7M in the Last-Twelve-Months ending in December of 2020.

Yes, everything seems to be working out well for DOX, but that brings up the question: is there still room to grow, or has DOX plateaued, making it a safe bet, but not a high-return investment?

**Capital Structure & Shareholders Breakdown**

A quick look at Amdocs‚Äô capital structure: **22% Debt, 77.1% Common Equity, 0.9% Minority Interest.** What is important to point out here is that DOX has **recorded $0 in debt** for 3 straight years from FY2017-19. This is a very uncommon occurrence for a company to be 0% leveraged. In contrast, most of its competitors are operating around the 15%-25% debt/total capital ratio, comparable companies like Akamai Technologies recording \~40% leverage in its capital structure.¬†

When it comes the shareholders of DOX, most of its outstanding shares are owned by institutional holders. Traditional portfolio managers such as asset manager firms are the biggest investors, with FMR LLC. as the largest holder. The large scale and consistent (holds & buys) asset management investment shows street professionals see DOX as a profitable, stable investment.

**Looking Long**

Overall, I believe DOX shows potential at a hold/buy for long positions if you are looking to invest in an undervalued, but experienced & matured company.¬† The following are three main theses behind a long investment in DOX:

* **Strong & Consistent Financial Performance:**

As an established company, we are seeing highly predictable topline growth rate with consistent profit margins. Although these no longer large-scale increases we would see on a growing tech company, DOX‚Äôs consistency and strong performance is definitely a supporting factor when it comes to investment. In more detail, DOX has a 2.9% top-line 5-year CAGR as of December 31st, 2020, with corresponding 3%, 3.6%, and 10.4% 5-year CAGR with EBITDA, EBIT, and Net Income, respectively. Although top-line growth was contracting a few years prior, it has rebounded between 2015-20, which could be contributed to the increasing number of companies transitioning into digital operations/cloud systems. Nevertheless, the higher (and increasing) bottom-line CAGRs means the company is still consistently increasing its profit margins (it is important to point out in that 5Y Net Income CAGR as of Dec.31st 2020 is significantly higher than previous years, which were around 2.2%-5.3%). DOX also has a strong cash flow, largely due to steady increases in operating cash flow. The OP cash flow is the best indicator here as unlevered free cash flow has seen some small-scale turbulence in recent years due to M&As such as the acquisition of Openet Telecom, Juganu Ltd., and Veego during CY2020. Overall, DOX is a strong investment from the financial perspective due to its margin growth and consistency.

* **Deep Product Portfolio with Wide Coverage**

Through ‚ÄúamdocsONE‚Äù, Amdocs is able to provide a full-suite of comprehensive products/services that covers every stage of digital transformation. From cutting 80% of time-to-market when utilizing Amdocs bundle offers, to continuous operational support and open tools/cloud platforms, clients receive a thorough service when working with Amdocs. Within the six main categories of offerings mention above (Digital Experience & Monetization; Media & Digital Services; Enterprise & Connected Society; Open Cloud Networks & NGOSS; Services & Hybrid Operations; Technology & Practices-Driven Innovation), there are numerous individual products that allows users to customize their usage of the Amdocs‚Äô platform and offerings. For example, CES20 is Amdocs‚Äô cloud-based customer experience suite. Within CES20, there are 4 products that helps automate and digitize the users‚Äô operations: DigitalONE, CatalogONE, RevenueONE, and Service & Network Automation. DigitalONE is a cloud-based system that allows users to work on their branding and customer experience. CatalogONE is an open-cloud platform catalog solution that allows users to launch new products easily with a detailed user interface. RevenueONE is a platform that allows users to scale or acquire new revenue stream while limiting the cost of acquisition. Last, Service & network Automation is a branch covered by amdocsNEO. AmdocsNEO is a service & network automation platform that offers a wide range of tracking and management capabilities. It is used to drive and control the fast automation process of the company. The CES20 is just an example of how Amdocs products are often interconnected and deeply comprehensive. They also offer certain platforms or products/services that are industry specific.

The wide coverage of the Amdocs offerings means they can gain market penetration across numerous industries. At the same time, the stage-specific offerings allow Amdocs to stay in demand and relevant as clients transition and grow. This plays a huge part into client retainment.

Last, the continuous innovation initiatives at Amdocs supports an investment as it shows the company is consistently trying to grow and improve itself. As a tech company, it is extremely dangerous to slack-off on innovation, which is often seen with tech firms that reaches a consistent profit margin. Being in the tech industry means you live and die by the creativity and uniqueness of the offerings. Amdocs is consistently investing \~20% of their gross profit into R&D. This shows the company‚Äôs dedication to innovation, which ensures that it will remain in demand in the future.

* **Extremely Low Leverage**

The last thesis is quite a short and simple one: the low leverage of the company means reduced risks and limits debt-related expenses such as interest/principal payments, which in turn increases their profitability. As mentioned above, there has be several years where the company literally at $0 in debt. During FY2020, the company took on \~$1B worth of debt, which could mean they are preparing for large scale development as from a financial standpoint, they are not in a situation where taking the extra cash is worth the liability. With that being said, the new debt is only 22% of the company‚Äôs overall capital structure, and they will have no problem paying off the related fees as they have a strong track-record of positive cash flow.

**Macro Market Trends**

The overall demand for digital/automation transformation/operations creates numerous trends that can positively impact the future of DOX. With the COVID-19 pandemic, company were pushed by the circumstances to digitize their operations, which will expand the market as well as create higher demand for the future. Here are some top trends that will impact DOX‚Äôs performance:

* **Overall Growth of the SaaS Market:**  

   * has been consistent growth in the past decade in the SaaS market. This is driven by multiple factors including the automation of internal control, enterprise centre processing system, as well as the boom of 5G and cloud-based services. Looking into the future, for the period of 2019-23, the worldwide SaaS market is expected to reach a $60.36B valuation, recording a 9% CAGR over that period.

* **Lasting Impacts of COVID-19:**  

   * The pandemic has already significantly accelerated the digitization rate due to the lockdowns and remote working environments. This is not a one-time catalyst, but rather a preview of what was going to happen in the future regardless; the pandemic situation has simply brought the future quicker. Going cloud or digitizing is not a temporary decision, this means the market has permanently expanded, and will continue to grow as demand increases.

https://preview.redd.it/78jymbukhhy61.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0362d3fb6c918222d0ffb49fff1132dadea2686

* **5G Penetration & Advancements**  

   * Continuous developments in 5G technology will impact the SaaS industry in two ways:

1. It will increase the accessibility of cloud-platforms and related services, thus increasing demand.
2. It will improve the quality and range of capabilities for the products/services of software companies.

https://preview.redd.it/zcswsxwlhhy61.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3c6560ebdcf519a5bbed1bdc42acc3c298571bc

In the modern society, it seems like life is limited if you have bad Wi-Fi connection. That is emphasized in the world of SaaS. Broader bandwidth and connection qualities will incentivize potential customers to digitalise and help service providers create higher quality products.

**Financials and Valuations**

When it comes to the fair valuation of Amdocs Limited (DOX), I used both comparable companies and intrinsic valuations, then weighted the price outcomes for the final target price. Instead, I evaluated the company using a basic comparable analysis. The companies included in the comparable universe are Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM), Ciena Corporation (CIEN), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH), and Perspecta Inc. (PRSP). The DCF valuation is relative crude with simple margin and top-line forecasts, but the results seem very reasonable and in-line with street estimates.

**Risks**

To finish off this analysis on DOX, there are a few key risks to keep in mind:

* **Cyber Security**

Although moving operations towards cloud or digital platforms will increase efficiency and limit costs, it does come with security risks. By nature of public, integrated, and/or connected cloud platforms or enterprise central systems, a large quantity of information can be easily accessed in one spot. Although that makes operations easier, it also increases the impact of hacks or other cyber security concerns. In these interconnected platforms, large amounts of information are at risks once the ‚Äúfirst door‚Äù is opened. Hackers no longer need to crack multiple systems to acquire different information such as customer information and financials. If Amdocs gets hacked, it will likely be very detrimental to the company as large quantity of information will be exposed.

* **Limited Innovation or Growth due to Lack of 5G or Internet Penetration**

For Amdocs and the entire SaaS industry, poor internet infrastructure will limit growth potential and market penetration. If 5G usage and general internet coverage does not match the rate of innovation of Amdocs, revenue growth will stall, which might impact the pricing of the stock. It will also limit the room for innovation and enhancement, which allows more time for competitors to grow within the current infrastructure and increase the competition.

**In the End: Buy, Hold, or Sell?**

Overall, I think Amdocs Limited (DOX) is currently undervalued. In general, the street has a buy or hold/buy valuation on the current price, which I do agree with. Therefore, my final thoughts on DOX are:

* **Buy** for long-term value investment. The stock might be somewhat volatile in the short-term, but its long-term value will be consistent.
* **Hold/Sell** if an investment return is already realized. The economy and overall market is kind of inflated as we recover from the pandemic, therefore a potential cash-out is definitely tangible as rumours of stock market crash spreads.

**TLDR**

An undervalued technology solution and service provider in a growing market with $0 debt and an upside of at least 25%

1.  GLD calls.  You may say ""but if the fed raises rates GLD won't do well"".  The thing is, the Fed already said they're not raising rates any time soon.  Yellen got smacked with a rolled up newspaper for even implying it.  For the next several months I don't think we're seeing any hints of rates going up.  Even with inflation.  
2.  Shorting long-term treasuries.  Current long-term treasuries will not have an adequate coupon to meet yield requirements required by the market in inflationary scenarios.  They also get slaughtered with inflation because of how long their duration is.  
3. Puts on Growth indexes.  I'm focused on the Russell growth index, because it's run *so* much the past few years.  I also believed at the start of the year we were finally hitting that small-cap value cycle.  So this was something of a pair.  I *was* long Russell value, but it ran 20% right out of the gate this year so I took my profits (IRA, so no tax implications).
4. Almost forgot, calls on INFL, inflation-linked ETF.  I don't have my PA up, but they're $33 calls, and I *think* September expiration.  I want a couple more inflation read-outs and see what that does to the underlying securities there."

As for the global picture, the UE recovery plan aims to sanctuarise up to 30% of the funds to green energy. Gas energy is also going to ramp up dramatically in the East of Europe with the rise of Russian importations to Germany, which aims to be a gas distributor across the East (if Nord Stream 2 is completed, we‚Äôre talking about billions of metric cubes each year, way over the annual Germany‚Äôs gas consumption). To me, it appeals for a change in energy sources in Poland and other East europeans countries. 

As for China, the Party is committing itself to ramp up green investments, in order to purify the major cities and to be n1 in green energy provider (which it already is in air and solar). Although, Gas, Oil and Nuclear will still represent a major part of their energy consumption. Coal energy will likely decrease in the coming decades."

Agreed. Oil companies get [way too much in subsidies](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs). I'd also argue that ""renewable energy companies"" is an increasingly nebulous term, as traditional electric utilities are embracing renewable energy for the low cost and environmental impact. Most solar and wind companies are viable without the ITC and PTC, anyway.

>Did you know that with a complete conversion to EVs alone, we'd need 3x times the electricity of our current demand? 

Even if that's true (which I don't believe it is), did you know that our electric demand also increased sharply with the invention and mass adoption of air conditioning? Our power grid was able to adapt, and we are currently seeing the beginning of an adaptation for mass electrification (of heating, of transportation, of cooking, etc).

Imagine thinking that large-scale EV adoption would lead to no more road lights or air conditioning in all of California. This wildly ignorant view would be hilarious if it wasn't held by so many."

You grossly, grossly underestimate the amount of additional power involved.

Yes, electric infrastructure needs upgrades. This is well recognized in the industry. No one thinks you can electrify the transport industry without having an effect. Utilities across the country are actively planning for the transition.

Trust me, I fully understand the implications of the transition to an electrified transportation sector. It's not a minor change, certainly, but it isn't happening overnight and utilities have time to adapt. And a LOT of the new power generation will be coming from natural gas."
2021-05-11 14:56:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm a fan of the government investing in fledgling industries that provide substantial benefits in the form of clean energy and high paying jobs.

That John Locke article calls the 2009 stimulus ""economy destroying"". How, exactly, was our economy destroyed by that investment? 

The 1705 loan program that funded Solyndra was designed literally to take risks. Some companies failed; many succeeded. Do you know how many companies received funds, to put the handful that declared bankruptcy into perspective?

lol that list is so dumb. Tesla, Georgia Power, First Solar, NextEra, Bloom Energy, Chevy Volt, NREL, Solar City, Schneider Electric - these are all listed under ""troubled"", and those companies are doing pretty fucking awesome right now. 

If you had put $8k on TSLA in 2012 (the year this article called Tesla a ""troubled"" company), you'd be a millionaire right now."

The fact that retards have bought it all the way up to an absurd PE ratio high of 1,000 is irrelevant as to the ""health"" of the company.

2021-05-11 10:43:10,wallstreetbets,Its not about the payment right now. You sell at the top of the market because your house has tons of equity right now. It doesn‚Äôt do you any good if you buy in the same market. You get a rental and sure you might pay more for now. But when the market tanks or even goes back to sane levels you take your equity and buy in the low market.
2021-05-11 11:25:36,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily.

Ironically I'm renting a Tesla with the proceeds from TSLA puts. Going to take that down to Hoover Dam, we're taking a hot air balloon ride, and I got us those cool little water jetpack things as a rental.

2021-05-11 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,"Rentals where I'm at, for what you get, are WAY over the price of a mortgage payment. Our payment for a 5/3 with a huge basement is about $1600 a month. That same $1600 for rent right now MIGHT get you a decent (not in the slums) 2 bedroom apartment. The difference is my mortgage payment is basically just money in the bank (not all of it, I know) as opposed to paying off someone else's house for them and having nothing to show for it when you leave. You're usually lucky to even get part of your deposit back. Add onto that the fact that if you're renting a home right now, the owner is probably looking at the market pretty closely and can sell their home/kick you out whenever they decide to cash out and your lease expires. But like you said, it depends where you are. My area is absolutely nuts right now."

Yet they were valued higher than Lockheed or Northrop who bring in more than that in PROFIT ALONE.

This garbage is so unbelievably overpriced even at $12 a share. You fools think Thiel took this shit public for shits and giggles? He took it to dump on your asses.

2021-05-11 08:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Glad to see someone gets it.

The options usually expire after 10 years. Since PLTR is 17 years old, you could see employees with options from 10 years ago at strikes of like $1. PLTR is then on the hook for difference in price, which throughout most of this quarter was $25+.

And each employee from that time may have thousands of these options."

Near IPO, lots of options getting exercised that have been saved up while private. The company has to pay the difference between the strike and exercise. At least with the price falling, that will go down. A number probably got exercised when it was $25+."

In 2020 they raised 500M at a 2.5B valuation.

Employees likely received options with a strike of $5 in 2020 which they could then exercise this quarter for about $25 a share. PLTR is then on the hook for the $20 a share difference.

There are employees likely holding 10000+ options with lower strikes that they have accumulated over years of service. Years in which they have helped grow revenue, and they are just now exercising.

That's why stock based compensation gets excluded. Deferred expense that tapers off as you move away from IPO."

2021-05-11 12:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Ah. Yeah with expiration of lock up, that could happen.

Main thing is they likely exercised sometime between February and march to put tax obligation to this year, and to then take advantage of the higher price to cover those taxes.

Lots of SBC expenses for that. Less than previous quarter reported, but still high. It should definitely start declining now."

What solar leasing companies do is a whole other level."
2021-05-11 08:14:49,wallstreetbets,"You have to go look when they are close to IPO, as that as when options accumulated over years prior get exercised.

Stock based compensation includes the cost of an employee exercising a $5 strike option they received in 2015 for $25 a few weeks ago. PLTR is on the hook for that $20. And your employees at at tech companies will have lots of these options.

Stock based compensation is not just CEO compensation in a tech company."

SBC will decline moving forward. Revenue will grow. My guess is operating income positive even with SBC included by Q4."
2021-05-11 08:47:06,wallstreetbets,"This sounds backward to me. Employees are to blame for taking a huge risk and having it payoff? Most of these guys got their options for significantly less than the ipo price, much less the current price. This is just short term traders whining."

The key table is on page 99 of their report. It's saying that most of their costs are related to employee compensation, which is mostly stock based compensation at this point in time. They have a gross profit margin of 78% before compensation. 

Sales and marketing has mostly stayed consistent in terms of percent of revenue. G&A hasn't gone down as much as I'd like, but most of it is related to listing, so should decline more next quarter. This is a really good sign in terms of scaling

-The most recent 5G cell cycles is not even close to over as most 5G users are still predominantly in developed countries.

-QCOM‚Äôs bread and butter business is from royalties which contributes up to 60% of revenue. This is generally a stable and predictable stream.

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A lesson in buying right time in front of you with many charts .  

Many are missing the point.

Even if an instrument is going to the moon, it doesn't mean the current entry is a low risk, high reward proposition...

Bear with me guys, here is the  famaous digital Dog   chart to exemplify this point. Fear of missing out is NEVER a good idea. Look how far you are from the moving average... I feel vertigo just looking at it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x67cnp5evgy61.png?width=1665&format=png&auto=webp&s=335c9d39eff4e40743e8d537787822b7f4e1f433

You might feel like a star buying here, as the price might go parabolic some more... but what you didn't know is you're walking a high strung tight rope. The slightest wind and you come tumbling down 1000 metres.

Unless you are a good sentiment reader, it's hard without a chart to really see how dangerous the situation is.

Now to some  silver charts! Check out the setup for silver  .

 Here we go!

**Evidence #1 - US Dollar and inflation adjusted**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bhi4hxovwgy61.png?width=1825&format=png&auto=webp&s=41b14643cd570a05387b455f08e154b9d8c7739f

 Inflation adjusted shows the truth to how your purchasing power has been subdued, even if the US Dollar index had strong bear market rallies since 1980.

Half-life of 15 years (US Dollar loses 50% of it's value every 15 years).

New bearish cycle is about to start.

Silver & friends will have a strong tailwind.

 **Evidence #2 - Gold vs Dow Ratio** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rh5mmal3xgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc91b3183804c58e77330288e998a25010bf83ca

 Point and figure charts remove time scale meaning, and add new columns only when price action reverses sufficiently (else it just fluctuates in same column).

When US equities go in BUBBLE MODE, gold (and silver) get relatively cheaper, creating a low risk, high reward entry points.

We are at similar points prior to a 1929 crash or 1972 inflation cycle.

Buying silver or gold now is not buying EXPENSIVE, but historically CHEAP.

**Evidence #3 - Silver vs Dow's 3 ""inflation adjusted"" cycles**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gtc4d2gxgy61.png?width=1838&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf7822f7a5da4856e13fc475914b0d8da4108b2

 Arcs are a powerful tool to identify a downtrend, the slowing of that downtrend, and the eventual rise from the ashes.

When you get 2 bounces off the right hemisphere, the new uptrend is confirmed and probabilities of a sustained uptrend is increased.

Angle of descent is usually angle of exit.

This JUST happened now.

**Evidence #4 - Silver's 50 years bi-monthly log chart** 

Once the price is out of the red cloud, it is GO TIME! You may start to fly 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sdr2m405zgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5c954c04d705e9dfebe81bb33d5a576dbd9fce

**Evidence #5  Lastly - Silver's Relative Strength to SPX ( US equities)**

Another view for silver, now comparing it's performance vs SPX (US equities). When the capital flows leave US equities and start flowing in silver... it creates an explosive move. Don't believe me? check out the chart right below. 

https://preview.redd.it/tet12j4bzgy61.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb61d89486d5ec0cf4a33c8ab7bed7986fba54ad

Notice the differences? Fear, and more fear. Close to the moving average, the risks are low, especially in a precious metals bull market. Nobody on mainstream media talking about silver really nowadays .

 **Conclusive Thoughts...**

THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE

 I‚Äôll just put this out there - silver is ABOUT TO GO TO THE MOON. This is the buying opportunity of a lifetime. A group of people around the whole world are buying up all the silver to drive up the prices. Everyone's doing it, and you should do it too. 

I would like to thank fellow Patrick Karim  for those fantastic charts . Or to follow him on twitter   [https://twitter.com/badcharts1](https://twitter.com/badcharts1)

2021-05-11 13:14:05,wallstreetbets,"This is an important post! While the YOLO plays can be lucrative, they can also be devastating. Silver has a good risk/reward setup right now where one might be more comfortable YOLOing a big part of one's portfolio and not have to worry about losing most of it.

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Peabody Energy ($BTU) one of the most hated stocks with a 3x to 5x upside &#x200B;

## Introduction

If you could find the most hated stock within the most hated subsector within the most hated industry today, it may very well be coal mining company Peabody Energy ($BTU). Energy is an industry that is not currently in vogue with investors and coal is certainly the black sheep of the family as the ""dirtiest"" of the 3 major fossil fuels.

Even among coal miners, Peabody is especially loathed by investors given high debt levels and recent bankruptcy (2016-2017). This probably explains Peabody‚Äôs high short interest of \~10%.

So why should you care about this dumpster fire of a stock?

The fear and loathing surrounding Peabody, has created a monster of an opportunity that offers more than 3x potential upside from current prices!!

## Overview

Peabody's business can be split into 3 different segments:

1. **Seaborn Thermal**Mostly comprised of Australian thermal coal that is primarily exported to Asian countries such as China, India, Japan, etc.
2. **Seaborn Metallurgical - Hard coking coal**Hard coking coal mostly mined in Australia that is used in steelmaking, and again primarily exported to Asia
3. **Domestic Thermal**Thermal coal mined in the Powder River Basin (Wyoming), Illinois Basin, and a couple of other U.S. states

## The Opportunity

While 2020 was a challenging year for Peabody, all 3 of its major segments will benefit from the following tailwinds over the next 12-24 months:

1. **Increased industrial activity**Industrial & manufacturing activity continues to strengthen as global economies emerge from COVID. China's manufacturing PMI has recovered to pre-COVID levels and the US manufacturing PMI has exceeded pre-COVID levels. Stronger industrial activity means increased steel consumption which means increased demand for hard coking coal used in steel-making.
2. **Higher Asian liquefied natural gas prices & Chinese coal plant additions**Asian liquefied natural gas prices are back to pre-COVID levels, making coal a more attractive fuel to burn. In response, thermal coal prices (**XAL1**) have also rebounded from 2020 lows to reclaim 2019 levels. While coal is viewed as being in decline in developed economies, it is still growing in developing economies, case in point, [China added 38.4 Gigawatts of new coal plant capacity in 2020](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-new-coal-power-plant-capacity-2020-more-than-3-times-rest-worlds-study-2021-02-03/). These new plants will increase demand for Peabody's seaborne thermal coal.
3. **Higher US natural gas prices leading to increased domestic coal burn**The recovery in natural gas prices is leading to an increase in thermal coal demand as coal becomes more cost-competitive. Coal's share of domestic power generation has been increasing while coal inventories have been decreasing. What happens when demand exceeds supply? You guessed it the price goes up.
4. **The load on the US electric grid will increase substantially over the next years**As zero-emission electric autos increase in number (**TSLA**), the load on the electric grid will increase substantially, calling for increased generation and increased use of coal. The electric grid, in the USA, is primarily coal-powered.
5. **Massive short interest**With short interest at 10% of the free float, a sudden increase in BTU price will have short-sellers scrambling to cover. Similar to what we have seen over and over and over again.

## Valuations

Peabody's forecast equity value we will apply a conservative EV/EBITDA ratio of 3x, which is reasonable for a highly cyclical & leveraged name like Peabody. We would then subtract out the net debt of $900 million, asset retirement obligation of $658 million, and accrued post-retirement obligation of $410 million. While the asset retirement obligations & post-retirement obligations may be resolved for less than fair value, we will be conservative in deducting the full market values. Lastly, we will divide the enterprise value by average 2021 1Q shares outstanding.

1. Base Case Scenario (50% likelihood) assumes that coal pricing returns to 2019 levels over the next 12 months, allowing Peabody to generate run-rate EBITDA of $850-$900 million which gives **$8 per share (+35% upside)**
2. Upside Scenario (25% likelihood) assumes that the tailwinds prove powerful enough to return coal pricing to 2018 levels, allowing Peabody to generate run-rate EBITDA of $1.3-$1.4 billion which gives **$20-$40 (+350%-700% upside)**
3. Downside Scenario (25% likelihood) assumes that the aforementioned tailwinds fizzle out and coal pricing plummets back to 2020 levels, which would imply run-rate EBITDA of less than $300 million which gives **0$**

Given these estimates, we can infer that at its current price of between $5.69 per share, Peabody is **undervalued by almost 100%** (Forecasted price 8\*50% + 30\*25% + 0\*25% = $11.5 vs current price of $5-$6)

Bu more importantly if coal pricing can return to 2018 levels (which is extremely possible given the powerful tailwinds outlined above), Peabody's stock would potentially be more than a **5-bagger** from current prices.

2021-05-11 06:31:14,wallstreetbets,"I have a fun question - as steel turns more and more green what do you think the impact of hydrogen-based fuels (hydrogen burners for reheating, hydrogen injection to act as a reducing agent like coke does, etc?) will have on the edge coal is gaining in the current market? 

TBH I hate Peabody energy after all their talk about their coal being cleaner then NG, which is an absolutely patent lie, but I like money so I may go for this."
2021-05-11 06:56:38,wallstreetbets,No clue on the status of the Aussie mines but Peabody bought Drummond energy in Alabama and the mine has been idle for almost a year. The other major mining operation in the state is sitting on enough coal already mined to fill its orders for the year and fighting with the local Miners union over wages and are currently on strike. Both mines produce met coal but maybe thermal is doing better

2021-05-11 06:50:05,wallstreetbets,"Futures are dropping this morning, with tech and small caps leading the way lower. Nasdaq and Russell 2000 already down 1.3% and 1.6%, respectively. S&P 500 futures down 0.8%. Dow Industrials 0.6% lower. That‚Äôs as of 0635.

This follows another day of selling in tech. The Nasdaq was down 2.5% yesterday, its worst day since March. The index is now down 4% this month. Sell in May? Well, Dow Industrials are up 2.5% and the S&P is green as well (barely).

This begs two questions: 1. What‚Äôs causing the tech sell-off? 2. Is it a buying opportunity?

The former appears to be this ‚Äòrotation trade‚Äô into cyclicals (and staples). I suspect interest rate hikes are starting to be priced in as well. The latter I discuss on the audio.

Not much on the calendar today JOLTS jobs openings at 1000. Some Fed speeches. Electronic Arts is due to report earnings after the close, which may help that stock if not the broader tech market."

Toward a horizontal flight

All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones"

I have a feeling the lightening will be priced like a Raptor, but if it is priced to $40k, it will be a massive hit. Ford is headed towards a lot of positive news.

EDIT: Ford out of money calls are cheap right now, and so I bought handful that expire on the 28th for like $200."

Someone kill me so my family can get the insurance money

EDIT: so basically I started off with $12,000, got my clock cleaned by the first GME crash and then sat at around 8k. Then after some great luck and good investments (gaming PLTR principally) I was able to have a high of 28K in my portfolio. And then.... I pissed it all away. I got calls on PLTR that all crashed, and then when I still had 18K I paperhanded puts, sold them at a big loss and watched as they shot up in value because the stock kept falling while I idiotically bought more calls.

In short, I fucked up, big time."

The kids liked the free toys and it made grandmas popular, so they gave them more toys. The kids asked if they could borrow money from grandma to buy toys and grandma said no problem. 
Meanwhile, the toy factory workers workers had been a part of a trial to see if MDMA cured PTSD, and all of them got better. But their workers comp settlement was more money than they got paid to make toys. So they all decided to stay home and buy stock they saw on WSB and buy toy store stock, because, hey, everyone is buying toys. 

After a couple cycles, the grandmas noticed that prices of toys were going up. But they certainly didn‚Äôt want to alarm Johnny so they said everything is ok. 

Then the toy store had to issue an outlook report to all their workers, turned investors. Turns out a bomb had also gone off in the plastic factory, and the metal factory; and the lumber factory, and every factory in the world. It‚Äôs going to cost a lot more to make toys.

2021-05-11 14:29:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah tough it out. I reckon we‚Äôre about to go through a pretty interesting year or two.
2021-05-11 15:07:05,wallstreetbets,I used to use the martin gale system on the zero (any number will do) of roulette tables. Turns out that‚Äôs a great way to get politely kicked out.

2021-05-11 07:17:09,wallstreetbets,We gotta have more revenue. 2017 tax cuts left $2T deficit. Raising capital for investment that will lower costs for more citizens in long run.
2021-05-11 08:59:23,wallstreetbets,This is figuratively exactly what happened.
2021-05-11 11:28:00,wallstreetbets,Came here to say this
2021-05-11 08:39:26,wallstreetbets,This is literally exactly what happened.
2021-05-11 07:14:05,wallstreetbets,Funds overleveraged...
2021-05-11 07:53:13,wallstreetbets,"It'll probably come back eventually, but this chop is going to be awful for a 3x fund -and not really even in a way you can profit from. Just makes it underperform relative to its benchmark. Maybe a Theta play?"
2021-05-11 13:28:58,wallstreetbets,With rocks in the landing pit
2021-05-11 07:57:06,wallstreetbets,"No, if you think that you should buy SPCE, you dont buy it. Just try to make yourself think that SPCE is a bad stock to buy and then accidently buy it."
2021-05-11 10:52:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah I bought high sold low then rebought high. This is the way yes?
2021-05-11 08:12:41,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the thing... I never sell
2021-05-11 09:44:51,wallstreetbets,Just switch the Buy/Sell buttons on your screen.
2021-05-11 08:02:39,wallstreetbets,"Branson got you too, huh?"
2021-05-11 08:42:08,wallstreetbets,"Thank god im not the only one, i bought it at $29"
2021-05-11 09:28:55,wallstreetbets,My theory is that if you never sell and only buy when it goes down then you... feel better? At least loose less...sometimes?
2021-05-11 11:35:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, you and me both. I picked up around 30 or 40 shares at 23. Rode them up to almost 60. Diamond hands. Crash to 14. FML Oh well, maybe I'll just buy more and lower my DCA."
2021-05-11 12:00:22,wallstreetbets,But how do I know the opposite is not the opposite of the opposite?
2021-05-11 09:13:37,wallstreetbets,relatable
2021-05-11 10:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Doing the opposite of what you think is basically trading psychology, from what I‚Äôve seen.

Because the news we heard is where some whale is selling based on rumor they bought a month ago. Or 30 seconds, with hft I guess."
2021-05-11 14:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Man, I thoroughly researched 10 stocks that I own. Each and every one of them has dropped over 10%. why can't it be as easy to pick 10 winners as it is 10 losers?"
2021-05-11 16:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt feel bad. I can use my time stamps from buys and sells to prove the same happens to me the exact minute I take action. The opposite usually occurs immediately. I end up being correct ~10% of the time. Today I put a coin on my desk and when I found a decent setup, flipped the coin to determine calls or puts. I would‚Äôve bought calls based on the chart, the coin flipped tails (puts)... puts ended up paying out. 100% accuracy with a coin flip, 10% accuracy actually reading charts and making the common sense decision."
2021-05-11 09:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it can."
2021-05-11 12:45:28,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is doing terribly lately, I really hope they actually have the next test flight soon but I heard there may be a delay for maintenance. So much potential here but very poor leadership."
2021-05-11 14:01:11,wallstreetbets,The trick is to buy 1 share so it tanks then load up. Reverse for selling
2021-05-11 15:37:45,wallstreetbets,That's why you hold bb just pick some stocks and hold them for the rest of your life

2021-05-11 11:25:58,wallstreetbets,Yeah i wish that was the case and soon it may be so.
2021-05-11 07:32:11,wallstreetbets,I 100% agree. Businesses will adapt and continue to grow. The extra profits from the tax cuts benefited the wealthy at the expense of the longterm greater good and have weakened the economy.
2021-05-11 07:57:53,wallstreetbets,I rolled a NAT 1. Sorry guys!

I present to you Public Enemy #1 and #2.

Blackstone Alternative

and

Cutler Group (has a history of violations for naked shorts)

Below you will find the list of stocks I found them to be short on, and their last reported positions - which in most cases are 5/10 - yeah that's right, YESTERDAY. We know exactly what they've shorted, and we know exactly what to do, right?

**We buy. We Hold. We win.**

These two are shorting almost every stock we hold dear. They are trying to take our hard earned cash just because they can. These are some of the people who have driven us red the last month. These are the kind of people who think they can have my wife without her boyfriend present. Over my cold, uncooked tendies.

Below are Blackstone's positions. You will see Cutler on many of those, as well as on some others that Blackstone was not in.

Additionally, there's a bonus in this list!

Among those precious stocks above is one that is primed for a gamma squeeze.

This stock is a small cap, so WSB can move the price.

This stock has significant short interest, which will assist in a gamma squeeze (it will not short squeeze, this is just an added little boost if it does gamma squeeze)

This stock has low average volume, meaning short positions will have higher DTC. This also means quicker and stronger price volatility.

This stock has been bent over hard and is currently at a bargain price well under any valuation you can find.

There are 4 million shares worth of options that will be ITM if the stock spikes. Average volume is 3.5m.

I give you CLNE.

If you want DD on it, do your own. The play is simple.

2021-05-11 13:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Uh you realize what happens if a HF closes their position. They have to buy = price goes up = marge is calling.

The thing about hedge funds is they are all about their pride/ego, they would rather risk going bankrupt at a later point than cover and eat a huge loss immediately. They.Have.Not.Covered."
2021-05-11 18:34:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think they partially covered. Maybe that's why Melvin Capital closed their doors to business even after a 2b bailout from Citadel. Go ahead and call their customer service and see if anyone picks up. Lets do some simple math, 140/40 = 3.5x their initial investment + interest on their shorts (not counting for what they naked shorted). Tell me, who would cover at those prices if they play in the 500m-1b range. That 500m-1b they play with, is not their money to lose. They can't afford to buy those back without impacting their investors materially.

Because they maybe have partially covered doesnt mean they aren't in deep shit. Lets not forget it is a verfiable fact on public record Citadel and the like have used naked short selling, HFT wash sales, and all other ILLEGAL tactics to suppress price. But at the END OF THE DAY, they need to pay back those debts."

2021-05-11 08:49:42,wallstreetbets,"Do you not see how many institutions shorted GME in February at $40? They've been bleeding since February. Nor does Fintel stated they closed their position. 

I'm buying xxx shares every $10 they drop because I know they want to cover at the lowest price like they did at when they crashed it to 110 at March and spiked up to 180 in a day. Because they'd rather not bleed when it was 5x the price at Feb. Bought some back when they crashed it down to 3x price at Feb. It easily bounce back to 4.5x Feb price. They're trying to replicate it again to buy shares back. But guess what? Low liquidity, retail owns float, they cant vrash it like they did in Feb."

2021-05-11 04:50:41,wallstreetbets,"Which came first, the bear or the fuk?"
2021-05-11 10:13:10,wallstreetbets,"What does $40 shorts in Feb have to do with May?

Yes we get the idea. But the idea that all of these short positions haven't covered is a stretch. Maybe the GME crowd is right and it is one big conspiracy rigging the numbers and lying and all the hedge funds are secretly sitting on these shorts still and just paying the fees and costs, long over their covering deadlines. But that isnt likely. What is more likely is a large number was sold off early and the short laddering since is exactly what it seemed like. And every day they offload a little more of what they have left.

The money they would have to pay to still be holding shorts on positions they had deadlines on 4 months ago would be adding up massively at this point.

Dont get me wrong, I am holding 40 shares of GME just in case. But I think most of the shorts are gone.

Even the current short float is misleading. People shorted the stock when it was at 150+ since the first time it broke it because it was a fantastic play. They are not in danger or a paniced."

2021-05-11 10:23:08,wallstreetbets,"Did you click the link OP provided regarding aggregate short interest? I am talking about actual data. Their positions havent closed. Tell me in what sane world would the SHFs cover at a price that is 3-5x their short price, especially since they probably shorted ALL meme stocks in tandem.

They shorted once when it was $4, the huge $480 rally wasn't a a margin call that squeeze them, confirmed by the last SEC congressional hearing rightbout of the SEC's mouth. Means the $4 shorts drove up the price to 480 (plus retail bandwagon) to cover. Because they had to cover at 20-40 dollars (4-10x their initial short). Then they doubled down in February. 

If you review the 2008 crash or hell just watch The Big Short, they will delay this shit for a year if they have to. They'll cook their financial books to make people think they're okay. Fact of the matter these intitutions shorted the memestocks (plus GME) at every juncture."

2021-05-11 18:24:33,wallstreetbets,"If you think all short positions covering result in a short squeeze, you've clearly only been here since January and don't know shit about stocks, much less options, lol."
2021-05-11 10:27:14,wallstreetbets,"This really is not the same thing as 2008.

Let us say theoretically that they have not covered the shorts. Why would they do so now? They should have covered months ago. They have been paying fees on extensions. So why would they all suddenly decide to cover at once and drive up the stock?

And OPs link doesnt show anything to me.


The current short interest on gamestop, as in hard data, is very low percentage."

2021-05-11 10:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol. You shouldn't be trying to argue both sides of the comversation. Pick one did they cover or did they extend? If you are going to play contrarian, then fuck off lol. The fact of the matter is, the made theIr play and are losing money. Do I need a squeeze? Not really. 

It's a lose lose for them. 1) cover, lose money 3-10x their initial investment, and put in their SEC filing they lose money, which would have retail gather around GME again, or 2) extend, lose money on interest, drive prices and try to buy back where they can. That SEC noose is closing in around them.

Edit: lets also review how these banks, hf and institution works. Are they using their own money to make these short plays? No they are not, they are using their investor's money to make the play. So not only do they owe the people they borrowed the stock from (at 3-5x current GME price), they also owe their investors on the losses they made on the trade. Fuck them."

2021-05-11 09:18:32,wallstreetbets,"> GameStop themselves confirmed they are heavily shorted

No they didn't.  They stated there **was** a short squeeze in the past.  They did not make any statements about their current situation.     If you disagree post the link to the quote from GME.   Also GME has **no idea** about the number of shares that are short (SI%) - they literally have no way of knowing this information other than the FINRA published data which GME holders say is false.

>almost every day shows a 5:1 buy to sell ratio

This type of trade analysis makes no sense.  There is a buyer and seller for every share of stock traded.   People keep repeating this stuff without a basic understanding of what the numbers they are looking at means.

> How could they have covered millions upon millions of shares whilst simultaneously driving the price down?

You don't have to short sell a stock for the price to go down.   The price is set by the current buyers and sellers.    If no one is willing to buy at $140 and then next buyer is at $135, then the bid drops to $135 - no shares had to change hands.

So many people act like it takes a certain level of volume to drive a stock price up or down - that isn't how price discovery works.   A stock price is based on the last trade.     The price can drop without any short selling, it can simply be people who are long trying to sell their shares and accepting the current bid price.

Edit: I know a lot of GME holders like to dismiss any contrary discussion or just refer to ""DD"" posts as ""proof"" but if you would like to have an intelligent discussion about any or all of these points I am happy to go into them in more detail."
2021-05-11 09:02:41,wallstreetbets,"What would GameStop know about how shorted their stock is? That's exchange information. And there's nothing logically wrong with somebody closing out their position while the stock goes down.

2021-05-11 10:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Weird, all objective sources show an SI of ~20%.

So no, I don't believe anyone who states authoritatively that when GME goes down to $35/$40/$50 that they would ""load up"".

A referendum on Scottish independence is within reach given the recent victories of the SNP and the Greens in parliamentary elections. In 2014, the pro independence coalition lost 55/45 with the key issue among no voters being the retention of the pound sterling as national currency. Since the Brexit debacle, a lot of the brokenness of London politics has been laid bare. I fully expect the independence vote to be successful.

So the big question is how do I go long on Scottish independence and possibly a new Scottish national currency?

Not every vote for SNP is a vote for independence, that‚Äôs just wee Nicola says as she‚Äôs obsessed with another vote. 

Unless they answer some basic economic questions it‚Äôll be a no vote again. What currency do we use, would we rejoin the EU? Should we have another referendum on that? Will there be a hard border? What will the deficit be like now that oil prices have  proven to be far too low to support a surplus in an independent Scotland? 

Even if I am wrong, and we become independent you want to *short* Scotland, not go long on it. We have literally fuck all going for us. We will be borrowing substantial amounts from the get go unless we live off of European aid and that‚Äôs *if* they let us back in straight away.

Did you know that in 2019/2020 North Sea oil revenue was 650mm gbp?  Did you know that all of that revenue bypasses Scotland and gets added to the balance / revenue sheets of England and not Scotland? If you draw a median line out across the North Sea from the border then 90% of the oil tax revenues will accrue to Scotland.  I'd say that if independence happened we would be fine.... Would you?"

I don't think London would practice much restraint with an independent Scotland using GBP.

As an outsider, wouldn't using the Euro, US Dollar or a Scandinavian currency be better for the interim, until Scotland has it's own currency?"
2021-05-11 17:41:40,wallstreetbets,"It will be linking back up with Europe. Majority of No voters main reason for voting against independence is they were promised ""it is the only way to ensure you remain in Europe"".

Then Brexit happened which Scotland resoundingly voted against.

If we win independence, joining the EU is top of the list of priorities, I guarantee it."
2021-05-11 09:06:38,wallstreetbets,"On the contrary, most of that revenue would accrue to an independent Shetland. Similarly, the more important revenue from the newer and developing west of Shetland gas fields wouldn't be enjoyed by Scotland. Even if that did not prove to be the case, the likely model of an independent Scotland's future would be oil-rich Venezuela."
2021-05-11 04:20:37,wallstreetbets,"No, why are you trying to convince them otherwise. We want the rest of the UK to support independence. Let him think we are the anchor weight and they are the boat."
2021-05-11 12:02:23,wallstreetbets,Oh Scotland owns the North Sea? Interesting. Has anyone told BP?
2021-05-11 04:17:27,wallstreetbets,"You're painfully misguided.

Russia has been cutting up the EU for years.

Trump was only another step in that.

As was Brexit.

As is crytpo.

And now this nonsense 

And you should really rethink what happens to China when their demographics cliff begins.

There is a reason why China is concerned about India.

And they don't play well with others on the world stage. Especially as it relates to Coronavirus.

Get off Tiktok. It's a propaganda app.

Some serious advice. Don't be joyful about breaking up the EU or the island. It only serves to weaken you to Russia and China.

[This](https://youtu.be/IQPsKvG6WMI) is what is happening to your island. Don't get it twisted and don't let them trick you into destroying your position on the world stage."
2021-05-11 04:23:31,wallstreetbets,That's not the point and you know it.
2021-05-11 12:18:46,wallstreetbets,"Are you dumb hahaha scotland does fund its own healthcare, education"
2021-05-11 17:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I retract my previous statement. I am not fully confident that we would keep the GBP and you (and I) should read more on the topic."
2021-05-11 11:18:00,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt know what the rules are for the euro but the US Dollar would be the best currency to use
2021-05-11 09:54:25,wallstreetbets,"Alright, in the nature of fairness I'll entertain this comment.  Has the SNP screwed the islands, likely yes, would the UK do any better, likely no.  If Shetland wanted to hold a referendum and break away from Scotland so be it I would support that but only about 40% of the Oil/Gas wells and revenue would fall under Shetland so it would likely not be Shetland takes all and more of a 60/40 or whatever the exact number may be.  Either way my point stands that 60% of 650m gpb is still greater than the debt Scotland would inherit and is much larger than what the UK deems we get each year."
2021-05-11 12:22:53,wallstreetbets,"No the NHS allocates funding to the Scottish Government which decides how it‚Äôs spent.

Same with education, you get a set budget and your government decides how to spend it, for example free higher education.

Dumbass."
2021-05-11 12:01:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes that‚Äôs how it work, decide what currency you want and just use it üòÇ"
2021-05-11 12:09:50,wallstreetbets,"Even if the over-ambitious 60% were true, that would constitute around 1% of Scotland's budget. The debt, if divided equally per capita, would be 132 billion (with a ""B""), or around 200 times the oil revenue, if fully retained."
2021-05-11 12:33:49,wallstreetbets,Considering Scotland gets upwards of 50 billion per year in taxes to say that England pays for our education/healthcare is ridiculous lmao
2021-05-11 12:30:15,wallstreetbets,The Euro is a bit of an outlier among currencies because countries pool their money together. It‚Äôs for this reason that despite being an EU member Romania isn‚Äôt allowed to use the Euro because there were concerns about their financial system that was risky for other nations (this was pre-Greece which makes this kinda funny)
2021-05-11 13:42:12,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me if I'm an idiot.  Well then in that case I vote for an Independent Shetland and they get it all, they need it more anyway."
2021-05-11 12:51:01,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt say we pay I said comes from one pot, stop jumping to conclusions.

Also tax revenue is 66 Billion + from Scotland (including oil revenue, which is in decline)

And..

They receive roughly 81 billion of public spending."

The terrible jobs report, the worst miss in several decades has insured JPOW isn‚Äôt even going to consider raising rates anytime soon. He is committed to nearing full employment numbers before that is even on the table. However, slowing down of quantitative easing is happening... you know, they aren‚Äôt injecting as much money into the economy and buying bonds... the 20 year yield will slowly creep up... but even if it hits 2%, that is still ridiculously low. Bottom line, for a while there is still nowhere else to get yield but equities for the trillions of dollars still sloshing around out there... that said.. the market has now changed, you need to accept that. As Michael Burry has pointed out, hyper inflation is coming because of the huge spike in household savings in just one year. It‚Äôs ascending to a level that historically has taken six years in just one. So you‚Äôre simply not going to win trying to drive up stocks that have no to little revenue and trad at a p/e that is 100+... those days are over... Michael Burry... The Godfather in many ways of WSB, and DFV, the man who spotted GameStop before you even knew GameStop was a publicly traded company, is laughing as us trying to chase the same old stocks... we need to think differently...

So what is that? Well. We need to follow his lead, how does he screen for stocks, how does HE for stocks and make his decisions? Read this:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/25iq.com/2016/03/25/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-from-dr-michael-burry-about-investing-2/amp/

Ok... after reading that... apply that to what you can trade, right now, following those principles. You will find, beyond a shadow of a doubt, ViacomCBS VIAC is the Alpha in this market. Stop thinking of how to fuck hedge funds over by trying to squeeze a stock, and start actually playing the game better than them. Stop letting them take advantage, like they are right now, giving us a sense of false empowerment. Because that is what has happened, and they will torch all the stocks we think we control. 

So let‚Äôs get back to the core of what made GameStop come to all of our attention, and that was the value investing tenets of Michael Burry and further championed by DFV. It doesn‚Äôt have to be ViacomCBS. There are other deep value plays that are a discount from growing intrinsic value. But whatever you do, get back to their what GameStop was really about. Value investing. Don‚Äôt kid yourself if was more than that. How we really win is making smart investing/trading decisions, not yoloing and just giving it all back"

So if the goal is to get out when it goes up, the first in will be jumping ship preventing the later people from making money. The type of investing Burry does involves finding stocks at what he thinks are essentially a discount and holding them till the market conditions finally bring that stock up.

2021-05-11 07:25:27,wallstreetbets,"First off, there's no need to be a jerk. But, setting that aside, hyper inflation is vastly different than high inflation, no matter where you live. With high inflation your purchasing power is cut at a faster clip than you're used to -- so people compensate by substituting ""cheaper"" goods and services (eat more rice and less meat, for example). With hyper inflation, your purchasing power is degraded at an accelerating pace. That $10 gallon of milk costs you $20, then $50, then $200 and so on. Before long, money becomes worthless, except for maybe burning it to heat your home. Supply for everything dries-up, you're eating your pets, and wiping your butt with tree bark.  


It's not hyperbole. It's called ""conflation"" when you lump the two together. High inflation and hyper inflation are two distinct economic realities with a chasm of difference between them."

Also, it is based on a false sense of group think based on morals rather than greed. Don‚Äôt fool yourself. If this is to work, and WSB did NOT work prior to GME, we need to get back to what made GME work in the first place. There will not be another GME. I was in GME from August 2020. Pounded stocktwits boards, well before you probably were even aware of it. The po in t is this. The whole success of WSB my friend, is based on value investing inspired by Michael Burry. It‚Äôs morphed into something that is ultimately going to hurt us, not help us, as we naively believe we will all pile in some bloated meme stock that is NOT a GME, because we all believe we are here to beat institutions and quants and prove a ‚Äúmoral‚Äù point. However, you‚Äôre confusing a market that allowed these high growth, no revenue stocks to thrive.. soon, it will end, it already is... the liquidity is drying up to pump into high growth no rev stocks, but us retail will still blindly pour in, lose more and more money, while those stocks that abide by what made GME a deep value will be the ones that ultimately bring returns. If you can‚Äôt see this, see GME for what it was, how it started, in the context it did, I wish you the best. Ultimately, a hedge fund, a big institution, or WSB isn‚Äôt going to determine where a stock trades. Fundamentals and mean reversion will. All else is noise."

2021-05-11 11:24:34,wallstreetbets,""" **Hyperinflation** is a term to describe rapid, excessive, and out-of-control general price increases in an economy. While inflation is a measure of the pace of rising prices for goods and services, **hyperinflation** is rapidly rising inflation, typically measuring more than 50% per month.""  


We are nowhere near a ""grey area"". That would be a 10-40% increase in inflation PER MONTH. Hyperinflation laughs at annual inflation rates of 2%, 10% and even 25% or 40%. Venezuela survived for decades with high inflation of 10%-40%+. When hyperinflation finally occurred, inflation topped 65,000% in one year.  


Well, I'm not interested in this discussion anymore. They're incredibly different, both technically and in reality. You'll know you're experiencing hyperinflation when you're suddenly wiping your butt with $20 bills because you need a stack of them just to buy a gumball and can't even find toilet paper. There are only a handful of hyperinflation examples in history, and no matter how high inflation becomes in the coming years, best hope you never see it turn into hyperinflation."

2021-05-11 10:55:26,wallstreetbets,"The only argument against it is that ""tHe UsD iS thE rEsERve CurRenCy of ThE WoRlD"" but if you look at the timeline for other currencies who were in similar positions (UK, France, Netherlands, Spain, Portugal, etc) as global reserve currencies, the USD is at the end of its lifespan.  China is rapidly poising the Yuen to replace the USD, and I don't think the US has the economic or military power to fight this, especially not with the entire country turning into a welfare state within the last decade or so.

It's my opinion that were watching an empire crumble in real time, and literally EVERY hyperinflation event starts out remarkably similar to this.  Like, if you googled ""how to destroy an economy with inflation"", the starting steps would be exactly what we're seeing now.

Edit; obviously it isn't just from people saving money lol, it's the myriad of absolutely horrible fiscal decisions over the last 15-20 years that are just being doubled down on and multiplied as of late.  We literally learned nothing from 2008, and nothing changed at all"
2021-05-11 17:51:03,wallstreetbets,"I would argue the US has become significantly less a welfare state. Government benefits tend not to rise or become updated very accurately. Entitlement programs we've had for 30+ years are just becoming a piggy bank to borrow from which desensitizes Congress from improving year after year to keep up with USD devaluation. States often fight them and so do voters. Minimum wage hasn't really increased since the late 60s if you're looking at CPI.

The only way to fix it would be seen as extremely harsh and cruel.  As in, ""you either go out and do something to support yourself, or you starve"" harsh and cruel.  It all starts with allowing people/institutions to fail instead of propping them up indefinitely.  I would eliminate almost all corporate subsidies/bailouts; if you aren't profitable get fucked, you deserve to go bankrupt.  Then I'd reduce unemployment benefits to below minimum wage (if they aren't there's no motivation to work), and then start agressively slashing government budgets.  There's no reason for half of the government jobs to even exist, and the government is just a bloated, slow, money sucking monstrosity (just look at their budgets relative to GDP over the last 100 years, it's disgusting how large we've let the government get) that is WAY too involved in every aspect of our life."

Other shows you might enjoy:
Psycho Pass, Steins;Gate, Jujutsu Kaisen, Made in Abyss & Devilman Crybaby (if you want to watch smth a little unusual and freaky)"

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BKR DD Hey autist here's some DD for you idiots.

BKR is getting ready to drop it like its hot. A look at the movement versus expected movement shows drastic over-movements recently. 

https://preview.redd.it/o70tl88cqey61.jpg?width=1124&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3d620ffaa4fd78bb17d1f9ac65e79dd9af430f7

This is particularly concerning for whoever shorted the stock 44 million times I'm sure. Of course this doesn't stop the head autist as they continue to do so:

[You all know nothing of diamond hands.](https://preview.redd.it/d774ys7oqey61.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f21a075c07a6e41c520cd89186bc5e002071a760)

There are two possible outcomes to this: upward squeeze mitigated by shorts, or downward price correction. Looking at how the options are placed:

https://preview.redd.it/fypjwiowqey61.jpg?width=1061&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06a36fe0b0b208f4ccba2d2db2a6b78ff7291276

The price action has recently pushed significantly past the majority of calls placed. This is good right?

Wrong. The price action has also helped keep the puts OTM. In sum this causes the following behavior when volatility increases.

https://preview.redd.it/qdwpwqa4rey61.jpg?width=201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec05525bcf40924e6af821e2e69be48e83c1fb72

If the puts weren't there there would be a good argument to be made for the possibility of a drastic price increase. Yet they're there so what can you do. I mean I know what I can do, so that was less a philosophical question and more of a normative question for you, normie.

In any case, the threat of an ups-squeeze is mitigated due to any increase in volatility causing 44,000 options to have to be hedged via stock-selling with only 33,698 being hedged via purchasing. The difference there being, of course, more than you can count - literally.

I would expect a price correction to at least $20 - where the majority of IV exposed puts are placed. If they go OTM to ITM, they will switch polarities for hedging-requirements which essentially will reverse the majority of any downward trend that had been established on the way there due to their relative quantity.

Better luck next time."
2021-05-11 01:47:23,wallstreetbets,"I get what your saying 

As Vanna increases in the money is hedged less and otm hedged more (which puts have negative delta.)

What you are missing is charm, as time passes in the money is hedged more and otm hedged less.


Your also missing What(my phone keeps capitalizing the W) is most important when looking for trend reversals. Delta Expiration. If a particular opex has a lot of option expiration the puts expire and the calls expire are closed or even just exercised and then sold the next trading day there could be a huge reversal.

Find the option date with the most ITM calls, as it approaches closer check to make sure that the options don't get rolled over to the next expiration and if all is good buy puts."

2021-05-11 02:47:51,wallstreetbets,"All great points!

I think I have a lot of your suggestions covered though. Charm, as it turns out, is minimal in terms of delta of delta - it can be included, but it typically doesn't effect anything if it is left out. 

Also - the deltas that are used in the production of these numbers account for both time decay (as in OpEx) as well as positioning from the strike. I use the Black-Scholes equation to calculate all the deltas of all options on several moving metrics - price/iv/date. 

Although not included on the reddit DDs, this provides an incredibly accurate picture of the options landscape that can be used to map out liquidity/price movement for various combinations of dates/iv/price. This of mechanism is computationally intensive so I only use it (currently) for the stocks I have stakes in.

To cover your points more distinctly - you can map out option landscape changes pre/post OpEx by simply removing the options set to expire and re-running the algorithm then isolate the difference. This provides a good basis too for setting yourself up ahead of the curve."

2021-05-11 05:34:52,wallstreetbets,Remember what happened to Brad.  Yeah...
2021-05-11 03:17:29,wallstreetbets,"ooooohhh good question. And its something I've been looking into. So far the answer seems to be - it depends. 

And to zoom out even more and generalize, I think it depends on 1) the type of strategy utilized most often by the option dealers' firm or MM's firm and 2) the positions they find themselves in.

This is just me theorizing but there are times where options seems to be hedged at 'just' the right moment. For instance, if you look at ADT on 1/27/21 and on 2/24/21, both hit a ceiling around 10$. That in and of itself isn't particularly interesting, except if you notice that a few days before both those instances, volatility started to rise. It becomes even more interesting when you look at the options on those dates and see large quantities of dealer long OTM calls placed at $10 which accounts for \~50% of all the calls on that stock. At $10 those would have become ITM calls which would have made someone around 30k long ITM calls which is a precarious position to be in (its the precipitating event to squeezes). 

But coincidentally, OTM long calls exposed to volatility are hedged via : selling. So the coincidence being, that the stock's IV rose as the stock price rose to 10$ but right when things got dicey a huge sell-off seems to have occurred, in both times resulting in drastic price drops below $10. 

What's even -more- interesting is these price drops (20%-30%) were accompanied by a decrease in IV. Typically large price drops are met with large jumps in IV - but not here.

But these are all things I've yet to explore in depth with actual numbers."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLNE Gamma Squeeze Greetings fellow apes

I'm gonna keep it short and simple for you. What do we like? Squeezes. While some of us are still waiting for the mother of all short squeezes, another type of squeeze is setting itself up in $CLNE. 

For those of you who are not in the know, $CLNE is a company that recycles natural gas from garbage dumps and uses it to fuel trucks and other commercial vehicles. If you've heard of Hyliion, Clean Energy would basically be their supplier with the difference being that they already have the necessary infrastructure and already make money selling their product.

But the fact that this stock is great long term hold and has its PT set between 11.00 and 27.00 (a great upside from today's price) by the end of the year is besides the point of this post. We want tendies, and we want them now.

And here's how to get them. $CLNE has become a very illiquid stock which means that purchases have a great effect on the price action. As pointed out by /u/NrdRage, a purchase of only 3000 shares could make the price action move up nearly 10% and it would only take 6 million dollars in capital to trigger what made you click the post : a gamma squeeze. 

As you all know by now, gamma squeezes are triggered as option sellers are forced to buy the underlying when there is a good chance that the options they sold will be ITM at expiry. Here is the current open interest (contracts for which the sellers would have to buy shares as the price action approaches the strike) for the June 18th expiry :

Anybody else see a nice lift-off ramp? I sure do.

As an added cherry on top, the stock has been severely suppressed by short sellers in the past week (namely Blackstone, a 3x leveraged hedge fund), which might be forced to cover in the event of a gamma squeeze.

2021-05-11 14:33:51,wallstreetbets,This is a great bet. CLNE should be higher valued purely on contracts alone. This is icing on the cake. Also it‚Äôs such an easy gamma squeeze to do.

Yadda yadda, not financial advice, if you buy yourself a ticket to Ramenistan that's on you. My favorite color of crayon is purple.

I'm new to this sort of thing (first write-up I've ever made lol) so I want holes to be poked in this relatively surface level DD. I'm also not the most knowledgeable on the intricacies of the steel manufacturing industry, since I'm going off of pure numbers.

With COVID recovery underway and the slow unfreezing of world economies, steel companies have been outperforming the S&P 500 by large margins, and this is one of those companies. I've noticed that compared to other players in the steel industry (X, NUE, STLD for example) MT's price is much lower than these players, and yet their fundamentals are roughly the same, if not better.

All statistics here are pulled off of [barchart.com](https://barchart.com/) and Yahoo Finance.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

| Ticker |MT|NUE|STLD|X|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Close 5/10/21| $33.06 | $98.76 | $63.36 | $27.85 |
|P/E TTM| 19.48 | 17.62 | 15.22 | N/A |
|P/E Forward| 5.52 | 8.56 | 8.30 | 5.14 |
|ROE (%)| 5.14% | %14.90 | 20.46% |\-13.05% |
|ROA (%)|2.41%| 8.32% | 9.42% |\-4.03% |
|Profit Margin (%)| \-1.38% | 3.58% |5.74% |\-11.96% |
|Debt / Equity| 0.24 | 0.47 |0.72 | 1.21 |
|Price / Sales| 0.61 | 1.42 |1.36 | 0.72 |
|Price / Book|0.81 | 2.41 |2.85 |1.48 |
|Shares Outstanding|1.06B | 299.24M | 211.2M | 269.96M |
|Float|742.42M |297.38M | 200.17M | 267.96M |

 

Bull indicators that stand out to me

* P/B and P/E indicate undervaluation
* Relatively benign ROE and ROA, and yet other companies are trading at higher prices than MT
* Competitors who are smaller cap are trading at much higher prices

Bear / Neutral Indicators

* Negative profit margin (which can possibly be indicative of repayment of debt or new acquisitions)
* High amount of stock issued - dilution contributing to the lower trading price

On the fundamental  side of things, if a second wave of COVID hits, infrastructure and building development will begin to lower demand, thereby reducing price. However, the US government's infrastructure development plans could offset any pitfalls in demand made by COVID. ArcelorMittal also holds the #1 spot as the world's premiere steel producer, with a presence in around 60 countries and has consistently growing sales figures. ArcelorMittal is also looking to reduce their carbon footprint through innovating in their daily operations.

This isn't the kind of play you'd buy FDs on and embody the spirit of Analfarmer, so I'd invest for a 9 month - 3 year timeframe. 

This is just what I've found, I'd like other opinions and counterpoints to the data I've scrounged up here. And things I missed / misinterpreting with my data. If something looks retarded, that means it probably is, so please point it out for both of our sakes.

Currently have no positions in it. If you want to inverse what I'd do, I'd buy LEAPs nine months to a year out, or buy shares (contrary to popular WSB belief, calls are not the only thing you can buy on your Robinhood account, still not refunds though)"

This is a sign we are at the vicinity of the peak.  Meaning bigger ones are looking to buyout others don‚Äôt know what to do with cash generated.

Edit: what people say the cause of a price increase in commodities and truth behind  that price action are two different things.  Using borderline illegal methods, large traders and suppliers control prices whenever they can do it, but not all the time.  Futures markets and large traders, commodity producers manipulate supply and demand. They can delay release of lumber, coal supplies to make steel or semiconductor fab equipment intentionally. The real reasons and stories they give to main st media are not the exact reasons for bottlenecks in supply chains.  Also real reasons can be amplified for prices to spike."

2021-05-10 21:47:06,wallstreetbets,PLTR is evil. How dare you.
2021-05-10 22:50:15,wallstreetbets,They invest in the company so they won‚Äôt show lots of profit. It may not go up tomorrow after earnings but that a 200$ stock in 2-3 years
2021-05-10 21:37:07,wallstreetbets,Maybe
2021-05-10 21:42:16,wallstreetbets,Maybe have to get out tomorrow. Lets see..
2021-05-10 23:09:22,wallstreetbets,Remember the MM‚Äôs always stretch things too far on the bottom side as well as pushing them too far at the top.  This way they can maximize profits for the big hedges.  They are always so thoughtful!

2021-05-10 23:05:27,wallstreetbets,Yes just wait for the hedges to shift around their billions of dollars and we will go for a ride back up.  Not until they knock it down some more in the am creating a panic sell off which creates massive liquidity for hedge funds to buy in.

2021-05-11 07:41:38,wallstreetbets,"Most companies have seen corrections of 30% or more though. PLTR is now at 35B market cap, with 1B+ revenue and 30%+ growth. Earnings, margin, growth and cash flow all beat. Also laughable that you call it no name. I have been hearing about PLTR for at least 5 years if not more.

The market is definitely correcting itself. Hanes is getting beat up because guidance was underneath estimates. Money seems to be pulling out of the market, having over inflated tech and over estimated reopening. 

Oh well, at the current rate my SPY hedge will print this summer."

2021-05-10 23:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Lol wtf? Are you smoking crack? Amazon is literally the largest online retailer and is diversified across a million different sectors. They make nearly half a TRILLION dollars in revenue.

PLTR is a one trick pony software company. Even IF they came close to a market share equivalnet to Oracle, they'd have a market cap of $200 billion.

Oracle makes nearly $40 billion a year in revenue.

There is zero justification for PLTR ever being worth that kind of money based on what they currently provide."
2021-05-11 00:12:03,wallstreetbets,Stock has sold off after each of her more recent purchasers. Her trades do not move the needle anymore.
2021-05-11 10:22:12,wallstreetbets,"This statement reminds me of the article I read yesterday about Amazon not recovering for seven years after it went to $7, even though nothing was wrong with the business. If I recall correctly, Bozos did say something to the effect of not being profitable for some time. 

I see similar storylines here. Granted, more than 17 years of not being profitable is a long time, but If PLTR doesn't recover for 5 years I see that as a longer term buying opportunity.

Stonk go ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote). Stonk go ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)... or maybe we're all screwed"

2021-05-10 21:39:33,wallstreetbets,O
2021-05-11 07:52:42,wallstreetbets,"That still does not justify a $35 billion market cap.

I am an electrical engineer. I work for a company that has literally been doubling its revenue year over year. We do engineering for major pharma. We just broke the $1 billion revenue mark. We would not be worth $35 billion.

Look at Jacobs engineering and so many other companies. Jacobs has a revenue of about $14 billion in revenue and has a market cap of 18.5 billion.

The fact of the matter is PLTR is seriously overpriced even compare to tech giants.

They are a successful company but they arent worth that type of valuation. It's why their price is tanking, everyone knows it except for the people who FOMOd here on Reddit."

2021-05-10 23:33:33,wallstreetbets,Lol. Exactly. When I invested in Amazon at 400$ they were not diversified and invested every penny to get to this level. At one point the board of director decided to sit Jeff down from CEO position Bec of crazy investments in the company and not showing any profit to share holders.
2021-05-11 01:55:44,wallstreetbets,Lol at thinking that Amazon's share price is because they have an online retail presence.
2021-05-11 00:13:59,wallstreetbets,Not so much that CW is going to ‚Äúsave us‚Äù we‚Äôll see what happens tomorrow. If earnings are stellar we may get a nice flat day to kill weeklies

2021-05-11 02:06:04,wallstreetbets,a song by Beyonce.
2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD MVIS Let's see what the current state of affairs for MVIS is you dumbfucks. I hate you all so much on a real level.

Looking at what is driving price via my algo:

https://preview.redd.it/dh0f3fvx4ey61.jpg?width=1365&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ffecb7ef48439f477b8dfe79341b48995c43c6d

Ah look its volatility. How do I know? Cause fuck you my brain is so smooth nothing gets past it.

Since volatility seems dominant, and volatility is a measure of expected price moves, lets look at expected versus reality price moves:

https://preview.redd.it/fee5n95a5ey61.jpg?width=1103&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7705cded3e68a7b59627b49841688b6204c001dc

Pretty chill lately - the price (black) has been within the +/- 1 std expected price move since calming down from the squeeze -er- attempted pump n' dump. 

Let's look at where the options that are sensitive to volatility are:

https://preview.redd.it/6s5lm16k5ey61.jpg?width=1106&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5861c417f41dcb27ded91093300b8ff2faf8ef0

Mostly far away from us at $35. This becomes important when trying to figure out when things switch by either switching from/to OTM/ITM.

Are the large institutions cool with MVIS?

https://preview.redd.it/hkca3ijr5ey61.jpg?width=1102&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed095e4c7ed76903a56df0d927ceb50de948b2c5

Well shorting has been - uh- skyrocketing. So maybe not. 

So MVIS is a mixed bag. The anticipated price drop (via increase in short selling) will be met with decease in volatility (via covering shorts) which will cause delta hedging via purchasing (info not shown cause its mine). So you have a bit of a stalemate. Unless price increases:

If price increases, the volatility increases, and the options will have to be hedged via purchasing underlying asset (325,829 to 282,655 : amount of options that will cause buying:selling). 

Seeing as since 04/21 OTM calls have gone from 140k to 314k with the predominance of them being dealer short and OTM puts doubling with predominance of them being dealer long (quite the mix!) there is reasonable concern for an unhealthy upside. When that will happen is hard to say. The nearest chunk of options that have sensitivity to volatility is at $15. I wouldn't expect things to go wild until then and if it continues to drift away from $15, the less likely it becomes with an anticipated floor of $10. Even then - until $35 the predominance of the volatility increase with price increase would only be resultant from issues covering shorts. 

TL;DR: Read a book."

Liedar doesn't exist at MVIS. There are 12 other companies with better technology and with real customers. mvis has no demonstrable technology and is just a hyped up pump-and-dump from delusional newbie sheep being suckered."

2021-05-10 23:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Sure! 
So the majority of options are dealt through options dealers. They do not care if they buy or sell options so long as they are collecting the premium for doing so. But in order to not be crushed by price movements of the stock they are dealing options on, they hedge by selling or buying the stock itself - this keeps them 'neutral' to the stock price. 

But occasionally, they can become off-sides if they over-sell or over-buy particular types of options. 

So you can look at certain characteristics of how the options are placed and if they are bought or sold by the options dealer and figure out what they will have to do in order to remain 'neutral' to the stock price itself."

2021-05-11 00:24:12,wallstreetbets,"Haha It's taken about a year to get a functional prototype of my program working. I'd say starting with a deep dive into the options world via reading as much online stuff as you can would be a good start. If you DM me later, I might be able to help you more."
2021-05-11 00:19:20,wallstreetbets,"Well no, not the complete story I suppose. But it can be assumed the majority of options are traded with the option dealer as an intermediary and as such, will be hedged in predictable ways. 

The caveat being, of course, complex options holdings and types that mix/match and and/or inherently delta/vanna/etc. hedge. But it is too difficult to parse through the data in such a way as to find the optimal ""ratio"" of types of options positions. So the assumption that most calls and puts are single order-type give rise to the confidence of flow = positioning from which you can derive the hedging behavior."
2021-05-11 06:40:10,wallstreetbets,">my target price is 1000 within a year

Based on what tho? Even if we all agree that it's a great company, the current price makes it worth more than the rest of the auto industry combined. None of it makes any sense.

Tesla aren't the only company in the world that can make EVs and batteries (right now they still rely on other companies for batteries anyway). Are we expecting Tesla to have a global monopoly on power storage? I really don't think that's a likely scenario."

2021-05-11 07:35:29,wallstreetbets,"> He's put NASA back on the map

Ehhh, I think your perception of Elon Musk is blinding you to reality. He's a wealthy man with an army of dorks on the internet who think his shit tastes like ice-cream.

There is no rational justification for Tesla's value right now. Musk is an investor and CEO, but he's managed to convince people he's a genius engineer, despite having no background in engineering.

2021-05-11 00:39:26,wallstreetbets,"Well I'd say start there! I started programming by finding something I was interested in investigating, and then as I formed questions, the natural thing to do was to figure out how to answer them.

From there, I gained the skills necessary to turn towards options."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD PLTR Sup idiots - Ya'll keep talking about PLTR so let's have a look. Buckle in neanderthals.

Looking at what determines delta hedging from options dealers there is good work comming from gamma:

https://preview.redd.it/u6re8pkhsdy61.jpg?width=1130&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8854b01168eb1c70ec4307644db5da13ac3dc528

When that purple squiggly is high it means pressure against prevailing direction - mostly. But that's not the fun part.

If you know what a stock price's movement is most sensitive to, you can then look deeper: since the squiggly is high it means a large portion of the stock movement will be dictated by delta hedging.

Since delta hedging is dependent on moniness of options, it makes sense to look at anticipated movements:

https://preview.redd.it/4qp5eo1usdy61.jpg?width=1117&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0c3596f02c0b6a3c34451b16feb16e559ab1861e

Clearly the price has been dipping below the bottom band consistently now - this indicates the price has been dropping lower than the anticipated price movement by 1 standard deviation. So the price has been going down more than anticipated lately. Well that doesn't mean much if we don't know how much / where the options are:

https://preview.redd.it/k92m1ke1tdy61.jpg?width=1106&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb01c762d85296a304b27a0a3f9ca3c0ecc49380

More lines for you idiots. The red line is the current price. The two graphs show the same thing but on different scales for visibility. The left just shows the distribution of options, the right shows distribution of options but colored by the options that are most sensitive to changes in volatility. Why volatility? Well when things go to shit volatility sky-rockets and its good to keep an eye on which stocks are most sensitive to that. Did that large chunk of volatility - sensitive calls just go ITM? Ops. That's an issue (for you not me). 

Also - notice the large chunk of options at $25 and how $25 seems to be a point of resistance? Ya me too that's why I created these algorithms while ya'll were baking tendies in easy bake ovens powered by hamsters.

So then what has the market been doing with these larger-than-normal down-trends in price?

https://preview.redd.it/1z0vj6qptdy61.jpg?width=1092&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d354fe6398500bee3235105108aceedc543e5465

They've chilled on the short-selling. Is this because availability of shorts is limited? Is it because there is little purchasing behavior? Is it delta-hedging? That's for you to figure out.

So now we know: recently there has been larger than normal drops in price. There is a large chunk of volatility sensitive calls above the current price (30$). And short activity has been casual. What else can we learn? To really finish this picture, however, we need to know which options are what: are they long? are they shorter than your prospects? Who knows.

Nvm, I do:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xlvba9esudy61.jpg?width=183&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7050a5d368d07d1cb470d836dbbe4237e86f5a27

https://preview.redd.it/vm6a9sqaudy61.jpg?width=986&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1246d42d4540e52c91bbb606838f32e3ccec45c6

&#x200B;

So there is short delta on the dealer's end on a stock that may move drastically after earnings. This has been set up due to the recent steady decrease in price that has been capitalized on by a large proportion of customer short calls (1,015,600 of them) causing dealer-short delta exposure. This indicates continued and large down-side.

With recent large increases in volatility, what happens when volatility goes up or down?

https://preview.redd.it/n989gt2dvdy61.jpg?width=210&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d84140c6df460d60488f7156c6c8ab5f1455910

Well 1,610,873 options will cause selling compared to 1,494,439. that's a 1.6:1.5 ratio with overall sell as volatility increases (reverse with decreases in vol). With little upside prospect, there is most likely going to be increase in the sell-side. 

So what did we learn kiddies?

All you buying the dip are fucked. The only way it will benefit is if the stock price pushes large quantities of options OTM -> ITM and customer's quickly swithch/liquidate their options in response to the price increase. Otherwise, everything indicates continued downside."

2021-05-10 22:14:26,wallstreetbets,"I said this in the beginning of the year. We all do
It. You will too. If you keep doing options. Keep wining and then one day. That day when you bet so big, your account becomes a deficit. Lol.

2021-05-11 02:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Posting this to help you or anybody else not familiar with options and stuck carrying heavy PLTR bags now: If you're actually serious about buying $10K worth of shares this week, why not get paid for it by doing it via Cash Secured Put options? You should be able to sell to open at least 5 contracts at 18 strike and get around $450-500 in premiums now in order to wait until after this Friday to see if it panned out. Theoretically, if PLTR decides to rally you could chase it on the way up each week and keep pocketing chunky premiums. If it never hits your strike, you would be lowering your cost basis on the 3600 shares you already have now. Also, sell Covered Calls on your 3600 and get around $470 or more each week at the $24 strike to also lower your basis while you're waiting for the moon-shot."

2021-05-10 21:25:55,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll paste a comment I made earlier today, sorry don‚Äôt have time to comment twice 

This is abbreviated but

I‚Äôve used them exclusively on the military side, and they‚Äôre deep in the intelligence agencies of every western country.  I see a multipolar future with several blocs of countries pitted against each other.  Palantir has repeatedly said they represent western ideology and will pick up more and more government contracts as the need for ai and data analytics is further recognized.

This will also occur in private western companies as Europe tightens data privacy laws and data analytics are used more and more frequently.  Pltr allows for data exploitation while also ensuring privacy.

My main concerns with Pltr right now are showing private sector growth, and reducing the dilution of shares with stock based compensation.

If these two things are addressed I believe the price goes back up.  I don‚Äôt think the potential value of the company is recognized now.

With that said, I don‚Äôt expect a rapid turnaround, and I am buying now to hold for years, with a goal of 5k shares.

Check out some interviews with Alex Karp, he‚Äôs got a great vision that I completely agree with."

Your first answer was that they claim to want protect western ideology. What part of that ideology do you value? Because if people at the top are critical of our democracy, have been linked to actual psy ops to undermine that democracy, then it seems like the main thing theyre defending is the capitalist system that benefits them.

I get that you see it as a lesser of evils and I'm not discounting foreign threats by any means, that's been a constant threat. I'm just saying we shouldn't ignore the wolves within either, because they could easily cause unparalleled harm as well."

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bearish TSLA? So we are sliding down since the end of January. There was a \~61.8% pull back up in April and down again. We are bellow a previous uptrend which was forming since march. We may be going towards 400-500 territory which wasn't in play since September November last year. This could be potentially nasty but looks that way. What would you say about it?

**Update 11th of May 2021 - premarket -** price is 587. Lets see what will happen.

**Update 12th of May 2021** so 600 is still holding. Any pull up will be used for selling.

2021-05-11 04:48:11,wallstreetbets,"I've bought ‚Ç¨1000 worth of puts on Tesla.

Even if we agree it's a great company with a great future, it's the most overvalued stock in the S&P500.

Right now, at a P/E ratio of 982, which was calculated from a share price of $700, it's overvalued. Let's find the ""correct"" price assuming a P/E of 25:

982/39.28 = 25, so the ""correct"" price is 700/39.28 = \~$17.75

OK, let's be optimistic and use the forward P/E ratio of 312.

312/12.48 = 25, so the ""correct"" price is 700/12.48 = $56

&#x200B;

So let's be super-mega optimistic and pretend that Tesla will quadruple in size in the next couple of years, and allow a multiplier of 4, that still gives us a ""correct"" price of just over $200.

&#x200B;

I think Tesla is a great company with a great future, and that it will grow significantly...

But the stock price is disconnected from reality. They're not going bankrupt, but there is no rational justification for the share price anymore.

&#x200B;

I'm buying Tesla puts at $200, it's literally free money right now. Even daddy musk himself thinks the share price is too high, he literally said it. Short tesla now and get yourselves some tendies."
2021-05-11 03:04:11,wallstreetbets,"Im bearish because rising metal costs are going to fuck TSLA‚Äôs margin. They will probably need to raise prices which will reduce the amount of buyers in the affordability range for their vehicles. Or m, they may follow the lead of other manufacturers and temporarily halt production. Either way, sales and profits will drop. There is nothing they can do unless they have begun mining their own metals.

Any industry with products produced from metals or containing metal components is going to see reduced profits while metal prices remain high. Companies are scrambling to find alternate suppliers for components already."

Deeply inside we all knew Tesla mooning is a charade, even if tomorrow Elon finds a better way to colonize Mars there wont be much for shareholders unless he finds martians up there and starts selling them gluten free foods.

P/e ratio of 25 is way above average, today the only reason Tsla stock price should be above 100 is if Elon could outperform any competition with his cars in the next years; which back then it was the main reason why Tesla stocks looked so juicy. Its already 2021 and a minimum price of 60k euro for a car that, innovative of course, but finished worse than the cheapest car you can find doesnt really make me want to trust the company.

However they have already said what their revenue is a few days ago so if its close it might be priced in already. Also their PE ratio is really high and the company is overvalued (however it may not change anything in this crazy market). 

Another thing, the stock does good on Fridays usually, however if investors realize its overvalued there can be a selloff on Friday also. I also expect it to dip by thursday.

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RKT is eating into UWMC's market share in Q1 2021, UWMC issued an ultimatum to mortgage brokers, telling them that they can only work with either UWMC or RKT. The two companies have been engaged in a pricing war, and with the earnings release of both companies, we can see that RKT is clearly winning. UWMC cannot compete with RKT, who is a larger, more diversified, and more efficient company. I believe RKT will soon be the largest direct-to-consumer lender and wholesale lender, and will achieve their target 25% market share in a $3.5 trillion mortgage market soon.

The recent sell-off in RKT was likely due to them approximately meeting expected earnings and not blowing it out. However, RKT has been cutting margin to gain market share, which we will see is working from the numbers. RKT also boasts a 90% customer retention rate, meaning that once this price war is over, they will keep most of their market shares that they gained. Thus, the recent sell-off is short-sighted and RKT will continue to grow market share even in a declining mortgage market.

The numbers:

RKT's partner network (brokers) origination volume went up from[$37.9B in Q4 2020](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-Experiences-Explosive-Growth-Revenue-Increases-144-year-over-year-to-4.7-Billion-in-Fourth-Quarter-Company-Announces-Special-Dividend-of-1.11-per-Class-A-Share-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx) to [$40.7B in Q1 2021](https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx). UWMC, who only deals with brokers, saw their origination volume go down from [$54.7B in Q4 to $49.1B in Q1](https://investors.uwm.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx). RKT has been giving out more competitive rates than UWMC, and UWMC cannot afford to fight this price war. At this rate, RKT will take over the #1 spot in the wholesale channel in 2 quarters.

Summary:

RKT's lower earnings is partially due to them aggressively gaining competitors' market shares even in a declining volume mortgage market. This, together with the other rapidly growing business in the suite of Rocket companies, such as Rocket Home and Rocket Auto (which is basically the backbone of Vroom btw, just search up rocket auto in [VRM's sec filings](https://ir.vroom.com/static-files/0d0ff3d4-14d6-4e17-a8da-0e6cddbdae2f)), means that the current dip is an excellent entry point for medium to long term holders."

2021-05-10 21:40:33,wallstreetbets,"I have been hearing this for 9 months and down $240,000 fucking $"
2021-05-11 08:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Dude, lmao. What are you on about. UWMC issued their ultimatum on March 15 and the 1st quarter ended March 30th. Plus the correspondent channel is part of the partner channel and so it‚Äôs not wholly wholesale. Also did you not see the 20 percent plus decrease in q2 numbers for loan originations that RKT guided for in q2 in total? Whereas UWMC is guiding up to 51-55 billion. RKT is expecting bps of 100, while UWMC is expecting 75 to 115 for q2 on gain on sale so that‚Äôs a wash, but are you joking about market share? RKT had Around 37-38 percent of its originations in the partner channel. If rkt meets q2 originations and the partner channel is stagnant that becomes almost 50 percent. So, no dude, they lost a lot of volume."
2021-05-11 00:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Both companies looked great and the market over reacted , this is not stupid to bag hold , I am down like crazy but believe their 2 q will better and the hype on housing market is not over"
2021-05-10 22:03:27,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you can read into these numbers the way you are. For one, RKT's partner network isn't just mortgage broker originations. Only the specific RKT TPO platform is mortgage broker originations.

In contrast, RKT's partner network volume, as they report it, is essentially all mortgage volume they get that are not direct to consumer. They lump it all together. This includes real estate agent partner network, the broker RKT TPO platform, and other ""partners.""

As far as I'm aware, Rocket does not breakdown it's partner network volume in its SEC filings so it's unclear what its exact broker volume is.

At a minimum though, the Rocket partner volume is comprised of more than just it's broker channel. Specifically, [this March 8, 2021 article](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-pro-tpo-finally-reveals-broker-origination-volume/) says Rocket finally disclosed its 2020 mortgage broker volume as $97 billion. In contrast, Rocket's recent annual 10-k indicates its 2020 partner network loan volume was $106 billion. Thus, the partner network loan volume has to include more than just the broker volume.

The Q4 2020 $37.9 billion and Q1 2021 $40.7 billion partner network loan volumes are only a 7.5% difference. I don't think you can read into how successful or unsuccessful UWMC's ultimatum is from just those numbers.

Also, presumably, even if UWMS's ultimatum were successful, it would have driven a short term mortgage broker spike to Rocket. That is, UWMC issues the ultimatum, all the brokers realize they're going to have to choose one, so they all test out both UWMC and Rocket to see which is the preferable platform. However, that doesn't mean that short term spike will be a long term one. I think only this upcoming quarter will tell how successful it was.

Lastly, from an economics perspective, as long as UWMC is able to give its customers lower rates, it'd be pretty weird for it to lose market share to Rocket. It would mean brokers aren't doing their jobs and taking their clients to the lowest rate lender.

I haven't seen anything in these recent quarterly releases indicating averaging interest rates for Rocket and UWMC, but last quarter I believe UWMC's average rate was something like 0.5% less than Rocket's, a pretty significant difference when you're dealing with 3% interest rates."
2021-05-10 20:44:52,wallstreetbets,"OK here's where your argument fails.

RKT's Q1 originations were 103.5B, of which 40.7 were brokers. I'll round up and call that 40%. (Q3 and Q4 2020 were 33 and 35%) 

UWMC's Q1 was 49.1B, which is 100% brokers.


But.... what are the Q2 outlooks?

RKT: 82.5-87.5B. 40% of that is 33-35B. Down by 5B at least.

UWMC: 51-55B. Marginally up.

The Ultimatum only went into effect on March 15 so I don't think there's much here anyway, but even if there is, I don't think it is saying what you think it's saying."
2021-05-10 21:11:12,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-05-11 01:42:24,wallstreetbets,"I see it as the opposite. RKT guided down for the next quarter, UWMC guided up.

RKT does 4x the volume of UWMC, but their big claim to fame is an iPhone app. UWMC has a dramatically lower close time (17 days on average vs 40-50 for RKT), averages lower interest rates, and a lower default rate (meaning they are cherry picking higher quality candidates)

The above factors are very important in a competitive environment, especially since customers at the broker level will be much more likely to use UWMC simply due to the fast closing times, not to mention the obvious benefits to the customer lower rates mean.

A house is a big purchase, RKT might have a more intuitive and convenient application interface, but I don‚Äôt see that holding a lot of sway long term since you can save a few hundred bucks a month in interest and close much faster by choosing UWMC. I think for most customers the benefits outweigh a few extra hours spent on paperwork and phone calls.

UWMC is sitting on a shitload of cash, is investing in growth, and I can see them growing just as fast if not faster than RKT, they‚Äôre definately primed for the current environment and going forward have every advantage over RKT. 

Plus they pay a 5% dividend and a more favorable price to earnings. Just a better company, better product overall, and I think time will tell"

People are hunting for competitive rates and uwmc is expanding their offerings.  Rkt isn't expanding anything but their advertising budget.  Q2 will really tell the tale as the ultimatum uwmc made was 2 weeks before the close if q1 and it sure looks like brokers chose to stick with uwmc as opposed to rkt."
2021-05-10 22:37:56,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôll both be fine short term but RKT is more of a financing company with multiple different revenue streams that makes it a dirty long term monster play. UWM kinda reminds me of Ditech financial like makes a lot of money with low rates then declares chapter 11 three times then bought out. Once they lose their number one marketshare and their market cap remains the same or lower‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a rap.

2021-05-11 10:31:32,wallstreetbets,"This is hilarious. RKT share price to book value is 60... and projecting a slowdown in Q2. 

UWMC price to book value is 0.84, and projects growth in Q2. The stock is literally worth less than their current assets, and trading far below IPO levels. Unless they are going out of business soon (they aren't), this is free money sitting on the table. With a 6% yearly dividend.

UWMC started the exclusivity ultimatum because they saw how RKT can rapidly catch up - broker volume went from $19.3B in Q1 2020 to $40.7B in Q1 2021 for RKT vs from $42.4B in Q1 2020 to $49.1B in Q1 2021 for UWMC.

2021-05-11 13:29:54,wallstreetbets,"Some very important context relevant to this that was revealed in the UWMC conference call this morning:

Ishbia stated that because of how quickly UWMC can close and service loans, the effect of the interest rate increase in March was actually felt and impacted their Q1 results, since loans started in March were already closed and on the books by the end of Q1. In contrast, other lenders that have longer loan closing times may not actually show the full impact of the March interest rate increase since the loan applications from March may not have been closed by the end of Q1, but rather the decreased loans from March will show in their Q2 results. For many of these companies with longer time to close a loan, Q1 results may only show loans that were started from December-Februrary, and thus their Q1 results may look better than UWMC. 

But it will bite them in their Q2 results. This is why companies like LDI and RKT have reduced their guidance for Q2, because that is when the reduction in loans from March will be added to their books. In contrast, Ishbia strongly reiterated during the conference call that Q2 will be even better than Q1, and is probably one of the few mortgage companies that is guiding higher for Q2 than Q1."
2021-05-11 04:01:36,wallstreetbets,Why would the Q2 outlook for RKT be lower than the Q1 but higher for UWMC?

2021-05-10 20:06:47,wallstreetbets,"Jay farner alluded to this during the RKT earnings call. They were emphasizing that they are trying to bring value over the lifetime of the customer, and RKT has a high customer retention rate. It would be unprofessional to call out UWMC during the call. If you read between the lines, you will understand what they are getting at."
2021-05-11 11:17:21,wallstreetbets,"Imagine using P/B value to value a mortgage company.... also P/B for RKT is more like 4.3, Yahoo is inaccurate."
2021-05-10 20:01:26,wallstreetbets,first day in the market?
2021-05-11 01:26:01,wallstreetbets,Perhaps the market doesn‚Äôt seem booming numbers to continue in the greatest real estate market ever
2021-05-10 20:03:37,wallstreetbets,I mean wouldnt RKT ideally like to remove the b2b market then?
2021-05-11 11:04:01,wallstreetbets,You had to bring up gourds
2021-05-11 06:57:18,wallstreetbets,Because UWM is gaining market share not losing it
2021-05-11 14:41:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah Amazon had a low profit margin when they were taking over too. That‚Äôs what they do. They have the cash to take over. They can adjust margins accordingly based upon their game plan. Like what‚Äôs their plan? Seems like they are just going to do more of the same
2021-05-10 21:37:21,wallstreetbets,I think something like 95 percent of the lenders UWMC work with signed the addendum.
2021-05-10 20:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah, didn't listen to the call so that makes sense to a degree"
2021-05-11 11:35:06,wallstreetbets,"In my mind, assets and cash on hand should certainly be considered in valuing any stock. This is L2 information on RKT from TD: ""Book value per share: $0.25."" At current share price, that means the P/B ratio is 67."
2021-05-10 22:25:10,wallstreetbets,Rocket CO‚Äôs has been around for 30 years. They also survived 08.
2021-05-11 06:54:27,wallstreetbets,"All time record low interest rates, people standing in line to get a raffle ticket to have a chance to buy a house. UWMC has q2 projections of 52 billion in new loans. There are more buyers then available homes for sale. The value of my own house has went up about 30 percent in 2 years. I would side with someone‚Äôs bearish thoughts on housing if they could give me indicators to match their argument."
2021-05-11 09:28:28,wallstreetbets,"These stocks were already cheap before the greatest real estate market ever, I can't see a reason why they'd be worth less during the greatest real estate market ever."
2021-05-10 21:21:11,wallstreetbets,You're saying the quiet part out loud.
2021-05-10 20:10:59,wallstreetbets,"wouldnt it be better to kneecap your oponent while building brand recognition?

genuinely curious"
2021-05-10 21:39:11,wallstreetbets,"That will never happen. I will always use a broker because I get a better rate. Until that changes, which is unlikely then b2b isn't going anywhere."
2021-05-11 15:23:30,wallstreetbets,"Apples and donkeys.  Amazon had low/no profit margins because they were constantly expanding their business and offerings.  Rocket isn't doing that, at all."
2021-05-11 12:09:52,wallstreetbets,"I took a look at RKT on TD & I think I figured it out. Some websites are including minority interest in liabilities & some are not.

Assets- $34,732,277,000 minus Liabilities - $26,426,448,000 = $8,305,829,000 Book Value

Divide Book Value by the total outstanding shares of 1,984,454,000, which gets you to a book value per share of 4.19.

Share price of $16.83 divided by $4.19 book value her share is a P/B around 4.

However... Dan Gilbert/etc. own 94% of the company, so TD appears to be taking 94% of the book value & putting it on the liability line as minority interest, which is correct per GAAP.

94% of $8,305,829,000 Book Value  = $7,750,000,000 Minority Interest

Then if you reduce the book value by the minority interest & you do all the calculations again you get a P/B of 60.

I'm no expert by any means, but it doesn't seem to make sense to include minority interest in calculating P/B. TD's P/B calculation is including every outstanding share in the company, including Dan Gilberts, not just the float.

So why would you reduce book value by the 94% minority interest, but then use EVERY outstanding share including those owned by the minority interest in the P/B calculation?

Finriz shows a P/B of 4."
2021-05-10 20:33:58,wallstreetbets,No it was 15 days
2021-05-11 17:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Yet. Isn‚Äôt doing that yet. Not my point...point is, use leverage when you can. Seems to be working, just look at the net income on er"
2021-05-11 12:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Ah gotcha. Both are great companies, and while competitors, I think both will continue to thrive. RKT will probably continue to dominate in the consumer space. I believe UWMC will emerge the clear winner in the wholesale space. And these levels, I also believe UWMC is an incredible bargain. RKT looks like it's forming good support levels, but could see more downside for even better entry opportunities. But I'm retarded, so take all this with a grain of tardsalt."
2021-05-10 21:01:06,wallstreetbets,CMScientist dosen't math very well.

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC- Earnings Update, Good news, Shitty news, and why I'm still Bullish Hey Bagholders,

I'm a retard in the same boat as you. Us apes are on a ride to no mans land.

Welcome to the brief up. Now kiss your wife good bye while she goes on a date with her boyfriend.

This is a quick summary (not complete) and my personal opinion. If you like the read and it helped you out then thats great!

**Q1-2021 Earnings Summary & Stuff**

\- Expected EPS 0.46. Actual EPS 0.47 You can view this [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210510005855/en/UWM-Holdings-Corporation-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results)  (Bullish)

\- Revenue - Expected Revenue 1.1B, Actual 860M, as compared to $20.3 million for 1Q20 (Bearish, but still great YoY growth).

\- \~99.5% of the stock is Class D and not publicly traded, total Class D: 1,502,069,787. Class A as of March 2021 is total 103,104,205. The share price of Class A stocks for UWMC has little to no affect on it's continued success. (Crystal ball).

\- Originations of $49.1 billion in loan volume, a 16% increase from the 1Q20 $42.4 billion loan volume (Bullish).

\- Total gain margin of 219 bps in 1Q21 compared to 95 bps in 1Q20 (Bullish).

\- Increased total equity to $2.78 billion at March 31, 2021 as compared to $681.5 million at March 31, 2020 (Bullish).

\- Unpaid principal balance of mortgage servicing rights increased to $221.0 billion in 1Q21 from $85.6 billion in 1Q20 (Bullish).

\- Controls 34% of the broker channel marketshare and growing. (Bullish).

\- Dividend Yield: $0.40/Share per Year or $0.10/Share per Quarter.

\- Extremely Low P/B ratio

\- Heavy Cash Flow (Always a Positive)

\- They announced a 300M buy back. Effective May 11th, 2021 to May 11, 2023. UWMC has complete option to buy back 300M shares between this time frame and all shares purchased will be retired. This is typically done to drive the stalk price up or because a company has a lot of excess cash, for UWMC, I'm assuming its the latter as they are cash flow heavy. (Bullish/Bearish).

Reality, the company has great fundamentals and overall looks like there doing great. Missing the revenue expectation by 300M is the biggest factor going against the company regarding Q2 earnings. Regarding the company itself, only \~5% of the shares are publicly traded. If Class A (the stocks we buy to invest in the company) goes down it'll do little to no affect to UWMC business/revenue/growth in comparison to stocks on the market with a large portion of shares that are publicly traded where it could cripple a company etc.

Regarding the buy backs this can be looked at as both bullish or bearish. Bearish in the sense that if the company does do buy backs any anticipation or catalyst for a Russell Inclusion goes out the window, as the FTSE (Russell) criteria is to have at minimum %5 of a companies share to be publicly traded. On the same hand, the Class A stock has increased short interest, and UWMC can use this to drive the stock price up, force short sellers to cover, but in general regardless of shorts, it's to drive the stock price up, typically, because a company thinks the share value is undervalued or what have you. *Multiple aspects to this one so go ape shit in the comments.*

*Edit: This has been brought to my attention that buy backs where shares are retired (UWMC buy backs) the shares may not impact the public float %, meaning Russell Inclusion would not be a write off as I wrote above. Again, remember do your own research and any smooth brains out there who has more information, comment in the comment section.*

Overall, the decision comes to your own analysis and risk level. Some bag holders that thought this stock would moon in a few weeks or months (Including myself) to cash out quick (Like a lot of stock choices recently), well this is not the case, but still could be who knows. On the flip side, in the next few months I'm still very bullish on the stock and very bullish on the company as a whole. What I liked about this stock when I found out about it a while ago was its business model, growth, success, marketshare, and to me most importantly their proprietary system/software which allows them to be the fastest mortgage lender to close out loan applications, the mean is 18 days. Fastest in the business. The fact that they have proprietary systems in place to me also adds more value to the core business and overall success. Last but not least, I'm pretty sure they handled the 2008-2009 mortgage crisis very well, so as a company I'm very confident as they've proven the test of time.

At the end of the day, this write up is my personal opinion with facts from the Q2 Earnings report. You could be bullish or bearish on this company, and thats for you to decide. This post was just to try and help out as we're currently in a bearish market today and earnings just came out.

I'm holding onto all of my shares, I only sold 100 shares I bought on margin 2 days ago to avoid bag holding on margin (And possibly buy cheaper if it dips tomorrow). All my other shares I'm holding. I'm personally still very bullish on the company but thats my personal opinion, yours is for you to make.

I'm not a financial advisor etc etc. Wish you all many tendies and success!"
2021-05-10 23:20:01,wallstreetbets,No Tl;DR ... Or positions man. I have 32 $5 calls and 200shares of this company bullish as all hell this should trade at $10-$14 minimum. Everyday I look at this stock I‚Äôm just baffled.
2021-05-11 05:17:20,wallstreetbets,"You guys realize the share-price, and the public float means that the 100-110 million shares of public float times the share price comes to 660-726 million dollars if the share-price is 6.6. Which means, all else being equal, if the share price remained neutral that means they could buy up 41.3 to 45 of the Class A float. You know, the shares on the market.

Considering the dividend yield is almost 6.2% at 6.47, and they have 1.5 Billion in Senior Notes (800 million was issued on April 16 so it doesn't show on the balance sheet for this quarter) with a 5.5% dividend yield it makes perfect sense to do a share buy back as opposed to an early redemption of notes and they get more bang for buck. Furthermore, they get a Earnings Per Share Boost by doing this. This helps the top and the bottom line in short. This also boosts the mortgage servicing income, as well as the interest income they receive, tallies more than the dividend yield and the interest income on the 1.5B notes I'm bullish on their ability to sustain the dividend.

The Earnings Report was a decidedly mixed bag, and there's no two ways about it. Here are some of my thoughts that are additional:

1. The 49.1B in origination was a whiff, as they guided for 52-57B in originations. Gain on sale fell right in the middle-ish which was fine. I was right to guide for a little less or roughly 1B in net income, and if the salaries, commissions, and benefits hadn't increased exponentially 123,624 million they would have met right around 1B at 983,624,000.
2. I like they are guiding up as opposed to everyone else for Q2, and considering their miss for Q1 I feel they may even be being conservative so as to not disappoint again. One thing I didn't like was that their gain on sale margin was expected to be .75%-1.1% for Q2, but one part of that may be that they have an in-house jumbo program where they retain servicing which might compress margin. With that said, there is definitely a pricing war going on, and as the CEO of LDI said we don't know when that'll end but as he stated no one likes to sell something for ninety cents on the dollar, and we can expect higher margins when the pricing war cools. Please note RKT's wholesale margin is expected to be 1%.
3. I like that they are investing in "" Continued investment into machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to further advance our operational excellence while driving down costs."" Margin expansion is key, especially since they already have a margin advantage.
4. I like that they have ""Continued to invest in our technology platform and on-site teams resulting in additional operational efficiencies focused on reducing costs, reducing closing times, and increasing loan processing speed"" since, again, margin advantage. I also like reduced closing and loan processing speeds.
5. I like that:  ""Our continued investments in the cloud, as well as technologies that increase Underwriting efficiency, such as Automated Document Recognition and Optical Character Recognition, have strengthened our technology advantage while driving greater efficiency, and reducing both fixed and variable costs."" Ditto with everything else.
6. Their jumbo and government portion of both refinance and purchase are extremely low relative to Q1 2020 because they only turned the spigot back on them the latter part of March. This is probably why it's so low, and why they are guiding up. Remember the gain on sale margin for government loans are smaller than conventional though so that might help explain some of the margin compression. This should also help them Q3 and Q4.
7. The seasonally adjusted annual homebuilding rate is at over 1.7 million home as April. There is a 4 million home backlog, and to keep up with demand home builders need to build 1.2 million homes a year. It needs to be more than 1.2 million to start reducing the backlog.
8. RKT's share price was roughly 20 dollars when it announced its 1 billion dollar buyback and had a market cap of 40 billion at the time. UWMC's market cap is roughly 10.8B. So it's market cap is exactly 27% what RKT's was at the time of the buyback. But the share buyback is 30% of RKT's. So there is more bang for buck. Additionally, there was a 1.1B special dividend of 1.1B which equated to roughly 5.5% at 20 dollars. The current annual yield on UWMC is over 6%. What's more, doing share buyback will increase EPS, net income, cash flow, and the balance sheet as opposed to RKT where it will only help EPS. Therefore, there is strong upside to be had at this price point.
9. I like that their highest expense (employees) is variable and stands at above 2/3rds of their expenses since it's easy to downsize in times of hardship, or they can choose to maintain staffing levels but not replace people to leave for a natural deceleration of income.
10. I'm revising my expectations of 2-2.5 Billion dollars a year in net income to roughly 1.5-2.25 Billion, and I am being very conservative on the low end. I am calculating roughly 500 million in net income for Q2 2021 to be somewhat conservative. The way I am coming to that conclusion is by calculating a 49.1B origination for Q2 even though they are guiding for 51-55B (and considering the embarrassment of the whiff, and the new products they have on offer to increase capacity, I believe them to be conservative). I am also assuming a 75 basis point margin on gain on sale which is a touch more than 34% of the margin for Q1 2021. Under these presumptions  they would be making 368,035,000 in loan production income. I am going to flat out live in delusion land and assume that Mortgage Servicing Income remains the same at 115,205,000 after accounting for the fact that mortgage servicing income minus change in fair value, plus gain on sale, and interest income equals that. That totals revenue of 483,240,000. I am going to assume the absolute worst and assume that they don't compress their expenses whatsoever and so their expenses will tally  317,000,000. Thus their net income will be 166,240,000.

I won't place the income tax because:  ""UWMC's net income for periods prior to the first quarter of 2021 does not reflect an income tax provision, since UWM (UWMC's accounting predecessor) is a pass-through entity not subject to federal and most state income taxes. For periods commencing with the first quarter of 2021, UWMC's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by UWMC. Therefore, for comparison purposes, UWMC provides ‚ÄúAdjusted net income‚Äù, which is our pre-tax income adjusted for a 23.78% estimated effective tax rate. ‚ÄúAdjusted net income‚Äù is a Non-GAAP Metric.""

If one looks at the net income attributable to UWMC on the cash flow statement and then divides by the provision for income taxes, then that is an effective tax rate of 26.8% for roughly 5.7% of the float which is roughly the 6 percent of free float. What I am trying to say is that we only pay net income on the 6% of free float that is the Class A public float. The adjusted net income would be if the entirety of the company was taxed, which it isn't, so disregard adjusted net income as it's not GAAP. We'll assume a 25 percent haircut to income tax as a result (though it would be a higher haircut, I'm just lazy) which would give taxes of 9,664.

After accounting for federal and state taxes, the new net income would be 166,230,336. Net income and thus EPS is pre dividend income, but let's count the dividend before EPS and count it as part of net income for a truly catastrophic scenario. So, let's assume no share buybacks occurred (worst case scenario), we'd then remove 10,310,420.5 (.10\* 103,104,205). The new net income after accounting for dividends is 155,919,916. Please note that in accounting you don't calculate the net income by putting the dividend as a expense. I'm just doing this to give you guys an absolute shit tier scenario with revenue misses, no mortgage servicing rights increases and thus no mortgage servicing income and interest increases, no margin gain, expenses that do not decrease, a bit more tax than they'd actually pay, no shares bought back, and dividends as an expense and thus weigh down on net income and thus EPS. I did not count the interest expense on the new 700 million senior notes however. But it should come to roughly 31 million.

The EPS would be .097, so round it to ten cents. Account for the same EPS for Q3 and Q4. You get 30 cents. This is 30 cents without the dividend payout ratio since the dividend is already accounted for. We'll not include Q1. The dividend of 40 cents alone will net you a p/e ratio of 16.175. The actual EPS for you as a class A shareholder would be 70 cents for the period Q2 to Q4. That would translate to a P/E ratio of 9.24. If you count the EPS of Q1 (which is Earnings per share of .47) then the FY 2021 EPS would be .70 and the P/E ratio would be 8.64. But if you count the dividend of .40 in addition to the EPS then it becomes 1.17 and the P/E ratio becomes 5.52. The only reason I count the dividend is because the dividend payout ratio is literally .006 (.10\*.06=.006) per quarter. However, you're still getting ten cents a quarter on a stock that is 6.47 while retaining your economic interest in the company itself which is adding roughly 77 cents in EPS FY 2021 under a catastrophic failure of epic proportions scenario."

2021-05-11 02:09:57,wallstreetbets,"To anyone thinking of buying, it's a fantastic buy at this price (6% dividend) but a poor bet for options - the dividend rate is the main selling point and you don't get that with options.

Two possible sources for  market sell-off that spot gamma mentioned.

1. Fed's Kaplan: It would be beneficial to begin talking about tapering sooner rather than later as we approach substantial further progress.
2. Pentagon Spokesman: Earlier today the US Coast Guard Cutter Maui fired 30 warning shots from a 50 caliber machine gun after a group of 13 Iranian Navy fast boats conducted unsafe and unprofessional maneuvers while operating close to a US naval formation in the Strait of Hormuz.

Here I would like to first summarize 2 important news with sources  then on the latest part of my post summarize my imho : 


1- What‚Äôs happening silver in lbma ? 

In early April, LBMA claimed that total silver held in LBMA London vaults had risen by a massive 11% during March from 1.125 bn ozs (34,996 tonnes) to 1.249 bn ozs (38,859 tonnes). This, it turns out, was not true, as the real end of March figure was 1.143 bn (35,557 tonnes).

Please you see the source as follow; https://www.lbma.org.uk/prices-and-data/london-vault-holdings-data

Important part of the statement ; 
We publish vault holdings data as part of our continued efforts to improve transparency in the Loco London Precious Metals Market, which also includes reporting weekly LBMA Trade Data. The statistics below include the holdings of the London commercial vaults as well as the Bank of England‚Äôs gold holdings (the Bank does not hold any silver).
Latest Gold and Stocks in London Vaults
A data submission error led to the publication of an incorrect aggregate figure for the total silver held in London vaults in March. The corrected figure is 1,143,194 Troy ounces ('000s). 

2- what‚Äôs happening in physical market ; 


A global shortage of physical gold and silver products has created a premium on coins and bars, and this premium is causing a disconnect between the spot price and the ""true"" price that retail investors need to pay, said Ed Moy, former director of the U.S. Mint.

Premiums on these physical gold and silver products can run as high as 20% in some places, Moy said.

One of the main reasons for why the spot prices have not caught up to gold and silver's premium-adjusted price is that the overall markets are flooded with bullion derivatives, Moy said, but it's only a matter of time before the short contracts keeping the price down expire.

there is really fundamentally big changes in silver market . 


THE INVESTMENT OF THE DECADE

The silver market is one of the most toxic of all. Heavily manipulated and with bullion banks now being  700million oz of silver short on Comex and with no liquidity in London, as Alasdair Macleod has pointed out.

Still, even if not in the next week or two, silver will win this game in the medium and long term as the dosage of paper silver shorts is much too big to survive a short squeeze.

I would not be surprised to see the 1980 and 2011 $50 high to be taken out in 2021.( my imho ) 

( not financial advice I am just ape like you )"
2021-05-10 21:52:43,wallstreetbets,"Um, if you look at precious metals theyve been going up steadily over the past couple years. Couple that with bubble/inflation fear, and of course theyre going to go up. Low and slow. Wrong sub. Bad bot"

2021-05-10 21:59:02,wallstreetbets,"I want to know where the author is seeing physical gold and silver for 20% over spot. I bought a five peso gold piece from my usual shop for 25% premium a few weeks ago, they wanted like 30% on their 1/10 oz AGEs. 

I'll probably scoop up more PSLV tomorrow, it's already one of my biggest positions."
2021-05-10 23:38:22,wallstreetbets,Things should get interesting going forward - especially for July Delivery month.
2021-05-11 08:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Jim Rogers in his recent interviews answered silver when asked what  investment he would advise. I think he‚Äôs right on the money. 

From 1976 to 1980 the price of gold per ounce increased eight-fold. This was after US closed the convertibly of dollar to gold in 1971 and whole world currencies no longer backed by gold. 

And from 1999 to 2011 the price of gold increased eight-fold beginning from Allan Greenspan easing of interest rates and started easy monetary policies culminated in QEs after the GFC. 

After all the QEs and unprecedented increase in money supply in 2020, the price of gold is expected to increase at least eight-fold, from a low of $1,250 in 2015 to $8,000 in 2022 or beyond. 

This would be the third gold bull run in history and when gold skyrocket, silver will follow. Silver would be a good asymmetrical risk reward investment and precious metal mining stock a great leverage play. 

This is not a financial advice. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please do your own due diligence. Cheers!"

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASO UPDATE: Board Member Change after KKR Closes all of it's 14M shares There have been a lot of great DD post on here. A of lot people have already been following this so I'm not going to repeat any of the information that has already been said. Just updates on recent news.

Recently it was announced that the company would have a secondary offering after Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (KKR) announced they would be selling their 14M share position. With this announcement, ASO announced they would be doing a buy back of 100M worth of shares to help off set this.

May 3rd - KKR Secondary Offering Announcement: [https://investors.academy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-secondary-offering-common-0](https://investors.academy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/academy-sports-outdoors-announces-secondary-offering-common-0)

$ASO stock price opened around $30.87 on May 4th, the day after this was announced, leaving current holders to believe there would be a dip from the sell off. However, it has continue to climb since then reaching as high as $36.60 and was above $35 today before closing at $33.30, where +800K shares (+26.64M) were bought right after the closing bell. This was most likely KKR last shares as shortly after closing ASO released the following statement on their website about changes to their board where the following below was said.

""Academy also announced today that Vishal V. Patel and Aileen X. Yan, both designees of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (""KKR""), have resigned from the Board, effective immediately, **following a reduction in KKR's holdings in Academy through a secondary public offering that** **closed today.** ""

&#x200B;

Now with all of KKR shares sold there is nothing stopping this stock from continuing to run up! NASDAQ releases their Short Interest Publication tomorrow at 4pm on settlements from 4/30/2021. Thsi will be something to keep an eye on with the high short float ASO has already had to see if any of the shorts have started to close their position. You would think that they would of cut their losses with KKR 14M unload but if they didn't then these hedges are screwed. We won't know for sure on this though until 5/25/2021 when NASDAQ releases their short interest up through 5/14/2021.

Nasdaq Short Interest Publication Schedule: [http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=shortintpubsch)

Markets that inflate to their all time high in a short period of time usually continue inflating that way, especially when the host nation's economic policies include inflating its currency. Companies will very easily meet expectations by showing strong earnings relative to the Dow's ATH position. ""Reopening"" is going to happen soon and definitely hasn't happened yet, and this will make the Dow reach a new ATH. That's why even massive liberal cities who are strict on Covid rules like Los Angeles and Chicago are still in a lull and haven't returned to their usual bustle, they're all waiting for the reopening.

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 4 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! This week is a little janky because a whole boatload of *new* companies are reporting, so we don't actually have comprehensive historical data for them. Instead of the standard 25 datapoints, we've got closer to half that, and in some cases, even less. Trade carefully everyone! I've omitted Monday AM and Friday AM reporters due to there being no relevant companies reporting on the given days.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14TOO6S_W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh_Fl-pN3dxsREv0/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14TOO6S_W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh_Fl-pN3dxsREv0/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **First and foremost, expect extra volatility this week**. Many of the companies who report this week are *young*, and as a result tend to swing heavily after earnings as the market tries to price in their ""true"" values. Expect some big swings coming out of the newer companies.

- **Be wary of second-time reporters, such as Opendoor, QuantumScape, Upstart, Poshmark etc.** Having only reported earnings once before, we can't necessarily make any reliable predictions on these tickers, so it may be best to avoid them all together. The IV is cranked, and even though the moves have the potential to be massive, the risk just isn't worth it.

- **Lots of heavy movers report this week**. Some notable names include Magnite, Novavax, Canada Goose, Vroom, and Sonos. Expect some insane post earnings moves, and high volatility if you plan on playing these tickers. It's tough to tell which way either of these tickers will go, but according to the historical data, at +10% move isn't uncommon. 

- **Similar to PENN and DKNG last week, we can make a similar play with VLDR and LAZR this week.** VLDRs report before LAZR, and as a result we can use VLDR's price action to gage the expected movement of LAZR when it reports Thursday after hours. Keep in mind, this method can be used to predict the direction the price will go, but *not* the magnitude.

- **Don't be afraid to play tickers who have never reported earnings before!** Some names include household favorite's **UWMC, PSFE, RBLX, and COIN**. All of these tickers report earnings for the very first time since going public this quarter, so if you're looking to roll the dice on some newly minted tickers, this is your opportunity. Each company has some fun catalysts in the pipeline, so you've got a good chance to bag some gains should you choose to do so.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

&nbsp;

# Conclusion

We‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14TOO6S_W36JOHoFFyqXobooLt7YTh_Fl-pN3dxsREv0/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

2021-05-10 22:03:26,wallstreetbets,-100%. Still green. Still good. Keep going retard
2021-05-10 22:18:02,wallstreetbets,"When you are still on robinthehood but complaining about their shady platform and business practices.

In other words

 Congrats. And fuck you."
2021-05-10 22:33:52,wallstreetbets,Talk to me once you get off RH man if you dont learn from all the shit they‚Äôve done already when will you?
2021-05-10 22:36:06,wallstreetbets,"If you're still getting cucked by RH, it's your own fault."
2021-05-10 22:50:21,wallstreetbets,You retards continue to use that shit app. How many times do we have to teach you old man?
2021-05-10 22:58:49,wallstreetbets,Maybe once you learn to take a screen shot then they‚Äôll let you
2021-05-10 22:59:49,wallstreetbets,And that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt use that shitty app.
2021-05-10 23:03:25,wallstreetbets,"IF you're still using RH at this point, you're the one to blame tbh"
2021-05-10 23:21:58,wallstreetbets,If you're still using RH; you might be the wrong kind of retarded.
2021-05-11 00:03:12,wallstreetbets,Why are you still with that dogshit firm?

2021-05-11 00:45:42,wallstreetbets,Ummmm... why are you using Robinhood? I think that‚Äôs the biggest loss here.
2021-05-11 00:50:55,wallstreetbets,Stop using RH‚Ä¶
2021-05-11 00:59:36,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha
2021-05-11 01:05:19,wallstreetbets,"my favorite is ""we will execute this trade at opening tomorrow due to extreme aftermarket volatility due to low trading volume"" Like yeah no shit that's why I'm trying to trade it when it goes up quickly in aftermarket..."

2021-05-11 02:08:40,wallstreetbets,"At this point, if you're in Robinhood - you get no sympathy. It's just a *bad choice*. At this point it's like giving your money to the Mafia and complaining they don't play fair."
2021-05-11 02:23:11,wallstreetbets,Gotta get up out the ‚Äòhood man
2021-05-11 02:41:42,wallstreetbets,People still using RH baffles me.

2021-05-11 02:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Why are you still using RH, exactly?"
2021-05-11 03:05:50,wallstreetbets,That's what you get for STILL being in RobbingdaHood. It take 2-3 days to get out. Just leave
2021-05-11 03:08:58,wallstreetbets,Is it safe to talk out against the subs evil overlord Vlad and his army Robinhood yet?
2021-05-11 03:09:22,wallstreetbets,wait did you sell or buy the spreads.. is this an Iron Condor or Butterfly?
2021-05-11 03:24:25,wallstreetbets,Your fault for still being with RH
2021-05-11 03:25:46,wallstreetbets,Should of read the terms and conditions. Imagine putting near $16k into something without reading terms and conditions.
2021-05-11 03:43:44,wallstreetbets,Are some of you guys rich but still wanna hang with us sad saps?
2021-05-11 04:02:03,wallstreetbets,pls just use another broker. There are so many good borkers around... RH is shit
2021-05-11 04:21:39,wallstreetbets,I guess you cant sell an IOU
2021-05-11 04:32:08,wallstreetbets,Better not leave for Friday close the position.

2021-05-11 05:23:26,wallstreetbets,"i dont understand why people trade on that platform, you are just begging to get robbed by these white collar criminals.

2021-05-11 06:24:37,wallstreetbets,Took me a minute trying to figure out how you have a bokeh looking background on Robinhood before I realized it's just a picture of a screen.
2021-05-11 06:41:33,wallstreetbets,"Good job, dumbass! You played yourself."
2021-05-11 07:05:57,wallstreetbets,Why tf are people still on rh??
2021-05-11 07:11:43,wallstreetbets,Imagine trading boomer stocks with this many restrictions jesus.
2021-05-11 07:11:51,wallstreetbets,Stop trying to trade when it‚Äôs going parabolic or crashing!  Damn you rookies have no idea what kind of crazy ass volume RH and other brokers are dealing with! All these tiny retail traders all at once think they are going to get good prices!
2021-05-11 07:13:04,wallstreetbets,I'm just gonna say it. That's your own fault for trusting RobinHood. They have done nothing but prove their malicious intent over the last half year. You have had ample opportunity to switch brokers
2021-05-11 07:13:54,wallstreetbets,"Well if you have learned nothing and are still using robinhood its kinda your own fault....  
Its not a matter if they are gonna fuck you over its a matter of when.

U know, fool me once shame on you etc etc..."
2021-05-11 07:14:09,wallstreetbets,All I see is a retard.
2021-05-11 07:24:36,wallstreetbets,Why are you still on RH?
2021-05-11 07:43:22,wallstreetbets,Sad to say I don't feel sorry for you. Should've learned by now to transfer over to an actual broker
2021-05-11 07:48:23,wallstreetbets,You honestly deserve it.Why the fuck are you still with robinhood? were the 100 prior warnings not enough
2021-05-11 08:07:53,wallstreetbets,Ahahahahahahahahaha. No pity. Probably thought RH wouldn‚Äôt screw you over did ya

2021-05-11 14:23:35,wallstreetbets,You were selling close to ITM iron condors...even if they were bought at separate times you collateralized both legs in the same wad of cash. Meaning you probably over leveraged if you paid for the second legs with premium from the first set. When selling spread y'all gotta keep some cash on hand to close these babies
2021-05-11 14:45:08,wallstreetbets,pleas fly again
2021-05-10 23:44:37,wallstreetbets,I don't do trading like this. I trade when I believe in a company to do a good service and if I respect their business and moral practices. If I lose money on it it means I paid for a dream that was better than other's greed.
2021-05-10 21:32:39,wallstreetbets,Dude you needed to close that position or execution will kill you with hundreds of thousands needed to close that position. Because now the short puts will be executed upon
2021-05-11 02:33:09,wallstreetbets,You deserve it for staying with RH ü§£ü§£
2021-05-11 02:44:11,wallstreetbets,I honestly feel no empathy for you. You know that RH is a shit broker after all what happened and still you are a lazy fuck and decide to stay with them. Totally on you mate.
2021-05-11 04:44:40,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt get fooled again

He had PR people confusing the shit out of him saying to cut that out of his speech because it would produce the quote out of context ""shame on me"". and they didn't want that used over and over again by the media.

2021-05-10 20:12:57,wallstreetbets,You seem like you just learned about trading spreads. The call spreads dont matter in this situation. They were in the money. They werent the reason you couldnt close your put credit spreads. You simply didnt have the cash required to close your put credit spread. My guess is you put your whole pot into those spreads leaving no extra cash to close. If you're way in the red like you were It takes more money to close a spread than the collateral you put up. Just becareful dude. When i learned about credit spreads i was like you.  I made 30 thousand in 2 months selling spreads not realizing how over leveraged and retarded i was being. Then i paid for it. Spreads will fuck you hard and fast if you aren't careful.

2021-05-10 20:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. No need to liquidate first. Just start the transfer from the new broker, then you don't even have to deal with RH or their non-existent customer service. With Fidelity it took me 3 business days, took my wife 5 with a recently cleared transaction. 

This is bad advice."
2021-05-11 03:09:21,wallstreetbets,"I moved from Rh to TD. Took 3 days. 

As a note, the cost basis never came through but i gave TD my statement so they could manually update it. Not positive if this week be reflected in my tax form or what. I've had issues in the past where cost basis doesn't come through so on paper it looks like 100% of it is gains. Something to keep in mind"

No need to liquidate anything -- a bad idea to do so, it becomes a taxable event if you have any gains when liquidating."

2021-05-10 22:13:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't think so. I'd just open a new account with a different broker (like Fidelity or Vanguard) and request a transfer.

This doesn't trigger a sale of assets (other than fractional shares, which don't get process in transfers to my knowledge) and this will prevent you from triggering taxes on sales of assets too.

Also I'm not sure how fast you'd get your money if you sold your assets, requested a transfer to your bank and then you'd send that money to your new broker.

I would just avoid RH customer service as much as possible. Fidelity has been great in my experience."
2021-05-10 22:53:36,wallstreetbets,"fractional shares will get sold off and not transferred, assuming you hold any."
2021-05-10 21:10:03,wallstreetbets,How is this not bad advice then?
2021-05-10 20:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Well the opening positions were on my Robinhood 1099 and the closing positions were on my TDA 1099. So like cost basis, wash sale, etc isn't automatically tracked. Pain in the ass.

2021-05-11 18:33:12,wallstreetbets,"How do you trade with vanguard? I have my 401k through them and wanted to do some stocks outside of that through them too, but it's not as intuitive as RH, or fidelity and the like, for someone that's new to the market"
2021-05-10 21:48:34,wallstreetbets,"I think I misunderstood both OP and you, so I‚Äôll just say, best to withdraw any cash just sitting there and then transfer everything else."
2021-05-11 17:46:43,wallstreetbets,"It's your right, Mr president"
2021-05-10 22:25:02,wallstreetbets,"If you're already familiar with Fidelity you're good to go. I didn't even have to talk to customer service.


 My wife did, due to having a recent transaction that cleared the day of the request.

Came to find out RH cancelled the transfer request immediately, so if it takes longer than 3ish business days, I would talk to Fidelity."
2021-05-11 17:48:36,wallstreetbets,"I only have my 401k on Fidelity, It was a little overwhelming but once I got figured out where to go on the virtual assistant it was super easy.  Fidelity is definitely going to be a learning curb compared to Robinhood.  It'll be worth it to get away from those crooks though."

2021-05-11 00:06:51,wallstreetbets,I downloaded the game as DD. Don‚Äôt understand the hype. Not a believer. I had my 7 year old play around with it. She thought it was terrible. The single most overvalued stock I‚Äôve ever seen.
2021-05-10 23:39:24,wallstreetbets,What price did you buy at
2021-05-11 00:44:10,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-11 00:12:19,wallstreetbets,Have you actually downloaded and played this? I spent an hour with this heap of filth. Couldn‚Äôt uninstall quick enough. An overly complicated broken game that begs for money more often than a free to play mobile game. My seven year old had zero interest after 30 seconds... I‚Äôm trying to comprehend any genuine optimism. Best to luck for all the holders and buyers!
2021-05-11 00:49:42,wallstreetbets,Several of them. Figure that‚Äôs enough to get an idea. Each a total waste of time and effort. I guess I could‚Äôve continued endlessly combing through trash in hopes of finding something mildly redeemable. Sounds like you enjoy the game. Best of luck on your trades!
2021-05-11 12:29:42,wallstreetbets,My 7yo figured it out easily and loves it - as do most of his friends.  YMMV

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,UWM Holdings Corporation Announces First Quarter 2021 Results 
2021-05-10 20:57:26,wallstreetbets,It's guy a 85% buy rating on robinhood... Can't trust it
2021-05-10 20:59:16,wallstreetbets,That's the spirit.
2021-05-11 00:16:26,wallstreetbets,Ahh man that was amazing bro ... I‚Äôm currently 19k in the red on this bitch. Reading your poem made me feel better. Thanks bro !!
2021-05-10 21:33:53,wallstreetbets,"thats not what it means. It means the margin GAIN YOY for next quarter will be 75-110bps. 


That means the margin will increase from Q2 2020 to Q2 2021 by 75-110 bps. 


Considering the fact that Q2 margin last year was 60%+ while Q1 margin last year was ~40% this means overal much more profit next quarter."
2021-05-10 20:50:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes corrected, I meant to say outstanding. The outstanding reduction is what‚Äôs going to reduce the market cap (which we want) I‚Äôm curious tho what will happen with a 44% reduction of the float."
2021-05-10 20:47:53,wallstreetbets,"I agree, they valued UWMC at 9.5X 2021 net income estimates. Well their net income has over doubled estimates it‚Äôs just being valued at like 4X now instead of 9.5 ... it should be illegal."
2021-05-10 20:44:12,wallstreetbets,"That is amazing ! 5% reduction in outstanding shares, that‚Äôs what will change the market cap, let‚Äôs see how this plays out."
2021-05-10 20:49:18,wallstreetbets,This is one of the few what are trading at an insanely cheap price tho. All these ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù stocks are trading over 20X sales with no earnings. UWMC is trading at like 4X earnings with a 6% dividend.
2021-05-11 09:03:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the buyback is pretty clearly a reach. They only announced it to try to drive up the price and because RKT did the same thing. It's for the same amount too ironically (when accounted for company valuations, I understand that it's not the same amount of cash). The same way they announced the special dividend after RKT did. The only realistic way they could do the buyback and still make the ETF lists is to convert some of the CEO's shares and immediately buy those back, but that's not going to happen at this price. Why would he take a haircut if he thinks the price will rise.

I love UWMC at this price and I'm definitely going to add to my position this week and hold long term."
2021-05-11 11:09:12,wallstreetbets,"no, margin gain is the gain you realize from offloading an originated mortgage. Revenues are gain on sale times volume, roughly."
2021-05-10 22:07:14,wallstreetbets,"It's just one parameter of valuation and depends on the sector and growth prospects. For instance, $ANTM has a Price/Book value of only 0.79, for $T it's 1.33, for $TSLA it's 17.76, for $MSFT it's 11.92, for $ABT it's 5.65, for $MMM it's 3.56, for $BA it's 2.37 and so on. Now it's a strange time because some stocks with good prospects are suffering due to the selling off a lot of stocks that went through unsustainable meteoric rise in 2020. People who started investing this year are having difficult time and a lot of them are in red."
2021-05-10 20:26:16,wallstreetbets,"I'm waiting for the contrarian trade to emerge. There's still too many sellers who haven't sold yet.

When it looks like a massacre is about to happen in the housing market, I'll buy as much as I can.

Think Oil last year. Was the trade of the decade when it was hitting negative numbers.

Something about investing your money where it's needed most. I don't know about that kind of thing tho. Sounds like gobble de gook to me."
2021-05-10 21:22:24,wallstreetbets,"I make a new bed of leaves every night. If you take the bananas for your bed made from trees, how many bananas will you need to spend for a new tree bed? ü¶ß üçå"

2021-05-10 22:54:14,wallstreetbets,Yup. Paper hands. There are too many inexperienced traders right now. They saw a crazy strong year and now it is getting dicey so they panic.
2021-05-10 21:11:26,wallstreetbets,"It's what he did. He invested in BAC and other banks. He is also not too loaded on tech, except for AAPL."
2021-05-10 21:06:41,wallstreetbets,You like throwing your money in a perpetual drain?
2021-05-10 21:34:27,wallstreetbets,"Ignorant AF. 

Old man who's amassed billions with his skills is a dinosaur so fuck him? You don't think he knows what he's doing? That he has wisdom? Vast experience? He's lived financial history - does he have any tips on how to weather the financial storm across decades, nations and multiple markets? No, right? 

This man is filled with skills that helped him to become a fucking billionaire. Don't be dismissive like a child - learn from someone like that.

But forget what he has to say. You seem to know what your doing."
2021-05-10 21:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Right? The fucking balls on these twats. That dude has given away more money in a few years than most of us ever hope to earn in 10 lifetimes. 

It's all about the basics."

2021-05-11 15:27:13,wallstreetbets,Personal Injury lawyers (the worst ambulance chasers) are now chasing ambulances with their shorts down to their knees & trying to put it to HL and AG. Take a look at those stonks now today & see how that‚Äôs working out. HL & AG to the moon & they will dance to a tune faster than inflation.

You sat on the couch and folded laundry with your wife, while she binged another television show with too many seasons. As she chuckles to herself, you do, as well, with the genuineness of a laugh track.

It looks like there may be a way to come out in the black and get back at them, but there is some risk involved and I can't decide if it's worth it to take the chance.

Basically, I've got reason to believe that my bosses will get an early peak at the agriculture report for oranges. I suspect they may try to corner the FCOJ market. I also think that it will be possible for me to intercept the report, feed them false information, and make the appropriate play.

And yet despite looking at the puts chain gaining  almost every day for the past few months, I can't  buy any. I feel trapped. I keep thinking I'll buy puts or sell my shares at the bottom. 

And now I noticed baba, which is the other half of my port in leaps, broke a long running support today. I am completely fucked.

Back in summer while I was noticing the euphoria, I was cautious and told myself I'd never buy the top or get caught in a bubble pop. But the top kept going higher and higher and although I did make some money off of that, I think I also got conditioned to think that every dip is temporary and gets bought. Probably the worst thing though is that I wanted to cut my losses when i was down only 20% because I felt like the party was over. But I chose not to. This conditioning and the screams of cultists all over 'investing' subs encouraged me to keep holding against my own self interest. Now I ran out of cash to keep buying the dip. 

TLDR: puts on my fucking financial independence."

No one wants to be holding the bags when the bubble does pop so institutions are on edge,  but I don't see this being the actual time.

I'm approaching a year since I lost 30k on robinhood. And I don't even care about the money because I know it wouldn't have changed anything. 

Nothing in life brings me joy. I have no friends, hobbies, or interests. I am 50k in debt to a worthless teaching degree, and there is simply no way of crawling out of this hole. 

I watch others and it just seems so easy for them to smile. To laugh. I envy them.

You have been taken astray by your greed and hubris. You have sinned against Cramer and against Buffet playing FDs on overvalued meme stonks. Fear not, it is not too late to repent and see your accounts green.

Liquidate all your wretched positions now and buy BRK.B or see your portfolios turned to ash while you help the theta gang buy a new clubhouse. Your bags are baggage on your net worth and on your souls. They look heavy, brother. Unload them so that there might be room for the tendies the Oracle of Omaha (PBUH) will bestow upon ye.

Mine gains are modest, but they are mine to keep. Witness the 1 month chart and the 1 year chart and the all time chart! Witness the steadiness with which the house of Berkshire Hathaway takes its gains! In these trying times to come, seek refuge from the storm in Warren Buffet's warm bosom. The good Oracle saw fit to bless me with tendies on this day. What have your false gods done for you lately? What has SPY done for you? Or PLTR or AMD? What of RKT and AMC and MVIS?

You remember a friend telling you that rate * time is equal to the total amount of dicks you will have to suck, so you compute 2*10 for a total of 20, but that seems like less dicks than you sucked in the past.

You try multiplying 2x8 and that is even worse than the first guess.

Finally, you break it down in your head the old fashioned way, and figure there is 6 ten minute blocks in an hour and multiplied by 8 that equals 48 ten minute blocks. Since you are able to suck 2 dicks every ten minutes, you multiply 48 by two, for a total of 96 dicks for the day.

You are upset and aggravated it took you so long to figure this out, and you almost were not able to keep your rate of 2 dicks every ten minutes.

You just wish there was an easier way to solve this and that your friend would have more care when blurting out formulas like rate*time = total amount of dicks you will suck."

For the last month I‚Äôve been buying SPY, DIA, QQQ POOOOTS.  And for the last month I‚Äôve been losing & bleeding out. Moving the puts around (strike prices and expirations). Last Friday was awful but quadrupled down and stuck to it (had accrued over $30K in loses) 

Monday morning I see futures up and said fuck here we go again... BUT THEN it gradually started go change and my ARMY OF POOOTS started to rage. 

I know it was a rough day for most of you and will most likely be also be a horrible day / week as well.   

HOWEVER it‚Äôs a thing of beauty when you see over 150 PUTS of all ages, strikes, colors, backgrounds working in unison. My largest battalion is lead by the 52 Comandos of 05-21 SPY $420 PUTS Unit and holly shit once the markets started to drop there was nothing that could stop them.

Third, software as a service is a scummy tactic and you've lost so many early adopters that paid for full self driving and never even saw so much a beta enabled before they got a new car. 10k  down the drain. Set some actual realistic timelines.

Vega is .0625 so if IV goes up to 600 on the 800c like it did in March these will increase in value by 800-200=37.5 and then more if gme goes up with the vol expansion.

Instead of buying puts on spy or calls on vix should buy 800 strike calls on gme cause its the same type of bet (except broader market vol might not transfer to a single stock.)"
2021-05-11 04:20:35,wallstreetbets,"I bought $800 calls in feb for 82$ each and sold them for 4.5k each same month. Been doing this for a long time actually. Buying more calls when market opens. Easy money to be honest.

If GME reaches $800 at expiry, you'd lose 100% of your capital.  

You'd need it to settle at around $813.96 to make about the same amount of money with options as if you bought shares outright.

2021-05-11 13:52:26,wallstreetbets,Up 18% today.
2021-05-10 21:20:25,wallstreetbets,My goal is to divide my holdings by zero when GME moons.
2021-05-11 05:42:32,wallstreetbets,If you divide by zero then they owe you all the money.
2021-05-10 21:24:25,wallstreetbets,What are you expecting to profit on from this?
2021-05-11 04:34:15,wallstreetbets,"lol yea, i mean it is at 10 million subscribers - i think i hear "" the number is once you past 50,000 subscribers the quality of the users goes down dramatically  ""  üòÇ"
2021-05-11 04:40:28,wallstreetbets,Been doing this for 4 months now haha
2021-05-10 23:08:17,wallstreetbets,"That's not how IV and Theta works. There's no way Theta doesn't eat him alive. 

If GME trades sideways these things bleed like crazy, I wrote calls less than a week ago that are worth almost half what I sold them for and they weren't dumb fucking 800c calls with no Delta to keep them afloat."
2021-05-11 04:34:53,wallstreetbets,You actually get how this works. I bought 4 $300 contracts and cashed out 45k$ in March. I‚Äôm literally just trading on profits now. Options STILL print. Especially if you buy them like OP is. I‚Äôm buying more when market opens. I‚Äôm starting to believe most people here don‚Äôt actually trade stocks at all...
2021-05-11 04:35:47,wallstreetbets,just added up all of my accounts... I currently hold 605 x  July $800 call contracts. We're on this retarded rocket ship together!
2021-05-10 20:48:51,wallstreetbets,"You could be 1M% up and it wouldn‚Äôt make this one play any less idiotic, look DFV bought like 6 bucks OTM with over a year to expiry, you‚Äôre buying 400% with just a couple months, if you want to burn money send it to me, I‚Äôll burn it better than you ever could"
2021-05-10 21:41:07,wallstreetbets,I'd be happy for more than the two of us if they were ITM but... RIPperoni
2021-05-11 03:40:09,wallstreetbets,I yolod hard and bit the dust recently. So I can sorta understand your pain.
2021-05-11 13:53:38,wallstreetbets,Well be sure to buy actual shares with your return ;)
2021-05-10 21:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Well if you believe the squeeze is happening due to the vote then this is a sound bet... if you think the stock holders voter stock recall won't do anything then yes this is stupid. 

4 weeks ago i bit $800 strike, 2 weeks ago sold for 50% profit.  It doesn't need to hit the strike rather closer to the strike to become more profitable"
2021-05-10 21:21:50,wallstreetbets,But they'd have hope for more than two months. You can choose to take the side of either Red on Andy Duphrense on whether hope is a good or bad thing (see Shawshank Redemption if you don't know)

2021-05-11 04:41:17,wallstreetbets,Seriously! Glad to see some real Apes every now and then!
2021-05-11 13:53:31,wallstreetbets,It's much more fun than trading stonks
2021-05-10 22:49:18,wallstreetbets,Rip
2021-05-11 01:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but all you need is a $10-20 bump at open and you make $100. I did it the other day when GME went up to 196 in AH. I saw it when 3m volume at 12pm (and it was already going up) went ""hmm"" and yolo'd most of my available cash on a $215c for like $350 or something. Gamestop opened around 185ish so I sold it off to make $200. 

I would've kicked myself if it leaped after I sold but nope, it became someone else's problem lol"
2021-05-11 00:42:59,wallstreetbets,"what was the expiration date for the contracts you wrote?

OP calls are still far out... but he has only a few weeks before the theta monster starts to eats those alive"
2021-05-11 13:54:57,wallstreetbets,Just did. üôÉ
2021-05-10 22:19:06,wallstreetbets,"Of course you are right. (Down votes coming) but of course the idea of a moonshot here is a meme and low prob. Almost all GME comments are a joke now, so count mine as such. That said, another shot north of 400 seems credible, but impossible to time. If it happens next week, yes these will print. But all signs point to these not printing."
2021-05-10 21:41:09,wallstreetbets,Lmfao 875 target. Fuckin good luck man
2021-05-11 04:56:57,wallstreetbets,"I think most are like me and stopped checking as much around last year or so lol , nice to meet you mister"
2021-05-11 02:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Two things, 

One 10-20 dollar bumps at GME's current price are not super common right now. Yes, GME has a history of breaking out but you guys seem to forget that it's not like a daily/weekly or even biweekly thing anymore.

That 10-20 dollar bump has to happen by like next week for these calls to turn a profit. The longer we trade sideways or down the more dramatic it has to be to counteract the decaying value."
2021-05-11 01:02:50,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs going to get bent over by IV crush either ways, any way you spin this story this was a meathead play"
2021-05-11 02:42:46,wallstreetbets,"June 11th, but mine had a 190 strike, OP is fucked"
2021-05-10 22:24:11,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't have to hit 400 next week for these to print lol, it could hit 180-200 + this will profit üòÇ"
2021-05-10 22:36:29,wallstreetbets,"AMC looks likelier to squeeze.  Short %, borrow fee, borrowed shares drying up, and the new liquidity rules.  But we‚Äôll see."
2021-05-10 21:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but it‚Äôs not a **real** loss until it becomes **real**ized"
2021-05-10 23:36:30,wallstreetbets,Are you saying GME will not squeeze or won't squeeze by July?
2021-05-11 05:07:02,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm down to once a week unless there‚Äôs some stocks being hyped so I can make some quick cash on options. People really underestimate how much you can make buying and selling options here...

Pleasure to meet you too! Time for a quick nap before I buy calls lol"
2021-05-11 03:35:08,wallstreetbets,Please don't assume I'm thinking these are a good play. They are the definition of FDs. I agree that the theta will eat it much too quickly to turn any profit. And in a week it will need a $20-30 bump. I was just giving my anecdote as to how to do this in a less retarded manner.
2021-05-10 22:30:57,wallstreetbets,Theta gang is going to murder you
2021-05-11 04:39:30,wallstreetbets,Y‚Äôall will be fine. Been doing this since February and you made the right calls. A small jump and you will profit. Don‚Äôt be surprised if gme is back to $170+ before you know it ;)
2021-05-10 23:20:15,wallstreetbets,Stop engaging fake accounts. This place is full with those now. It‚Äôs discussing.
2021-05-10 23:50:13,wallstreetbets,"That's retarded, even for here. If you put 100k into gamestop a few weeks ago, you'd have missed out on toooooooons of good opportunities while GME continued its slow death."
2021-05-11 01:01:09,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre delusional if you expect any sort of squeeze or for it to somehow get remotely close to $875. Y‚Äôall gotta get out of this GME saga, there is no squeeze, it happened already, its over. This autist may as well have lit his money on fire.

Keep on downvoting me, doesn‚Äôt make it any less true ü§£"
2021-05-11 05:10:21,wallstreetbets,"üòÇ enjoy it dude ! Yes you literally got 100%+ profit daily opportunities or one +1000% weekly  from what i've gathered lol, i'm actually waiting for break outs to buy calls on GME"
2021-05-10 22:42:11,wallstreetbets,"if you actually look at the option prices since march/april, u can see theta has pretty much sucked them dry over the last month on sideways movement. so if you're gonna die on these options it's because we were wrong about gme making upward movement, not because of theta decay."
2021-05-10 23:50:27,wallstreetbets,Ya totally fake account guy. You're a Ganon cultist
2021-05-11 00:39:16,wallstreetbets,"And if my grandma had wheels, she‚Äôd be a bicycle"

2021-05-10 22:44:28,wallstreetbets,"?

Do you know what Theta is? Even if gme makes upward movements, I doubt the delta is high enough on 800c to counteract theta decay"

2021-05-10 22:48:00,wallstreetbets,you're not accounting for IV. look at today the stock dropped 11% but 800c only fell 12%.
2021-05-10 22:52:56,wallstreetbets,"Actually stuff this 

Go check the delta and theta of your options and get back to me on it

But basically, you're gambling on an IV spike"

2021-05-10 21:06:00,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight 20/20.

Never play IPOs, Never play earnings, Never play newer tech stocks with less than 1 year and/or hasn't dipped under IPO price for at least once. Price dropping below IPO price baptizes tech stocks. Remember that. I am going to say this again, **Price dropping below IPO price baptizes tech stocks**!!!

Look at SNOW, UBER, LYFT, BMBL etc and soon to be LMND and ABNB. PLTR is surely gonna dip below IPO price sometime in the future and we can't do f*** all."

I'm surprised the hype has lasted this long. PLTR had like 6 months of hype on WSB that drove the price up."

I then should have reevaluated my risk when it continued to go down while interest rates were surging, but I did not. My PLTR debit spread has now lost 66% of it's value and would need to rise probably about 6 or 7 standard deviations before I even come close to breaking even. Almost every single company this quarter had great earnings and sold off regardless. I am moving on so I can rinse and repeat my mistakes."

He's on the hook for the tax liability for the shares he's been paid with, so essentially he's selling just enough to cover the liability at 39%.  From what I recall I think he's sold like 45% of his stock?  That's part of why it's dipped. He confounded and helped build the company to a giant, so I don't think retard is really the correct term.

UDOW is like TQQQ for the DOW. 3x daily leverage. So if you like a bit of a gamble for gains, but in something a little safer than tech/growth stocks for the time being, it could be an option. UDOW took a massive hit in the COVID crash though so if you think a full market crash is coming stay away.

I bought PLTR at 28/24/20.5/20 etc and sell CCs at 28.5/24.5/21/20.5 on the shares bought there.  Its not much but every week or two I get a little check and when PLTR finally closes on those levels, ill be OK selling since I picked up premium the whole time and I sold my CCs a little above purchase price."

2021-05-11 01:35:43,wallstreetbets,"These are exciting findings, but MDMA, LSD, and psilocybin can't be owned by a company. Because of this, MindMed is going for a different business strategy (very non-traditional for a pharma company). They're going for optimized therapy and drug-combination plans. Maybe I'm not a visionary, but I don't see how any MD couldn't prescribe this without the help of MindMed.

The point of a clinical dose is to use the minimum effective dose to achieve a workable outcome.

Part of living in modern society is paying into a collective fund that establishes basic social welfare programs and maintains our roads, bridges, schools, libraries.  The fact that capital gains of people earning a yearly income of over 1 million dollars could be higher actually makes sense to me--it's literally just taxing the passive income generation of the very wealthy.

2021-05-10 23:00:15,wallstreetbets,"> No if you sell 1000000 in capital gains then you will get hit.

Yes if you realize over 1 million in capital gains then you will be taxed on that.  I bet you it works similarly to income tax in that up to 1 million dollars, you are taxed at the normal 20% rate, and every dollar above 1 million is taxed at the higher rate.  So the likelihood that you or I or anyone who ever reads this will ever make a trade where this would even apply to us is practically nil.

2021-05-10 22:55:14,wallstreetbets,"> If You invest over your lifetime you will get over 1000000.

That's not relevant to the capital gains tax.  Your net worth doesn't matter, it's your income.  People will probably change their behavior and hold onto assets to some degree, but they already pay 20% and rich people still sell stocks.  If that goes up to 39%, people will still sell stocks.  People always act like any change to capital gains will bring markets to a grinding halt but it's never true."

Literally not a fact.  Take what you just said to its logical conclusion.  The lower the rate at which we collect tax, the greater the return we get.  So if we tax at 0%, we make the most in tax revenue?

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Upstart (UPST) - actually useful AI **What is Upstart?**

(from their IR): Upstart‚Äôs (Nasdaq: UPST) mission is to enable effortless credit based on true risk. We are a leading artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform designed to improve access to affordable credit while reducing the risk and costs of lending for our bank partners. Our platform uses sophisticated machine learning models to more accurately identify risk and approve more applicants than traditional, credit-score based lending models.

**Why should I care?**
Upstart is one of the few ""AI"" companies outside of FAANG to actually:

* Make a profit (they are GAAP net income profitable)
* Demonstrate product-market fit 

Upstart's business is in lending, a market that has a number of characteristics that make it a **highly optimal AI use case.**   

* The end goal can be clearly defined and measured.  

Make higher-alpha lending decisions vs traditional (human-driven) credit analysts and over-reliance on credit scores.   More accurate credit risk evaluation by AI means more people can be approved for more loans with fewer defaults.   Upstart claims it excels when evaluating risk for individuals (like immigrants, younger lenders) that have no credit score or a borderline credit score that would usually get them denied elsewhere.   Upstart also claims (https://www.upstart.com/for-banks) that at the same approval rate, they are able to hit 75% fewer defaults, which means more $$$ for lenders who use their platform.  Around 71% of loans originated by UPST are instantly approved and fully automated, a big plus in the current consumer environment that expects instant gratification.

* A robust supply of underlying data

UPST's AI models (their secret sauce) use a combination of Employment History, Credit Experience, Education, Cost of Living, Bank Transactions, and Application Interaction (with probably thousands of data points per model).   Being able to leverage data points that would normally not be factored in to a human credit analyst' decision-making presents clear potential for increased performance.

* Easily scalable to adjacent applications

The TAM for unsecured personal loans (according to TransUnion for Q4 2019-Q3 2020) is $92B.   That's a huge addressable market for Upstart, but what makes the company even more exciting is their recent expansion to Auto Loans.   UPST announced their acquisition of Prodigy Software last quarter, a software company that created an end-to-end platform to allow dealerships to offer buy-now-pay-later deals to customers buying cars as a bolt-on (no-effort for dealerships, they get a cut of the profits).   This is huge in terms of expanding UPST' addressable market - Auto Retail is probably the biggest BNPL markets with around $626B in Q4 2019-Q3 2020 originations.   If this acquisition is successful in hitting the same metrics, it would demonstrate the ""platform"" appeal of UPST's technology - a plug-n-play AI engine that can be adapted to different market contexts.  




**Why now?**

UPST made a meteoric move upwards on their last earnings call by backing up their claims with real hard $$ numbers and highly optimistic guidance. Not going to go in depth on the numbers as you can read those for yourself, but I think the key thing to take away here is their guidance for FY21 - approx $500M in revenue.   If they hit or exceed this, it would demonstrate a huge inflection point in their growth and a sign that their technology has hit a point where it is generating significant value for bank partners.   Like with most platform-driven companies, this sort of trend up after a couple years of foundation-building is exactly the indicator they are looking for to call success / failure on the whole thing.

Since their last ER, UPST has fallen from ATH's and is now around the $90 range.   Growth companies in general are struggling pretty broadly.  Similar companies like Affirm (AFRM) have dropped even further recently on headwinds for BNPL fintech platforms and increased competition.   Market pressure downward aside, I think UPST currently has amazing fundamentals: best-in-breed tech platform, best talent & team, and the best competitive position to take over this emerging market - any further concrete evidence of this in Q1 2021 tomorrow could take this very sharply upward, and I don't think enough people are aware of this fact.

**Risks:** 

* Continued market pressure on growth / fin-tech stocks.
* Anything less than stellar delivery on current guidance
* Weak guidance for Q2 

**End Notes:**

Things to pay attention to in their earnings call 

* 1) early indications of traction in the auto loan market post-acquisition 
* 2) any updates and new strategies for  BD / product strategy going forward into 2021.  they recently did a post-IPO secondary offering @ $120, hopefully they will elucidate more on what they plan to do with the money riased
* 3) they recently launched the UPST referral network, that basically offers a plug-n-play, whitelisted consumer loan portfolio solution to banks and credit unions who don't have the resources to build it all out in-house.   very curious to see UPST's evaluation of the potential market for this and any traction in the past month since they released (https://www.upstart.com/for-banks/referral-network/) 

**My position:** 

Mostly shares, some highly OTM calls (super cheap rn) for 5/21 to capitalize on the post-earnings upside potential."

2021-05-10 22:22:48,wallstreetbets,"I get that this is WSB and all, but if y'all took a look at their 10k they have all their models listed and a couple of the data points they use. They're AI applications go far beyond just underwriting, they do identity fraud, income fraud, fee optimization, etc. to name a few. Pretty bullish on what they're doing here, as most banks can't get their act together when it comes to doing anything with tech."

2021-05-11 18:55:45,wallstreetbets,Is there a way to capitalize on this run somehow? Thinking of buying 100 shares (since I'm bullish long term) and then write a far out covered call. Thoughts?
2021-05-10 21:00:24,wallstreetbets,"This is one of my biggest holdings. Category killer, future FAANG potential here. There is a reason this company's share price ascended about 100% last earnings release. The proof is in the numbers - this company is unrivaled amongst its peers in terms of revenue growth. Star studded early investors including Cuban, Benioff and Schmidt:

2021-05-10 23:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Note: I don't really have a view on Upstart itself, but just as someone who has worked in machine learning at various tech companies over the years, I'd be cautious about treating Upstart's machine learning models (""AI"") as an absolute advantage that nobody can replicate. 

Almost every fintech lender uses machine learning these days, it's just that most of them lend on their own books instead of selling their models to banks, so we don't hear as much about them or how they work/perform. I'd expect that almost all of them could also outperform these smaller banks' underwriting policies. 

That said, I don't think this is necessarily a negative thing - you can still be a strong business without having absolute best in class lending models, especially if other fintech lenders aren't really competing in this space."
2021-05-10 20:27:13,wallstreetbets,"I understand the sentiment.  here are some counter-points, given the assumption that the personal data being talked about isn't mis-used for some other nefarious purpose:

* wouldn't more accurate models to predict default risk with non-traditional data points (like average phone battery level, that's actually kind of brilliant LOL) actually INCREASE loan availability to deserving borrowers?   

- with the status quo, potential subprime borrowers would be shut out altogether on their FICO scores which have consistently been proven to be a flawed measure of creditworthiness.   

- ""leave my weird porn habits out of my financial life, please"" is a fair sentiment, but if I were a lender, I'm purely incentivized to make as much safe money lending as possible.  assuming efficient markets, any big bank that discriminated against ""weird porn habits"" in lending decisions for some archaic reason would quickly lose alpha to another competitor that took those same habits as a neutral (or even positive) signal of creditworthiness.   

- I would much rather an emotionless ML-driven algo determine my creditworthiness by crunching millions of credit histories and related events than some random Joe with their own biases and pre-conceptions."
2021-05-11 17:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah.  I'm holding and adding to my position long term after that ER call, this has a chance to 5x over the next few years."

2021-05-10 20:29:10,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the key head start that they have is 8 years worth of learning and data collection - that is a difficult thing for competitors to replicate."
2021-05-10 21:29:36,wallstreetbets,"I do think this tech would work as intended, and that institutions could reduce risk this way, but that this is inching toward the social credit system that people dread. If every aspect of my life that is represented by my virtual data becomes a liability to my financial well-being, life starts to feel that much more arbitrary and dystopian. I think this will do more harm than good, and that it will take legislation to avoid it. But you‚Äôre right to say that it would probably work."

I‚Äôve got just over 300 shares and the initial plan was to offload them if it rockets up tomrw, but this is a good long term play. Did you listen to the call? I wasn‚Äôt able to get in in time so I‚Äôll have to just read the transcript."

2021-05-10 22:27:42,wallstreetbets,"As someone working in finance as well, most banks are lost when it comes to actually applying technology. The actual data lives on prehistoric systems that are still running stuff like COBOL. Traditional banks don't have the data or technology means to even begin to apply any sort of ML to their process."
2021-05-11 17:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea some really good additional info in the call worth hearing.  Everything in my ""things to pay attention to"" list of questions got answered in the call.  The fact that they are not even factoring in the impact of the Prodigy acquisition into FY21 full year guidance of $600M is even more bullish, because the auto-loan market provides some key growth runway looking ahead 2-3 years, in addition to their existing (proven) growth in personal loans.  Definitely a LEAP / long-term hold for me."
2021-05-11 09:06:21,wallstreetbets,"if you're worried inflation will keep spiking and the correction for growth isn't over yet, cutting your losses isn't a bad move, it's what all the institutional funds are doing now."
2021-05-11 02:07:08,wallstreetbets,"So, serious question.

Do you think there's a market for ML tech that interfaces nicely with COBOL and runs on a mainframe?

I feel dirty having this thought."

2021-05-11 14:04:44,wallstreetbets,"Let me ask did i get this rigth:
1. the higher the borrow fee, the lesser the shorters.
2. less shorters-gaps on the wayy up
3. gaps on the way up - higher price
4. higher price= margin call for those who shorted already
5. margin call for those who shorted - they have to have enough money in their accounts OR close short positions.
6. covering shorts = buying stock
7. buying stock = üöÄüöÄ üåù

P.S. so buy & hold is an exhausting torture for short holders with not enough cash."

2021-05-10 20:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Dumb plays are fine, that's what the sub is about. But AMC is just a junk stock. Yea it was highly shorted, but not at the >100% level that GameStop was. People who missed the boat on GME piled on to it because it was cheaper.

The issue is that most of them are bagholding now with no gigasqueeze in sight, so they switched to convincing themselves and everyone else that it was a solid fundamental investment, which is also bollocks. 

The stock was in free fall anyway, and then got diluted to fuck last year. The company is currently valued at **6 times** what it was pre-pandemic but people still think it's justified in growing further. It's madness.

AMC is demonized because, like GME, there's a huge crowd of people who are fucking sick of it. But unlike GME, AMCs cult isn't big enough to shape the majority opinion with downvotes."

Maybe people realized that hedge funds and market makers shouldn‚Äôt have the ability to do whatever the fuck they want and fuck us out of a ‚Äúfree‚Äù capital market?‚Ä¶ but no gme is the problem.

2021-05-10 21:40:04,wallstreetbets,"according to iborrowdesk on 4-th of May (1 week ago)you had the chance to borrow a max of 2,400,00 shares for 10.9% fee. Now you you can only  get 10,000 shares at 70.6% fee. The lesser the shares available to borrow, the higher the fee. 

Correct me if i am wrong"
2021-05-11 00:05:20,wallstreetbets,"Look without a squeeze AMC is undervalued come 2022. The fact that It can squeeze makes it a power move and one the best moves you can make at this point.

2021-05-11 00:14:17,wallstreetbets,So you essentially paid your rent when you could of paid off your mortgage.  Good job üëç.  And just to put the short interest into perspective.  Gme started squeezing when it hit 84%. AMC was at 80% end of day and will be higher tomorrow.  Good thing is AMC is still cheap. So there‚Äôs still time.

2021-05-11 04:24:40,wallstreetbets,How does the squeeze work if Blackrock is still able to pick up 30 mil shares?  Unless there are 100mil+ uncovered shorts out there it looks like these funds should've been able to cover a while ago.
2021-05-11 00:19:11,wallstreetbets,"What are ""inflows"" ?"
2021-05-11 09:04:23,wallstreetbets,That's what I heard but regardless that removes the xx million shares from the float. The borrow rate has soared to 80% since last week and it started shooting up right after black rock's filing came out. I'm long GME but definitely see how close AMC is to mooning as well. If the shorters are short both positions then one will carry the other or that's what I hope at least.
2021-05-11 09:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Yea I heard due to TESLA. Regardless if they don't have beef, they would be stupid not to take advantage of bringing Shitadel down.

2021-05-11 04:35:23,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely true but RC has gone all in on the transformation plans so investors are less likely to dump and run when the going gets tough. AMC's plans are praying the next Spiderman movie doesn't suck.

I'm not sure what your point is in the second part of your post. Some of them were drinking GME kool-aid, some of them got sucked in by AMC's lower share price. Hopefully most of them stayed the hell away.

2021-05-11 01:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Nobody knows. Maybe this week, maybe next or after that. All we know is that the borrow fee rate is insane. The SI shot up to 25% and everyone knows that the SI for GME and AMC are highly manipulated cause of all the naked/synthetic shorts."
2021-05-11 05:16:48,wallstreetbets,And 1 can argue that GME is absurdly overvalued. It‚Äôs worth realistically about $20 a stock let‚Äôs be real
2021-05-11 00:31:51,wallstreetbets,There's no short squeeze with amc.  GME sure.  They didn't go nearly that far with AMC.
2021-05-10 20:15:22,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd say the people like you were saying the same thing when streaming came out, VCR‚Äôs came out etc. The cinema is an experience seeing a movie that will never die, no matter how many times it‚Äôs stamped on."
2021-05-10 22:55:52,wallstreetbets,The cinema is not dead. It‚Äôs funny how everyone is bad mouthing AMC but yet no one is talking crap about Cinemark which is currently trading at 21 dollars.
2021-05-10 22:58:14,wallstreetbets,"You're a dumbass. You're on of those I see with your little name that you have. You're upset that AMC is going to explode to the moon and it's making you bitter. Maybe if you were smart and bought both, like I've been doing for the past 3 months you would be happy right now. GME shorted by $20 today so you're over here trying to rain on AMC holders parade, lmao. You're pathetic."
2021-05-10 23:41:37,wallstreetbets,But will the movies online bring u a 60 foot screen and a dual dolby 4k audio system.
2021-05-10 22:08:42,wallstreetbets,Lol. I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to devote any energy to such a dumb post as that.
2021-05-10 23:08:17,wallstreetbets,SI is at 25% and borrow fee rate is 73.2% with 2k shares left to borrow. That's as of 8pm. At around 6pm today it was at 70.6% and there were 0 shares left to borrow. They found a few thousand at the last min to short with cause they didn't like how hard it was ripping AH.
2021-05-11 01:00:49,wallstreetbets,"Last ortex I saw was 154m shorts interest on amc, with 100 percent utilization. Amc is what? 450m shares? With like 35m owned by institutions. So basically there is only 417m shares, so 154m shorts out of 417m float? 23 percent short interest? See you guys are just not following, not aware, not paying attention. Amc borrow fee went from 27 percent to 63 today, but I guess again, no one cares or is paying attention. Also 150m short shares is 1.5b in short sold shares, back when gme had its squeeze, it was 40 dollar shares, 40 million of them. So quarter billion short sold. So there is six times more money invested by hedges. It will cause like 150b in economic damage to the hedges, since last time it was 100x of what the short sold shares sum was"
2021-05-11 01:34:42,wallstreetbets,"He's saying GME SI is 19%, it's not. It's 22% and the borrow fee rate is just a measly 1%"
2021-05-11 12:10:22,wallstreetbets,It was at $20 but with a only 103 million shares outstanding. It now has 450 million. In October of 2019 it had a market cap (value) of $500 million. It is now $4.39 BILLION! They are literally valued over 8 times as much today.
2021-05-11 00:49:53,wallstreetbets,"I have 47,000 shekks and maybe like 450% gains. But next pay check I will get more AMC."

2021-05-11 02:55:59,wallstreetbets,"lol so defensive when a random person on the internet questions whether AMC is a good play or not.  (its not) 

like chill the fuck out, if its a good play then dont fucking worry about what i think.  its your money to lose or win with.  I honestly don't give a shit."
2021-05-11 04:00:48,wallstreetbets,"If you make some money I'm happy for you, I just can't understand this cultish mindset. Don't listen to me though, I had Netflix stock options that I sold for $100... In my defense they would've expired soon but still, that one hurt."
2021-05-11 01:21:33,wallstreetbets,"Possible, but shitadel has been doing that already. Black rock is super late to the party if that's the case. What a coincidence that they bought in after the borrow fee rate shot up way past 50%. I don't think that's their play here."
2021-05-11 01:19:45,wallstreetbets,"yeah, that is a possibility. But the borrow fee rate is getting real close to 100% and the OI is pretty low. People have been informed of these option calls tricks. I think most are buying close to the money and are waiting to buy far out the money lotto tickets when it squeeze is happening. Like many did with GME back in Jan. That's why you have seen a decline in OI in GME and AMC in far OTM calls. Remember how many were buying 2 and 3 months ago in GME 10s of thousands OI in 800 calls in GME lol."

Gamestop currently has the best used game rates of any online broker, including Amazon."
2021-05-11 02:43:50,wallstreetbets,Can you guys please learn the difference between share price and market cap!? Just because AMC is trading for half the share price doesn't mean they are under valued! AMC has  4x as many shares and they market cap is DOUBLE that of Cinemark.

I have specified several times throughout the thread that not only do I have shares of both, I have also acknowledged that amc will at least go into orbit; not as much, because it's not as shorted as gamestop is, but it will also pop due to being shorted by citadel. I'm not raining on anyone's parade. Gme going down 20 was a happy day for us! It brought us one step closer to mooning for everyone."
2021-05-10 20:18:57,wallstreetbets,"AMC does have their own streaming service for newish releases, but not sure how anyone expects it to compete when HBO has most of the actually new releases same day. 

Also it‚Äôs just a rental service so you have to pay for everything and isn‚Äôt included in your stubz membership otherwise maybe it could compete."
2021-05-10 23:28:12,wallstreetbets,‚Äúshares left to borrow‚Äù is a very inaccurate measurement. it is almost always just data from a single prime brokerage that is willing to give out that data.
2021-05-11 06:16:48,wallstreetbets,"GameStop has a total of 47.75 million shares in free float. So 40million shorted shares would have been over 80% of the free float. Around 4x more than AMC comparatively. 

You don‚Äôt go by raw value or raw amount, you go by amount comparative to the stock‚Äôs free float/market cap.

Also, you‚Äôre calculating AMC‚Äôs shares as if Ortex doesn‚Äôt already calculate free float. You think Ortex just didn‚Äôt account for the locked up shares or something? If you have a different free float number than them, your free float number is wrong lol.

The way you‚Äôre comparing GME and AMC‚Äôs free float/short interest is like comparing the population of ants to the population of monkeys. There is no consistency.

Also I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting this 100x short sold sum number, or if that‚Äôs an exaggeration, but that‚Äôs just.... wrong. That entire last couple sentences is just blatantly incorrect information lol.

If you want to stick it to hedge funds and big money; buy crypto. They HATE crypto. Buying AMC and GME doesn‚Äôt affect them at all anymore."
2021-05-11 10:54:16,wallstreetbets,"depends on who you ask‚Ä¶ FactSet says 19%, bloomberg says 20% and capital iq says 22%. Doesn‚Äôt really make a difference if it‚Äôs 19% vs 22% anyways."

2021-05-11 05:26:30,wallstreetbets,Im sure that HBO is going to offer every movie ever made.
2021-05-11 06:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Certain companies are canceling their contracts with HBO Max. Example Warner bros will not be releasing their movies on it in 2022 and on. This is due to the fact that it‚Äôs more lucrative to release it in the movie theatre than HBO max.

In my honest opinion I feel HBO has step their game up. Just an example but how come Netflix could have gotten Dave Chapelle but HBO Max can‚Äôt get that. They have the money to be on top of the game especially with how successful Game of thrones was. 

AMC rental service is similar to Amazon prime video. You have certain movies available for free on prime then you have ones you can rent. I know they only offer movies on their rental service whereas when you pay for prime you get a multitude of things. 

Although, in the future there‚Äôs going to be movies that are AMC specific just like how prime and Netflix has theirs."

2021-05-11 16:31:24,wallstreetbets,"That just flew right over your head. If GameStop had like 300 million dollars of short sold shares, and it cost 25 billion dollars of bankruptcy to hedge funds, then amc who has 1.5 billion dollars of shares short sold, is going to cause how much damage to the hedge funds? 

I know math is hard for autistic apes, so that's why we're only going to go over one point at a time"
2021-05-11 12:16:32,wallstreetbets,None. These are the official numbers. If your theory is that synthetics is keeping down the value then the stock would be even more over priced.

The only purpose amc will serve is as a stock that moons because of naked shorting. GME has paid its debt, almost completely replaced its board of directors whom also have chosen to not receive monetary pay. They are paid in stocks. Amc execs pay themselves cash bonuses out the ass"
2021-05-10 20:40:05,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see some plans on that; currently only gamestop has a plan in motion. AMC is more interested in giving bonuses to CEO's than reinvestment.
2021-05-10 20:43:43,wallstreetbets,"Beyond gamestop having literally the cheapest used game prices out of all of the gaming market, it's the largest gaming retailer specifically for gaming. I like physical copies of my video games, I like merch, and I like the idea of gamestop getting involved in e-sports. Covid has created a far stronger video game following than we've ever seen- we now have a wide horizon to expand a retail business that is centered entirely on video games. Blizzard only sells blizzard; ea games sells only ea games. Gamestop sells all of it."

2021-05-11 17:15:16,wallstreetbets,"Do you understand how short selling works? Do you understand what causes a short squeeze?

24% short interest isn‚Äôt going to jump the stock 20x like it did with GameStop. MIGHT jump it 2x if you‚Äôre really lucky, but realistically it won‚Äôt even cause a squeeze at all. The reason GME caused so much damage is because short selling has potentially infinite loss and the stock was shorted over 100%. So when the stock jumped from$6 a share to $40 a share, the short sellers who jumped in at $6 were at a MINIMUM 650% loss. And for that jump to happen GME went from like 300m valuation to 2b valuation. AMC has to have WAY more money behind it than GME needed to make this kind of move because AMC is currently a 4.5billion dollar company (worth over 2x more than GME was at the time when GME‚Äôs squeeze actually started). So for it to 6x initially you‚Äôre gonna need for there to be around 20 billion in growth compared to the roughly 1.7 billion it took for GME.

Like I said, you‚Äôre comparing ants to monkeys. You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about lol. It‚Äôs pretty obvious you‚Äôve only been in the market for 3 months.

Also still have no idea where that 100x thing was coming from lol. What is going to 100x here?

Edit: oh you‚Äôre an OSRS player too. Maybe we‚Äôre both acoustic ü§™."

2021-05-10 21:13:48,wallstreetbets,"So you went from saying I like the business model to investing for the squeeze, nice flip flop. But you think no squeeze for AMC will happen despite failure to delivers up to 2.7 million in April. Blackrock buying 21 million shares and individual shareholders own 80% of AMC shares, short borrow interest increasing to 70%. Saying people are gonna get hurt because of squeeze is the same imposters saying the squeeze will cause everyone to lose their 401k/retirement plan."
2021-05-11 01:27:32,wallstreetbets,"My dude, Fundamentals DO NOT matter in a short squeeze and also, you have no idea or proof that AMC is less shorted than GME. AMC was being shorted for as long as GME was. It prob won't have a bigger squeeze because the float is way bigger. Not because you magically without proof think that it's shorted way less than GME. Nobody in any of GME DD or AMC DD knows how many naked/synthetic shorts there are for both. So cut the crap."
2021-05-10 20:50:05,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but most game sales are made during around launch of a game, best buy I know has started into the merch as well, but I do know when I went to a gamestop the other day they're really doubling down on it, but if I wasn't going to get merch at the same time as my game, I feel like most people would be more inclined to get it where it's cheapest, which is probably amazon. So I think gamestop biggest thing with merch and pop culture would be to have those added while consumers are buying games. But they bring people in to get those games it should be slightly cheaper imo."
2021-05-11 19:48:45,wallstreetbets,"You mind not downvoting all my comments every reply? Really petty and acoustic. 

Anyway amc is shorted 37 percent of float, and the float is almost 100 percent of the outstanding shares.

Gme is only 27 percent shorted of the float, and the float is only 60 percent of the float. 

 So amc is 220 percent more shorted than gme

Why are you spreading fud telling people not to buy amc? You trying to help hedges?

Also what's this bullshit about the stock having to be 80 percent shorted to squeeze. And your shitty calculations how much the price goes up. 

Btx was only 35 percent shorted and it went up 15 times it's price. 

The price increase is directly tied to the stock buy backs of the shorts closing 

So the amc was 1.5b shorted, now the borrow fee is 80 percent so now the short debt is 2.8b

The price of the stock is around 10 dollars with no buying or selling demand. 

The stock price is deprecated by 37 percent via the selling pressure that was made by the initial shorts , after a long time the stock will go back to its original price with the selling pressure losing effect over time. 

When the stock hits 14 bucks, the short selling debt is gonna be 3.7b

So their debt is equivalent to the market cap of the stock


They can't close their 150m shares"
2021-05-11 01:33:18,wallstreetbets,"You're not very good at this game, are you? Ape no fight ape. I never said fundamentals matter in the short squeeze, I did say both would squeeze, and there is definitive evidence that the gme shorts are in greater number than amc. Amc is good for the squeeze, bad for the long hold, while gme is great for the squeeze, and good for the long hold. Calm your tits. Nobody in the amc really knows what's going on, at least the dedicated amc crowd, because if they did, they'd hold both. Just as I'm doing."

You're over here trying to bad mouth AMC, and you know you're doing it intentionally. GME has a good OUTLOOK on possibly being a good long hold. They have not proven it yet. It's def 100% overvalued. it should be way under $100. When the transformation into an E-commerce happens and they actually start to show significant amount of sales that are not influenced by people buying video games because they were quarantined for a whole year. That is when we will know if it's a good long hold. See what I did there. I did the same thing you did. You won't believe it tho, cause you have no clue what you're talking about.

**TYSON FOODS IS WHERE IT'S AT**

Reason:

1. They are the biggest manufacturer of chicken tendies in the world!
2. Options are INSANELY cheap.
3. I like tendies.
4. They have had an amazing covid recovery and have consistently beaten estimations.
5. Pre-covid stock price was up to $90 and it's currently trading for under $80.
6. Dude, tendies.
7. They own a lot of well-known brands like Jimmy Dean, Sara Lee, and Ball Park Franks.
8.  More states will lessen restrictions and more people are being vaccinated so dining will inc.
9. Summer is coming and it's BBQ season. Think of all the people that couldn't BBQ a year ago.
10. Just look at Tysons historical chart. It's a value stock and year over year, on average, it's worth more EOY. 2% dividends. They are literally in the tendie business.

I have been trading TSN calls for crazy profits for months. Like seriously, I took $500 and flipped it to $5k in like a week.

I will say this is a low-volume stock, so theta can eat at your options if you buy it like a retard. I usually buy a strike price above the current value as a weekly and either DT it or ghetto spread it, but you do you. Let's get these fucking tendies!

POSITION: 1000 shares @ $6.90 CAD

For the week of may 10th, Inovio pharmaceuticals have a few catalyst to come. Following the earnings report on may 10th at 4:30 EST, Joseph Kim (ceo) has stated that we are likely to hear about an external funding announcement by the end of this month. 

After amazing P2 results with INO-4800, we are currently waiting for the thumbs up from the FDA to continue with phase 3 trials.

With all of the craze about INO-4800, it's sometimes easy to forget that Inovio's lead pipeline candidate is actually VGX-3100. And the company expects to announce important results for the DNA medicine soon.

For those that are unfamiliar, INO-4800 is a covid vaccine candidate, and VGX-3100 is its main medicine in the pipeline. VGX-3100 is a DNA medicine in clinical trials for the treatment of three HPV-16-/18-related disease states ‚Äì cervical dysplasia, vulvar dysplasia and anal dysplasia. The cervical dysplasia program is in late Phase 3 clinical trials.

I am not a financial advisor and should not be taken as one, please do your own DD!

Good luck apes! üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Gevo future great company can fly ahead $GEVO Gevo Inc (NASDAQ: GEVO) has been an interesting stock to watch as of late. After a massive pop earlier this year, the stock has been tapering off its gains. However, if you‚Äôre thinking about betting against the company, you‚Äôre missing out on a huge opportunity. 

Here‚Äôs what you need to know:

What Is Gevo?
Gevo is a clean energy company, but not the traditional clean energy company that you think about when you think about the space. The company has no interest in producing solar panels wind turbines. There‚Äôs no interest in generating electricity either. 
Instead, the company is focused on replacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels. 
To do so, Gevo has spent years developing and perfecting a process to turn renewable feedstocks like waste wood and other things we would consider to be garbage, into isobutanol. This isobutanol is then used to develop aviation and offroad fuels. 

In fact, Gevo fuels are already being used in commercial aircraft. 

However, with a recent announcement from the company, we learned that it‚Äôs not only looking at the transportation sector as an opportunity, it‚Äôs looking into natural gas for the heating of homes and other uses. 
President Joe Biden and his cohorts in Washington D.C. have long been proponents of clean energy, and considering their control over the nation‚Äôs capital, big changes are likely coming down the line in the United States energy and transportation sectors. 
At the moment, investors are focusing on those creating solar panels or setting up wind energy farms. On the transportation side, it‚Äôs all about electric vehicles, but that won‚Äôt be the end all be all.  There will be significant demand for clean, renewable fuels.
For example, I live in a rural area where an electric vehicle simply doesn‚Äôt make sense. In my area, if I had an electric vehicle, the only place I would be able to charge it is at home. If I wanted to take a long distance trip, I would have absolutely no place to charge my vehicle when the batteries started to die, and would be forced to tow my vehicle home. 
That‚Äôs not the only issue with EVs either. 
Ultimately, filling a line of batteries takes quite a bit more time than filling a gas tank. Who wants to wait hours to be able to drive their vehicle? Sure, EVs are fun, and popular at that, but they aren‚Äôt practical for everyone. As a result, renewable fuels will become increasingly important, and in the renewable, clean-burning fuels game, there‚Äôs no other company that has even gotten close to the accomplishments of Gevo. 
In fact, Gevo recently announced a renewable natural gas project, and that it has issued bonds to fund the project. With the renewable natural gas product, the company will be extracting natural gas from cow manure, resulting in yet another renewable product. 

The Market Has Gone Short

After sending the stock screaming for the top earlier this year, the stock market seems to have gone short on the stock. In fact, at the moment, the stock trades with short interest of more than 20%. 

So, why have investors gone short?

Well, there‚Äôs a bit to it. Gevo is in a growth stage, which is a painful reality for many. The company has signed agreements surrounding the sale of billions of dollars worth of its sustainable aviation fuel. However, to meet the demand set forth by those agreements, the company is having to spend massive amounts of money to build out its infrastructure. 

The big spending at the company is ultimately leading to losses, which is scaring investors; but that‚Äôs not always a bad thing. 
Take a look at the early days of Amazon.com. Everyone said Jeff Bezos was a lunatic on a spending spree as he built out his infrastructure to become the leading force in the e-commerce space. When Bezos‚Äô goals came to fruition, there were plenty of people with feet in their mouths. 

That‚Äôs likely to be the case for Gevo. 

Yes, the company is spending money by the wheel barrel full, but that spending is a necessary evil, and will set the stage for tremendous growth ahead. 
As the members of the Wall Street Bets Reddit have proven, retail investors are getting tired of hedge funds playing with the market at their expense, and are starting to fight back. Well, I‚Äôm expecting a war to be waged in the relatively near term surrounding GEVO that could send the stock for gains in multiples."

Biomass and biofuels made from biomass are alternative energy sources to fossil fuels‚Äîcoal, petroleum, and natural gas. Burning either fossil fuels or biomass releases carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the plants that are the source of biomass for energy capture almost the same amount of CO2 through photosynthesis while growing as is released when biomass is burned, which can make biomass a carbon-neutral energy source.

Developing and commercializing renewable alternative jet fuel and diesel
Uses feedstocks that have the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions
What Gevo does:

Gevo Inc (NASDAQ: GEVO) is a next-generation ‚Äúlow-carbon‚Äù fuel company focused on the development and commercialization of renewable alternatives to petroleum-based products.

The Englewood, Colorado-based company is developing gasoline and jet fuel using renewable feedstocks that have the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions at a meaningful scale and enhance agricultural production, including food and other related products.

The group has developed a breakthrough process that converts a high-octane fuel called isobutanol into clean, renewable diesel. The green diesel can also be made from fusel oils, a mixture of several alcohols produced as a by-product of fermentation.

Renewable diesel is expected to compete head-to-head on price with natural and petroleum-based equivalents, while reducing particulates and CO2 emissions, according to Gevo‚Äôs CEO Patrick R Gruber.

Low-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle.

Demand has increased since California‚Äôs Low Carbon Fuel Standard came into effect, which is designed to decrease the carbon intensity of California‚Äôs transportation fuel pool and provide an increasing range of low-carbon and renewable alternatives, which reduce petroleum dependency and achieve air quality benefits.

In addition to serving the low-carbon fuel markets, Gevo‚Äôs technology can also serve markets for the production of chemical intermediate products for solvents, plastics, and building block chemicals.

The group's stated strategy is to commercialize bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products to allow for the optimization of fermentation facilities‚Äô assets, with the ultimate goal of maximizing cash flows from the operation of those assets.

How it is doing:

Gevo kicked off 2021 by announcing to shareholders and other potential investors that it has about $535 million in cash and no significant debt.

The money will help the company launch its Net Zero Projects to produce energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons using renewable energy and Gevo‚Äôs proprietary technology. Gevo is currently developing its Net-Zero 1 Project at Lake Preston, South Dakota and other Net-Zero projects are planned. 

The company expects the Net-Zero 1 project will have the capability to produce around 45MGPY of liquid hydrocarbons (jet fuel and renewable gasoline) that when burned, should have a ‚Äúnet-zero‚Äù greenhouse gas footprint. In addition, the Net-Zero 1 plant is expected to produce at least 350,000,000 lbs per year of high-protein animal feed. 

Gevo, which is working with Citigroup, said preliminary capital estimates for Net-Zero 1 are $700 million-$800 million (including on-site renewable energy generation). The company is in the process of completing front-end engineering and project planning to determine capital costs for Net-Zero 1 with more precision.

In addition, the company plans to begin the construction of its first RNG (renewable natural gas) project in 2021. It will produce RNG by using anaerobic digesters to convert manure from dairy cows into RNG, with production expected to begin in 2022. Gevo plans to sell most of the gas to the RNG market in California and use some of the bio-gas generated from this project at its renewable hydrocarbons plant, for example, at Lake Preston. 

For its first major deal of the new year, Gevo in February struck an expanded fuel sales agreement with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). Under the deal now valued at $100 million, SAS will increase its minimum purchase obligation for Gevo‚Äôs sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 5 million gallons annually.  Gevo expects to supply SAS with SAF starting in 2024, from its Net-Zero 2 Project for the use and distribution in low carbon fuel regions of the US. Gevo and SAS signed the original agreement in October 2019. 

In addition to SAS, Gevo has closed several other fuel-supply contracts - with Delta Air Lines Inc as well as a deal to supply its SAF to the aviation industry in the Pacific Northwest, by way of its customer and global fuel supplier, Avfuel Corporation.

Gevo also won recently the largest contract in its history after entering into a binding agreement with Trafigura Trading LLC, one of the world‚Äôs leading independent commodity trading companies. The contract increases the company revenue pipeline to more than $1.5 billion.

Under the 10-year deal, Gevo will deliver 48 million gallons/year (MPGY) of renewable hydrocarbons, the majority of which is expected to be low-carbon premium gasoline with a smaller portion of the volume for SAF, starting in 2023. Trafigura hopes to supply SAF to both US and international customers interested in low-carbon jet fuel.

Looking outside the US, the company has been awarded part of The Queensland Waste to Biofutures (W2B) Fund to support the development of waste-to-biofutures projects in Australia's second-largest state.

And Gevo recently increased its footprint in India via a technology-licensing deal with bio-based technologies and engineering firm Praj Industries Ltd to commercialize low carbon SAF and renewable premium gasoline in the South Asian nation and neighboring countries. The company is currently working with the Indian Air Force on fuel tests.

On March 17, Gevo reported its 4Q 2020 results that showed the company finished the three-month period to end December 31, 2020, with nearly $78.3 million in cash and equivalents. 

Revenue for the quarter was $0.5 million compared with $6.9 million in the same period in 2019 as a result of the suspension of ethanol production due to coronavirus (COVID-19) and an ‚Äúunfavourable commodity environment,‚Äù according to the company."

What the boss says:

Commenting on the outlook for 2021, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber told shareholders: ‚ÄúNet-Zero 1 is a first of a kind, off-the-grid type of plant where we are putting great effort into making Net-Zero 1 the most sustainable plant it can be.""

He added: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad we have the customers secured, Citigroup to help us with the debt financing, and that the economics of Net-Zero 1 are attractive at this stage. I‚Äôm also pleased that we are making progress on filling up production capacity at Net-Zero 2 as evidenced by the recent SAS contract. We are making great progress, fast.‚Äù"

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Nokia Renaissance (NOK): How the Finnish telecom giant will flourish in the era of 5G Last Friday, Morgan Stanley analyst, Dominik Olszewski, upgraded Finnish telecom company Nokia to Overweight from Equal Weight. Commenting, ‚Äúimprovements at Nokia are coming faster than we had expected.‚Äù AKA, it‚Äôs a Buy. The upgrade comes as one of many in a recent positive shift in the stocks rating across the board, including ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù ratings issued by SEB Equity Research and UBS Group.

Just like their infamously durable 3310 mobile phone released at the turn of the century in 2000, Nokia‚Äôs success in telecommunications remains invincible even in the 5G era. With cutting-edge patents and new contracts with tech giants including Amazon, Microsoft and Google, Nokia is set up for continued strength and relevance in their respective markets.

Although less famous for their mobile devices nowadays, Nokia still crushes earnings expectations with telecom sales due to new remote labor models born from the pandemic. First quarter EPS in 2021 were reported at .08¬¢, beating the .01¬¢ forecast eight-fold.

In one year, Q1 ‚Äô20 to Q1 ‚Äô21, net sales have grown 3%. Adjusted for currency fluctuations, net sales have actually grown 9% on a constant currency basis ‚Äî an extremely compelling figure. Gross margins climbing to 37.9% from 35.3% in the same period, indicating refined operations and a positive reflection of new leadership.

Pekka Lundmark took over as Nokia‚Äôs CEO and President in September 2020, saying he‚Äôll do ‚Äúwhatever it takes‚Äù to win the 5G race. Other competitors to look out for are Swedish multinational Ericsson and China-based Huawei. Chinese telecom giant Huawei, however, faces widespread suspicion over state surveillance concerns.

The US has pressured allied nations to avoid collaboration with the Chinese firm, and many countries ‚Äî such as the UK and Sweden ‚Äî have placed bans on their technology. Although bad news for China, this opens up greater market share potential for Nokia. This coincides with a year-over-year change of 13% net sales gain in the North American region alone. Possibly indicating the geopolitical tensions are working in Nokia‚Äôs favor. As of now, there seems to be no winding down of strained US-China relations.

Nokia appears to be in great health, boasting a D/E ratio of 0.37 as of 03/31/2021. Even more alluring are the four consecutive quarters of positive free cash flow. Nokia netted EUR 1.2 billion in Q1 ‚Äô21 alone, with an end-of-quarter net cash balance of EUR 3.7 billion, allowing for aggressive re-investment, particularly in 5G tech. As the decade of 5G ramps up, Nokia is financially positioned to take full advantage of cutting-edge research and development.

Nokia‚Äôs existing arsenal of 5G tech is teaming up with behemoths like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft, Google and the US Federal Government. AWS has expanded their existing partnership with Nokia to include cloud-native convergent charging solutions for CSPs (communication service providers). Google, like AWS, is also collaborating with Nokia to enhance cloud services. US Federal Government‚Äôs National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) 5G Cybersecurity Project has tapped Nokia to provide a secure transition to 5G networks.

The company‚Äôs Q1 ‚Äô21 interim report paints a positive picture through 2023, anticipating faster growth than the market. Similar to previous quarters, Nokia is expecting a ‚Äúclearly positive‚Äù cash flow over the next couple years. Optimistic comparable operating margins predict 7‚Äì10% through ‚Äô21, increasing to 10‚Äì13% in ‚Äô23. Conservatively managed, Nokia‚Äôs guidance appears to deliver from previous quarters. All in all, this optimistic outlook could very well be outperformed in the near future ‚Äî which is great news for investors.

As the petals of 5G technology unfold across the world, Nokia is in full bloom with it. Strong demand, fresh leadership, top-of-the-line tech and a solid balance sheet are the seeds of a new renaissance in telecommunications. Nokia will once again be reinstated as the best of the best, and prove to be one of the decades most advanced leaders in 5G technology.

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Gap: Potentially the best investment out there right now I know this title might come off as crazy, but I believe that Gap is about to blow up. I will keep it brief:

People on /r/WestSubEver were able to figure out that the Yeezy Gap deal is coming [this Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/WestSubEver/comments/n8nhab/yeezy_gap_thursday_12am_its_confirmed_boys/). Kanye's deals have blown away investor expectations time and time again‚Äîhis deals with Nike and Adidas both outperformed expectations by far, with his shoes selling out almost instantly, along with resales going for thousands of dollars in some cases. If you check resale platforms like [StockX](https://stockx.com/yeezy), you will see Yeezy shoes consistently selling far above retail prices.

Most importantly, Nike and Adidas both had huge surges in stock price. Look at how much Adidas' stock has risen in recent years. Gap has already had a huge surge, and this is just the beginning.

What's great about this deal is that the exact release date has not been reported on in any news publications, meaning that right now you can get in ahead of larger investment groups (I doubt they are actively following Kanye subreddits).

That is not all though. Look at this quote from Morningstar:

>According  to Euromonitor, Old Navy is the largest apparel brand in U.S. It  competes in the discount apparel sector, which has been healthier than  other areas of apparel retail.  
>  
>Gap‚Äôs e-commerce accounted for more  than $6 billion in sales in 2020, 45% of its total sales. COVID-19 has  accelerated e-commerce growth for Gap and others in the apparel space.  
>  
>Athleta  has established itself in the fast-growing women‚Äôs athleisure market,  one of the bright spots in North America apparel. We estimate the number  of Athleta stores will double over the next decade.

Overall, I think Gap is a great investment right now. Hope this helps somebody!"

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PSFE (Paysafe): A better way to bet on multiple high growth companies like DRAFTKINGS, BARSTOOL (PENN), FORTNITE (Epic Game), YOUTUBE/GOOGLE, COINBASE, ROBLOX, TWITCH (AMAZON), SKILLZ, APPLEPAY, BetMGM (MGM), FANDUEL, SPOTIFY, MICROSOFT/XBOX, etc. &#x200B;

[Paysafe Partners](https://preview.redd.it/5dsiel82vby61.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d18a5ff23c52205e6e84ba6b4c0f5f44d68dc146)

Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing e-currencies which is growing in popularity. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe valuation in-depth and discussion of bear cases, so I‚Äôm not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don‚Äôt even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it‚Äôs really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it‚Äôs more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

As you can see these Paysafe‚Äôs customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer‚Äôs earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe‚Äôs future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital ""stuff"" with the wallet. These currencies has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ  on their 1st qtr report (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) ‚Äú Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv‚Äù (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) ‚ÄúSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.‚Äù ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don‚Äôt know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. I get it, people will say look man their CAGR is way too small compare to PayPal or SQ. I'm not looking at the past. I'm looking at the future. Their CAGR estimate did not include the sportbetting/igaming growth. Remember that Sportbetting was banned in the USA but has been overturned by the SCOTUS recently. Right now less than 1/2 the population can bet online, and the 4 largest states haven't yet legalized online gaming. This is why I post the results from their customers like DKNG and PENN which is showing high growth rate. And best of all? They own this space in online gambling as they are a monopoly. So we'll see what their new CAGR will be going forward once they reported earning tomorrow (May 11). If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

Paysafe involved with Gaming, Sports, e-wallet/currencies which I find very exciting and feel that if I own the stock I‚Äôll be part of the journey of growth with these sectors. Roaring Kitty/ DeepFuckingValue simply invested in GME because he liked the stock. I‚Äôm investing in Paysafe simply because it's cool and sexy, regardless of its growth potential.

Summary: Paysafe I believed is a lower risk and high reward stock, since their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when 20+ states including the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has this space. This is a massive high growth (as seen with DKNG, PENN, MGM 1st qtr report) area and they owns it. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

2021-05-11 00:58:32,wallstreetbets,"While tech is taking a beating good value companies are still in the green. PayPal, SQ and other trading over their normal PE/PEG are getting destroyed. 

The market has had enough with overvalued growth stocks and that is healthy. Adobe is holding up well and trading at reasonable multiples, as well as Microsoft and some others where there is actual substance.

Paysafe is very, very undervalued by traditional metrics. The BIG question is their ability to generate organic growth. Yes, the underlying markets have outstanding CAGR, but are they capitalising on it?

We‚Äôll see, I don‚Äôt think think anything is priced in to PSFE as opposed to PYPL and others who tanked on superreports.

2021-05-11 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Does the ""Shroom Boom"" have strong investing potential? In 2018, $CMPS (Compass) paved the way for using psychedelics in psychiatric medicine when it received the [FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/compass-pathways-receives-fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-for-psilocybin-therapy-for-treatment-resistant-depression-698309591.html). (Opinion: If it stays on track with its current [research](https://compasspathways.com/our-research/psilocybin-therapy/clinical-trials/treatment-resistant-depression/), the company has strong potential to retain its leading spot in the [shroom boom](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/psychedelic-drug-boom-in-mental-health-treatment-nears-reality-.html).) Last Friday, MindMed went public and is set to launch [Project Angie](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-announces-project-angie-targeting-the-treatment-of-pain-with-psychedelics-301284096.html) that aims to use LSD in pain treatment. With the legalization of Marijuana, mental health medicine companies are clearly turning to psychedelics as treatment options.

What got me thinking about the shroom boom was [this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01336-3) research article published in Nature today. As the science nerds here are aware, Nature is a huge deal. So it obviously caught my attention. According to the study:  


\> These data indicate that, compared with manualized therapy with inactive placebo, MDMA-assisted therapy is highly efficacious in individuals with severe PTSD, and treatment is safe and well-tolerated, even in those with comorbidities. We conclude that MDMA-assisted therapy represents a potential breakthrough treatment that merits expedited clinical evaluation.

What do you guys think? I believe that this whole realm of medicine is revolutionary. It's lagged behind the legalization of marijuana because of the clinical trials involved. But with Compass working away on its [phase IIb study of psilocybin therapy](https://compasspathways.com/our-research/psilocybin-therapy/clinical-trials/treatment-resistant-depression/#from-subnav) and MindMed jumping into the mix, I think we've got strong investing potential here."

Of course assets that can consistently climb 5% day by day will fall just as hard when the run is up. If anyone who is holding ARK right now is surprised by how much it‚Äôs dropping, they didn‚Äôt know what they were buying in the first place. It would also be insane to put all of your money into growth stocks if you‚Äôre scared of losing some value. 

I hope they drop just as much tomorrow, because I‚Äôm buying more."

2021-05-10 23:55:16,wallstreetbets,I didn't know GME still exists in 2021
2021-05-10 21:46:13,wallstreetbets,"be careful with GME on eToro. I was also using eToro until i read their Product Disclosure Statement.

If you have shares on eToro you do not own any shares. There are no shares registered in your name, it is instead a custodial agreement.

There is nothing inherently wrong with having the shares be held in a custodial agreement, the main problem is they reserve the right to sell your position for any reason inside their PDS. 

I'm currently involved in a regulatory complaint process with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority as eToro's advertising is misleading and deceptive by stating that purchasing through their platform is an investment in the underlying asset (implying the purchaser owns the shares)."
2021-05-11 00:31:06,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the best website/app to invest in?!?
2021-05-11 01:21:10,wallstreetbets,I avoid etoro at any cost since their website is always slow/ not working properly when there's a lot of traffic. It will cost you money in the long run. Anyways congrats

2021-05-10 22:39:47,wallstreetbets,Nothing right now. AMC is the one that's going to blast off to the moon soon. It hit 70.6% borrow fee rate with 0 shares to borrow today.
2021-05-10 22:41:13,wallstreetbets,Oh what's going on with GME is that it literally got shorted $20 today. Went from $162 to $142. With little volume. Blatant massive short attack.
2021-05-10 21:17:08,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is the go to in the USA. As far as I know they didn't do anything scummy during the surge earlier this year

2021-05-10 22:39:10,wallstreetbets,"It's squeezed twice before, maybe will again? Who knows. The range during a squeeze looks to be between $350 these days. IF it happens. More likely, it will never sniff $300 again and slow bleed back under $100 by June."

And be super nice to people. Thats key.  Even when they are lying to your face, keep working it.  End game is to make money not friends so let the little shit go because there will be a lot of it. 

Hours.  Jesus bro, I still log 60+ hours a week and 12-14 hour days are often.

Don't fall for shit marketing.  My BEST marking every was having a nice clean vehicle with my business name and contact info.   The vehicles I've always chosen to drive are rigs thst are eye catching without being expensive.  Something different.  Evevryone doucher contractor drives a jacked up dished wheel diesel of some sort so don't do that.  Also, don't have business names thst are offensive or draw negative attention.  Like for window tinting, impersonal would never do a ""John's blacked out window tinting""  or ""jills skull reaper tint shop""  if you catch my drift.  You want middle america to notice you because that's your best chance at making good money.  Aim for lambos and you'll miss.  I never tried.  I'd rather work on a 5 year old corolla than a new super car. Its not easier, just there are more corollas. 

Again, be nice, be helpful.  You can be B‚Äê at your trade but an A++ service record will lut you at the top.   And also again, watch out for those who charge to build your business.  They are there for themselves first before they are there for you.

And the trade means dick. Dude I was a trigger pull away from doing a portable bathroom business.  Yeah, cleaning piss and shit.  I handed the idea off to a relative who now makes over 100k a year and now drags the fancy bathroom setups to weddings and whatnot.  He was doing construction sites and baseball fields for years. 

95% of businesses fail because 95% in my opinion have too many things in the mix to please.  Rely on you, don't let people get into your wallet and truly work hard for people.

Realtors¬Æ push their clients towards lenders (mortgage brokers usually) with the best rates and fastest close times.

It is a seller's market in real estate right now. Cash buyers galore. If you are not a cash buyer the next best thing is a SHORT escrow from a pre-approved buyer (basically nearly the same as cash).  It is also usually a mortgage buyer on the other end that created the cash buyer.  Plenty of mortgages will be generated in the coming years no matter what.  More people than houses... GOOGLE ""supply and demand"".

**UWMC closes in less than half the time of RKT.**

As the summer nears and COVID hopefully wains look for a better Q2, Q3 under these conditions (and without the panic that the government might be collapsing).

The 2008 collapse of the housing market was largely due to an abuse of ARMS and predatory lending practices.  If there is a collapse now it will be because of the damage from COVID, BUT the ability to produce income will bounce back quickly with qualified buyers as they return to the workforce.  This is a great opportunity to grab a stonk that a (hopefully) once in a lifetime insurrection & competition with RKT pushed to lower than expected profits during Q1."

Rocket missed. (barely) Additionally RKT reported that their MTG fee % dropped significantly.  Furthermore, they stated that outlook will be that it continues to drop.

While bad news for RKT, even worse for UWM since RKT has different product segments where UWM is just mortgages.

The worst part is that I don't think you'll get any positive catalysts anytime soon.  As RKT / UWM have already alluded to, future quarters are not going to do any better.  (will be worse)

Best course of action may be to hold out for a bit and hope for any incremental recovery, but get out before the next earnings call as it will be highly likely they miss that one as well.

Though... I was very honest about my experience. NYMT remained at a steady $6 to $7 range for the past 4 years (pre-Covid). And maintained a very nice dividend (one of the highest in my portfolio). I'm not really following your claim of ""tons of margin calls were had last spring"". As far as I know... the ***entire stock market*** had tons of margin calls last spring. That's why I sold many of my big hitters in the March 2020 panic, and bought back lower in May/June. I sold NYMT at $6.20 and bought back later @ $1.92.

I watch all my stocks like a hawk, anyway. And definitely plan on selling if this drops below $4. But I highly anticipate NYMT to rise back to the pre-Covid margin. Especially w/ this expected REIT boom looming ‚Äî¬†coupled with the fact that many businesses have realized having employees WFH is much cheaper ‚Äî¬†and many urban centers (like NYC, LA, SF and Atlanta) have already begun to convert old office buildings into live/work condos and apartments.

In the meantime, I'm enjoying a 125-130% increase on my NYMT investment... and the chunky quarterly dividends that come with it. If it's not for you... no biggie. Again, I was just sharing the news of my good fortune.

However, last spring they got destroyed and since they are heavily leveraged run the risk of a margin call. They (along with everyone else in the sector) have worked to reduce risk which is why I doubt they go back to 7/share especially with current finance climate. You will get the large dividends because REITs are basically required to do this. You also don‚Äôt get many tax breaks. I am avoiding this sector for now because I imagine everyone could get hit hard by future rona foreclosures, they probably can also see this scenario and are trying to minimize risk accordingly.  Basically the investment vehicle is what crashed the 2007 economy (but revised to overcome some of the shortsightedness of the previous version). If you think we are in a major housing bubble, I would avoid this company."

2021-05-10 22:27:36,wallstreetbets,"You make money by averaging up, not down.  Because you are chasing a winner.

You cost basis down when a stock goes up a lot, and can lock a profit.  Ideally, this is done with a 3x move in a penny.  You sell 2/3‚Äôs, keep 1/3, set back 1/3 for taxes.  This way you truly have a cost basis of zero on a stock you think will eventually become listed on a real exchange.  You can do it on a 2x as well, and just deal with the taxes at tax time.  

You are chasing loser.  Stop figuring this out and get a book on stocks before you lose even more money.  Follow the rules to a T until you make some money.  Then get fancy once you know the basics."

2021-05-11 06:06:21,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has had the same 40% correction a couple of times, you could go back about a year and that same graph would still fit your parameters. Notice the quick spike and drop in the middle of the Tesla chart. If you shorted the stock at that point then you would have been with the people who lost tens of billions on that bet. 

Humans are good at finding all kinds of patterns even when they do not actually represent the reality of what is going to happen. If you really want to know what is going on by comparing 2021 Tesla and 2001 Apple, then might be good to have more than just two data points for gains/losses. Are their fundamentals out of wack in a similar way? Is there an underlying problem both companies have/had? There is a lot of data out there. If you just draw a couple boxes that is really low effort."
2021-05-11 14:20:21,wallstreetbets,Bruh the dot com bubble burst in March 2000. This chart apple drop was in September. Maybe related but not the same thing.

2021-05-10 23:09:31,wallstreetbets,"The early iPods weren‚Äôt trash dude.. they were as revolutionary as the iPhone at the time. I remember how they replaced the discman (which replaced the Walkman) as the gadget everyone needed in their pockets.. it was incredible how it could load thousands of songs in minutes and hold all of them in such a small device. Also the the user interface was considered a huge leap in usability (with its highly praised click-wheel) and it quickly made everything else (other mp3 players) seem obsolete. People were willing to spend a lot more to get the iPod and it was their best selling product at the time by far. Many other companies tried to copy their success with cheaper alternatives but mostly failed (remember the Zune?)

It was the stepping stone to the iPhone and iPad."
2021-05-11 01:12:57,wallstreetbets,"Those are some facts.

As a tech company Jobs managed to maneuver the per song costs and that‚Äôs what won the battle. iPods were shit compared to others on the market. Shitty old iTunes was actually good at the time and the pricing worked.

And then the company somehow couldn‚Äôt miss after that. Wild shit."

In fact apple essentially saved the music industry from killing themselves by digitizing the music world in a legal way that people were willing to pay for due to its ease of use. Prior to that the RIAA just tried to sue everyone that pirated (it was a losing battle) but there wasn‚Äôt a good alternative to pirating until apple kick started the iTunes iPod store and it quickly blew up in popularity. Finally people could just buy individual songs they liked and have it instantly on their iPod instead of needing to buy a whole album and ripping a couple songs from it etc it simplified everything and made digital music viable without CDs"

2021-05-11 14:58:27,wallstreetbets,Agreed! Every other MP3 player just read your folders and MP3 filenames. Apple re-organized all your MP3s into whatever random folders their shit algorithm decided. I bought and iPod back then and returned it the next day.

Like completely empty? Yeah maybe. Unfortunately a huge percentage of people worldwide live in cities/metro areas so, they'll need to address that. 

If they hadn't intervened they probably would've gotten in 3+ accidents just in that little afternoon drive. Abysmal. Again, maybe a good driving \*assist\* tool, but no way am I trusting this to drive me point A to B without intervention.

It is one thing to fund pure research between scientists but the optics of funding the CCP  with US taxpayers dollars would not fly.  Only 10 percent of Chinese are vaccinated due to mistrust of Sinovac.  They have the test subjects and the money.

The American Government  used the  excuse that with near herd immunity in US it is difficult to get enough pure volunteers.

As a doctor you know With the triple mutation variant in India, thousands of untested arriving visitors  arriving monthly to all 50 states,  many refusing mRNA  vaccines with PEG and Syncytin1, and natural antibodies lasting 8 months  we are setting the stage for round 2 next Winter.

2021-05-10 23:41:11,wallstreetbets,"A lot of interesting points here. Certainly every flaw you‚Äôve pointed out regarding the perils of being over reliant on a DCF are true (although I have also spread comps here, so that downside is mitigated).

A few people have pointed out insider moves as justification for T higher and VZ lower. I don‚Äôt find this a particularly compelling point. AMZN and AAPL (and most big tech) have seen much higher levels insider selling than buying over the past few years, and you can argue about an overvaluation being their motivation but the returns suggest, at the very least, these sales were either poorly timed or had motivations beyond the days share price. Insider moves at this level, at the volumes we‚Äôre seeing, it doesnt cause me concern. 

There‚Äôs no denying that insiders have access to greater information, but on companies of this scale I am less likely to put a great deal of concern on low-volume insider moves. I care more about insider trading on thinly traded companies.

Its interesting to me that you cite and bold YTD share price growth as evidence that T is a good buy and VZ a poor one, but this seems to me to point towards the opposite. If T, a company that pays a 6.5-7% dividend, is up 11% in 3 months, doesn‚Äôt that make you wonder if all of the value opportunity has been swallowed up? If Verizon was down 15% I would be extremely concerned, but at -0.5% I‚Äôm not worried. 

The subscriber drop is obviously not great, but to me this is another reason to suspect that there might be a value opportunity here. A bigger drop would worry me, but this level doesn‚Äôt cause me concern for the long term solvency of the company."

It really depends I wouldn't consider selling 35000 as 'insignificant', and neither do other analysts think that, so they titled the article 'significant insider selling occurs at VZ'.

As you rightly pointed out, a sale can have numerous motivations, that's why I always give it less weight than buying, but never 0 unless someone uses it to fulfil tax obligations, So I think it's a fair question to raise why some would sell so many VZ shares if they were truly so massively undervalued as your model predicted while insiders would buy more T which you judged to be overvalued. That's a sanity check for the numbers your model has produced.

Remember GME? MANY many analysts almost had a consensus that it is a 3$-10$ stock, it only took a few guys to analyse not only the numbers but the market, its condition and the possibilities of development to prove WallStreet wrong. Today it's probably detached from a sane valuation, but isn't tesla? That's exactly the point, models can only get you so far, domain expertise and higher order implication considerations are superior to relying on flawed models. 

>Its interesting to me that you cite and bold YTD share price growth as evidence that T is a good buy and VZ a poor one, but this seems to me to point towards the opposite.

If Verizon was down 15% I would be extremely concerned, but at -0.5% I‚Äôm not worried.

I'm not citing those YTD numbers as 'evidence' to make buy recommendations, but to raise awareness that, although the numbers of both companies didn't really substantially change, the market valued those companies quite differently that your calculations would have predicted ( adapting your model to the adequate timeframe )

As for the upside of T, I think that Warner Media is an excellent acquisition, which has already [proven its potential](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/warnermedia-ceo-s-hollywood-movie-gamble-pays-off-at-box-office-1.1597204) 

This had a massively positive impact on churn among other benefits which resulted in more subscribers. AT&T suffered under negative sentiment for a very long time of (partially justified, but also heavily exaggerated most of the time compared to VZ and TMUS), so they have and will surprise the market more with positive developments if they continue on this positive path, especially once HBOMax expands worldwide. They have already taken a bigger bite out of Netflix's pie and I think this will be even greater after the global expansion.

>The subscriber drop is obviously not great, but to me this is another reason to suspect that there might be a value opportunity here. A bigger drop would worry me, but this level doesn‚Äôt cause me concern for the long term solvency of the company.

That's quite the euphemism, a loss of 180000 subscribers while the competition gained subscribers should be a concerning issue. What will protect VZ from losing even more subs the next quarter? VZ's shares are already trading on higher multiples, compare their  Price to Earnings Ratio, Price to Revenue Ratio, Price to Book, Price to Sales.
I think that AT&T has still more upside than VZ.

2021-05-11 07:27:18,wallstreetbets,"WELL reported record quarterly revenues of C$25.6 million in Q1-2021 reflecting a 150% year-over-year increase. WELL's growth was led by its Software and Services revenues which increased by 345% in Q1-2021 compared to the prior year.

WELL achieved its second quarter in a row of positive Adjusted EBITDA(2) as a result of strong contribution from its Canadian operations which achieved Adjusted EBITDA(2) of C$1.1 million.

During the first quarter WELL announced the acquisition of CRH Medical or ""CRH"" which subsequently closed in the second quarter. The acquisition which had a transaction value of approximately US$372.9 million, was funded by a C$302.5 million subscription receipts offering at C$9.80/share of WELL and a senior secured credit arrangement administered by JP Morgan and a syndicate of lenders, for an aggregate amount of up to US$300 million which will support the growth of the business.

CRH is on track to meet and exceed its business plan goal of generating over US$150 million in revenues, US$60 million in EBITDA and US$40 million in free cashflow before leverage and tax costs in 2021. As a result, WELL's combined pro forma revenue is now approaching C$300 million with over C$80 million in EBITDA(2) on a run-rate basis."

2021-05-11 04:49:25,wallstreetbets,"> This has nothing to do with misinformation. GigaBerlin was planned to be operational in July. I live in Germany, and yes the headlines might have been overstated, however even the most optimistic of Tesla Fans have to admit that this time-line is not feasible and earliest opening will probably be later in the year.

Nobody knows when it was planned to be operational. Tesla never released any official information about this. The only thing they communicated was that it's ""still on track for late 2021"", suggesting that was the goal all along.

>  Without this factory opening on time without any delay, again, it is highly improbable that Tesla sells 1M vehicles this year.

Definitely not. They don't need Giga Berlin or Texas to get close to 1M. They're already at a 1.050.000 run rate right now, and they're still  scaling production in both Fremont and Shanghai. I think it will be close, but I expect them to deliver anywhere between 0.9 and 1.1 million vehicles.

> This is not only to do with a single customer complaining about brakes. Chinese authorities have started getting involved amid complaints about the quality and safety of their vehicles. Link Link

> No matter how you look at this, it can't be good especially when other Chinese EV manufacturers are rolling out their own vehicles. I suspect that the authorities in China are probably trying to favour local EV manufacturers by leaning on Tesla, but again, this is not good news for Tesla in its biggest market.

These kinds of things happened everywhere else in the world as well. It's just because what they're making is new, so people are weary. Every death in a Tesla related car crash hits the media for some reason, meanwhile, people die in Ford and GM cars every day and nobody bats an eye.

I agree that it's not great for Tesla, but as long as their demand is so big that they can sell out all cars to be produced in Q2 within the first month of the quarter, it doesn't actually affect them financially. Eventually people will realize that all this FUD about Tesla is BS as more and more people they know drive a Tesla.

> Dude, there's no comparison between developing iPhones and Autonomous Vehicles. Not even close. Waymo and Cruise are taking the conservative approach to developing their software with the aim of scaling up when they perfect it. Is this the right approach? IMO yes. It is subjective, but i don't believe releasing an incomplete beta software into the wild ( like Tesla) is the responsible thing to do. Just look at the negative news it generates whenever a Tesla crashes (whether FSD was involved or not). Also the approach being used by Tesla (only cameras) is debatable compared to other companies that use LIDAR and Radar and Cameras.

I agree the comparison isn't perfect, but I couldn't think of a better one. Either way, Waymo and Cruise are not just taking the conservative approach, they're taking the approach that cannot be scaled up to a global level. Tesla is.

Also, calling it irresponsible when FSD is already saving lives every day, with people 9x less likely to get into an accident with FSD engaged, just completely misses the mark. Yes, there is a ton of negative news every time a Tesla crashes, but just because people are afraid of new technologies and media companies don't like Tesla because they're not using their advertising channels doesn't mean we should stop trying to save lives.

As for the vision vs LIDAR debate, there's no way to settle this until Tesla proves whether they can do it. The only thing that's definitive is that Tesla's system is much better IF it works, and that in theory it should be possible because humans can do it with only two cameras.

> I'm sorry but this is a ridiculous take. So when the CEO of a company comes out and promises a product release, we should take it with a grain of salt? And not take his words as fact? I'm sorry but that is unacceptable. Why should anyone accept being stringed along by Elon? The CEO of one of the most valuable companies on earth? If he tells me that my Tesla which I preorder will have 490 miles of range or will fully charge in 1h, should I also not take that as fact? Why should I then believe that FSD will work as promised? Why should I believe anything he says regarding car safety? Why should I believe the Model 3 I bought last year is equipped to have FSD?

You're heavily taking things out of context. If Elon comes out and promises stuff on an earnings call or company presentation, we 100% should hold him accountable. The problem with Elon's deadlines is that 90% of the time it's just somebody asking him when he THINKS something will be ready, Elon saying he EXPECTS something to be done in X amount of time, and media companies then misrepresenting what he said as targets/promises/etc. to smear Tesla in the future.

I also think you should cut them some slack on the FSD front. People don't fully appreciate that this is one of the most difficult problems humanity has ever attempted to solve. Obviously it's going to be difficult to put a timeframe on that. I can't even give you an accurate timeframe of how long it takes me to build a video game with a handful op people.

> Let me clarify. Demand for EVs are increasing worldwide and even VW and others have preorders. The point is as other manufacturers release their own EVs, the market share that Tesla could've captured as the flagship EV manufacturer is decreasing quickly especially since Tesla cannot ramp up production quickly enough to match the likes of VW. For instance, here in Germany, in Q1 2020 Tesla sold 3300 vehicles compared to 6000 in Q1 2021. That is a very impressive x2 increase. However, VW sold 6000 vehicles in Q1 2020 but sold 16000 in Q1 2021. This is almost a x3 increase, and currently has a 25% share of the market. This means its VW not Tesla that is most likely to meet the demand for EVs in Europe simply because they can make them faster than Tesla thereby capturing a bigger market share.

I understand where you're coming from, and I agree VW will be one of Tesla's biggest (and only) competitors, but it's also an outlier and slightly cherry picked data for a number of reasons:

* VW is coming from extremely low numbers, so of course percent-wise their growth is going to look impressive. 
* You're looking at VWs home country, where Tesla doesn't even have a factory yet. We could do the same for Tesla by looking at the US alone, and it would paint a completely different picture.
* VWs EVs are currently unprofitable, so demand is artificially high. If they were to sell them as the same gross margins as Tesla, I wonder if demand would be the same.
* VWs cars have a slightly lower average price, so we can't compare their production numbers 1 to 1 with Tesla's

And ultimately, I do think VW will be able to make the transition to EVs, but it will be a huge challenge for them to phase out their profitable ICE vehicles and replace them with unprofitable EVs, turn those EVs into profitable products, convert their MASSIVE company's culture to that of a software/tech company and replacing all of the managers that don't understand iterative and agile production processes, and doing all of that while having a terrible balance sheet and a much higher number of short term-minded shareholders and executives than Tesla does. I do think VW will manage it, but I don't think people appreciate how difficult this will be and how many legacy automakers will go bankrupt or become a fraction of what they once were while doing so."

2021-05-10 21:29:35,wallstreetbets,"> What's not to like other than that people are unreasonably bearish on the sector

That's enough assuming you're a trader. Fundamentally Amazon, Google and other big tech names are also great. They blew away earnings *and then sold off*. Look at the nasdaq right now - it's shitting itself because the market is rotating out of tech/growth expecting higher interest rates in the future (which I doubt materializes). It doesn't really matter how great tech is. Long term it'll be fine, but if your time frame is shorter than the next quarter, this stuff matters.

If your timeframe is measured in years, none of this matters. But I swing trade stocks/sectors/charts. I'm in LEN right now, not because I'm extremely familiar with Lennar (though I know they're huge in housing), but because the chart is looking really bullish. Assuming today's red day doesn't continue into the week, I hope to swing between $1k - $3k by friday on butterfly call spreads. They were already ITM today before the market sold off and I bought them last Friday.

Next week I'll move onto the next stock which is ready to run. My only long term holds right now are oil and gold, and by long term, I mean into the summer or however long this commodity rotation lasts.

UWMC's chart is extremely bearish. I doubt earnings will change that unless they're surprisingly good. But judging by the after hours trading, it looks like it's going to continue to sell off until a floor is found. It may not make any sense from a fundamental perspective, but market fundamentals have never mattered on short time horizons, only long horizons."

No vendor apart from FireEye has been mentioned, they have sent in their SWAT team   - Fireeye Mandiant . **Find me another security vendor mentioned even in passing.**

IMO FireEye is either misconfigured, did not stop it - dumb email with zero-day attachment or some rogue personnel exposed the netw. to the ransomware through a personal device.

Maybe not a state sponsored Russian hacking group, but certainly Putin allows teams like this to exist and even flourish if they meet his own twisted objectives, which this group certainly does rn.

2021-05-11 03:35:55,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, but possibly missing a detail.  REAL cybersecurity, the kind of thing that uncovers novel techniques, discovers holes that are not yet documented, etc, is an intensely and highly intellectual task.  It's really an insanely meticulous and exacting effort that is most similar to R&D or straight up science.  Large organizations are utter DOGSHIT at dealing with things like that.  They're very good at prodding people along and driving schedules for things where the path forward is clear.  But when you need to do something that, by definition, no one else has done, and you're dealing with systems that are monstrously complex the way modern software systems are... the research drives the show, not the other way around.  Most large organizations can't stomach that.  They will remain incompetent.

Those 3000 employees would be fine for the dreadfully boring part of cybersecurity known as 'patch patrol' that doesn't do anything novel, never understands anything, and just checks to see if everything is patched, and yells at people to patch if its not.  But how do they know there are vulnerabilities?  They can't find them.  They have to be fed everything by spoon by the former group."

I think a lot of people will sit on the sidelines until the Phase 3 Trial is successfully completed, or the GMB treatment is succesfully completed and approved. When either one happens, I think the stock will pop, and every one will say ""I wish I bought sooner."""

2021-05-11 10:42:09,wallstreetbets,GL with commercial and the new tax proposals. It will be a while. Big money is going to shift their money even more from commercial to small family homes. They have no incentive to stay in commercial or the stock market. This will also lead to less available and higher prices for the middle and lower class.
2021-05-11 17:14:34,wallstreetbets,Don't think you need to divorce for the sake of fucking around. Surely they could arrange a different marriage style if they wanted to non monogamy is not uncommon. Esp for the wealthy
2021-05-11 09:23:12,wallstreetbets,"If people enter a marriage or other committed relationship and agree that they can have sex with other people, that is their choice. If you make a commitment to a monogamous relationship and have sex outside of it, then you are a liar.
The true meaning of monogamy is one sexual partner. So the terms are literally mutually exclusive. As I say, if both people in the relationship agree, I respect their right to make any choice they want."
2021-05-11 17:33:52,wallstreetbets,"That was a rhetorical question; monogamy means one wife/husband/partner, it doesn't mean one sexual partner. It definitely comes down to the nature of the commitment that you've made, but it's entirely possible to be monoGAMOUS (socially and personally committed to one person) and polyAMOROUS (sexually or romantically committed to more than one person). Suffice it to say that any time you're entering into a serious relationship with anyone, there should be an awareness of and respect for expectations. But it's a fallacy to expect monogamy to implicitly never include interest outside the marriage; if that's your assumption, you need to have a talk with your partner to be sure or you're going to set yourself up for a bad time."

2021-05-11 17:14:08,wallstreetbets,Water is actually not wet. It only makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the ability of a liquid to adhere to the surface of a solid. So if you say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the surface of the object.

That actually created the SFR space.  Private equity started buying houses in bulk out of foreclosure.  The first securitization of SFR cashflows happened around 2012-2013.  I know because my friend structured the deal.  It was a private label deal.  
There has only been one SFR securitization by a GSE, to my knowledge.  Probably because it goes against the base mission of FNMA, Freddie, and GNMA, namely fostering home OWNERSHIP.  But that one GSE securitization was a billion $s at 50 bps below where retail borrowers can get mortgages.  


Retail buyers don't stand a chance.  Recently, SFR folks are buying up whole subdivisions from developers like Toll Brother and KB home"

2021-05-11 17:05:35,wallstreetbets,"Alright chief I took a look at earnings. The company worth 42B took in 387m net rev. Not horrible, but lost .46 per share so they obviously will need to double their revenue to get profitable. But to give you an idea. Activision Blizzard (Roblox market cap is 58% of Blizzards) that recently reported 2B in rev, and .84 positive earnings per share. Unless you think roblox is will close to triple their revenue within the next year, and to be quite honest. Almost all of that price is already priced in because that‚Äôs what Roblox‚Äôs share price is valued at. So when you think roblox is a good stock, you better be pounding the table for another 150% year because that will price in NEXT YEARS POTENTIAL GROWTH. That‚Äôs fine that you think Roblox is a good hold, but people don‚Äôt understand what can move a stock price. Roblox isn‚Äôt a fucking 2B market cap company that can get a easy swing to 3-4B with a lot of volume. At 42B don‚Äôt expect any crazy price movement with no catalyst and expect it to trade down after every earnings"

Apple also specify if you don't sell digital goods and service within the app. you  have to use other payment methods which companies like UBER, AIRBNB and other use. 

So when epic games decided to contest on paying the 30% ..they were taken off the app store."
