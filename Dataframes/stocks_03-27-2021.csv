03/27/2021,stocks,"I read today that a chinese hedgefund blew up yesterday and many positions got liquidated. One of them maybe was FUBO. There were some huge block trades that were similar to other stocks that got liquidated. 

Make of that what you want. I just thought that was crazy. The fund was leveraged x5. Crazy world we live in were somebody leveraged a 15bn fund to 80bn."
03/27/2021,stocks,Im in for 30@29. Lets gooo

03/27/2021,stocks,Buying more on the way down?
03/27/2021,stocks,This is the bottom. Next stop 50+
03/27/2021,stocks,They are dangerous when you are buying them after they have already skyrocketed.
03/27/2021,stocks,Yes... my father was run over by a drunk meme stock. My mother was never the same.
03/27/2021,stocks,Extremely. Especially the ones that go to the moon. They bring back alien diseases.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Meme stocks don‚Äôt kill people, people do?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"The big money seems to be in options, but like Warren Buffett said if I don't understand it, I don't invest in it. I just buy shares, that's what I understand. Options is beyond me"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Meme stocks are great for selling options.....

SPCE is a good long term meme stock
LCY is a great long term stock
AMD is a great long term meme stock
PLTR is a great long term meme stock
NIO is great long term meme stock 
TSLA is great long term meme stock"
03/27/2021,stocks,"By dangerous you mean highly profitable, then yes meme stocks are straight lethal"
03/27/2021,stocks,"GameStop is flipping the entire board without any public fight and has short squeeze in its 10-K.

There are 70 million shares total and math shows the float is entirely gone in the most conservative scenario.

This is absolutely unprecedented.

It‚Äôs worth the research and choice to get on the ride or not."
03/27/2021,stocks,Godzilla v Kong comes out Wednesday.   I love movies.
03/27/2021,stocks,"They're dangerous to retail traders who gamble more than they can afford to lose, which is why the government needs to protect us from ourselves with lots of fun new regulations."
03/27/2021,stocks,Yeah certainly man. You never know when there will be a massive sell off because the people with $100k+ invested have had enough. It‚Äôs not the right way sadly. A lot of small investors will get hurt.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Lol, I didn't know this room was full of jokers. I'm sure you all know what I meant by ""dangerous"", but I see that many of you just want to play linguistic games."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve got Rocket, Blackberry, and Palantir; all of which I think have potential despite the meme aspect."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Lol be very very fucking careful playing options on meme stocks.
I‚Äôve seen so much gain porn, and it‚Äôs so awesome to see young people making it big.
But I‚Äôve also seen soooo much loss porn and people that didn‚Äôt know what the fuck they were doing with options lose so much money they will probably have to claim bankruptcy.
Buy the meme stock on a dip and HODL.
Majority of people that play stocks have taken a ride on the meme stock roller coaster"
03/27/2021,stocks,Can‚Äôt have a serious discussion when this sub is flooded with wsb juveniles unfortunately
03/27/2021,stocks,All of them.
03/27/2021,stocks,"There are a lot of people/investors on here and many other subs that got involved with GME, including myself. Most took a little to a lot of profit and haven‚Äôt touched it since. The subs favouring GME now have a lot of bullshit DD that‚Äôs all one sided. If you want to believe what the assistant night manager at the second largest gas station in Any-Town USA is saying, go ahead."

03/27/2021,stocks,my wifes bf was molested by memes
03/27/2021,stocks,"Great comment.. all of these were considered meme stocks which is a just a joke in itself.

Can‚Äôt go wrong selling covered call options... other than missing out on that short squeeze"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm glad you brought that up! Options seem to be the central player in the MEME game, but having said that, this becomes much more short term than long term, no?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I own a few shares of GME. But tbh, it's pure speculation. I made most of my money in FB, AMZN and TSLA. But some of those MEMEs seem interesting bets, such as RKT and PLTR, but I haven't studied either enough to know if they are good investments. When I see too much pumping going on, I usually stay away. But GME made me a lot of money....money I didn't expect. But having said that, I STILL don't believe in it the way I do in my other holdings."
03/27/2021,stocks,lol not one bit of sarcasm of course
03/27/2021,stocks,Linguistic? I love pasta.
03/27/2021,stocks,Why Blackberry? Can you tell me your reasons please
03/27/2021,stocks,can she cut a tree down with a hearing?
03/27/2021,stocks,Sort of ... it is turning into a long game. Look at TSLA... it was the consistent number of itm calll options that helped the stock just snowball out of control. That is what is happening with GME. Only we suspect there is significant short interest along with a significant number of FTDs in the market suppressing the actual price
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm with you on GME.  Could there be some mega squeeze, sure, but I'm not going to risk a ton of money on it.  

Based in what I have read and seen in the news reports about PLTR it seems like a good long term play.  They are landing contracts and teaming up with big names and their growth projections look solid for the future."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The way I see it is this is a once in a lifetime opportunity... I‚Äôm purely talking about gme. We know this stock is being highly manipulated and it‚Äôs more than a meme stock at this point. After the sales call and the price dropping to ~118... it stabilized and came back. 

Anyone is welcome to paperhand at any point... but I‚Äôll keep seeing where this does finally end up. I‚Äôm young, it‚Äôs really not that much money in the long run. For me GME is a movement towards a fair market for all. The squeeze is a result of the negligence of the regulators and greed of the hedge funds/market makers."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I hope GameStop fills the board and defines the future soon because until they do there will be tons of legit questions. 

My investment is betting on the risk that I will like those answers more than I hate them. And then a reasonable path of execution not drawn out longer than it would take competitors to react strongly.

Hyper Risky:  but the upside of the short position cancels that risk for me. It‚Äôs almost, in my mind, a hedge with a lottery ticket built in. I‚Äôm either hedged and chill or hedged and way chiller. Not advice, mega mega risk, do you."
03/27/2021,stocks,Yeah I figure we're all smart enough apes here that I can omit the /s
03/27/2021,stocks,"I believe in the company and their shift away from hardware into software, I like the partnership with Amazon, and I‚Äôm happy that Facebook settled with them - they obviously had a good reason to sue."
03/27/2021,stocks,I agree on PLTR. Seems to fill an empty void and has/can continue to get talent.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I have my doubts about PLTR because that stock is constantly being mentioned with some woman named Cathie Woods in the same breath. I don't know who she is and I don't care. To me, she's just another Ichan or Ackman or MELVIN for all I know! Who knows what her TRUE intentions are and where her loyalties really lie."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Sorry, can't tell if it's sarcasm or not.  She founded and runs ARK, an asset management fund.  Based on what they have bought it seems they are very bullish on PLTR."
03/27/2021,stocks,She is cool as fuck lol
03/27/2021,stocks,"Go to a casino and bet it on black. 

That‚Äôs the types of answers you‚Äôll get asking this kind of question.

The truth is that no one knows. 

If you‚Äôre determined to get that kind of return in that short amount of time, just be prepared to lose everything as well. Best of luck."
03/27/2021,stocks,It is a guessing game. But high rewards mean high risk.

03/27/2021,stocks,"My best thoughts and don‚Äôt take this as an insult but just some direct if blunt advice. 

This is hard earned money that you NEED for something super important. If you are under the belief that there is any stock or ETF that will ‚Äúget‚Äù you a 10-15% increase in a short amount of time, then I think you are best to sit it out and learn a little bit more about stocks before plunging large amounts of money into the market. 

Anything that could possibly give you that return is tantamount to gambling. Do not gamble with money you can‚Äôt afford to lose."

03/27/2021,stocks,"True. But YTD (which is less than the time frame OP is asking about) you‚Äôd still be down from high. 

Kudos on the good timing though."
03/27/2021,stocks,Aren't all the popular ones based in canada where it's already legal? Everyone investing in CAN companies talking about US laws. We wont be importing marijuana.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Honestly I think my advice would still apply. It‚Äôs money you NEED for something in the short term  you shouldn‚Äôt be looking to ‚Äúinvest‚Äù it for a quick buck. 

Quick example: someone on here mentioned Costco. Everyone knows Costco. Good company. And if you had bought it a few years ago you‚Äôd be up pretty nicely. If you bought it 6 months ago you‚Äôd barely be even. If you bought it 3 months ago you‚Äôd still be down. Investing is about long term and end of summer isn‚Äôt long term. 

Honestly I stick by what I said. You need the money for something important. Just sit on it until you‚Äôre ready to buy the car."

03/27/2021,stocks,"You have a lot of tech already but it‚Äôs so tough for me to not recommend PLTR since you seem to have an interest in that sector. They have a decent moat at minimum, mama Cathie has invested almost half a billion in them, and their CEO said in an interview they are focused long term and any investors looking for short profits need to look elsewhere. 

All good signs for PLTR. Of course there‚Äôs way more but do your own DD"
03/27/2021,stocks,Right now FB is the buy out of those on the list.
03/27/2021,stocks,Do you all think Bitcoin is a buy?
03/27/2021,stocks,HIMX + DAC + PERI or OTC INTV + KAVL + TRWRF

I liquidated a shitty MF to get 5% of my 401K in RTH bc it was a free transaction, no tax implications. But I woulda bought it in my brokerage account if I had to. Also calls on DBI. I have PSN calendar calls but may buy outright. I love their fed contracts, intel, etc. I‚Äôm also in FIDU. Last two are industrial/infra type plays. Also like commodities have some DBA, CWCO and SPKE for utes. Look at NLST. They‚Äôre beating google in court. I‚Äôm up 60% in a month or so with huge room to run. Im in LLKKF bc I believe there is huge upside, metals extraction conference is coming 3/30-3/31. I‚Äôm avoiding NFLX, DIS,  PYPL. No reason other than the shine is gone and other options seem better. Good luck."

03/27/2021,stocks,Seconded. SQ is the way.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I like SQ, just the current price and finances aren‚Äôt looking too great but I assume will spike due to small businesses opening up soon."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I like BABA a lot, the finances are great but the Chinese stocks crusade is killing them."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve been looking into PLTR since they‚Äôre often recommended. I‚Äôm just having issues with their finances considering all the stocks I currently have increase revenues every year and have huge assets to debt ratio.

Imma look into PINS since I use it sometimes."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yea, they just jumped a little. Hopefully they dip to around 260ish for me to buy in."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Idk much about Bitcoin, I tend to only invest in things I use."
03/27/2021,stocks,TRWRF? I‚Äôm on the fence. They‚Äôre on my watchlist but I jumped on the IPNFF train and lost 8% one day. Got out.
03/27/2021,stocks,Fintechs the future it‚Äôs not always about financial statements it‚Äôs about potential growth too but I understand your point
03/27/2021,stocks,"Personally I think the current BABA issues will get positively resolved in the next year, and if/when they do, the valuation right now would be ridiculously attractive relative to comparables. We‚Äôll see!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Also keep in mind, PLTR didn‚Äôt list until last September of 2020. The ceo said they are investing *aggressively* to forego short term gains for long term growth and valuation. Financials aren‚Äôt where you would want them ideally, but I think the pros far outweigh the cons. And if you look at the graph PLTR hasn‚Äôt been this low really since it crossed the 20 threshold. This correction has brought it down sure but so is damn near everything else."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Price projections for FB is anywhere from 900-3200. Its hard to even manually adjust things to get a bad return. It would take the company basically stopping any sales today and forever to loose.

(5 yr projection)"
03/27/2021,stocks,I have IPNFF +PONGF + TAPM + CINGF + FDMSF too
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yea I get that, that‚Äôs why I like PYPL, I believe they were the first one to offer small businesses ways to pay, I also use Venmo more than cash-app. And most important, they have better assets to liabilities ratio and priced similar but I‚Äôll do a deeper look."
03/27/2021,stocks,Are you adding any right now or are you waiting for a bigger dip? I‚Äôm think 200 or less is a buy.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I see it at 300 at the end of the year, just wondering with all the stuff happening regarding FB could hurt it. Though the difference in 15-20 dollars between now and my entry point is negligible so I‚Äôm prob gonna buy regardless."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm always adding to BABA when under $230/sh every month, but I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be wrong to wait. The market could knock everything down and you could get a great entry point. Technically, if it went under $200, I think it could fall to support at $175. Would be a great entry price down there."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah its hard to factor in what the lawsuits will do and potential future ones. From what I‚Äôve gathered theres about a max 10% cut off their topline which really is quite small overall. When I do an analysis of their financials I usually mess around with the projections, for example, cutting growth down by half to see where we would be in that kind of scenario...FB wins in even the most conservative approaches."
03/27/2021,stocks,What do you think about the Chinese government targeting the Jack Ma? Feels like he‚Äôs tied to BABA‚Äôs success.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Totally agree that‚Äôs the main problem, plus the broader context of the market getting ahead of regulators and the government regulators playing catch-up. But it‚Äôs in both the government‚Äôs and his interest to smooth things over, so I expect they will. Their government can‚Äôt be targeting tech founders if they want to be perceived by their own citizens as a great place to start new businesses, and they need to be seen this way or much of future tech moves to the US West coast."
03/27/2021,stocks,Buy the rumor. Sell the news.
03/27/2021,stocks,"There‚Äôs been a recent trend, buy the hype sell the news. The same thing happened with GME this week. Day after earnings it tanked like 50%. 

Earnings is tricky to anticipate. See week of earnings there is big uncertainty of the company and stock. So you see it rise usually. Then after earnings the uncertainty is over, which is also where you get IV crush in your options. 

If you believe in WGO and are long, you just got a good discount then."
03/27/2021,stocks,Isn‚Äôt WGO a strong covid play?  It‚Äôs falling like the other covid winners.
03/27/2021,stocks,is Wbo a good entry point now? or should i put a limit order to buy at $ 12 lower
03/27/2021,stocks,"Cheers, I hear that. it just seemed that there was little to no hype on WGO and price activity appeared normal pre earnings. The discount if it is one is nice to be sure."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Could be right, After road tripping and camping around the states recently (I'm from NZ) I decided to invest a little bit. Everywhere I went I saw their products, it felt that American culture was very geared towards the accessibility that their products provided."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Mark Cuban told us last month, if nothing has changed in regards to how you view and value the company, why sell? Why panic? Buy the dip and be patient. It fucking sucks being patient I know, but that‚Äôs a huge difference maker for stock success."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I know some would have felt it rational to sell and am just trying to understand that. But yeah, I feel like they will continue to grow if they maintain good leadership."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Supposedly dark pools were created so the retail investor doesn‚Äôt get smacked by huge stock movement when an institution decides to buy a huge order from another institution. But if you think about it, it really benefits ONLY the hedgies. They get to trade under the table for a better price because if they tried buying in bulk on the market it would surge the price up. So they buy wholesale from another hedge fund all at the same price. 

Supply and demand definitely have an effect on the stock price. Squeezes are perfect examples of that. Huge demand, little supply, price fucking moons. 

In my personal opinion, the fundamentals have become less important (still important) but aren‚Äôt the keys to the mitt. With this new wave of retail investors, they invest off emotions, and feelings and other factors. The market is changing and the old cats either have to keep up, or watch from the sidelines."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The reason why dark pools work is because of demand from large institutional investors like mutual funds and pension funds.  Each dark pool sponsor has a different quantity queuing and price setting process, but because it is off exchange, the participant doesn't have to show their entire stair-step bid or ask sequence.

For example, many dark pools will close transactions based on mid of best bid-ask on the open exchanges, and exchange quantity up to the available amount in the queues.  So, in essence, the dark pools accept the price discovery of the public exchange, but as a tradeoff all desired quantities may not clear.

I'm not sure what you mean about fundamentals in this context, but a dark pool is just a different way of clearing a market.  And it functions because of the demand of large institutions for this service.

For retail investors, we don't need to worry about this.  We're not trying to buy 1 million shares of MSFT without moving the market."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Not all OTC are dark pool. Most are just small caps

I have seen several obscure stocks with sharp price movements that are clearly traded with high velocity computers . You can probably buy at the bottom but if you try to sell at the high then good luck finding a buyer ."
03/27/2021,stocks,What changes about your world or profits if someone answers this question for you?
03/27/2021,stocks,"OTC is literally just outside of an exchange. I know the GME crowd has been making it seem nefarious but it mostly just involves either small caps not listed on an exchange or market maker functions. 

You mention legality, what law do you think there is about trading a stock outside of an exchange?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thank you for this answer. I'm new, and learning. You said something at the end:

""We're not trying to buy 1 million shares of msft without moving the market.""  

My question is, why should anyone be allowed to buy/sell shares of a publically traded company without moving the public market?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"1) The confirmation that I know less than I previously thought. Which will lead to more learning and reading

2) Will stem a more passive approach to my investment method. Probably will stay away from any level of volatility

2 things I can think of off the top"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think that he is asking about OTC trades (i.e. upstairs trades, dark pool trades, ECN trades etc.) and not about the types of securities traded on the OTCBB. ""Over the counter trades"" in this sense simply means any trades which are executed off exchanges, including off-exchange trading of securities listed on major exchanges (the so-called ""third market"")."
03/27/2021,stocks,"If you can find a willing buyer for the offset, then the price should not move.  That's what the dark pools do.  Match big volumes of both buyers and sellers."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Just assume that you know less than you think. Investing in equities is humbling and the little guy has access to less information and is competing with big dawgs that can influence the market in special ways.

If you were able to answer whatever it is you're trying to learn in your post, I don't think it really should change your approach. You should still be using fundemental analysis to determine your buys and position sizing. And if you believe in technicals, then maybe entries and exits.

But understanding dark pools, HFTs, and other mechanisms beyond the basics is really not a value added activity in my mind.

Lots of people focus on learning things that don't really matter. It leads to overcomplicating things and time wasting activities.

Good luck."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think his point is the unfair benefit it provides.  Because the price doesn‚Äôt reflect the increase in demand, the buyers get a better price than if they were to trade it like the rest of us."

Keeping these trades from altering human choices looks to be as much the goal."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Encouraging someone to stop asking questions is unhealthy and irresponsible. I get your gist of trying to focus on important things, but you could say it in a less demeaning way. The response to any question should not be *what do you care?*"

So much to learn, it is difficult to know which pieces matter most."
03/27/2021,stocks,"It's a game theory problem.  Whoever shows his cards first loses.  On the dark pools, both sides hide their quantity ""cards"" so neither has an advantage.

Regarding human choices, I suspect by now, algorithmic trading is driving most of the volume on both exchanges and dark pools."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm not encouraging them to not ask questions. I'm telling them to focus on what matters. It's being direct. Not being a di$&-head. (Other than not using a gambling app like Robinhood or WeBull what else is there really to know about this?)

At the end of the day the retail imvestor sees a bid and ask. They have NO control of how it works out on the back end.

The only real advice is to set limit orders so that you don't get hosed by the market makers. 

Too many people entertain novice investors by sharing information that leads them down rabbit holes that don't really matter to the average person. So rather than do that I told them it doesn't matter so they can focus on the important stuff.

If you wait for ‚Äúthe right price‚Äù to buy you‚Äôll often miss out on gains. Happened me to me in 2012 with MA, I missed out on about 200% gains waiting for the right price before i finally just started buying and never looked back"

03/27/2021,stocks,Love this stock.  I think now is a great price to get in at.  I've been holding nvidia since $29. I'm still buying shares whenever it nears 500.

03/27/2021,stocks,I was dumb enough to think that I shouldn't invest in both NVDA and AMD at the same time because they compete. NVIDIA is a little more specialized though and much bigger into AI & other R&D. I missed the prime opportunity too...
03/27/2021,stocks,Can always buy 2 shares now.  Never too late.
03/27/2021,stocks,Damn you literally bought at all time high. So you think it‚Äôs going to go much higher?
03/27/2021,stocks,"I wish I invested back then, I liked NVDA and AMD way back when they were cheap but I preferred spending money instead of investing."
03/27/2021,stocks,I like what I hear.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Looking at the chart it is reaching the 200 day average. The question is, will it bounce back at around the 500 mark or keep falling? Especially if the arm deal goes through it should bounce or is it already priced in and drop if it fails."
03/27/2021,stocks,I meant that you could buy an etf with NVDA in it. You‚Äôd then hold NVDA but with the volatility buffered.
03/27/2021,stocks,"its one of those things where it reinforces my investing strategy of just investing in what you think are the best companies. NVDA would be nothing where it is if it wasnt for bitcoin, it just happened to have a 10+ year track record of being the FAR superior gpu maker in the world, and thats what you need for mining during the bitcoin explosion the last 5+ years."
03/27/2021,stocks,"NVDA will eventually go higher, especially if the ARM acquisition goes through like the CEO expects it to based on its progression to this point. It‚Äôs a great long term play in my opinion"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yup, the future is VR , EV and AI - we need fast chips and good tech for all of it. 
NVDA and AMD are the ones to make them. I have positions in both of them and will be buying more ."
03/27/2021,stocks,In 5 or 10 years of course.  Do you think it's gonna be 600 in 5 years?!!  It'll probably be 1000 or split by then.
03/27/2021,stocks,The important thing is that you learned and changed your ways. Best of luck on your journey!
03/27/2021,stocks,Seems the 200 day average has some support there. NVDA is trading in a range so I guess time will tell.

03/27/2021,stocks,Arm won't go through.
03/27/2021,stocks,What happens if the ARM acquisition doesn‚Äôt go through. What do you consider a good entry point as of right now?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Well for me it‚Äôs not about the ARM acquisition, it‚Äôs about the future. I see the future to be a place where people , classes would take place in VR systems, Businesses would use AI to analyze data , EV would replace traditional cars. I believe we need high tech semiconductor chips for all these. + inflation. My 600$ probably won‚Äôt be worth anything in the next 5 years."

03/27/2021,stocks,"I assume it will drop temporarily based on that news, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt the company much in the long run seeing as their data storage, AI, and gpu segments are all doing very well. Jensen Huang, one of my favorite CEOs, recently discussed how the acquisition was going exactly as planned. I added to my position during its recent dip under $500 which I think was a good time to add based on my time horizon. If you‚Äôre looking for immediate gains then this may not be your best option based on the current sentiment regarding the reopening trade."

The numerous companies who are fighting to stop the acquisition only reinforce my idea of how influential it could be"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm think, prob going to add more shares if it dips below 500 again."
03/27/2021,stocks,Dude it'll be 600 by the end of 2021. Just buy a couple shares now or close to 500
03/27/2021,stocks,"If a strategy doesn‚Äôt work for similar stocks in a similar industry then I‚Äôd consider it as possibly being overfit to an individual stock.:. But it could be okay, it just depends on the specifics.   

Some stocks trade in distinct ways and it‚Äôs not unusual to have to adjust algos to work, but if it‚Äôs a ground up rewrite of the entire strategy I‚Äôd be questioning why it works at all right now and make sure you‚Äôre convinced it‚Äôs a valid strategy that will continue to exist into the future.   If you‚Äôre not sure why it works historically then I‚Äôd be very hesitant to turn it live."
03/27/2021,stocks,"If you play around and invent a formula for a curve that ""looks"" like a typical stock chart, you can probably find an existing stock among the thousands in existence that follows this formula pretty well. It would be a coincidence because there is no reason other than random chance why this stock would follow something entirely unrelated. The ""why"" is a problem here: there is no reason for the match. Using that formula as a predictor of future performance to guide your investing activity would be foolish. However, if you can identify reasons why traders might like or dislike a stock under particular conditions of economy, trade, technological change or other circumstances, and work out a method to factor all that into a predictive system, and it seems to work, then you have a reason why it works so it's probably fine. But then you should be able to validate your approach by applying to other stock and confirm that it's not a fluke. If it works in general then you got something. But if it insists on working for only one stock, and to have only worked in the past, well, be wary and wise."

ordinary / nonqualified are taxed as regular income, so whatever tax bracket you are in. qualified are taxed differently, see the nerdwallet link above for the 3 income brackets for 0%, 15%, 20% tax rate on qualified dividends"

Another piece of advice: once you buy a stock, consider that money as though it is disappeared forever. 

Also, pick investments that you LIKE. This will make it easier to hold that investment when the price starts to drop (it WILL drop). If you are convinced that you picked a good investment, DONT sell at a loss.

I don't know how far you are from 18, but i think the way you will see the most return is by picking solid companies that you expect to go up within your time horizon.

Keep your time horizon in mind as you pick your stocks. Stocks that are suitable for people with longer horizons (for example something that is highly speculative) may not be suitable for you"
03/27/2021,stocks,"There is some great advice being given.  I'd also suggest that you be very aware of your timeframe, and be comfortable holding your stocks.  Slowly build a portfolio - I'd suggest some slow, safe bets (like an index fund - SPY is an easy first suggestion).  These will not be ""fun"" per se since they are not going to explode upwards, but they will slowly grow your wealth over time.  Find a company that makes a product you like, and make a small investment in it.  See what happens - if the stock price goes down, do not sell.  As you become more familiar with the markets, AND if you have money to gamble with, you might want to consider making small value, high risk plays - BUT ONLY WITH MONEY YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE.  Also - I suggest staying away from trading apps like Robinhood - open a real brokerage account from Fidelity or TDameritrade."

If the stock were to catch up with its value in the next 6 months, would your investment be worth more than if you just sold today and tossed the money in SPY for 6 months? What about 12?

03/27/2021,stocks,Redfin. It's still not as inexpensive as what you described but it is less
03/27/2021,stocks,">No matter what a parasite real estate agents tell you - There is no way angent can add 5-6% 

in the USA, there is strong data showing that FSBO (For Sale By Owner) properties tend to sell for less than houses sold by an agent. there are many subtle elements of marking and selling a house, and a good agent can help get a better selling price. for example it's a common mistake, at least in America, that sellers believe upgrades to the property increase value dollar for dollar (they think a $10,000 kitchen remodel will add $10,000 or more in value to the sale price). in reality, these types of improvements don't add dollar for dollar value, perhaps 50 cents on the dollar, and people can lose money by spending too much on the wrong improvements. 

but to answer the question, there are American companies offering similar services to what you describe: flat-rate agents who do not charge a percentage. but I'm not aware of any companies that sell stock. house sales are regulated federally and state-by-state, so there are probably many small companies that are not listed."
03/27/2021,stocks,Rocket Homes might be looking to disrupt this area. Combined with the rest of the RKT ecosystem they might vertically integrate the entire process
03/27/2021,stocks,"I haven't looked into this, or if any companies are doing something similar, but i couldn't agree with you more. the current model of a real estate agent in 2021 is so outdated and ridiculous, i would never sell a house with an agent, no chance at all. they are so overpaid it is pretty ludicrous.

&#x200B;

I know in the US there is a wide variety of real estate companies that either buy and sell, or for listings, but i am not sure if there are any providing the service you are talking about. if there isnt, maybe its time to start one !"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Zillow is the obvious one not getting mentioned. 

I'm long in Redfin had a good earnings report and still dropped so you could call it a bargain right now... have some rocket mortgage shares too as that P/E is memeworthy, I think it's shorts holding it back right now."

03/27/2021,stocks,"The reason for why FSBO sells for lower, is because that everyone buys throgh a buyers agent, and friends have to protect friends, so they never show your house to their clients. Braindead clients don‚Äôt want to look it up on Zillow, so they just spread their ***hole for the agents. Our friends that sold their property didn‚Äôt do it FSBO may I add, but did it through an agent, and for what you should change in your house isn‚Äôt worth the <$60.000 in no f-ing way.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I do not want to get rid of realtors in any way. It just amazes me that realtors in the US take up to 6%, while in Denmark I would have to shelve up less than a tenth of that. How much time goes into selling a $1.000.000 house? I‚Äôve done it myself with my dad, and it took less than 30 workhours in todays hot market (Though the houses price was around $400.000). Hired a photograph for $500 and paid $1.500 for marketing and a open house with some catering. It‚Äôs not harder to sell a more expensive house (only if you go up the the multimillion dollar houses, but thats a different story), so the percantage fee makes no sence. The 30 hours would make a hourly wage of $2.000 dollars an hour if it was the US. I would never do FSBO again when I can do it for $5.000 through a service like Brikk, which I will use in the future."

03/27/2021,stocks,"There must be fewer agents per capita there. I used to date an agent and she would have starved with commissions like yours. I don't know about there, but it is very difficult to even get in to see houses for sale without an agent taking you through."

03/27/2021,stocks,OPEN is doomed by design.  Disastrous results last year . No role in a hot market for a company that offers 15% less for your property.

Back in 2009 sold a property my mom bought for 1350K.

Market was in crisis. Got offer for 850K and another willing to go up to 1150K but the wording allowed us to use this . It wasn't so clearcut ."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The system is arcaic. I went to Copenhagen to look up some properties, and I just called the agents to tell them I wanted a tour, and fit 5 tours into a single day - no problem. Brikk is even easier. You can book a tour like a hotel room, and they call you to confirm.

Brikk is a cheap agency, so open houses and so on are not included, and you have to pay extra $500 if a recall correctly. Most danes do not go that through that road, and use a tradiotinal agency which usually costs between $10.000-$15.000 (The rate is pretty much fixed)"

03/27/2021,stocks,"I mean, sure the seller is technically responsible for paying the buyer's agent. But where do you think the seller is getting the money to pay the agent? Who writes a big check at closing? The buyer pays for everything, including the seller's agent."

I've done a fair deal of realestate dealings in Denmark and 90% of buyers here use no agent of any kind, and they certainly get a good price. It's NOT hard to price a property, because It's all relative. To prove that we actully have a tv-show here were people are shown houses, and they have to guess how much it's for sale, and without even knowing the area and with no research the guess it fine. Homebuyers here look up what houses sold for in the area (which is public here), and then you just comparer it. A buyers agent is an arcaic and outdated system, which there is nearly no use for. 
The people who use buyers agents pay for them themselves, and their commision is based on how much is saved off the listing price, so their only job is to bargain."
03/27/2021,stocks,"yea that is true, that sub is likely filled with trash real estate agents that make us hate the industry"
03/27/2021,stocks,"if you sell  on your own without an agent, you are much more in control of closing costs. you can tell the sellers agent to suck a fat one, and ur not paying her shit. dont listen to what the moron REs tell you, they just trying to steal as much money as they can"

03/27/2021,stocks,"You are right, and the that's the reason for why FSBO doesn't work in the US, because the agents never show your house. The thing you can do is pay for MLS and offer the buyers agent a commission, so you only save 50%."

03/27/2021,stocks,"In the US the seller pays for both agents. That's the reason for the 5-6%. This is very smart cuz buyers are many times young so this helps keep market dynamic if they aren't paying for their Realtor .

Buyer agent is so one agent doesn't represent both parties ."
03/27/2021,stocks,"It makes NO diffrence if the seller pays for it all or the buyer or it's split 50/50

It's all money that gets reflected in the price. I can give you an example;

A man makes $5.000 a month pre tax and $3.000 after. The goverment decides that the employer should pay all the tax, because the employee is opressed. What would happen? He won't be making $5.000 after tax and he would still be making $3.000 after tax.

There is no such thing as the seller pays for it. Would you say the resturant pays for it if soda was taxed and you bought a can of soda? No ofcourse, because it's reflected in the price."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Most countries in Africa have 2 main problems: unstable/unchecked governments and lack of reliable, critical infrastructure. These are getting better in many countries, especially when it comes to problem no. 2. Unfortunately problem 1 is a bigger deal and will have a greater impact on your investments there, so you need to check the macro-view of each country's political situation before you invest. Bear in mind also that problem 2 is only becoming less of a problem because of direct investment from China (I won't go into why this is its own issue, you can look this up).

In my opinion countries to look at within the next 5 - 10 years would be Rwanda, Ethiopia (check laws on foreign ownership) and Ghana. If Botswana can alleviate its dependency on diamond exports it will also be worth checking out, as it has a more stable government than some Eastern European countries"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Investing in Aferica isn't ideal at least not now, most countries there have very little shareholder and real estate laws so getting scared is incredibly easy also most governments are not doing to great, your best bets would be to go with rewanda, south Aferica, Nigeria and some other but most countries are under developed or are in political turmoil. If you are going to do this an etf would EZA, AFK, NGE, but just do your reaserch and do it well this is not like investing in the US stock or real estate markets at all."
03/27/2021,stocks,Best returns come from places where other people don't dare to invest yet. All these doubtful answers make me think that investing in Africa might be a terrific idea.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I also believe Africa will be more important economically in the future, but for many of the nations they also need to develop more basic things like infrastructure first before they have a stock market. 

iShares has ETFs for South Africa ETF (EZA), and in what they call ""frontier markets"" (FM) which includes Morocco. but those are the only things I'm aware of specifically for African stocks. you need to account for very high risk of volatility and political turmoil with these types of investments. in more than a few cases of major revolution in unstable nations, the new governments take over and kick out or take control of all foreign companies and investors lose everything. Warren Buffett says he keeps stock certificates from Batista-era Cuba as a reminder for the risks of international investing."

03/27/2021,stocks,"lol i believe this is called dividend stripping, not sniping. although i think sniping is a better term for it if im being honest"
03/27/2021,stocks,The reason why the stock fluctuates around dividends is because dividends are a zero sum game. Where do you think the company is getting the money to pay the share holders? You are basically just putting that .50 from you right pocket and putting it in you left pocket. Don‚Äôt forgot about taxes too. Your scenario of $300 will be much less after taxes
03/27/2021,stocks,https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dividend-capture-strategy.asp
03/27/2021,stocks,">Although the price doesn‚Äôt fluctuate too much it does around earnings/dividend release.

that's because the dividend LITERALLY comes out of the share price. if the company stock it trading at $10 and they pay a 25 cent dividend, the share price will drop to $9.75 after they pay the dividend. if you sell immediately after the dividend, you're in the exact same position as before: you had $10 in stock, now you have $10 cash. plus you're taxed on the dividend and any capital gain. so the best strategy is to ride it out for the long-haul, rather than try to get in & out only for the dividend."
03/27/2021,stocks,"In my regular portfolio I have several dividend stocks.  I look for ones that have a consistent dividend without suspending dividends.

T is a good dividend stock but I put my money in monthly paying dividend stock.  I don‚Äôt get much growth but the potential of compounding dividends means I am less reliable on the market‚Äôs volatility."
03/27/2021,stocks,"there is a big issue with this investment strategy, and that is the tax impact of doing this

&#x200B;

the THOUGHT process is, if you make more on the dividend than you do on the decrease in share price, you come out ahead

&#x200B;

while this appears to be true on paper, that is not how the income tax structure works. you may deduct $3,000 in net losses on stock sales in a calender year. this means if the total amount of money you lost on buying/selling stocks (long or short term, it doesnt matter) is more than $3,000 than you can only take a 3k deduction, and the rest is rolled over to your next tax year -- indefinitely. 

&#x200B;

so this means if you do this strategy alot, and you come out ahead, lets say to be easy you double your money on every ex dividend snipe you make, for a total of 100k in dividends and a 50k loss in stock sales.. in reality when you file your taxes, you have 100k in dividends and a 3k loss in stock sales, and your are paying tax on 97k on dividends with a 47k rollover loss"

03/27/2021,stocks,clearing houses from my understanding
03/27/2021,stocks,Why do you think the lenders are getting shafted?
03/27/2021,stocks,I've read that Blackrock and Vanguard could make their bigger funds have a 0.0 expense ratio of they wanted because make so much from lending shares to shorts but they don't because they don't want to have to increase expenses if things go south.
03/27/2021,stocks,"This is really eye opening to me, but makes a lot of things click into place. I've noticed that on the retire early subreddits, that vanguard funds are pushed a lot. I took my own path to early retirement and I'd never encountered it much outside of an option in my 401k list, so I joined in the retirement subs a few months ago and found their entrenchment to be strange. 

But knowing that vanguard is a major share lender has me wondering: maybe this entrenchment of VTSAX isn't an organic finding that this is the best choice but a coordinated effort to make sure that large amount of assets are under their management. Especially because this allows for market control through share lending into shorting.

I have to think about this more, but this is kind of blowing my mind."
03/27/2021,stocks,so what is the clearing house's incentive to lend?
03/27/2021,stocks,There is quite a bit to be asked about the recent craze for index and ETF investing and its effects on the stock market. There are of course interests behind any idea that's pushed to the exclusion of all others.
03/27/2021,stocks,"If you had done even a trivial amount of reading, you would know that Vanguard effectively pioneered the extremely low-cost index fund, which attracted tons of investors who wanted to keep more money for themselves and pay less for fund management. It also has an unusual ownership structure wherein it is owned by fund shareholders, somewhat similar to a credit union. Other brokerages, notably Fidelity and Schwab, eventually lowered their fees to compete when they got tired of losing clients to Vanguard. In short, people invest with Vanguard because it has long offered reputable, low-cost index funds and does not face pressure by ownership to jack up its fees. VTSAX is simply popular because it is a diversified total market domestic fund.

Take your ""coordinated effort"" conspiracy theory trash back to WSB."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Haha no, look up Jack Bogle and Bogleheads"

03/27/2021,stocks,"Mainly because Europe's banking system has been frozen since 2008, the European union is the main issue, some counties are strong and others are weak for example Germany is a whole diffrent story than Greece, so raising rates is going to be a much bigger challenge in Europe than in America. Also most European banks aren't as big as the American ones which are commercial and investment, for example bnp paribas is both commercial and investment but bank of Ireland and bank of Portugal are not investment which means they are tied to rates far more, and on top of that people don't have much faith in the euro after Greece and the eurozone crisis. But I don't think buying Europe banks at all time low rates is a bad idea, eventually rates will rise and you will have gotten in at a great time."
03/27/2021,stocks,"European banks have been pretty dead since 2008. Crippled by high capital requirements and tight regulation in the wake of the subprime crisis. In addition, interest rates have been zero since then -> so interest business is no longer functional. And the investment business is not running at all in continental Europe. This is not a particularly capital market-savvy area, most corporate financing is via cheap loans rather than bonds, and many large companies are privately and not publicly listed. So: no interest, no investment business, no party for the banks."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Avoid any European bank or financial company in general.

EU works hard to mess up everything and try to keep the cake split as it is.

IMO, Germany should have at least a few big successful banks with its exporting reach. (DB seems to be the ginger step child of big investment banks). They don't for a reason."
03/27/2021,stocks,"From my perspective as a European, the banks did not recover from 2008 fully. There were no bailouts, 5 years ago as I remember there was a huge discussion to save or not Deutsche Bank from bankruptcy and the answer from the German government was no. They had to restructure the bank otherwise face bankruptcy even today they are still holding that burden of subprime loans and other derivatives.

Different European banks operate in their home countries mostly, so if the country prospects are bleak they have nowhere to go.

Europe is very tight in regulations. Too much government involvement. 

TIP: You have to be very careful analyzing bank fundamentals in general. There can be complex financial instruments that are equal to subprime mortgages."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The European banking sector is quite diffuse, with some stronger banks but also a lot of weaker banks. Especially bank in Southern European countries have risky balance sheets, while Northern European banks suffer from a lot regulation and expensive compliance obligations.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Alright thanks for your two cents. 
Funny how Germany is more capitalist than America not bailing out its banks. 
Although does that mean there were smaller banks in Germany that didn't over lend. Because I mean you need banks to run a country so they must have bailed out some of them right?"

03/27/2021,stocks,Alright thanks but even with these regulations there still making these results which seem very good again going back to the Portugal bank. 1.75B mkt cap and is making +400m with 7.5% profit margin.

But in case of insolvency issues, the entire Eurozone and especially southern European countries Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal would face a debt crisis close to bankruptcy.

My suggestion would be to stay away from European stocks for good. I mostly invest in the US market with only European stock which is SAP-"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think that Portugal has a pretty bad reputation in terms of business environment (high taxation, government interference etc.) so people tend to stay away, whether that's justified by fundamentals or not. Both Ireland and Portugal have terrible reputations as far as their banking systems are concerned due to huge scandals that happened there during the financial crisis of 2008. The same applies to Italy and Greece. In general in Europe the perception is that Germanic and Nordic countries are solvent and financially responsible while Ireland and Southern Europe are far from being so. So people tend to run away from banks in Ireland and in the South."

Chinese people wont go out of their way to buy xinjiang cotton. Thats not how that kind of nationalistic boycott-backlash works over there. You may however get lucky, if a western brand comes out and says they support them. That would motivate Chinese to support them in kind. - You  may not see much movement in stock price. I would think that would take a massive boost in profits. On the other hand, a western company saying they support Xinjiang cotton would probably not help thier sales in the US/western market lol.

I think the only winning play to be found in all of this is to find another industry to invest in, that isnt related to Xinjiang cotton. Too many volatile variables."
03/27/2021,stocks,So you want to invest not based on any valuation but purely as a reactionary on the pro forced labor side of the cotton industry because you see it as a pro China patriotic play? If you really want to support China why don't you just send them your $ directly instead of gambling.

Either way, you should've shorted Nike last week if you wanted to make any ""plays"" on this so-called movement that will probably blow over by next year. Perhaps you will have more foresight in the future.

But know this... unlike the Koreans who boycott or protest out of historical enmities and principal (even to the extent of their detriment), Chinese boycotts are done largely out of convenience, and ONLY with the blessing of the CCP. 

Did you know anti-Japanese nationalism was actually suppressed during the time of Mao? Diaoyu/Senkaku and war crimes only became a diplomatic issue after bilateral relations were normalized, and China became (and still is) one of the largest recipients of foreign aid, both in terms of soft loans and grants.

If you truly believe the Uighur ethic issue is going to become a much larger political rift between China and the world, I would be very wary of putting any money into Chinese exchanges. We are already seeing Western academics refusing to go to China out of fear of being arbitrarily detained and possibly rotting away in some Chinese gulag. It's only a matter of time before Western (American and European) investments pull out of China to prevent nationalization. I don't see Xi Jinping being afraid of losing foreign investment, he is clearly setting his eyes on domestic economic growth.

Edit:

China is also currently losing the vaccine war in east Asia as well.

https://mnews.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?newsId=N1006249288

You may call it vaccine racism, but it doesn't change the fact that even Asians are currently wary of China. I would not bet that Xi Jinping is going to be able to change Chinese perception abroad, and is going to be further inward looking, which is bad news for a foreign investor like you."

03/27/2021,stocks,I think they're more of a short play in this case.
03/27/2021,stocks,"not insider knowledge, but I do follow areas that frequently include nationalistic attitudes and backlash.

WHat I think would most likely happen is that they would boycott those companies that have come out publicly against Xinjiang. that would dampen sales obviously. Those Chinese companies that advertise their support will see a slight uptick, but nothing like a giant surge in sales.

They would support a western company that came out in support of them though. Its kind of a face/respect thing. They already support their own brands, but having a western brand come out in support would really motivate them to show their support of those who support ""them"" - if that makes any sense. 

I dont know that you would see much of a spike in sales though, you would have to research market shares and everything else to see how much of a presence they have in CH - how much they would benefit from that. 
Weighted with the backlash in the west of people over here boycotting them for their support,  sales may even out, who knows.

They have a very powerful public ""shun"" machine when you cross them(country pride). You can end your career if you support the wrong ""idea""  or screw up. - the equivalent happening in the west is that you can always come back. Its very difficult, if not impossible over there. 

The brands that boycotted, will have to  spend a lot on advertising and investment to come back to market share in CH, depending on how deep their condemnation was. It will defintely hurt their brand name over there though. They have also given an opening for any home grown, popular brand to break out and gain market share, so thats also something to look at.

They see the blanket attack on Xinjiang as an attack on them as a whole, despite the fact they may not support whats going on over there. Gov doesnt even have to do anything to those brands that are boycotting, public will do the damage for them for free.

TBH, im sure these western brands did research on how much it would effect them. They are too profit driven to make a genuine stand against injustice."
03/27/2021,stocks,I think betting on a handful of small to mid sized retail companies in the US is a really dumb way to play escalating trade tensions between the US and China when the companies will be exposed to many more macro factors that will impact them much more than news that will probably be forgotten in a week.

This is actually incorrect, but the discussion *is* helping me clarify how it *actually* works, so thank you.

The company release a general announcement of the meeting to the public. 

This announcement must be at least 60 days before the meeting, in order to give shareholders time to *recall* (i.e. have their broker ‚Äúlocate‚Äù) their shares.

The reason for this is that you can only vote if you are the *holder of record*. If your shares are held in a margin account, your broker can lend them out to be shorted and sold to other buyers. When this happens to your shares, *the new buyer becomes the holder of record for those shares, and therefore controls the voting right, not you.*

When the short seller covers their short sale, the shares are returned to the broker, and you become holder of record again.

Whoever is the holder of record on the ‚Äúdate of record‚Äù has the voting right.

The piece I‚Äôm still missing is **what precisely happens when you ask the broker to recall your shares if they have been lent to a short seller *and sold* to another buyer?**"

2021-03-27 19:57:47,stocks,"Carnival Cruise Warning Part 4 Continuing with my bearish thesis on Carnival Cruise.  New industry news just hit yesterday.

Florida Governor Ron Desantis has issued a demand that the CDC lift the sail restrictions on the cruise industry.  He has threatened lawsuits if needed.  Many seem to think this is a good thing.  I believe just the opposite.  Here is why.

1. This is very political now.  Doesn't make it right or wrong.  It just is.  Biden's CDC will not allow itself to be bullied by someone who many view to be a Trump knockoff.  It doesn't matter where you fall politically.  We have two forces that will refuse to give in and currently the CDC has the upper hand.
2. Desantis' lawsuit won't go anywhere.  The CDC will very easily be able to make its case as to why they think allowing cruising would be a safety hazard.  They will point to the virus variants, the unknowns about them and the surge in Europe.  Also a Florida University Epidemiologist is quoted saying:

*""Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist, defended the ban, saying it is still too early for cruise ships to operate. Unlike other modes of transportation, families and groups on cruises mingle and dine together for long periods, increasing the likelihood of spread, she said, and testing and symptom screening are not perfect methods of prevention. ""*

So the CDC will easily be able to make their case if a lawsuit happens.  They have many examples to give to show how they came to their decision.

3) Both the cruise industry and Gov. Desantis have stated that people should not be required to get vaccinated in order to go on a cruise.  This is just foolish on their part.  The CDC will never go for that and the public would probably agree.  Most of the bullish types on here cite vaccines as a reason Carnival will recover.  But Carnival and Desantis are both saying that vaccines shouldn't be a requirement.

Finally.  I believe that if Gov Desantis has done anything he has just brought attention to the major problem the cruise industry is having.  People smell blood in the water now.  I would not be surprised if formerly unaware investors are now getting concerned and thinking about dumping their positions until things turn around.

I am posting a link to show where I got my information.

&#x200B;

Adding an update:

Royal Caribbean is now receiving boycott threats all because they planned a few fully vaccinated cruises.  The idea that vaccinations are being well received is incorrect and many people won't be getting them.  This will be an issue moving forward.

[https://news.yahoo.com/royal-caribbean-says-boycott-cruise-120700142.html](https://news.yahoo.com/royal-caribbean-says-boycott-cruise-120700142.html)

Another Update:

Norwegian just canceled a bunch of summer cruises.  They notified customers that they were bailing.  Norwegian is redeploying.  Some suspect that they will be operating out of non US ports now.  Carnival president has already stated they are not leaving US ports.  So if Norwegian is leaving because they believe summer sailing from the US is a no go then Carnival is screwed.

There‚Äôs a fine line to tread on right now and I think optimism will keep the stock relevant for another couple months until a potential worst case scenario even has the chance to take hold and drive the stock way, way down.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Wouldn't you think conceding to the vaccine requirement for cruises be acceptable though? Our vaccine timeline is aggressive but now seems realistic. I'm in the last priority group (like most people) and will be able to get a vaccine in NV starting April 5th (already have an appointment). The majority of states open up to all on April 15th. I don't see a vaccine requirement as a non-starter and if that is what gets cruises back, I would think your thesis would be wrong. The only real pullback at that point is new variants resistant to vaccines (which would affect the whole market).

I appreciate the negative outlook, as there should always be two sides, and as someone who is invested in the industry, I do take these posts seriously. It does seem like there is bias here though. Saying the CDC will easily to be able to make their case seems like too broad of an argument. You should always be laying out bull *and* bear pathways, regardless of your ultimate conclusion. Cruiselines can also easily make *their* case based around other industries being given the green light but not being any different. Movie theaters, bars/restaurants, etc? Again, if they concede to a vaccine requirement, there should be *no issue here*. The previously mentioned industries do not require one and able to operate 100%. Those industries serve *way more customers* on a day to day basis. Allowing a finite group of vaccinated individuals on a cruise should not be a case that is singled out."

03/27/2021,stocks,"I didn't ""make"" it bullish. It's fact - they have shit tons of assets to be liquidated. That's assuming it even goes to bankruptcy, which is not a foregone conclusion. 

The difference between CCL and some company like Hertz is that Hertz didn't own their cars - so when it came time for adjudication, shareholders got completely shafted. Now, what that would look like in the _actual practice_ is anyone's guess - shareholders are always last in line - but those cruise liners are giant assets. 

Realistically, if CCL was doing that poorly, they likely wouldn't go bankrupt, they'd likely get bought out by someone who _isn't_ doing poorly who is looking to swallow up other sectors. Think, DIS. They've got cruise lines and a pretty big budget for further cornering the market on vacation spending."

I've been looking at many companies and performance and have come to the upsetting conclusion that stocks don't mean anything about a company and vice versa.

Munger and Buffet famously relentlessly promote Coca-Cola as a value stock, but looking at their growth and price stability, HOW can a company be worth the same 20 years later and not increase in value?

The same goes with diversified mega-corporations like Panasonic. They make everything, but their price has FALLEN over the past 20 years.

Even titans of tech giants like IBM have been consistently dropping in value and rivaling their height at the dotcom bubble of 2001. Maybe it's their 5% dividend?

&#x200B;

On the other hand you have people like AAPL, MSFT, FB, and maybe TSLA, if you ignore their squeeze, who have hit 3-5x growth in the past 5 years.

It's feeling to me like companies that form the backbone of our civilization and produce the underlying goods and services that make it run are being dwarved by the screens you click on while shitting and playing candy crush.

&#x200B;

Does anybody understand the fundamental systems at place that are causing these ""real"" companies to die while the hot tech stocks just do cartwheels across the market? It's probably not greedy hedge funds, so what is it that's making these valuable companies lose value?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Cigna is a value stock and they've ripped over the last month. 

Lazard is a value stock and they're up 7% for me since I bought them a couple months ago (with a nice dividend on the side).

I think you're just looking at bad examples. I'm really not a fan of KO and never looked into Panasonic.

IBM is a victim of having been an industry leader and watching competitors catch up and wave on by. They haven't been an industry leader for 10 years now and they haven't seemed to notice yet. Has been company

Important when looking at value fundamentals to ask yourself. Is there a reason the company I am looking at is poorly valued right now? Sometimes, companies are ""undervalued"" because they are in a failing industry, they are a downtrending company or they've come under scrutiny.  In other words, you need to make sure a company that qualifies as a value stock by value metrics is actually undervalued and not just a bad investment."
03/27/2021,stocks,There is a difference between what a stock trades at vs what it is worth.  Traditionally value stock have been defined as trading below intrinsic value.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Why Buffet like Coca cola so much is because nowdays he gets about half his initial investment in dividends every year which i find absolutely amazing, inv 1.3B get 600M+ every year and its an extremely safe investment.

Diamond hands and HODLing for a very long time and you see that interest on interest will give a lot of tendies too

I don't see that this stock is falling like you said but i guess value stocks are sensitive to treasury yields like the 10y bond making market shift toward value investing and of course opposite when it falls.

So i guess the question is why go for boring value stocks when u can YOLO and go for the squeeze on GME and buy a Tesla for your wife's boyfriend tomorrow?

The value stock way takes a long time but with very low risk and your wife's boyfriend is almost guaranteed a nice Volvo in a more distant future."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Buffett has a totally different problem than many of us. When your managing that much money, your main goal is to probably increase it above inflation rates and to not lose money. Thats why he probably invests his money in safer market that will likely continue to expand or not crumble fast. Plus the dividends he receives are signifficant.

For many of us who have a smaller amount of capitol, I think its better than you look for opportunities to significantly beat the market. Within a year, Buffett talks about inefficiencies that happen every year. Just analyze the ebb and flow of some of the most popular stocks within a year. You'll see that at some point they drop pretty significantly from their highs only to bounce back."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Business lifecycle, look this up. Early young companies make no profits and are in full growth stage trying to reinvest all their revenue. As they mature they finally start making some profit but are still growing. As they get bigger they tend to mature and eventually there's usually a decline. 

As they get bigger too u usually see less growth and companies take on more debt. 

Example:

Stage 1: peloton
Stage 2: netflix
Stage 3: coca cola
Stage 4: toyota 

The big tech companies we see now are a little interesting because they are still heavy in reinvesting a lot of their earnings back into the company and going into new territories. For example amazon's profit margins are 5% because it takes everything else and puts it back into the company so even tho they are huge companies they are trying to grow."
03/27/2021,stocks,"*goes to answer question about coca cola, figuring it must be dividends not reflected in the price*

Ok, so that's not great but it's not bad, what about those dividends.

*Quick Google finds it's [a little above 3%](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=ko) annualized.*

*Decide I'm not really sure what OP means and I probably can't answer the question.*"
03/27/2021,stocks,"It's because there has been a paradigm shift.

The new ""value investing"" is Growth At A Reasonable Price.

What is traditional value investing is now an extension of the Value Trap.  Previously, the Value Trap applied only to declining companies, like MLPs in the energy sector.

I guess that, the moment companies start paying dividends proper (not stock buyouts like Apple), their stocks become value traps."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Warren's philosophy revolves around value investing and buying what you know. Warren doesn't know tech, and he knows that he doesn't.

Investing is all about risk management; how much risk are you taking on for a realistic reward? What happens if you lose a large portion of your money? I personally don't want to spend an extra five to ten years not retired because of a stupid mistake trying to double my money.

It's not as simple as buying Apple or Microsoft and earning 30% average per year. There were many years where they traded sideways or downwards. Look at Microsoft from 2001 to 2014. Thirteen years of doodoo in terms of equity appreciation. It can happen again.

Many of the companies you see popularized today will not be around in 5 to 10 years. For some reason it is popular to lose money and then try to go public.

I wouldn't hesitate to call myself a value investor. One of my ""top"" holdings is eBay. I don't expect for eBay to 10x overnight, but I do believe that it is fundamentally undervalued, and that it is an e-commerce/tech company that pays a dividend. I'll probably still be holding this company in 10 years, and my dividend yield on cost should be pretty juicy at that point, so long as they continue to up the dividend. eBay is also relatively recession proof, as people will continue to buy and sell on their platform no matter what the economy looks like, which brings risk down.

I'm long MSFT, AAPL and EBAY.

The price of the larger companies you mentioned has a lot to do with how much money they are making. IBM is still a fantastic company, but they don't raise their earnings by much. They have quite a bit of debt based on a quick look at finviz, and their dividend payout ratio looks like it is 103%, which is a little ""uh-oh"", as it means they are paying out more than they can afford to, putting their dividend at risk.

There are lots of value plays out there. I think Utz is a good value. WMT or TGT are arguably value companies.

He tells me (and his VP tells him) that the company is plagued by what I like to call ""organizational drag"". There are so many teams doing so many things that nothing really gets done. Some code gets written and then shelved because another team feels their toes are being stepped on. Some product gets designed and then changed ad nauseam before anyone ever starts to build it. They had their day in the sun and can basically coast off dividends. Being big and formerly successful doesnt count for much without innovation. Does Panasonic make phones yet? Many of these former leaders are quite behind the 8 ball in 2021"
03/27/2021,stocks,"These value companies do have value. When you are on reddit, you only see Retail investors investing most their money on tech sector but when you look at these hedge funds they own a lot of these value stocks. Most of Retail investors don't have a diversified portfolio are heavily invested into tech. As a retail investor when you only have $5k to invest in lets say, its much more juicer to invest in tech. You also have to remember that a lot of stock valuation is based on the potential future of the company. KO, for example doesn't have same growth anymore if they did they probably wouldn't be paying dividends like all the other growth stocks. When you are talking about dividend stocks don't forget about the dividends. If you have T($30) for example that pays $2 every year in dividends, you have increased your value by $2. The bare minimum goal of investing is to be inflation. With inflation at 1.5% and T dividend yield at 7% you are beating inflation. It doesn't look at much when you own 10 of these stocks but as a hedge fund that owns 1,000,0000 KO stock that dividends adds a lot.  These value stocks aren't losing money. I think you are looking at the charts wrong. KO was at $60 in 2020 before coronavirus crashed the market. 6 Months ago KO was around $49.30 now it is at $53. Don't forget that tech is the future that's why its always hot but Value stocks will always have a placed in investor's portfolios."

The question comes down to whether shorters really were able to cover back in January as  they claimed to have.  Was the huge price spike due to them covering or merely the result of the gamma squeeze at that time.

Some things to consider also are that we've been in a bull market for a while, so these gains may not be sustainable on a 5-10 year track record. Buffett just seems more about reducing risk than looking for gains. The amount of money he has to manage also likely makes it difficult for him to find a good place to invest it. If he throws it all in one place, it could significantly jump up the price of a stock. Lots of more things for him to consider when managing his money than us small fries.

A tech company can also be a value company.

Apple also follows some of the traditional aspects of value investing. It is a fairly simple company, someone can easily explain how Apple makes its money. It has an enormous amount of cash on hand, and they strive towards excellence in their products, which Warren likes.

03/27/2021,stocks,Why do boomers go for companies that seemingly have dismal growth with even negative returns when they can... MAKE money instead of losing it? I've even looked at a couple of little <$1B cap companies because of GME-cross-correlation DD I've been researching. Big firms have holdings in stocks that are losing them money. Why?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Most people (all ages) tend to assume the future is a straight trendline of the present.  Back in the day, when Boomers were your age and knew everything, KO and IBM were the growth stonks.  You're now assuming that AAPL and MSFT will be forever, or at least you're implying that by saying that's what needs to be bought and people buying other things are stupid.  You might be right, you might also get caught in a dead end.  That's what makes a market.  But if you fall in love with one stock and expect it will perform over the next decade as it has over the last one, you too can find yourself with a company who either quit growing in favor of a new technology (BB a decade ago) or one that's valuation grew way too fast and the actual cash flow has to catch up with it (TSLA, probably). 

Also, Boomers have lived through an inflation cycle, but had never experienced an extended period of declining interest rates to zero.  Things will look familiar to them when/if interest rates zoom and inflation picks up.  Will they to you?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"This is a pretty complicated question but it's a good one. The simple answer is that they've been lead to believe that this is the way of investing. What gets complicated is examining why they were lead to believe this, why they took on this belief, and why this belief doesn't match reality.

It used to be that the boomer style of investing was the best route to the best gains. A lot of lore has been built up around this (""time in the market beats timing the market"", ""90% of traders can't beat the index"", etc) and this lore was appropriate a long time ago. But things changed.

Why they changed is something for economic history books in the next century. However, I find that [this video](https://altcensored.com/watch?v=OF87sMjYlws) has a pretty good grasp on why boomer mentality doesn't really work anymore. And this video only scratches the surface, it doesn't think about multi-decade low interest environments (it's from 2008) and massive quantitative easing and retail push through apps. Even though it misses many of the things we're facing today, it still has a strong basis in the fundamenta idea that too many dollars are being herded into the market making it weird.

Now, go back to the boomers. They are part of that herding. It's important to keep them corraled and the way to do that is to represent anything other than putting assets under management in some broad index fund is too much risk.

And while Coca Cola has its growth eaten by other cherry picked tickers, the truth is that people near retirement with a lot of money really only need a 3% dividend and 4% growth to maintain their lifestyle. And retirement is often mostly about maintaining a lifestyle. And it can be scary to think that you could be in an Apple but you could also be in an Amiga and that's not good."

2021-03-27 19:12:00,stocks,"Would like some feedback on my first ever DD. (DIS) **Disclaimer:** I am aware of the fact that Disney does not need a DD. I started investing at the beginning of this year and i want to improve my knowledge and skills. I took Disney because there is quite some information to find and I also strongly believe in the brand. I buy 1 or 2 stocks each month and invest a total of around ‚Ç¨600 monthly, so its fair to say Disney is an important part of my portfolio.

The calculations i made were manually done, this is also because I wanted to be able to understand the calculations and the meaning of what i am looking for. (Even tho some of it are super easy to find on Yahoo Finance) If i made mistakes, I would appreciate it if you point that out.

I am aware i have still loads to learn, but the books im reading dont give me any insights of how I use the knowledge. So thats why i wanted to test and share it with you guys.

# The Walt Disney Company

Disney is the biggest entertainment company of the world. They own the biggest themeparks and also offer cruiselines, resorts and spa‚Äôs.

Disney financially took over Marvel, Pixar, Hulu, Lucasfilm, ABC, National geographic, ESPN and now have their own (growing insanely fast) Disney + streaming service.

Disney has one of the worlds biggest brand awereness and customer life time value.

# Financials

**Revenue** (2020)      $65.388 billion

**Cost of revenue**    $43.880 billion

**Gross profit**            $21.508 billion

**S*****olvency***

Common Stock Equity $88,877 / Total Assets $193,984 x100 = 45,81%

The rule of thumb indicates that between 25% and 50% solvency, the company has enough own recources to pay of their debts.

***Profitability***

Net Income Common Stockholders -2,864 /Common Stock Equity 83,583 = -3,42%

Obviously this doesnt say much since the pandemic caused the loss. So i also calculated the profitability 2019:

11,054 / 88,877 x100 = **12,43%**

Meaning that for every invested dollar, they make 12 cents. **(right?)** which is, according to my knowledge, pretty good. Especially since the pandemic already started in this year.

**Earnings per share (EPS)**

TTM EPS $-2.74

2020 EPS was $-1.58, a 123.8% decline from 2019.

2019 EPS was $6.64, a 20.57% decline from 2018.

2018 EPS was $8.36, a 46.92% increase from 2017.

Now the EPS at this moment is again, affected heavily by the pandamic. So it doenst tell much yet.

**P/E RATIO**

The current P/E ratio cant be calculated due to net losses. However last year Disney was around 30 which is pricy, but not too bad. The forward PE is way higher, around 41. That sure does sound like a lot but its not that bad compared to the PE of Netflix (83.56) .

# Buyback

Disney spent $47.9 billion on share buybacks from 2009 through 2018. However it may be on pause until 2023 due the pandemic.

Personally im not a huge fan of Buybacks, but the opinion about this fact are quite diverse.

# Leadership

Before becoming CEO on February 25, 2020, Bob Chapek had a 26-year career with The Walt Disney Company, beginning in the Home Entertainment division, and rising to become the Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Before joining Disney, Bob Chapek worked for the famous Heinz Company in brand management and advertising. Chapek studied Microbiology at the Indiana University.

In the 26 years working for Disney, Bob Chapek got promoted in 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015. While working as chairman of merchandise, he was in charge of the Star Wars merchandise which resulted in a succes, even though there was quite some resistance from Starwars and Disney fans.

# News

* Walt Disney World, Shanghai Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland are open
* Paris Disneyland(opening April 2) and Disney's California(opening April 30) theme parks and resort hotel remain closed.
* This year, Disney+ will expand to Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets.
* **The company now expects to have 230 million-260 million Disney+ subscribers by 2024. Netflix, by comparison, has 195.15 million subscribers**.
* Analysts expect EPS to fall 5% in the current fiscal year ending in September, followed by a 154% jump in fiscal 2021, according to FactSet.
* In the last three months of 2020, as Disney laid off thousands of employees, its shares surged 46%.
* DIS stock hit an all-time high of 203.02 on March 8(2021)
* Walt Disney along with ESPN, have reached an immersive, multi-year media rights agreement for exclusive live UFC content on ESPN+
* Disney had a huge dip in March 2020, being the cheapest since 2014. Part of this was because of COVID, negative revenue and probably because of a new CEO, Bob Chapek.

However within a year, the stockprice increased with 130% and hit an all time high. The huge succes of Disney + being a good reason for that. Especially with series like The Mandalorian and paid movies like Mulan Disney+ will only grow.

# Stockprice

My take is that the current price of $185 is justified. Yes, it is expensive but with the parks re-opening and Disney+ creeping up to Netflix i think Disney is an obvious buy and hold for the long term.

They have a wide spread of products, have lifetime customers and i think i can defenitly say they are a MOAT. I personally think that about 20 years, Disney will have a monopoly on the entire entertainment industry.

As for now, the 4 billion loss from the past 12 months dont bother me too much since covid is the main reason. Their debt of 113 billion is high, but its not concerning since the interest is low. The solvency proves they can pay of their debts if they wanted to. Also its quite normal for companies this size to have large debts.

**I do see a lot of different numbers regarding to their debt. I took the number here:** [**https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/disney/debt-equity-ratio**](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/DIS/disney/debt-equity-ratio)

# Negatives

Disney isnt a perfect company, and are even seen as evil company by some people. Over the years they had quite some scandals, some examples:

* The new movie Mulan was filmed in XinJiang, the place where Uyghurs are being held in ‚Äò‚Äôre-education‚Äô‚Äô camps.
* Disney threatened to sue daycare centers because they used Disney stickers in the daycare without their permission
* Disney stopped paying dividends in 2020
* Disney told a stonemason that carving Winnie the Pooh into a child‚Äôs gravestone would violate its copyright.
* Disney asks a lot from their employees while heavily underpaying them. Allthough some employees got a raise, there are still a lot of works working their ass off while struggle to make a living.
* Their ethics are often questioned around child marketing and the insane prices the parks charging, creating parents having to save up for years for a visit.
* Reaching an ATH stockprice while being in one of the worst periods of the company could be alarming
* Over the years Disney is seen as a money hungry company that is far away from their own company branding and mission/vision.

And probably many more im overlooking."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Some solid DD, and I think Disney is a good long-term play. Though I do think there may be some pullback over the coming months/year. Beyond Covid, I think they're suffering indigestion from eating a large Fox.


Here's a look into their financials: https://imgur.com/a/DfeBEVS"
03/27/2021,stocks,I view Disney as a long term hold stock. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they monopolize the streaming market. They also have unlimited spinoff material with their current catalog.
03/27/2021,stocks,buy and forget - long Micky and his empire
03/27/2021,stocks,I think DIS share price action will look a lot like NFLX price action from the past 5 years which was based almost entirely on subscription numbers.  Look at the 5 year on NFLX and tell me you don‚Äôt wanna be on that train.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Came in here to say DD on DIS is a waste of time, just buy it and hold until you retire...then I read the first sentence. üòÖ"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Disney is one of my big investments right now, too. I see them rapidly expanding in streaming and being a big winner there, driving the company from $350B up to a $T in a few years. They've got all the pieces in place to dominate modern media."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Consider me a Boomer, I guess, but I sold our Disney stocks in January. I missed the $200+ ATH, but I just didn‚Äôt see the positives outweighing the negatives. I had been buying Disney regularly since 2009, when it was $19 per share, and I thought the $145ish that it hovered around during the MCU era was a good investment and a reasonable price target. However, with (spoiler alert) Tony Stark dead, Thor fat, and the inability to continue the Spider-Man series, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be a solid revenue source. Their CGI movies are becoming a little too cookie cutter, I agree with many of the concerns about their policies and statements, and the parks are both too crowded and too expensive. When you spend a couple hundred dollars to get into the park and then spend 45 minutes waiting in line for one ride (or even one snack), the cost-per-experience is outrageous! You can show me all the analytics you want, but I, personally, don‚Äôt see support for a price for Disney of more than $175 per share. I am probably wrong, but I‚Äôm willing to live with that and invest my money elsewhere. 

On the other side of the coin, lots of parents and grandparents like the sentiment of buying shares of Disney stock for their kids, so there is some psychological benefit there.  However, if Disney keeps coming up with stupid moves like the ‚Äúno Winnie the Pooh on tombstones‚Äù policy, eventually that will burn up as well."
03/27/2021,stocks,What did your DCF tell you?
03/27/2021,stocks,"I got in DIS at around $90 about 5 years ago. I unloaded most of my position last week. The company is great. They have a cult following. They have made smart acquisitions. I have no doubt they will be around in 50 years still making obscene amounts of money. But right here and now, DIS streaming blasted shares off to the stratosphere and I would like to re-enter closer to $140 for a long term hold. There are better opportunities for holding long and collecting a dividend and I am not 100% convinced that COVID is over and the parks will reopen and stay open."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes. I found it interesting that now the movie theatres are closed, Disney made huge profits selling a new movie on Disney +.

[Although Mulan will be available for free in December 2020, it still made the studio $35.5 million in net profits. Disney reported a 68% increase in Disney+ downloads](https://screenrant.com/mulan-2020-movie-disney-plus-office-success-failure/#:~:text=Mulan%20was%20not%20the%20first,%2435.5%20million%20in%20net%20profits)

Movie theatres make more money, but having so many extra paid users on your streaming service might actually profit them more in the long run."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your reply. You defenitly made some solid points. Amazing you got to buy the stocks for $19!

I think, in the end, it really depends if you believe in their future plans or not.

Overcrowded parks can be fixed by building new parks, if the prices are building up too high and they are losing customers they can reduce the price.

The movies they made was an entire direction of what Disney used to do, they will probably learn from their mistakes and try to make them better. Their animation movies are still amazing.

You are defenitly not wrong to have a different opinion, its just a matter of opinion i think."
03/27/2021,stocks,"DIS may have already hit it's ceiling, but I wouldn't say it's because the movies are going to get less popular. Thor won't be fat by the middle of next movie guaranteed and they are still making Spider-Man movies, they just had a slight hiccup with his licensing for a month or two. 

I don't think interest is waning in the parks either, we all know those people that make disney world every vacation ever year. 

At the same time, I don't see interest necessarily increasing in the long term. So, I'd say we can agree Disney is about where it will stay, if not settle a little lower, even if we came to the conclusion for different reasons."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That is understandable.. I would have done some selling along the way too if I got in at $19.

But I got in investing late into this 2020 bull run. It was expensive af getting in but I trust them going forward.

From movies in the pipeline to shows, I like the creative decisions they are going for. Disney just have really good creators underneath them, that knows the formula to make great family friendly content. That will never go out of style. With the biggest IPs in entertainment owned by them, it will just benefit their streaming services even more into the future. 5 years from now it could very be likely DIS and HBO have better content than Netflix. Some people already say those two have surpassed Netflix.

On their theme parks.. I hear the complaints about raising prices.. But then you see reports about the attendance on their parks and hotels, along with expansions currently in the works and it gives you confidence about the business moving forward.

They pretty much have a monopoly on family friendly entertainment and media.. I'm holding DIS for a long long time. Adding bit by bit every month."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The entire Mulan thing was brilliant solely because of the information they could get out of the consumer response data. There were obviously tons of complaints online, but the people who could afford it the least were the loudest, IMO."
2021-03-27 19:11:48,stocks,"Why did DKNG have such an awful week? I'm a noob trying to learn. One of my first stock purchases was DKNG. Got in relatively early and have made a handomse profit.

 Followed Buffet's advice of buy what you know/like. I love the DKNG app and I'm a sports bettor and a daily fantasy sports player. DKNG makes great apps, offers so much (daily fantasy, sports book, Casino games, pools). They reward loyalty and they sign league sponsorships left and right. Also they've shown the willingness to integrate  e sports betting  and e sports wagering is something I think will blow up in the next few years. 

In an effort to learn, why is the stock trading down almost 14% this week?

I understand stocks fluctuate and I don't expect growth week after week but I was wondering if there was news/a catalyst that prompted this.

I looked and I really only saw positive news. The NCAA tourney I assumed would be a good thing (even on a small scale). I thought NY legalizing gambling would be good news. At first it seemed books like DKNG would be shut out by NY state legislature but I'm pretty sure I read that now it seems like they're warming to the idea of letting books like DraftKings operate in the state.

I'm not experienced enough to know if this is even a good question but was it profit taking when it ran up to ~$73 earlier this month? 

So I'm not panicking. I'm not complaining my gains don't come weekly. I'm just trying to hone my research skills. Did I miss something or is this just a case of stocks being stocks?"

Just wanted to comment on this bit real quick. It literally doesnt matter at all if a company has good or bad news, what matters is if the news is better or worse than expectations. People dont buy stocks based on how a company is doing now, they buy them based on how they expect they will do in the future, and they price the stock based on those expectations.

A company's stock *will go down* when positive news is released if the market expected better news, and a company's stock *will go up* when bad news is released if the market expected worse news."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Wow, you Apple fanboys are only 8 years behind the Android fanboys this time. Really closing the gap!"
03/27/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs bc they signed way too many NDA‚Äôs with the department of defense and Microsoft. Seems they‚Äôre finding alternate and valid routes now.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I pee en eff eff, perhaps :)"
2021-03-27 18:13:16,stocks,Production disruption from East Asia So I heard from two different manufacturers in EU that there has been a strange disruption of supply lines of all kinds of manufactured materials needed for factories in EU. Plastic Packaging and other materials. Anyone heard similar things and know why that could be and what bigger impacts can be? This started happening since December and is not related to Suez.
03/27/2021,stocks,"The disruption is not strange and it was anticipated months ago (at least by Samsung). Various parts of the world go in lockdown, then they go out etc etc. I work for a large EU retailer of consumer electronics and heard this news around november. Buy-in pricies for various product groups have increased too and deliveries are to be expected to be disrupted troughout  2021."
03/27/2021,stocks,Some kinda Brexit knock on?
03/27/2021,stocks,Interesting...
03/27/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs the C V 19 backlash combined with many shipping issues.

Places are starting and stopping due to supply issues.  

We have auto factories all the world shutting down due to micro chip shortages.  
We have capital equipment companies shutting down waiting for  repair parts for machines.  
This global, just in time, and leveraged manufacturing system doesn‚Äôt allow for things in India to stop which prevents Germany from assembly which shuts down the water pump maker in China which takes 3 factories in the USA down because the toilets can‚Äôt pump the poo away 

Not to mention the 3 giant ships that have lost cargo to the bottom of the ocean thanks to weird giant waves 

Isolationism doesn‚Äôt seem so bad now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Edit: correct typo"
03/27/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/27/2021,stocks,Interesting.
03/27/2021,stocks,Okay can someone translate this text with 0.5 thought speed?
03/27/2021,stocks,Doesn't make sense to deliberately disrupt low tech supply chain since it can be moved elsewhere.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Parts made all over the world

World shutting down at different times 

Shipping issues Before the canal, sinking containers & all the boats are in the wrong spots (or empty when planned to be full)

I can‚Äôt build my $80k widgets because I‚Äôm waiting on a $3 dollar computer chip 

All the people who supply me parts, can‚Äôt work because their warehouses are full 

And the butterfly effect keeps rolling,  economics guys best guess 12 more months of supply and shipping issues"
2021-03-27 17:47:43,stocks,"Robinhood alternative I am trying to teach my little brother about stocks and get him involved in the stock market. He has never invested before and does not have too much knowledge, but I plan on helping and guiding him to learn about it and get his feet wet. 

I know the robinhood app is great for beginners, but given its recent history, I don‚Äôt want my brother to sign up with them. 

Are there any other good apps for beginners? I invest with fidelity and tdameritrade, but I don‚Äôt find their mobile apps to be very user friendly for young beginners.

Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!"
03/27/2021,stocks,What about SoFi?
03/27/2021,stocks,"I kinda hate to say it, but to hell with apps for beginners.  It's so easy to get fleeced accidentally with something you don't understand.  I'd say shove him into the deep end with Vanguard.  Sure, the site is a bit clunky and difficult to understand at first, but they are a fantastic company that actually takes protecting their investors seriously.  

They also have some great learning tools and some truly phenomenal customer service.

TL;DR:  Don't worry about ease of use, worry about a reputable broker.  The best way to learn how the market works is slowly."
03/27/2021,stocks,SoFi seems to be the much better version of Robinhood.
03/27/2021,stocks,Fidelity has a new app called Fidelity Spire. It‚Äôs supposed to be a lot easier to manage and work with
03/27/2021,stocks,SoFi
03/27/2021,stocks,I'm a beginner myself and I've found E-trade to be somewhat easy to understand.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thinkorswim/TD Ameritrade is pretty excellent. I like the TOS app a lot, it has paper money, and they have a series of educational videos."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve heard concerns about WeBull‚Äôs Chinese ownership, CCP. Something to consider. 

I‚Äôm not making a political statement. Just some dude on Reddit lol"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Public, Dough. Public has a social media-like feed where you can have constructive dialogue with other users."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I like the simplicity of cashapp, but don't like how trades are only placed twice a day, meaning you tend to pay the most and sell for the least (market open is a peak buying time). If you're trying to teach a young user, maybe start with paper trading on one of your apps?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Merrill lynch or edge by bank of america, are they the same"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Do Think or Swim, Fidelity, or Vanguard. My thoughts are that if you're a beginner any of the platforms should be good enough to get someone started. The important thing is providing enough basic knowledge for them to understand the process of using the brokerage to buy/sell stocks. I would consider having them branch out elsewhere when they want to do more advanced things like options. If anything, use a decent broker and download the RH, Webull, or yahoo finance app to track your favorite stocks."
03/27/2021,stocks,How old is your little brother?
03/27/2021,stocks,I got onto Fidelity at 18 years old and that was 2 decades ago. It aint hard.
03/27/2021,stocks,Personally I think you should be using a desktop computer for trading. I like Fidelity.
03/27/2021,stocks,Fidelity is what I switched to when I left robinhood. The mobile and desktop versions are a bit different from one another and have a steeper learning curve but it gives you better tools for trading and access to data
03/27/2021,stocks,ThinkorSwim
03/27/2021,stocks,"Just teach him with the same app you‚Äôre using. You already understand it, and will be able to explain it much better to him"
03/27/2021,stocks,Haven't used it but M1 finance is supposed to be good for investing (not trading)
03/27/2021,stocks,"Check out Webull. They have good tutorials that explain how to use the app and teach the very basics of trading. Also have a paper trading section.

It's the only app I've ever used, so I can't give you a comparison. I like it though."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Look up paper trading apps. There's a few of them out there.

If you want him to learn have him start there for 3 months. It's invaluable to have a little practice and see where your decisions lead without the fear of messing up big time.

Then, once he's more comfortable with all of the concepts and has a plan one of the less friendly (but more sound) apps shouldn't be overwhelming with him.

I agree though, unfortunately for UI, RH was king, but hopefully someone is looking to step in and fill that void that was just created."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôd start with IBKR and do a paper trading account. Imo best way to learn the market and its 0 risk, so he can go nuts and learn from his mistakes without losing money."
03/27/2021,stocks,My recommendation is eTrade as they are a no nonsense company and do not play as many games with their customers as so many others do.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Did you actually try searching ""Robinhood alternative?"" Because if you had you'd see it's been asked and answered a million times already."
03/27/2021,stocks,"There‚Äôs a dozen names already in here but I recently switched to Moomoo (The app from Futu Holdings) and I really like it.

Perhaps it‚Äôs not the best platform for a beginner, as there is a LOT of information and charts provided, but the UI and capabilities have surpassed just about anything else I‚Äôve tried.

Disclosure: I own about ~500 shares of FUTU. I downloaded Moomoo to see if I trust the app I invested in and I‚Äôm genuinely a satisfied customer/investor."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Random question, are there any penalties other than not being able to trade from switching to another brokerage when you just finalized switching over to a new one? 

Switched from RH to Webull but they don‚Äôt have DRIP and their ways of cash settling is a bit odd. Was thinking of switching to Ameritrade but was probably gonna wait a while to avoid any issues"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think the best advice is to make sure he is investing long term first. Get him set up with a good savings account and a ROTH IRA and then if he shows interest in trading stocks, revisit which platform to use."
03/27/2021,stocks,Get a proper execution broker like DEGIRO or flatex (Europe)
03/27/2021,stocks,"Every time I read one of these threads I just feel older and older... I am only 40, but fuck, I guess put me in an old folks home... 

I never use an app. ever. I work a 9-5 on the west coast. I am literally at my desk at my computer during market hours, I have no need or want for a less efficient way of viewing data and making trades than a large desktop UI. 

So with that bias clear...I like Fidelity. Definitely download and use the active trader pro. Live stock prices, tons of data available at your finger tips. and if you are into that sort of thing, it appears quick margin and options approval. Both were done within a business day for me."
03/27/2021,stocks,Webull
03/27/2021,stocks,TD Ameritrade
03/27/2021,stocks,SoFi is pretty easy but they take a long time to fill orders if you are buying fractional shares and they only offer fractional shares on certain stocks.
03/27/2021,stocks,I hate that RobinHood is losing its cult following. The app/service is actually getting better with charts and more info on options strategies
03/27/2021,stocks,Webull
03/27/2021,stocks,i would say Webull or FD
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve used Schwab, Robinhood and Sofi and Sofi is probably the easiest."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Investing is about self education. If you're constantly recommending they do this and that, they aren't actually learning."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Vanguard is so damn confusing though. It doesn't seem to show you what you have until the next business day. It's almost  impossible to find the cost of what I bought and compare it to what the stock is worth today. The stats are not in real-time. I'm pretty sure one of my purchases executed at a price well above the limit I set, but I can't even track it down to confirm. 

Vanguard is reputable, but in my opinion sucks for short-term trading. If I hadn't first used Robinhood, I would never have been able to navigate Vanguard at all."
03/27/2021,stocks,"This. I love the look and ease of use of webull, and FUCKING HATE the look of charles schwab's street smart Edge. But webull doesn't offer everything I want and at least with the stock market old > new"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt really get what‚Äôs wrong with the current Fidelity app. It‚Äôs too green? It doesn‚Äôt have a leaderboard of trending stocks? I look at the leaderboard on CNBC and then switch back to the app, works fine for me."
03/27/2021,stocks,"TD Ameritrade can be confusing, but they use industry standard terms in their web UI so it's easier to find educational info and it also translates better to other platforms.  If you're in investing long term, I think it's worth the learning curve."
03/27/2021,stocks,Webull lends out your shares. I dont like that aspect of it but the free level 2 data is nice and their desktop app is smooth. I prefer schwaab for actual investing though
03/27/2021,stocks,Telling people not to use something because of Chinese ownership is absolutely a political statement.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah, the featured users usually have good advise and you can straight up see their portfolio."
03/27/2021,stocks,I do not trust Merrill Edge I heard they try to stop you from trading so that they can use your shares to short.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Ugh. M1 is horrible. Your money is in this pie chart thing that's really kind of difficult for a beginner to figure out (the app and allocation). They've over-streamlined it to the point where making individual trade decisions is impossible unless that trade fits into your pie chart allocation. I don't really recommend it for a brand new investor. Fidelity is a little boomer but simple, and TD is simple but has more powerful tools available. TD also has paper trading through think or swim."
03/27/2021,stocks,Even though I'm still on RH I use Webull religiously to check charts and data.
03/27/2021,stocks,They don‚Äôt DRIP which I wish I knew before I switched
03/27/2021,stocks,"They are losing their following because they are a shit company, with shit customer service and shit ethics. Free market baby!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Couldn't agree more.  One of the ""under the radar"" perks is they have good educational material on how to do things, fair recommendations for most stocks, and don't try to push things on you."
03/27/2021,stocks," oh yeah, it def sucks for short term trading.  I consider that a perk since it keeps me from doing that lol.  

When you're starting out, you should get the basics of wealth building down for the first 5 years before you start YOLOing it WSB style"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve gotten used to vanguard, yeah their UI is clunky, but I‚Äôm damn sure of the trade I‚Äôm placing as opposed to screwing something up by tapping and swiping too fast on my phone. 

My biggest gripe with vanguard is they don‚Äôt offer partial shares. So for my kids account (I give them $10/month and they pick a company to invest in) I use fidelity."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Once Vanguard gets a proper mobile app, I'll jump in. When I was looking for reviews on which brokerage to use for trading on a mobile app, I was amazed how a $6T company is so behind in the game. 

But boy they do have my trust to handle my shit correctly."
03/27/2021,stocks,Fidelity just pisses me off cause it doesnt have extended hours prices
03/27/2021,stocks,"It has a leaderboard of the most active stocks, losers, and winners if you go to more and then research"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I personally don't use Webull but I'm pretty sure they only lend out your shares if you choose to do so. And those who choose to do so get a ""kickback"""
03/27/2021,stocks,Fuck Winnie the Pooh
03/27/2021,stocks,I never said he shouldn‚Äôt use WeBull. I was simply provided feedback.
03/27/2021,stocks,"You‚Äôre god damn right it‚Äôs political, if you‚Äôre gonna completely disregard the geopolitical relationships and ignore the news that tons of American investors are pulling out of Chinese govt-controlled stocks because institutions are now demanding transparency and accountability, you‚Äôre on big dumb."
03/27/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah, they keep it real old school that way.  If you don't have enough for the full share, you could always throw the remainder into one of the many ETFs available.  That's what I like to do."
03/27/2021,stocks,Good news! I heard somewhere a while ago that they are working diligently on a new app.  I think it's supposed to be released sometime this year.
03/27/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs the only thing I don‚Äôt like about the app. You have to tap on the extended hours for it to show you the order book unless you‚Äôre using active trader on the computer
03/27/2021,stocks,I see it now; I just hadn‚Äôt looked for it.
03/27/2021,stocks,It's on by default. I have yet to see a kickback it might be a small amount but they do say they have it. I leave it on cause they could be lending your shares anywhere might as well get paid for it lol this isnt a huge issue to me but I prefer having my serious account with an established bank. Chase has a simple easy to use brokerage account and i just so happen tobuse them as my bank too I habent had any issues. I like schwaab a lot as well because literally every stock is on there
03/27/2021,stocks,"I never said he should use WeBull, I just pointed out that you made a political statement and then, in the same comment, stated that it was not a political statement.  You are as dumb as your friends here apparently."
03/27/2021,stocks,"So google isn't a government controlled stock?

I'm shocked shock so shock at this hypocrisy. Lol"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I knew I was right.  What makes you think you know how I stand on China?  You don't, but you seem to have used your excellent powers of deduction to think you do.  You must do great in the markets with your no brain logic chain working that well.  Dummy."
03/27/2021,stocks,It's the same in the US with FISA national security letters
03/27/2021,stocks,"I already knew that.  I was just pointing out that it was political. You don't know anything about me, slappy."
03/27/2021,stocks,You don't have to buy a full share of ETF's on Fidelity? Because I'm thinking of switching my Roth to Fidelity from Stash and I wasn't sure if partial shares are allowed.
03/27/2021,stocks,I heard a beta version might be available already but I haven't looked into it yet.
03/27/2021,stocks,They changed the app recently to where it's a lot more user friendly
03/27/2021,stocks,No worries. It took me a while to get it
03/27/2021,stocks,"It typically is only small amounts. 
I get like $.02 a day from the lending my shares on Webull. Granted it is only about a dozen shares, but it  won't make you rich"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Were you not here for the 2020 elections when every single person was screaming at everybody else, ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS A PRIVATE COMPANY?‚Äù"
03/27/2021,stocks,"You made it sound like you were discounting what the dude was saying BECAUSE it was a political statement, dummy
Proof: check your comment vote count"
03/27/2021,stocks,having a bad day lol?
03/27/2021,stocks,"IDK about Fidelity, but on Vanguard at least you don't have to for their Mutual funds.  Before GME, Vanguard mutual funds were pretty much the only thing I've ever invested in"
03/27/2021,stocks,They have a beta version out called Beacon.
03/27/2021,stocks,I'm shocked so shock that private company give private access to CIA for free probing of their data bases in google. Shock so shock at your idiotic hypocrisy lol
03/27/2021,stocks,"Mutual funds on all brokers support fractional shares, ETFs and stocks support fractional shares on only some brokers. I know Fidelity and Robinhood support them but TDA does not. Not sure about others."

I traded Cinedigm last week profitably... but am revisiting it for actual investment potential.  Their management team seems solid.  Any thoughts out there regarding this or any other candidates in and around the NFT sector??"
03/27/2021,stocks,"It is a s solid choice. Management is good and signaling they will be releasing nft business news. (See Twitter). I am holding, not trading, from 1.3."
03/27/2021,stocks,"They have some sort of partnership with the NFL as they made/released the TB Superbowl highlight DVD.  I couldn't find the specifics. I did buy shares bc why not. NFT gifs from the nfl would be way more fun than nba. Hard hits, diving catches."
03/27/2021,stocks,Holding strong.. even without the nft news this stock has some great potential
03/27/2021,stocks,"It's a gamble imo. Look at their financials, it's just sad."
03/27/2021,stocks,only company i would ever play related to possible NFT stuff is Funko
03/27/2021,stocks,Some chart analysis on CIDM from elsewhere (if links ok to post.....) https://discord.com/channels/779193272450547742/779219667183992872/825383246485127169
03/27/2021,stocks,The original NFT plays before everyone jumped on the bandwagon are FNKO + TAPM (back in 2018) + IPNFF + FDMSF + PONGF + CINGF.  I posted about NFT
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes, I‚Äôve been digging deeper on them in an attempt to actually get in on the ground floor within this sector.  Given their low market cap, one would think they could possibly be an acquisition target as well."
03/27/2021,stocks,I have FNKO too.. TRWRF + PONGF + FDMSF
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes. They own good content too. It is pretty easy risk on money at the current pricing, not much downside or loss if stop becomes necessary. Almost a no brainer, lol."
2021-03-27 16:56:38,stocks,"Here‚Äôs my list, thoughts? Good morning investors.

To cut to the chase I‚Äôm at a crossroad. After a massive loss (for me) on GME and AMC, I told myself I need to stay out of stocks for a while. Well, I saved $3,500 to invest and I don‚Äôt feel right letting it get dusty in my checking account. Here‚Äôs the stocks currently on my list, I‚Äôm open for any suggestions.
(I have separated my allotted money into sections, that‚Äôs why some relatively good stocks are at lower number figures)

-$SPY - $600
-$VUG - $450
-$APPL - $375
-$DKNG - $400
-$CCL - $400
-$TRIP - $250
-$WH - $225
-$SPWR - $200
-$FSLR - $250
-$AXP - $350

These are all meant to be medium term plays. I‚Äôm thinking around a year taking profits at my own discretion. 

Thanks a lot, everybody"
03/27/2021,stocks,I think with your history of gambling on AMC and GME you better invest your money in an ETF.
03/27/2021,stocks,"why don't you pick two names from that list instead of splashing that 3500 into 10 names, from that list only DKNG I'd put on for a swing trade it to 72-75. 

stay away from meme stocks unless you're able to watch it daily and in front of your screen to manage."
03/27/2021,stocks,90% SPY 5%apple and maybe DKNG would be better long term IMO
03/27/2021,stocks,I think you should only add to the first two positions.
03/27/2021,stocks,"80% VTI or SPY and 20% VXUS,  Start building a core retirement portfolio til you get to 20,000.  Then you can start fooling around with individual stocks.  IMHO"
03/27/2021,stocks,Apple?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah I‚Äôm thinking about sending a larger percentage to ETFs. I just feel as though the sections I‚Äôve picked are still have room to recover from covid, especially when we‚Äôre able to fully open again."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Good advice, thanks. I‚Äôve always heard diversification is key so I figured I‚Äôd pick sections and go from there. I will likely lower the list to less tickers though. This is sorta my rough draft in a way."
03/27/2021,stocks,why buy apple if heavy into SPY? makes no sense
03/27/2021,stocks,"They very well can but you need to do your homework for that just like we all do. Just buying something because it has potential will leave you broke or worse, with a ton of debt. In principle almost any company has potential. I invested in the maritime sector a little while ago with the idea transport will go to normal at some point. Did my research, checked the numbers and bought some more 2 weeks ago because things where looking brighter than expected for that company. Now we have a ship stuck in the Suez Canal and nobody knows how long it will take (days at best, weeks at worst) and I know this will have affect on the next Q earnings.

&#x200B;

So even with enough data present you still can get fucked. An ETF is a lot safer and can have a decent return. Maybe turn it around - Do you think you can outperform an ETF or the Nasdaq, S&P 500? If so you should go for stocks mixed with an ETF/Fund otherwise just let it be."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Sorry but what room to recover are you talking about? Out of all the stocks you listed, CCL is the only one that hasn‚Äôt recovered, everything else is up from a year ago. 

Just put everything into an ETF because you‚Äôre clearly still trying to speculate. Have you really learned your lesson?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"relative to the market dkng had been one of the strongest  names, yes it's pullback 18% from its highs but the stock has a lot of support at 60-62 levels, concentration is the key to investing, diversification are for those who are lazy - no offense."
03/27/2021,stocks,"You make a compelling argument. Good on you my friend, I‚Äôll likely turn a larger percentage into ETFs. Still waiting on my deposit to clear so nothing is concrete yet"
03/27/2021,stocks,"In my mind, TripAdvisor will gain with the growth of travel. Solar is a growing industry as we move away from oil. Banks have a laughable interest rate on most savings/CD accounts among other reasons for people, including myself, to not invest in their accounts. Sports betting will be legalized in majority of states within the next 3-5 years, many of them within the next year for Draftkings. Apple is just Apple. I don‚Äôt think just because the stock price is higher means they‚Äôve necessarily fully recovered."
03/27/2021,stocks,None taken. This is my first try at true diversification but you sound like you‚Äôre onto something. Thanks a lot
03/27/2021,stocks,"Before the pandemic broke out, Tripadvisor was $30.  Its now almost double that.  Do you really think travel is going to more than double from what it was pre-pandemic?"
2021-03-27 16:51:30,stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021 Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 29th, 2021.

# **The end of the quarter could create volatility for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/the-end-of-the-quarter-could-create-volatility-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Stocks could be buffeted by end-of-quarter trading in the week ahead, as pension funds and other big investors buy bonds and sell stocks to rebalance their portfolios.
*****
> The dramatic move higher in bond yields this quarter sets up fund managers to shift their holdings, to make up for the shortfall in bond holdings.
*****
> The focus in the coming week could turn to the overall economy, with the March employment report expected Friday and the White House‚Äôs infrastructure plans expected to be unveiled Wednesday. There is also ISM manufacturing data released on Thursday.
*****
> The March jobs report is scheduled for a morning when the stock market is closed for the Good Friday holiday, but bonds will trade half a day, ending at noon. Economists expect 630,000 jobs were added in March, and the unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to unveil details of his $3 trillion to $4 trillion infrastructure plan on Wednesday in Pittsburgh, but strategists say it is too soon to say what form the plan could take or how large it will be in its final form.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, while Treasury yields were less volatile. The closely watched 10-year was at 1.67% Friday, down from 1.75% in the prior week. Yields move opposite price, and strategists expect rates to continue to slip in the coming week as investors rebalance their holdings.

> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the last week of the quarter so there could be just a lot of noise related to that,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group. ‚ÄúObviously, we‚Äôll be keeping an eye on bonds. The 10-year now seems to be in a range of 1.60% to 1.70%. I think people are just trying to find their footing here. They‚Äôre trying to figure it out.‚Äù
*****
> Some strategists say the quarter-end trade could end up being positive for stocks, especially big cap tech, since rates have stopped moving higher temporarily.
*****
> Stocks are higher for the quarter so far. The S&P 500 was up 1.6% for the week and up 5.8% for the quarter to date. The Dow was up 1.4% for the week, and has an 8% gain for the first quarter so far. The Nasdaq has been the laggard, falling 0.6% for the week and up 1.9% for the quarter.
*****
> Bonds have staged a much more dramatic move for the quarter with the benchmark 10-year yield rising from 0.93% at the end of last year.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in the driver‚Äôs seat right now,‚Äù said NatWest‚Äôs Blake Gwinn of the 10-year yield. The 10-year is the most widely followed yield since it influences mortgages and other key financing rates.
*****
> Gwinn, head of U.S. rates strategy, said he changed his view on the 10-year and he now expects the yield to reach 2% by year-end from 1.75%. But in the near term, he said, the yield could continue to fall as big funds buy Treasurys. Japanese investors are also expected to be active buyers around their year-end, which is Wednesday.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf anything, we‚Äôre really hoping it continues to push yields a little lower, so it gives us a better spot to get involved in shorts again,‚Äù he said.
*****
> # Infrastructure plan
> Gwinn said he is focused on the Biden infrastructure plan and does not believe it is yet priced into the market. The $1.9 trillion fiscal plan, just signed by the president, was one driver of bond yields, as investors weighed the anticipated bump in economic activity and higher debt levels it will bring.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe Biden plan to me is the biggest risk for the Treasury market right now. I don‚Äôt have what is the full Biden plan happening this year priced in to my ... forecast,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf all of a sudden we start moving quickly on that, and that starts coming together in Q2, I‚Äôm going to have to reconsider my 2% target.‚Äù
*****
> Gwinn said the market has ‚Äúfiscal fatigue.‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of doubt and uncertainty about how it‚Äôs going to be passed, when it‚Äôs going to be passed and whether it‚Äôs going to be passed ... It‚Äôs not tangible enough,‚Äù he said.
*****
> The plan is expected to span multiple years, and Democrats are expected to seek tax hikes to pay for it.
*****
> # Rotation
> The rotation into cyclicals and value stocks is expected to continue into the next quarter. For the first quarter so far, energy and financials were the best performers, up about 33% and 16.5% respectively. Tech was up 1.7%, but it was a better performer than utilities and consumer staples.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think certain parts of the market have plenty of upside but part of that may come at the expense of the growth stocks,‚Äù said Dan Suzuki, deputy CIO at Richard Bernstein Advisors. He also expects growth stocks to continue to react negatively to rising interest rates and positively when they fall. That trade decoupled somewhat in the past week.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to match one for one with every wiggle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think the basis behind it is real. If you think rates are going to get up to 2% by the end of the year, that‚Äôs really bad for expensive high-growth names. The markets care less about absolute levels and more about direction. The higher rates go, the worse it is for high multiple stocks.‚Äù
*****
> Suzuki said the rise in rates is knocking some of the froth out of the market. The stocks of special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, had been jumping on their first days of trading in February, averaging more than 5% gains, and saw no gain in March, according to data from a University of Florida finance professor.
*****
> ‚ÄúAs we‚Äôre seeing the economy get better and better at an incredible fast rate, especially when you add on stimulus, you have companies that are going to benefit most from that acceleration, that are going to be up 2X, 3X plus,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTo their credit, those high multiple growth stocks were so resilient last year ... Tech earnings growth is coming in at mid-teens next year, but again, the more cyclical parts of the economy ‚Äî energy, materials, industrials, small caps, they‚Äôre going to put up much stronger earnings growth this year as a result of the recovery.

> # April Almanac: Top DJIA Month ‚Äì Up 15 in a Row

> April marks the end of the ‚ÄúBest Six Months‚Äù for DJIA and the S&P 500. The window for our seasonal MACD sell signal opens on April 1st. From our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on November 5, 2020 through yesterday‚Äôs close, DJIA was up 16.3% and S&P 500 had advanced 13.2%. These above average gains are encouraging and suggests seasonality is back on track after getting derailed by Covid-19 last year.

> April 1999 was the first month to gain 1000 DJIA points. However, from 2000 to 2005, ‚ÄúTax‚Äù month was hit, declining in four of six years. Since 2006, April has been up fifteen years in a row with an average gain of 2.9% to reclaim its position as the best DJIA month since 1950. April is second best for S&P and fourth best for NASDAQ (since 1971).

> The first half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has no longer been the case. The effect of April 15 Tax Deadline (moved to May 17 for 2021) appears to be diminished with numerous bullish days present on either side of the day. Traders and investors are clearly focused on first quarter earnings and guidance during April.

> This year, guidance is likely to be the greatest focus as the economy continues to reopen. Traders and investors will likely be looking for signs that ‚Äúwork-from-home‚Äù stocks can continue to grow and signs that leisure, hospitality, and travel are rebounding.

> Typical post-election year blues have done little to damper April‚Äôs performance since 1953. April is DJIA‚Äôs second best month in post-election years, gaining 1.9% on average. April is fourth best for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Although post-election year 2005 did suffer a 3% DJIA decline.

> # Historic Year for the S&P 500

> Tomorrow will mark the one-year anniversary of the S&P 500's closing low from the COVID crash, and for most stocks in the index, it has been a historic year. Within the S&P 500, stocks in the index are up an average of 104.22% through Friday's close, and just three stocks - all from the Health Care sector - are actually lower. Leading the losers, Gilead (GILD) has declined over 10%. Recall that GILD performed well during the initial stages of the pandemic on the promising results of its drug Remdesivir in treating COVID patients, but once the market started to rally, it was left behind.

> The table below lists the top 25 performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the closing low on 3/23/20. Topping the list with a gargantuan gain of 763% is ViacomCBS (VIAC). After trading below $12 per share last March, the stock is close to triple-digits today. Behind VIAC, Tesla (TSLA), L Brands (LB), Etsy (ETSY), and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) round out the top five, and all have gained in excess of 500%. Interestingly enough, despite the strength of the sector for what seems like years now, the only stock on the list from the Technology sector is Enphase Energy (ENPH). In fact, after ENPH, you have to go all the way down to the 53rd spot to find the next stock from the Technology sector (Applied Materials - AMAT, +186%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/032221-best-stocks1.png))**

> Leading the way higher, stocks in the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors are both up an average of over 150%, while Consumer Staples and Utilities are the only two sectors where each one's components are up an average of less than 50%. Just to the right of the S&P 500 in the chart below is the Technology sector which is one of five sectors where the average performance of its components is less than 100%. A gain of 96.1% in a year is nothing to sneeze at in any market environment, but just the fact that the average performance of stocks in the Technology sector since the March lows is now lower than the average of the S&P 500 illustrates the shift we have seen since the sector's peak relative strength last fall.

> # The Big Winner of the Past Year: Commodities

> It has been just over a year since the S&P 500 Index bottomed on March 23, 2020, and while global stock markets have provided historic returns since the low, the biggest winners come from a completely different asset class: commodities. As global activity quickly ground to a halt, commodity prices plummeted, with oil prices even trading for a negative value for the first time in history.

> Since March 23, 2020, commodity markets have roared back as the global economy has emerged from the shadow of COVID-19. As shown in the LPL Chart of the day, oil and lumber prices have more than doubled off the lows, while copper prices have pulled back a bit after reaching that feat back in February:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.25.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> ‚ÄúAfter likely their worst period in history, although I wasn‚Äôt around for the bubonic plague so I can‚Äôt be certain, commodity prices have roared back as the global economy continues to wake up,‚Äù added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThe US and China are well ahead of other nations in terms of economy activity and output, so as the rest of the world plays catch up, we wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see commodities rise even further.‚Äù

> The emergence from lockdowns and subsequent increase in activity has boosted prices from the outright deflationary environment we saw last spring, to a more reflationary environment in recent months, and this has pulled commodity prices along with it. The commodity market‚Äôs top performer, lumber, has seen a particular boom in prices as the ‚Äústay at home environment‚Äù benefitted the housing market, leading to all-time highs in housing starts in December‚Äîeven surpassing the high water mark set before the pandemic began. Adding to the fervor, mortgage rates continued to set record lows, falling as low as 2.82%, according to the Bankrate 30-year national average.

> We upgraded our view on oil in our January Global Portfolio Strategy publication, as strong technical factors favored prices to accelerate higher. Further, oil prices have continue to benefit from a favorable supply environment, with OPEC+ maintaining output until global demand rises, though the risk of a global increase in production at higher prices remains a risk to our view.

> # Mean Reversion After Biggest 1-Year Spike Since 1949?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5689a720ed84d38815a99feebc905f12/e0f60c4ce9518235-5d/s500x750/0ac0150b41e963199a102d356909aac776eb265d.jpg))**

> Lots of chatter out there about the giant 1-year gain of 75% on the S&P 500 from the March 23, 2020 low ‚Äì actually it‚Äôs 74.78%. It may very well be the beginning of a new bull market, but that does not mean (pun intended) that we should expect gains like these moving forward.

> We ran the numbers on the 1-year rolling returns for the S&P 500 back to 1949 and while these giant spikes do come at the early stages of extended bull runs gains of this magnitude have not been sustained and the market has tended to revert to the mean. The arithmetic mean or average rolling 1-year return since 1949 is 9.15%, which isn‚Äôt bad either.

> With lingering pandemic/vaccine and political and geopolitical issues, all the noise from the Fed and the bond market, Robinhood and Reddit stock pumping, rich valuations, teetering internals, extended technicals ‚Äì and the end of the Best Six Months November-April on the horizon, it is not inconceivable to expect the market to consolidate over the Worst Six Months May-October (AKA ‚ÄúSell in May‚Äù).

> Last time we had a 1-year rolling return of this magnitude in 2010 when the S&P was up 68.57% on March 9, 2010 from the March 9, 2009 secular bear market low we had a 10.34% correction to the July 2, 2010 low and a 15.75% rolling 1-year return from March 9, 2010 to March 9, 2011. And let‚Äôs not forget the May 6, 2010 flash crash. So while we are by no means ‚Äúbearish‚Äù perhaps a little caution and portfolio defense in the near future is not a crazy idea.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
03/27/2021,stocks,Thank you for providing this content week in week out. It‚Äôs very useful!
03/27/2021,stocks,"Interesting to read that the infrastructure bill isn't priced in yet so maybe my first real options trade may make money next week

Bought 1c of PAVE 16 Apr $27 strike for .15 and it closed after market at $25

I'm betting and hoping on $30 by the 16th and if not a bump from the infrastructure bill then maybe a reconstruction bounce from the major severe weather in the south will boost it"
03/27/2021,stocks,Thank you. Appreciate all the work you put into these. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.
03/27/2021,stocks,"#SOXL

03/27/2021,stocks,Thank you üëç
03/27/2021,stocks,Thanks for the great info. I'm just getting started in the market and posts like this really help the new people out. Way more than the buy and hold posts with no DD. The memes are fun and I have some money on them.  But they aren't a long term strategy.
03/27/2021,stocks,Amazing service to the Reddit public. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
03/27/2021,stocks,This is probably the most useful weekly post on reddit by the way.
03/27/2021,stocks,Very glad to read such a thorough and detailed report. Much appreciated. My brain feels better now that I‚Äôve moved over from wsb to here.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Great work. I'm currently deep in growth, tech, consumer staples. This is helping me mentally prep for the bloodbath that my portfolio will continute to wade through in Q2. I think I might have some investable income this quarter, and I'm hoping to double down on the companies I believe in most while their price drops. Hope I'm rewarded for my faith here in 5-10 years."
03/27/2021,stocks,Great work!
03/27/2021,stocks,All that good opportunities of making bank last year and wasted them all :(
03/27/2021,stocks,"During this red wave I ran out of free cash to buy the dips so now I've created a buy the dips fund (put in a few pounds a week to buy the dips) as my pretty diverse portfolio (tech, biopharma and mining mostly) went down 20% in the last few weeks from up 15% before"

03/27/2021,stocks,This is incredibly generous and I appreciate you
03/27/2021,stocks,"As a novice, when you say that options traders are pricing in an x% move on earnings, does that mean people suspect that options prices will jump up that % after the earnings report, or is it deeper than that?

Thanks for this, it‚Äôs really helping my smooth brain grow some wrinkles :)"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thank you for this, it is much appreciated, hope you are having a fantastic day and weekend!"

03/27/2021,stocks,"Any thoughts on the problems with china and potential delistings? Personally thinks its just noise and if it didn't happen under Trump then it def won't under biden. Politics seem to be moving back towards russia as the big bad again and both economies certainly need each right now, so no reason to jeopardise that."
03/27/2021,stocks,AMD please go back to 90 :(
03/27/2021,stocks,The US federal government has annual tax revenues of around $3.5 trillion annually.  Another stimulus at this point seems out of touch with any kind of fiscal reality.  That will be the last straw for our $80 trillion debt market.  Watching $80 trillion all run for the exit at the same time isn‚Äôt going to be pretty.

03/27/2021,stocks,Could someone explain to me the oil play a little? When prices go up does that make companies like XOM and CVX make more money?

03/27/2021,stocks,Well I‚Äôd say nucore is pricing it in now still a solid company but I‚Äôll wait for a pullback
03/27/2021,stocks,"Curious why it's not priced in yet. It's a sure shot.

The levels for ICLN are now to a level that is barely up since Biden's election. Some of it is the uncertainty around PLUG's financial accountings too"
03/27/2021,stocks,How far out do you buy the calls ?
03/27/2021,stocks,"THANK YOU for this! Oh and I couldn't help but Lol on your last sentence there, cause if you can believe this, I was literally ""banned"" from wsb yesterday for posting threads up similar to this one on there hah.

That place is seriously going downhill faster than you can blink. Sad in a way as I was regular contributor of that sub for yeeeeears. Oh well. Good riddance to them. Hence my love and appreciation for r/stocks and its staff team and community members! This is by far my #1 stock-related sub on ALL of Reddit. :)"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Wsb used to be somewhat legitimate but now it's just a bunch of market novices aping and diamond handing garbage stocks.  And by that, I mean it's not even speculating with a purpose like it used to be, it's just straight up gambling now.  I respect their ways, but I can't consider myself one of them anymore I think the popularity has permanently killed it off."
03/27/2021,stocks,Glad to have you. I can imagine it‚Äôs a much different feeling here.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Don't sleep of with that kind of thinking man , Peel you're eyes open focus on what ahead and you will find that opportunity. Stick to your plan. I did never felt happier I've learn allot couple of years."
03/27/2021,stocks,I like ENPH a lot. Lots of upside with the infrastructure bill. Also bought into U as well. I need to dig more into the financials but love them long term.
03/27/2021,stocks,So basically reddit stocks.

03/27/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs unfortunate it was banned from their page. I just recently joined this page and I can see I found something worth dedicating some time to and getting solid information instead of emojis. Appreciate the insights more than one can show.
03/27/2021,stocks,I was wondering why there is r/stocks and r/stockmarket so thanks for clarifying for me which one to pay more attention to haha
03/27/2021,stocks,I was one of them but I‚Äôve since put actual effort into investing/options; made $300 this week on some puts and calls and am hoping to continue learning from this sub and other places :)

2021-03-27 16:41:20,stocks,"IBM, yess 5pct div IBM Time in the Sun has finally arrived after 18 months As a investor, who is 70pct technical and 30pct fundamental, I am convinced that IBM ( the big supertanker) is finally unstuck from the Suez canal on its way to open seas ! On Thu/Fri it broke 1 key hurdles: broke over a 18 month channel ceiling and also broke over the short term upward trend line.

Sadly I cannot post my chart on this subreddit beacuse ( in a strange way they do not allow images) but may post it on the dividends subreddit since this is a nice dividend stock.

Coincidentally, last Thu

IBM Positioned as a Leader in 2021 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Insight Engines""

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-positioned-leader-2021-gartner-120000382.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-positioned-leader-2021-gartner-120000382.html)"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Their dividend payout ratio is over 100%. Years of declining profit while increasing the dividend...Hard pass.

IBM needs to cut the dividend and focus on investment. I was hoping the new CEO would recognize that, but so far he hasn't.

Instead it seems they'll keep cutting to support the dividend, and will continue it's decay. Maybe I'm wrong but as of today I'm not optimistic."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I say this as someone who owned $IBM for years... it felt more like a submarine... always under water

Dividends weren‚Äôt bad, and I was optimistic about how the cloud business was growing, but in my personal experience (and this isn‚Äôt financial advice) is that I could have used my capital more efficiently elsewhere

Of course as a submarine, it could also pop up out of nowhere and seriously f*** s*** up..."
03/27/2021,stocks,IBM = super tanker? I‚Äôm confused
03/27/2021,stocks,Well they broke above it two times in the last 6m and nothing happend
03/27/2021,stocks,I'm frustrated about this. I was seeing it's 120/share price very appealing and I let the internet change my mind. Not sure where it heads from here!
03/27/2021,stocks,"I like ibm, but it's hard for think you should put money there over microsoft or apple. Not that they are really in the same genre anymore, but name/tech wise they are comparable in my mind"
03/27/2021,stocks,"IBM new CEO needs to bring it back to pre Gina (ex CEO,) days and its tough task. IBM had all talent, patents and had right focus till Gina took over as CEO. As ex IBMer we saw good opportunities let go and slowly all our division top performers moved to other big 4. If you look at growth of other consulting firms you will see they grew at much higher % in last 10 years and IBM lost business. Now as customer , I am yet to see change in IBM operations. Will wait for one quarter before investing more. I am long on IBM."
03/27/2021,stocks,I have a small position in IBM and I'm not complaining
03/27/2021,stocks,I hear they‚Äôre working to track the vaccinated/unvaccinated like they helped Hitler track the Jews back in the day.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think they‚Äôre toast, though it will be a long and slow decline. They need a Lou Gerstner to come in and embrace cloud, like real cloud, not this hybrid shit they‚Äôre peddling. I actually think they could be a good cloud enterprise solution architect firm if they pivoted solely to that. Or they can double down on Watson and quantum and see how that works out for them. Worked in the industry for about a decade and IBM is just a laggard, very few multiples I would consider them at. At least Oracle is terrible but increases earnings."
03/27/2021,stocks,"After the experience of 2001, 2008 and Q2 Mar 2020 ( and as a retiree focusing on dividends with some growth if you buy at the right point) I have refined my techniques to   weigh technical and sentiment ( yours make me feel better as a contrary indicator, and I could be 100pct wrong; and as a holder of T for 3 years I commiserate with those whose expectation on IBM has been deflated ) factors as 75pct and fundamentals as only 25pct ( Pl explain GME to me if you want to talk fundamentals).  On Thu eve I pulled the trigger VERY LIGHTLY on IBM and then programmed bots, like yourself, took the buying over on Friday and confirmed my personal BUY signal of Thu. I am also accumulating LUMN, VTRS, etc.....who am I, a poor contented retiree, to argue with proven home run hitters, like Mike Burry ( of the movie THE BIF SHORT fame). 

[https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/stocks-michael-burry-likes-better-than-tesla](https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/stocks-michael-burry-likes-better-than-tesla)"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Oh; if you are /were frustrated with IBM; look at the three year chart for ( T  ATT); then we can commiserate together and have a virtual beer. Every darned think is virtual now a days. I never, in my 25 year stint in the markets every bought stocks over $100 ( no reason; just psychological after being traumatized in 2001 crash) but this time I dabbled into IBM on Thu and Fri. The exception: Last July (2020) I bought few BRK/B under $175 exactly when every investor and member of the general media was calling Warren a fool and it is now over $255. I used the beating I got in the markets in Q2 2020 to refine my techniques to weigh technical and sentiment analysis more heavily in my stock selection and this explains my start on IBM. May be I will be wrong. As a retiree, I am strictly into value and dividends ( plus reasonable growth if I buy correctly ) . The others I am building positions are : LUMN, VTRS, IRM. https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/stocks-michael-burry-likes-better-than-tesla
Humility ( the market does it to one) and experience advice me that I should not ridicule the investments of proven guys like Buffet, Burry etc."
03/27/2021,stocks,Huge cap stock; slow to change; not a fast moving high beta stock as in Cathie Wood portfolio !
03/27/2021,stocks,"No guarantees in the stock market ( which has become a casino);
some say : "" Third time is a charm"". Hope so; in any case the P/E and P/B is good and the 5pct div is 4.99 pct more than Chase pays mw on my accounts."
03/27/2021,stocks,"For 30 years I made the same mistakes; now I buy ONLY AFTER IT BREAKS.
This implies buy at a higher price but be more sure of the upward trajectory.
( No guarantees in the market). I look at paying that little extra as paying an insurance premium to assure less risk in the buying decision."
03/27/2021,stocks,Thanks for the feedback; AAPL and uSoft are both solid companies but IBM day in the sun appears ( to me ) be about to shine on them too.
03/27/2021,stocks,All u say is on target; that is why the stock price has languished and not blosommed like a Microsoft for example. However my technical indicators are now confirming that believers in a turn around have start to exceed the skeptics and this is being reflected in demand for stock exceeding supply and gradually higher prices. I am no software or cliud expert but may be the big institutional buyers have started to see the Red Hat acquistion now as a contributor. Next week or two will tell the story if the stock reaches 140 or so.
03/27/2021,stocks,Thanks; next couple of weeks will tell the story. If it touches 140 that will confirm my thesis that demand from believers is exceeding sales by skeptics. Being a value/dividend hungry retiree i am also accumulating under valued LUMN and VTRS.
03/27/2021,stocks,I am not familiar with these issues.
03/27/2021,stocks,"For retirees, I agree that dividends and preserving capital is paramount since time is no longer a friend (‚Äò01 and ‚Äò08 are prime examples). In that case, $IBM is worthy of consideration since they are generous with the dividends (relative to other stocks). Personally, it was frustrating to see my other cloud plays (e.g. $AMZN, $MSFT, etc.) rise over the years yet $IBM (for the most part) went sideways. I still have a ways to go before I call it a career, so I‚Äôm more focused on growth and (to me) $IBM doesn‚Äôt really fit into that plan.

Folks like Buffet and Burry are who/where they are for a reason... and they have done well doing what they do (I have $BRK.B as well). Folks have different investment strategies and just because it‚Äôs different doesn‚Äôt make it wrong. 

Trust your analysis, check for bias, and take statements from other people (like me) with a grain of salt.

2021-03-27 15:42:30,stocks,"Nasdaq's battle with 13,000 As a warning, this is a TA-based post, so if you're not a fan of TA, then this post will likely not be that interesting for you.

Moving forward, for the last few months, it's been pretty apparent that Nasdaq has been struggling to stay above 13,000 while all the other indexes have continued to rally on higher.

**Let's look at the monthly chart first:** (yellow line is the 13,000 level)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/KbOw6JrK/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/KbOw6JrK/)

Since the start of 2021, Nasdaq has successfully traded above 13,000 at various points, but for January and February, it still managed to find itself under that level at the close of the candle. We've basically seen two doji candles in a row now, and the month of March is seemingly turning into another doji.

**Let's look at the weekly chart now:**

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZtrtVUm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/NZtrtVUm/) 

Ever since the correction began for Nasdaq, there has been a struggle in closing above 13,000 on the weekly chart. Four weeks in a row, Nasdaq traded above 13k at some point in the week, only to find itself under that level at candle close. We came really close on Friday on finally rallying through it and possibly closing above it, but we fall short at 12,966.75.

**Thesis:**

Personally, I believe that recapturing and closing above 13,000 will be the signal we are looking for that there will be strength coming back into tech. It begins with the closing of the March candle this coming week. There are only a few days left in the month, so there is an opportunity to finally break this trend by closing above. 

This coming week, if we finally close the monthly candle above 13k, and then the weekly candle also manages to close above it, I would personally say that we should begin to see a renewed rally in tech for the month of April."
03/27/2021,stocks,"NASDAQ's real problem is that it consists primarily of technology companies, who have been discovered to be the discounted future cash flow equivalent of low interest rate (effectively negative after inflation) long duration bonds (and that's their most optimistic outcome scenario)."
03/27/2021,stocks,"So closing above 13,000 means NASDAQ will go up? What the hell is this post lmao. There is literally no content here, or even good TA (not like any TA is good TA). Charters are somethin else"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I don't disagree with you that closing above a certain point or trend line will show a possible short term reversal or show short term strength, but the valuations of those companies...some need to come down 20% more before they're even worth looking at as reliable plays. If they trend back up for 5 months, it's just 5 more months of overvaluation. 

TA without context is guessing. I'd use TA to short the Qs before anything and that would still just be guessing.

Edit: everything is showing overbought on the monthly charts by the way. That's gonna have to come down eventually."

You can't use TA in a vaccum, you need to consider what the market is doing and the overall fundamentals of what you are analyzing and then you can apply TA with those factors in mind."

The most optimistic outcome scenario is tech is massively undervalued because AI, self-driving cars, big data, household cleaning robots are just a step away and anyone not on the wagon gets left behind

Just think of where we were in 2005 just 15 years ago and think where we could be in 15 more years. The question is will it lag an index with non-tech stocks? But we know the answer to that don't we... NASDAQ has PepsiCo, Dollar Tree and Costco. It's not a tech sector ETF but it is heavily weighted towards tech"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Sure, and that's the basis for the current correction. I'm just looking at the chart in a vacuum and explaining the current trend."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I don't mean to be that guy, but good TA exists as a tool to manage risk."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I actually disagree. Fundamentals do matter, but they matter in the long-term. It's impossible to tell when the market will actually correct itself to value things properly.

I was a strong perma-bear back during 2012-2013, to the point that I burned through $600k on SPY puts. I was firmly in the camp back then that a functioning market cannot rely on money being printed. Well, I was wrong, and I lost a fuck ton. Was TA telling me that I should short? Not really, but the fundamentals were.

I believe that the market goes through periods of being over-corrected to being in a bubble. Rarely in between, and that's expected because moves tend to be exaggerated due to the level of leverage being used in our stock market.

Are US equities overvalued in practically ever sector right now? Yes, they are. Is that enough of a basis to begin looking at the charts with a bearish bias? I don't believe so, and I believe that is the wrong approach."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That's the easy answer, and the answer being fed by the media, but the relationship has been murky between the two:

[https://i.imgur.com/xVm24rt.png](https://i.imgur.com/xVm24rt.png)

The chart has Nasdaq and the 10-year bond both plotted (10 year is the purple line). As a reminder, this is the actual price of the bond, so obviously, if the bond price is dropping, the yield is rising.

Anyhow, look back to 2018, Nasdaq made new highs while the 10-year was dropping heavy. Then look at 2019, Once again, Nasdaq rallied strong to new highs, while, the 10 year was dropping during that time.

&#x200B;

Edit:

We can look at the relationship on a daily chart:

[https://i.imgur.com/k15qmDA.png](https://i.imgur.com/k15qmDA.png)

So in this chart, you can see that the bond has been dropping since November, while the index continued to rally higher. Basically pointing back to my earlier point.

So then, the only other thing that can be said is the rate of the drop is what matters. Sure, the rate of the drop during mid-Feb definitely shook things up. But after that, we are beginning to see the trend between the two inverse. Bonds have continued to sell off, but Nasdaq is trading higher."
03/27/2021,stocks,Care to show a proper DD fundamentals. I am TA obsessed trader but never did fundamentals
03/27/2021,stocks,"I agree, not being able to close above 13000 is super bearish to me- like they are just selling to the public high before an orchestrated drop"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Buy now and win if Nasdaq go up. 
Or buy now and lose if Nasdaq go down."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'll attempt to break it down.

Stocks are commonly valued based on their discounted cash flow, specifically tech/growth stocks.

You take companies future projected cash flow, and then reduce it by the discount rate, aka risk-free return aka usually the 10-year treasury bond.

You then come up with the present value of the company.

If the discount rate rises, it will in return lower the present-day value of the company. Some companies that are hyped in the market today aren't expected to cash flow for another 10-15 years, so imagine what a 2 or a 3% treasury bond does to the equation?

This is why for many growth stocks, even a small rise in the discount rate can greatly affect the valuation of a growth company, because that growth company doesn't expect to actually post profits for another decade.

If our stock market was filled with growth companies that are expecting to cash flow within 2-3 years, then there would be a much smaller effect to rising yields, than what we see right now.

One last thing to point out, when these companies do begin to cash flow, it doesn't mean that they would be posting mega bucks from the first quarter. Usually, it takes many more years for cash flow to ramp up as they exit their ""growth"" stage."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I agree

Especially given that rates will stay low term indefinitely, if the rest of the developing world is any guide. The innovations you mentioned will further accelerate productivity and inflation will remain a distant concern. Secular stagnation will continue, and low rates are the only answer. 

Schiller himself has made the case that PE ratios become much more inflated in these conditions, as they should (in a rational market where rates matter and valuations are relative and now is a pretty unique moment). 

https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/12/01/stocks-prices-not-as-absurd-as-some-think-shiller/

So yeah, I buy stocks that are undervalued compared to peers but growing rapidly, often in tech -- BAND is one. Another is rapidly growing newly IPOd HMPT. I invest long term. I have no worries"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Except there is no proof of it ever working, causation doesn't mean correlation. And while bsck testing usually is fine all TA fails to forsee the future.


I've not found one scientific proof TA works despite countless studies. It simply don't..."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I was doing some weekend chart scans.  There are negative divergences on QQQ  on the weekly with regards to RSI / MACD from price over the last year. This doesn't always lead to a big decline but is something to keep an eye on. Even a big move up to ATH may not be enough to drag the RSI to new highs. 

VIX also crashed to under 19 on Friday its lowest level in over a year. Not really bullish or bearish but another thing to keep an eye on. Bulls hope it is sign that things are getting back to normal and stocks will continue to go up but the bear case would be a major top is forming is VIX is putting in a major bottom here. I also saw retail investor sentiment is at a year high.

Also watching the 10 yr yield and dollar. Both are still trending higher and if this continues it will surely influence equities / commodities. Oil, cotton, PM's are a bit troubling. None of them have been projecting surging demand or inflation recently. 

As for the Nas specifically along with the RUT, both could chop around here for quite a while while the market continues to rotate out of tech for a year or two. Honestly, the valuations on some of these tech companies are simply astronomical."
03/27/2021,stocks,Are you day trading or swing trading?
03/27/2021,stocks,"So I do look at RSI divergences as well, but the issue with it is that it isn't a great signal for timing. Such as on the daily, QQQ rallied from Dec to Feb, while RSI basically went sideways, until the Qs finally broke down.

If we back it down to earlier last year, Nasdaq continued to run from July to the end of August while RSI also went sidelines. Again, I like looking at divergences, just that they take time to play out, which ultimately offers little ""edge"" to the trade.

In terms of VIX, yes, the spot VIX breaking under 20 was pretty surprising. But it's important to note that the VIX futures is still trading above 20, specifically at 21.45.

What I think is even more interesting is VXN, which is basically the VIX for Nasdaq. With Friday's close, it finished at 25.64. Every single time VXN has dipped down to 25 ever since the COVID recovery, it has always bounced back up.

All in all, yes, there are more signs pointing towards a downtrend in Nasdaq, than to an uptrend. Going back to my thread post, one key thing that I do think could shift the current charts to a more bullish take is if Nasdaq closes above 13,000 for the month. That wouldn't just break the current overhead resistance, but it would also mark the best monthly close for Nasdaq.

On your last point, the macro picture is shit. But, trying to time a bubble is nearly impossible. From a macro perspective, there would have been very little reason to be long the market for the past decade. Just that now, it's more ridiculous than before. But that doesn't mean it cannot become more ridiculous.

At one point or another, there has to be a large deleveraging event. The economy and the market is propped up by debt, and the only reason that it continues to function is due to more debt being taken on. It doesn't take an economist to understand that at some point or another, you have to face the music. Whether we face it this year, or two years from now is the million-dollar question.

One of the best lines I've heard in some interview is that the people who make out like bandits during a recession/market crash are those who have liquidity when others do not. If you're overleveraged going into a market crash, whether it be equities or housing, you won't be able to take advantage of the depressed prices of assets. On the other hand, if you're cash-rich going into this period, then you stand to make a fortune."
03/27/2021,stocks,Swing trading. Used to be day trading
03/27/2021,stocks,"A couple things I have been thinking about. 

A rip your face off rally would turn me more bearish. Let's say we print 4100 on the SPX next week and NDX makes it way back up to gap fill around 13800, along with spikes down in volatility. You might even see a nice double top forming up in the RUT. This is end of quarter this week so I would think we'll see more of the trend which is throw tech out the window and buy HD, IBM and other mega cap leaders making a rip your face rally unworkable. Grind higher, falling yields, falling dollar and no more dislocations to the downside in commodities would make me more bullish.

I think a lot of this week will come down to that stupid boat stuck in the Suez Canal. It doesn't matter until it does and if that thing is stuck where it will be there for weeks, that is going to start sending some shockwaves. The hedge fund that blew up on VIAC is bothersome. Hopefully the selling is done and the blast is contained. How many more Bill Hwang's are out there levered up x5 with 'billions under management' and about to get a call from the margin clerk? The last thing is COVID. Oil and cotton isn't telegraphing massive demand right now. If there is more bad news on COVID, I think things could get dicey."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm a new investor and don't really do the trading thing. Probably why I think the fundamentals matter so much. I would suppose for the short term you wouldn't need to worry about it so much.

I use TA to find good entry points in a long position and when I get paid I add money into my account, take notes on how I'm expecting charts of my investments to move to decide when I would like to add to my current positions. 

Since I'm doing long term I look into value based metrics. I'm making sure their market cap hasn't run away from their total revenues, check to be sure there is a strong net margin and strong assests. I also check to see if they have a growing cash flow and look into the companys website to see if I believe the company is declining or on the rise.

I try and set expected length of investment and price targets. I have year ranges from 2years to a hold until I retire."

I feel like you ran right into the point here and then went off in the wrong direction. my takeaway from the above snippet is that picking businesses that benefit from an increase in ""seclusion"" and ""self reliance"" will yield gainz, and I agree with that. I think, particularly due to the rise of the internet, social media, etc, we are all becoming quite lonely people, and yet we also have more capability than ever for going it alone, self-teaching ourselves to do basically anything, working from home or being self employed is a thing, ""hustle culture"", etc.  But instead you just seem to be using ""seclusion"" and ""self reliance"" as a euphemism for wanking. and we do love a good wank joke. but perhaps broaden your scope, I think theres more to this"

03/27/2021,stocks,"Be cautious anytime anyone tells you a stock is up or down because of (pick a reason). At best these are reactionary and only show correlation. Very rarely do they actually show causation. If you really want to beat the market you'll have a hard time doings so only looking back.

The bottum line is that stocks go up or down because of fear and greed. When traders are greedy they hold and prices go up. When they are afraid they sell and prices go down. This is very similar to supply and demand but it accounts for one more variable: the human variable."

Now I'm not talking about a case like you-know-what where it was overshorted and bet on a company going bankrupt, but can't shorting help with keeping company prices in check? When a company becomes overvalued, wouldn't shorting it, within logical frameworks, bring it back to its normal value? Wouldn't this help with the prevention of market bubbles?"

naked shorting where shares are magically conjured up and sold is BS"
03/27/2021,stocks,Need more transparency
03/27/2021,stocks,"I used to think that way, and this coming from somebody who shorted a stock once (TLMD).

When I made that very brief short, however, I completely forgot the predatory financing of pot companies made by hedge funds: they shorted in order to cut off financing, then covered through predatory financing.

In hindsight, I think the German approach is a starting point.  Every short must disclose their short positions.

Really, though, shorting is only ""good"" to punish fraud.

In all other situations, I don't care if the end result is higher highs and lower lows."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I love when a shorting opportunity presents itself, I normally find the gains are quicker and provide less anxiety and speculation than going long"
03/27/2021,stocks,Ding ding u are correct

It's like reddit's upvote system. If you like a post, you upvote it. You don't like it? You downvote it. But hiring tons of bots/people to downvote it is a different matter."
03/27/2021,stocks,Shorting is good. Overshorting more than 100% float is not. Value players that buy put leaps on GME has a valid thesis -- after the saga calms down there is no way GME intrinsic value is over 100$.
03/27/2021,stocks,There‚Äôs an interesting episode of Dirt Money on Netflix that goes through why shorting can do good to the stock market.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Shoring is necessary for a healthy, efficient, two sided market."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Like most things in life, those speaking in absolutes are wrong. Of course shorting itself can be useful. But there is a type of shorting that has happened on Wall Street for years which is designed to actually destroy a company. Funds gang up to aggressively short a company for the express purpose of expediting the drop and putting the company out of business. This turns that concept from a simple bet against a stock to, essentially, financial terrorism. It‚Äôs harmful to our economy and serves to make a few rich at the expense of many."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Shorting certainly helps in price discovery for fair market value. I also couldn't understand a market that doesn't allow shorting because how could puts be delta hedged without it. Plus, I personally do shorting fairly often; two of my biggest positions right now are shorts and I often hedge against market failure with shorts. I see people calling for blood but I don't think they understand what they are calling for.

That said, there is some bad stuff going on with shorting and it's not just naked shorting that's causing it. The best recent example is AMC where the stick price was pushed down so much that they couldn't get reasonable financing which out then into a position where they may have BKed, so the short was causing itself to be justified which then justified putting a large amount of money into it. But this is not the only case and not all the other companies were so lucky.  It also allows for someone to step in and ""save"" the company for cents on the dollar. There's no doubt that shorting can be predatory.

So, it's a complicated topic with nuance. Not something people deal with well, it seems."
03/27/2021,stocks,That's the point
03/27/2021,stocks,"in trading if you're only going one direction (long) you're missing out on the the other 50% of the market and opportunity. I'm a technical trader and when I see price breaks supports and momentum is to the downside you short it directly or by buying puts. I prefer to borrow as I can return the shares back anytime - intraday, few days etc."
03/27/2021,stocks,Of course tye best portfolios in the world all have some short positions being 100% long is such a rookie mistake and it's a shame retail vilifies shorting when it can be so useful
03/27/2021,stocks,I thought naked shorting was already illegal. Is it really not?
03/27/2021,stocks,Is naked shorting just like shorting without any sort of checks and balances and making sure people don‚Äôt do dumb shit?
03/27/2021,stocks,Agreed. P&Ds are far safer on the way down.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I agree, but I think there is more too it.  Shorting by buying a put option from someone selling a covered option is one thing ... there are many reasons people put there shares up for options trading.  The problem comes in on nakid is shorting as is selling shares that don't exist.  This thow's off the whole concept of shares authorized and float. Naked shorting is how you can get over 100% short, that is more shares than physically exists.  Wiith covered options you can never get anywhere near 100% since existing phisical shares are involved.  Look at it as someone trying to sell you a car they don't have.  Naked shorting puts undesirable stress on markets and leads to price malipulation.  To drop a stock, simply sell millions of nakid shares ... maybe to create a bear raid where they drop the price then pick up shares cheap as the stock quickly rebound."
03/27/2021,stocks,"It is but it‚Äôs not enforced and the current regulations allows hedge funds to get away with it. Lack of diligent and timely reporting, very small fines associated with miss reporting data. If I can naked short sell a stock and make 20 billion and my fine is 275k  well I‚Äôm going to keep naked short selling."
03/27/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs creating a short position when there is no share to be borrowed from.
03/27/2021,stocks,If you can get in on the way down. Very difficult
03/27/2021,stocks,"What's the reason short data is still only reported every 2-4 weeks? Makes absolutely zero sense to me, especially following the recent squeezes and whatnot"
03/27/2021,stocks,Ok thank u for the info much appreciated
03/27/2021,stocks,What is it that makes it difficult do you think?
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm new so take this with a grain of salt. Every time I read the pre-market movers I see a small cap biotech stock spike up 80% on positive news. I tell myself, surely this is going to go back down to where it was pre spike. For the last month I then go to short the stock and my broker app tells me ""shares not available."" This has happened to me 10 of 10 times. So, either I'm too late, and all the short shares are not available or ?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"On most retail brokers you can only short big heavily traded stocks.  No issues shorting $AAPL.  The small biotech stocks, not so much.  One broker, Cobra Trading has a reputation of allowing customers to short a lot more stocks than other brokers. 

Cobra is not a zero commission broker, but paying the commissions opens up different opportunities.

They are not cheap and require a $30k minimum , but I may open an account just to try shorting these biotech stocks that pop in early trading and then almost always go back down later in the day."
03/27/2021,stocks,Ahh well I tend to short via CFD so the market is super liquid
03/27/2021,stocks,"Previously I only trade those low float big pre market movers. And I only shorted them. It‚Äôs impossible now because, true, most of the time shares are unavailable to short. And if they are the hard to borrow fees will kill you. I moved on from that strategy."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the info... I‚Äôve been wondering why. Ally Invest won‚Äôt let you short anything under five bucks. But most of these bio tech stocks are in the teens and 20s. I wonder why this is, why won‚Äôt brokers allow you to short small-cap stocks. Volatility? Risk?"
2021-03-27 13:47:42,stocks,"Suez Canal Tanker Play Edit: made the whole write up better and added my positions

Suez Canal Tanker Play

$STNG $TNK $NAT $TK $FRO

The Suez Canal blockage has lead to a surge in tanker rates and it‚Äôll continue to rise the longer the ship remains stuck. They are already rerouting ships around Africa which signals the blockage could last weeks and with shipping as tight as it already is, the rates are going to skyrocket and kick start a new supercycle.

I was bullish on tankers even before the Suez Canal and I have been seeing great gains these past 3 months. The Tanker industry was already seeing a huge recovery across the board and now its being boosted even further by the Suez Canal disruption. CEOs and insiders, specifically $STNG and $NAT, are already buying stock/call options. 

They are all also trading below their net asset value with strong fundamental cash positions from the huge rate spike in Q1 and Q2 2020. 

The tanker/shipping market is inherently cyclical and hinges totally on supply and demand. Back in the super cycle of 2000-2007 companies were over building tanker ships while oil demand couldn‚Äôt keep up, so we had a lot of supply with not enough demand causing a 15 year bear market.

The 15 year market is incredibly important for product tankers specifically as the major players in the industry stop chartering ships over 15 years old so they are essentially off the market and will soon be scrapped.

The ship orderbook has been as low as its ever been and it has been low the past 15 years so we are seeing a small amount of ships being built but a large amount of ships passing the 15 years and no longer being used.

So what we have here is a massive supply/demand imbalance waiting to happen and now with the Suez Canal putting even tighter strain, if the ships have to all be rerouted around Africa increasing the amount of miles drastically then tankers/shipping are going to be the hottest sector in the market.

Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was closed by Egypt and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits. A similar situation is playing out as ships are already being rerouted around Africa now. I think this could be the black swan event that kicks off a supercycle for the entire shipping industry.

My current positions are in calls, mostly in $STNG to play product tankers and $TNK to play crude.

$20 STNG 7/16 2021
$15 TNK 5/15 2021
And I have some yolo $4 NAT 4/16 calls

Edit 2:

From 2000-2021, 2687 vessels were built (MR, LR1, LR2) and 1251 of those vessels were built from 2000-2006 so roughly 47% of the global product tanker fleet will have passed that 15 year mark this year.

The supply side of product tankers is dwindling fast while demand is still rising, its simple supply and demand. But now with the Suez Canal blockage, the supply is only getting more and more constrained."
03/27/2021,stocks,Is tanker gang coming back????? I hope it works out for y'all this time

She ended up failing upward to a better paying job in oceanic logistics. I like to imagine she was the one that routed this shipment up the suez canal because that would be hilarious.

What was the point of this story? If it actually was her that routed it up there the canal will probably be blocked for another 2 years, the ship will get wedged in even deeper and they'll give up and dig a new channel around it."
03/27/2021,stocks,"there was talk of another toilet paper shortage, as a Brazilian company that dominates raw paper pulp is blocked out of the Suez for now.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Just because shipping gets more expensive, doesn't make it more profitable. The cost increases are to offset not just the lack of availability, but the added overhead when the short cut is cut off.

03/27/2021,stocks,For real. I wanted to play this so bad but can‚Äôt do NAT again
03/27/2021,stocks,"Charter rates have already sharply increased in some tanker segments. Going around Africa is a lot of extra TonKm that will swallow some of the extra supply in the market. No changes though to market fundamentals so many stock prices will probably settle back down after Suez is cleared. 
Tanker market is a very efficient supply/demand market and suez is a major VLCC route. If the blockade will last next week it will have a clear positive impact on TCE, albeit a short one"

03/27/2021,stocks,Yeah the Suez Canal experts are directly incentivized to downplay the seriousness of the situation and that they‚Äôll have it done any day now. So we will have to just sit and see

03/27/2021,stocks,The 5 blockage has already sent LR2 and LR1 rates up 30-40% in the last few days and it‚Äôll continue to rise exponentially each day that gets delayed
03/27/2021,stocks,"For sure, but dont understand what you mean costed in for a margin of delay? The delay wont change the TCE for ships that was fixed before suez blockade, only ships that are getting fixed now."
03/27/2021,stocks,"If only we could drone them some pizza.  Fricken rich, we would be.  :). 

Cheers bro."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I mean all contracted routes include ‚Äúpotential delays‚Äù in their agreements, so minimal disruption won‚Äôt affect their price. Most fleets are contracted in an annual basis so there would be very few if any ‚Äúnew‚Äù contracts being issued during/after suez. Granted this delay limits the amount of future delays they can have and remain within the contract window, but that‚Äôs a future issue that we cannot know yet.

Our company uses a 3% costing for delays annually, but never surpasses 1% so even a delay like this would have minimal effect as we have a 2% annual (3x) cushion. Most shippers operate on a similar basis."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Delay is always part of the charter party and they can vary greatly depending on agreement with charter. In this case it‚Äôs likely force majeur and charter would pay for extra transport days. 
Regarding, vessels in spot market versus long term time charter. There is a lot of tanker companies that prefer to play spot market and do voyage charter unless they sign a very good TC when market is high. Having a long term TC in crude oil is risky since market can change quickly."

If the stock is above that price (say $430) at the end of the day on 4/30, that ‚Äúcall‚Äù can be ‚Äúexercised‚Äù on 100 of those shares. So you are paying $10 less per share then the current rate.

Individual investors rarely exercise these contracts, you will probably end up selling it and then a larger financial firm will exercise that contract. If the stock fails to meet that ‚Äústrike price‚Äù the option expires, worthless. It‚Äôs way, way riskier then owning shares. 

The ‚Äúpremium‚Äù you pay for the call varies wildly based on how volatile that stock is. For instance, tech stocks tend to have much higher premiums then a boring industrial stock does.

Let's say they all cost 0.001. You buy 100,000 shares each. Effectively making you a millionaire if even one rockets. But you've got to buy all of them. So $160,000.

2021-03-27 13:01:04,stocks,"VOO + VTI vs. QQQM + QQQJ + VTI... 20+ year long term portfolio (DD) I am in the process of finalizing exactly what i want me portfolio to look like i want it to be simple, diversified, safe and efficient. 

VTI is my main holding at 70%. That will not change. I allocated 10% to stocks (my play/ fun/ risk), 5% to SCHD for dividends/ mostly value stocks, 5% to SMH (semi conductors), and 5% to VIS (Vanguard industrials) due to VTIs lack if industrials plus i believe infrastructure will be a big thing year over year. So that leaves me with 5% to go. 

I am debating on whether that is better allocated to tech heavy QQQM and QQQJ or VOO. 

QQQM
This is the alternative to QQQ but has a lower daily volume and expenses ratio. They are identical, however, QQQ does hold one more stock than QQQM according to a few tools I've seen and this does result in a higher performance for QQQ (less than 1%) 

Tracks nadaq top 100 stocks 
Tech weight- 63%
ER- 0.15% 
YTD- (-)0.47%
1 year- 71% 
5 year- 24%
10 year- 20%

QQQJ 

Tracks nasdaq 100-200 stocks. 
ER- 0.15%
YTD- 1.67% 
1 year- 18% 
Unfortunately this ETF is new and doesnt have any more performance data. 

Average YTD return- 0.59% 
Average 1 year return- 45% 

VOO

Tracks the top 500 of the S&P. 

Tech weight= 34%. 
ER- 0.03% 
YTD- 4%
1 year- 62%
5 year- 16%
10 year- 14% 


Performances wise Voo best QQQM/J over the last year however QQQ has best VOO year over year. 

7 of the top 10 holds of VOO (~23%)/ QQQ (~44%) are the same however hold they hold a much heavier weight in QQQ.

79 of QQQMs 103 holdings and 42 of QQQJs holdings are in VOO for a total of 121 holdings for abouts a 60% find overlap. 



This is where im not really sure which is best for me. 

On one had QQQM/QQQJ have consistently out performed VTI while VOO has fallen just short or been withing <1%. 

QQQM/J is much heavier into tech than VOO. which i believe to be a downside in the long 15-20 year hold (6 months ago I wouldn't have thought that but this correction we are in has humbled me). VOO does provide a much better diversification than QQQM/J while still being overweight in tech. 

The lower ER of VOO is a nice bonus. 

VOO does also have about 0.5% higher dividend pay out than QQQM/J put together. 

VOO is 98% large cap stocks while QQQM is 100% large cap but QQQJ is primarily Mid/ small (no actual weight available when i researched).

Note- due to VOOs S&p weighting it has survived this dip we are in much better than QQQM/J, however, has the S&P rises to new highs will we see a pull back thatll wash that fact out...?

In the end which is better is the question. 

Someone who believes in tech and or believes in up and coming tech could be easily persuaded to QQQM/QQQJ. 

While someone looking for diversification and less risk while still toting a nice return would be interested in the 500 holding VOO. 

Which will out perform the other over the next 20 years? Well that is a good question. 

Right now after this DD.... I am leaning towards QQQM/J. but i also am very tempted by VOO due to its wider holdings, lower ER and performance."

03/27/2021,stocks,"There's a lot of overlap between VTI and VOO, no need to hold both. Holding QQQ or any similar tech concentration expects that tech will continue to outperform VTI for 20 years...

2021-03-27 12:47:14,stocks,"Initial Thoughts on Trinity Bank The rest of the write-up is at: https://netosnotes.blogspot.com/2021/03/trinity-bank.html

Trinity was founded in May of 2003 by Jeffrey Harp. It started with just over $11 million in capital from 258 people in his circle of friends in Tarrant County, Texas.

Founder and CEO, Jeffrey Harp, was previously CEO of Summit Bancshares, where he spent 16 years. Summit was a 138-year-old bank that was acquired by Frost in 2006. When Summit was acquired, it had over $900 million in deposits. Much like Frost and Trinity, albeit to a lesser extent, Summit also made most of its loans to businesses (both C&I and owner-occupied CRE) and had a cheap source of funding ‚Äì given that most deposits were non-interest-bearing demand deposits from banks. Whether we are talking about the loan book, the securities book, earning asset‚Äôs duration, the source of deposits or leverage, the three banks are similar.  

(...)

I would say that the main difference between Frost and Trinity in terms of culture and business model, is that Trinity has a much sharper focus on keeping costs low. Assets per employee at Trinity are $13 million versus $7 million at Frost and $6 million at similarly sized (compared to Trinity) banks. The fact that Trinity does a lot with little is achieved by basically leveraging their fixed costs at their only branch. Much like a hedge fund, the contribution margin of increasing assets becomes bigger and bigger, until more branches, etc. are needed. Trinity opened in May of 2003 with 13 employees. They managed to work with 13 employees until the balance sheet grew to $215 million in deposits. In practical terms, this translates into non-interest expense (rent, salaries, etc.) as percentage of average assets of 1.5% versus 2.7% for peer banks and 2.3% for banks with $1-3bn in assets. Curiously, net non-interest expense is 1.3% at Trinity versus 2.2% at peer banks and 1.4% at larger banks (which typically charge more fees)."

I sold all 200 shares of $Stock and bought the same amount in my TFSA at the same price. My average is now 0.85 cents. I plan to hold $Stock long term and could potentially see a 10x or more return. Did I mess up by doing this transfer or will nothing be effected compared to if I kept the shares in my personal account?

2021-03-27 10:49:18,stocks,"5 Considerations When Picking Stocks for Long-Term Growth Like many of you, I started actively investing a year and a half ago. The recent rotation was a rude awakening for me because it specifically impacted growth, tech, and renewables (the majority of my holdings).

I have since taken on a cautiously aggressive strategy of picking individual stocks that pass five tests. I wanted to run my theory by this group to hear your thoughts. Note, I‚Äôm not trying to find deep value stocks or ten-baggers or anything ‚Äì just solid doers that have a good chance of outperforming the market for many years to come.

**Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?**

Think of getting your driver‚Äôs license photo taken. When I most recently renewed my license, I had a huge beard, and now I‚Äôm stuck with that photo for most of my 30s. Of course you don‚Äôt need to hold a stock that long. But I think it‚Äôs a good framework for analyzing stocks, because they really should be longer term investments. Is this a company that will still be doing well in six years? Can I take myself seriously holding this for that long?

**Test 2: What‚Äôs the P/E ratio?**

Nothing new here. But it‚Äôs usually the next thing I consider. 12 to 24 great. 25 to 34 understandable. 35-49 caution. 50+ or negative, too speculative.

**Test 3: Did it already moon?**

This was an oversight with one of my original picks. The stock had been trading in the teens in 2019 and was around $100/share when I first bought it. Averaging down is no fun. If a stock mooned anytime in the last 5 years, you might have to accept you missed the ticket. Check 10, 20+ years back for older companies to gain more context.

**Test 4: How linear is its growth?**

Ideally I‚Äôd like to see a perfectly straight line over the past 5 years. Something that steadily marches upward over time with minimal volatility, and something that has gained between roughly 125-250% over the past 5 years. While I think lots of companies will do well as companies, I‚Äôm hesitant to invest in them if their history looks like a roller coaster. I especially take note of how a company did through 2018-2019, how it did before the Covid crash vs. after, and how it did these past couple months.

**Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?**

Maybe this goes without saying, but I think a company's profitability is a good indication of whether it will do well in the future. It‚Äôs nice to see the past 5 earning reports beat expectations, though 4 out of 5 isn‚Äôt bad either.

Of course, it‚Äôs hard for any stock to pass all five tests, and if I was a purist I probably wouldn‚Äôt be very diversified. Some stocks that fit closely with these criteria include UNP, GOOGL, V, HD, DG, TMO, SPGI, and TXN. (This is not financial advice.) Can you think of any others?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Trading for a year and a half and has advice. SMH


Anyway, here's 13 years investing responding.

> Test 1: Will I feel good owning this six years from now?

How do you even know how you'll feel about anything in six years? You've only been trading for a fourth that time.

Anyway, this isn't really on the nose. It's got some aspects, but it's not quite right.

First, not every trade has to last six years. And you should never go into something thinking you will stick out any amount of time. I'm not knocking long term holds (some of my biggest gains have been from decade long holds), but don't think every play has to be long term. If it goes sideways, exit.

Edit: man I really started talking about an onion on my belt there. Let's get back on point.

What you should be think about is ""how do I think I'll feel about this portion of my portfolio tied into this for that long"". It's really not about the stock, it's about the fact that it's tied up in something. So, you have to scale in appropriately.

> Test 2: What‚Äôs the P/E ratio?

Ok, well, what's even more important is forward P/E, and there you need to factor in risks of it not meeting that expectation as well as the chance that that's underestimated.

And P/E is not and end all be all either. I went through a phase a few years ago where I was only acquiring low P/E companies. I dropped the last of that last year because it performed terribly.

Right now, I barely know the P/E of anything I'm invested in and everything is certainly outside of my old range. If the market starts to care about P/E again, then by all means switch to this, but it's important to understand what the market really is doing.

> Test 3: Did it already moon?

This is pretty important when doing short term trades, but I've found for longer terms a recent moon isn't a big negative. A recent moon and pull back is really quite positive, but even without a pull back, a previous moon leads to more financing leads to better opportunities for the company and people accepting a higher price. In the long term, things tend to work on percents, so the fact that doubled from 50 to 100 means it needs 100 more to double again means little.

> Test 4: How linear is its growth?

To you mean how linear is the log of it's growth? Because ideally growth is exponential. Not tsla exponential but at least a good curve up.

Even then, I feel here that this is excluding great investments for lowered (perceived) risk. Plus it's trading off the chart which is something I recommend against.

> Test 5: How are their quarterly earnings?

I don't like this section at all. Firstly, I believe a growth company should target zero or slightly negative profit. They should be reinvesting at a rate that they have nothing left over and they should be borrowing to do so. The fact that they can borrow to do so is a good sign. Revenue should be increasing to reflect this.

But what caught me is when you said they should constantly be beating expectations. No. This could mean they are bad at estimating or it could mean they are front loading sales and it's going to come as a surprise later dumped into a bad market condition so it doesn't look quite as much like accounting chicanery.

I like the earnings report to be pretty within expectations, and the revisions to be upward."
03/27/2021,stocks,If I knew the answer to number 1 I wouldn't need this sub.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Was thinking that in #4 you should also analyze debt and free cash flow. That information could be found on quickfs.net or other website if you want their track records. Pretty easy to do, free, and you can find all the financial information on most companies."
03/27/2021,stocks,"From everything you said, it seems like you would be the ideal candidate to invest in index funds. Pick something like VUG, dump some money in it, and find more ways to generate income to dump more money into it. The end result will be similar or better than if you actively picked stocks based on those criteria. Higher returns than an index will almost always necessitate more risk than what you've outlined.

If indexes aren't spicy enough for you then you can sprinkle in some speculative stocks once in a while or throw some options into the mix. But if you're looking for reliable growth companies with minimal risk I personally wouldn't bother stock picking. Bad ROI of your time."
03/27/2021,stocks,"P/E ratio isn‚Äôt a good metric, I prefer price to sales and projected growth as a combination with it. Your first point touched on it but what‚Äôs most important is what a companies business does and where you think it‚Äôll be in 5-10 years time. For example I own both PYPL and SQ despite higher valuations because I have a belief that Financial Tech is going to replace traditional brick and mortar banking because of the massive cost declines and greater accessibility it has over traditional banking. Also some businesses could be exactly where they are today returning slight growth and paying a dividend like KO and maybe that‚Äôs what you want. Investing is all about what your vision of the future is. Risk tolerance is also very important too, and that has a lot to do with age as well."
03/27/2021,stocks,Test 6: is it called AAPL?
03/27/2021,stocks,"I agree with number 1 and I do that with every stock I own. I think number is irrelevant on high growth stocks because you‚Äôre really paying a (sometimes insane) premium for what the company will be earning in the future, so it‚Äôs PE will be absurd today. Everyone has different investing strategies though and for some people they really want a low PE, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that, I just personally couldn‚Äôt care less as long as the future revenue growth and direction of the company makes sense. Number 3 I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs mooned as long as I still see rapid growth in the future even if it‚Äôs already had a huge run, doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt run a lot more, really depends on the company. Number 4 I think is pretty irrelevant for any stocks really as past performance doesn‚Äôt give any indications for the future at all. 

Analyzing quarterly and annual earnings reports is an absolute must for any investor so no sane person can disagree with number 5 haha. I have no problem if a company falls short on their earnings reports as long as there‚Äôs a valid reason that they‚Äôve since over come, or are likely to easily overcome. I‚Äôm not worried about profitability today but again, different investors look for different things. I‚Äôd much rather a high growth company sustain net losses year over year to grow the company more as long as they have the funding to do so safely, but again everyone looks for different things in a company, and there‚Äôs no right or wrong answer here. 

If this is the list that you find works well for you then stick with it. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to investing, just stick with whatever works for you personally."
03/27/2021,stocks,Lockheed Martin seems like a solid pick right now.

03/27/2021,stocks,"People gotta really drop the P/E ratio act when it comes to tech, though. If you're talking traditional companies such as banks and retailers, sure, P/E might be relevant here but when it comes to tech (which is pretty much where most of the $ is going to these days), looking at P/E ratio is going to screw you of many opportunities. How many of us would have loved to have gotten in on Netflix and Amazon back when their P/E didn't exist because they were losing a ton of money? Tech is largely about market share and to gain that, you need to spend a ton of money so the P/E doesn't really help you with that. Your Test #4 can help with that but I would drop the P/E ratio for the majority of tech stocks (in which the gains are largely there). Sales to price ratio is more relevant than P/E here."
03/27/2021,stocks,Is anyone looking at VIAC? It‚Äôs down over 70% in a week üò≥
03/27/2021,stocks,"Good summary, thank you!"
03/27/2021,stocks,Just good mate
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks, like your list! I agree with the sentiment here on high P/E. My best bets in the last few years came from companies with very high P/E. Snap and Amazon. Amazon did 4x in 4 years on a very high P/E. Now their P/E is much lower thanks for very high earnings growth. So that's maybe an important indicator - high P/E is OK if you see a nice trend of growing earnings.

As for missing the boat if a company already mooned. That's a good one I struggle a lot with. Some companies are still good investments as long they still have solid growth and didn't moon mainly because of hype. Then there is also the market cap. For example, Etsy mooned in 2020 because of covid. But their current market cup is still not that high at $20B. Then you have Zoom who also mooned for the same reason. But Zoom at $100B market cap is much riskier now in my opinion. Even though their growth is very strong and it's a great business. They pass your number one test for sure."

03/27/2021,stocks,"These are all great metrics. You mention however that you are ‚Äúcautiously aggressive‚Äù which is a paradoxical statement to say the least. However, it is important to highlight if you are tailored for growth. A major factor to mention is the CEO and board of directors. Are the values and the direction the company is heading towards aligned with your investment values. For instance are they buying back shares, paying out shareholders dividends, or acquiring other assets and companies. A lesson to learn from the gme stock is that the shareholders are owners of the company. With this mentality it is important to think like an owner and ensure your views corresponded with that of the CEO‚Äôs and management."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think the p/e ratio was a good indicator, but interest rates have destroyed it, it's amazing how many companies have never and never intend on turning a profit. 

When you get an Uber ride it's partially paid for by investors and with out raising prices or lowering costs, they will never change that. So no p/e ratio, probably never will be one, but people continue to invest and make money ü§Ø."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Honestly, half my stock is KO and then various utilities. Is it a lot of growth? No, but that portfolios value has gone up 20% in the last 4 years and even when the rest of the market was exploding up and down, majority of my investment saw only a little volatility.

Honestly, 2 of the big things I look for, especially for the ""core"" of a portfolio, are ""how old is the company/do they offer something people will always want"" and then ""what effect did their last scandal have?"""
03/27/2021,stocks,"100% agree. Number 1 of your 5 is the only thing I agree with. 

Read the company‚Äôs most recent annual report. Then the previous quarterly. Find on sec.gov edgars reports. 

Compare balance sheets. Then research the liabilities and strategic investing of the company. If you still like it. Buy it.

Edit: look at partnerships as well some companies get into partnerships that reflect in 10k reports. If it‚Äôs new they may be investing in the contract debt for a payout later. 

Not financial advise."
03/27/2021,stocks,"P/E can be extremely inflated though depending on the market environment - Wouldn't it be a concern betting on such a P/E to be justified down the line when things can change significantly in the future?

IF you chose to invest even if they have a crappy P/E that‚Äôs okay, but its certainly not irrelevant even for tech."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but I think UBER is a bad business model, and unprofitable businesses aren‚Äôt always bad to invest in if they have a good plan to one day be profitable. Amazon wasn‚Äôt profitable for a long time and was a good investment before it was, and after it was profitable people argued it was overvalued because of the high P/E ratio, but they didn‚Äôt see the bigger picture of how Amazon was trying to put all of its money towards expansion and whatnot. Amazon is probably the main reason why I think P/E ratio is not the best way to value a stock."

Humble yourself on actual fundamentals and how to value a business. Read the intelligent investor or some books from Peter Lynch. You need to know if u are buying something at a fair price , even if you love the company. 'oh but it's the future bro' is speculative.

- Learn to invest (fundamentals) 

- The Swedish investor: he summarizes A LOT of investing books in 10 minutes and it's an incredibly rich resource if you have limited time to read books

- Ben Felix tho tldw he will just give you research after research that you should buy total market index funds

03/27/2021,stocks,"Dave Ramsey got me to pay attention. He recommends a certain 401k allocation, and recommends growth stocks when possible. My job had a large cap growth and a large cap value. Hmm. I'd better learn the difference between growth and value investing. I found the subject fascinating and keep reading everything I could get my hands on. I started buying single stocks after reading Peter Lynch's books."
03/27/2021,stocks,"My first real exposure was in history class in jr high. We did a segment on the market crash leading to the great depression and as a part of that the teacher ran a kind of stock simulator group activity. It doesn't sound like a lot, but to me it made a huge impression.

After that, I saw it often as a background in BBS door games (bulletin board systems were kind of a precursor to the internet). I learned how to work the system in these to make quite a lot for my character. It actually taught some good basics but reality doesn't work like bbs games. Also, honorable mention to tradewars because, although it's not stocks, it did provide some foundations that I used later.

In my early twenties, I was given stocks and options as part of my work. I'd say I didn't really understand this stuff at the time but it was the dot com era so it seemed like this was an important aspect of the job. Ultimately, none of this turned out valuable because I worked for companies that failed.

Then I started working in finance (IT systems). As a part of that, I had a 401k match and some stocks but I was pretty passive about things. Then the 2008 crash happened and I decided I really needed to understand this stuff well. I dove in, mostly watched YouTube videos and read a lot of articles videos but I did talk a little with a few members of my family that were in it (this isn't really a big help, tbh. Retrospectively, I think a lot of this advice was crap).

I would make my own spreadsheets, do my own simulations, and started putting my money in. Harkening back to my TradeWars experience, I started looking for black swan events that I could get a contrary options position to in order to capture the recovery. My best one at that time was putting 3k down on some British Petroleum calls a few weeks after they accidentally dumped a bunch of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. That weekend, the US federal government declared they were backstopping the losses BP would take and that trade went to 125k. It went beyond that, even but that's where I sold.

I don't trade like that anymore. I feel 13 years later I'm a lot more sophisticated. It's been a lot of incremental learning, especially from (sometimes expensive) trade mistakes. Still, overall, I'm easily beating the market, I retired in my late thirties several years ago (I'm in my early forties now), and my only real task is managing my money which I've shifted my trade style to not require much active day-to-day work, so that I can really just focus on my family.

Edit: forgot to mention, I took freshman level accounting electives in college that helped me understand how to value a company and it covered stocks minorly."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Investopedia is your friend!

They also have a simulator that lets you use fake money using real prices. I did this for a while before throwing real money in, and it was a great way to learn (and execute trades without worrying about losing your ass).

03/27/2021,stocks,"I started by reading every book I could get my hands on. The Warren Buffet Way was super helpful for a mindset shift.

The .41% fee is higher that you'd pay for indexes via the Canadian branches of Fidelity or Vanguard. He preaches against home country bias, but he's heavily in Canadian stocks.

It's easy to lie with statistics.


Most of them mess with low-cap stocks. Very low cap stocks. The type where a small group can move the stock price. This is exploited by having a pay structure where higher pay = real time 'tips' and lower pay or free having longer time-frames. Bagholders. Resembles a ponzi/pyramid scheme. Not smart, not lucky...I'd call it 'clever'. It's a clever grift.


It's definitely upsetting to see it happening in plain sight, but it also scales. The Yahoo finance spam often works inverse to rational investment/trade advice.

03/27/2021,stocks,"This can and probably will be way larger of an impact than expected. I‚Äôve been through the Panama Canal, 18 years USCG experience, 4 years working at NYC ports. I know these situations. 

Sunday is an attempt to free the ship with the highest tide, full moon and all. After that it‚Äôs going to be a long haul. Probability of Sunday working is extremely very low. These ships have so much weight and when they run aground they suck into the earth. The physics of lifting them from being stuck is incredibly difficult and it‚Äôs not gonna happen here. 

After that failed attempt comes trying to make the ship lighter by removing containers, and deballasting fuel. If you look at the images, the ship isn‚Äôt just sitting at a pier with cranes ready to work. So setting up cranes to take off the containers is going to take time. Two weeks atleast. My very educated prediction is it is going to take three weeks minimum to release the ship from blocking the canal. 

Taking off enough containers would take 300-400 barges... that would take months to organize. 

Worst case scenario is the ship is improperly deballasted and it lists or capsizes in the canal. Then we are talking 6 months to clear the ship.

The way I‚Äôm thinking is not every ship running through there has freight that will only be seeing the ports on that ships route many of the containers are just hitching a ride on ship A heading to Port A just to be placed on ship B for port B and so if it‚Äôs something going from Europe to South Africa then to Australia or America it is affecting those countries or industries in those countries that are depending on supply from the containers that came from the origin country or originally hitched a ride on ship A.

2021-03-27 08:14:08,stocks,"Drinking and Trading don‚Äôt mix. I accidentally bought equity warrants instead of ordinary stock. How do I make money of of this mistake? Title says it all. Had a few too many drinks of liquid courage and bought 50 shares of Cresco Labs Equity Warrants (CRLWF) instead of the ordinary shares (CRLBF). I used Fidelity to buy the shares resulting in a fee of $100 (bought 30 and then 20 and didnt notice the $50 fee for each.) So my cost basis is around $8 while the listing price for CRLWF is around $6. 

If I sell now, I get hit with another $50 transaction fee, plus lose the $100 and some change. The warrants expire in September of 2022. The strike price is around $9.90. 

Is there anyway I can come out of this by either breaking even or making a profit? I‚Äôm pretty confused about how to exercise warrants, and how people even make money of equity warrants. Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

And no need to call me a moron....i‚Äôm very well aware if that. Thank you again!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"So there‚Äôs 2 main differences between a warrant and a call/put option. 

- a company issues the warrants 

- said company issues new shares if the warrant is exercised 

ELI5: options are between you and another party, usually the MM. You pay a premium to reserve a price point in the future to buy or sell a stock at, regardless of the price of the stock. When you get a warrant, the *company* issues you the warrant, and if you exercise it the company issues you new shares and they make profit. A MM is delta hedged and not trying to profit or lose from their position, so a warrant is more beneficial to a company directly. It‚Äôs basically an option but with the company itself. 

How do you make money from this mistake? You have 2 choices. You wait for the price of the stock to get closer to your strike price, and sell the warrant for a profit. Or wait for the stock price to go past your strike price, exercise the warrant to buy the stock at your price and then sell it for the market price.

03/27/2021,stocks,"So, to come out on top, you'll need to sell which is another $50 fee, increasing the cost basis to $9. Strike of $9.90 means the stock has to go to $18.90 by September 2022 for you to break even. 

Looking at the chart, it hit 17.49 on 2/10. Where it started a long downslide. This timing is similar to the recent nasdaq fall but there's enough differences to where I'm not seeing high correlation.

So, why is it sliding and can it recover? If I could get comfortable with it recovering to above $18.90 within the next year, I'd just hold. Hell, I might hold anyway just to remind myself of the mistake. Or I might hold because any move towards is a smaller loss than here.

But, again, it depends on why it's sliding. But you were catching this falling knife, so I'd assume you know."
03/27/2021,stocks,Oof
03/27/2021,stocks,"Dont drink and trade.
You learned something.

03/27/2021,stocks,Guess it depends on the company holding the security? Blackberry May be a bad equity warrant to make money off of for instance?
03/27/2021,stocks,The amount of money is so small you might as well use this as a learning experience.
03/27/2021,stocks,I e been wanting to buy into Cresco but E*TRADE doesn‚Äôt allow OTC. Sad.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Well it sounds like you don't have a lot of money tied up in it so that's fortunate. If they go up in value you can sell, or you can exercise them and make money, I wouldn't worry about it. Part of the market is learning to lose money"
03/27/2021,stocks,"As far as drunk mistakes, that's not so bad.
I sold 5000 shares of one of my positions when I was trying to buy, only to have it jump 5% before I fixed the mistake.
I wasn't drunk but I was sampling some spicy dank at the time."
03/27/2021,stocks,Don't try to fix the mistake own it and let it destroy you. Only then you will repeat such mistakes.
03/27/2021,stocks,"The warrants for cresco labs are an excellent option , you sir made a wise mistake minus the fees , these will reap $$ and a good way to leverage your bets. Don‚Äôt worry  by 2022 you‚Äôll thank yourself for making that mistake ."
03/27/2021,stocks,I couldn‚Äôt have done this sober. Congrats!
03/27/2021,stocks,"Hey, coulda gone a lot worse. Your delta direction for the trade is still what you intended.

Also, asking yourself ‚Äúhow do I make money off of this mistake‚Äù is honestly one of the best questions you can objectively ask yourself, securities and derivatives trading wise."
03/27/2021,stocks,Usually warrants move more drastically and you are getting more bang for your buck if warrants jump 20%
03/27/2021,stocks,I almost invested in TMUS after a friend that was a Sr. director  there said not to.  It went up over $5% the next day.  Just shows how we should invest against what we think.

I‚Äôm sorry if I didn‚Äôt make that clear

03/27/2021,stocks,"The last letter in the ticker is F, it is a foreign stock which Fidelity takes a $50 fee on every trade"
03/27/2021,stocks,They charge the $50 if it is a non dtc held security. Only way to know if yo review your trade confirmation before you submit.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Depends on your definition of reality. Is roaming the fifth dimension considered an upgrade? If so, then being sober is a crippling state of mind in which you can't make any proper decisions without violating the space-time inversion codex and you are literally making losses in the gravitational sector every femto second. But if you are happy in your third dimensional illusion then you probably should downgrade into two dimensional continuum in order to save on quantized energy spectrums as those will allow you to interact with low-volatility boson derivatives more easily.

Personally, I recommend leaving three dimensional space one way or another if you consider yourself an actual being and aren't just a quark-triggered consciousness."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Probably first few minutes to an hour, until the senior traders introduces them to cocaine with booze"

03/27/2021,stocks,Yup. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. But I was looking at a limit sell of $15 and the pay-off would be around $700. So what the hell is the point of buy warrants? What‚Äôs so special about them?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Totally. I‚Äôm the same way. Thats why im not toooo bummed about buying the stock and then exercising the warrant to get regular shares of cresco. I‚Äôm sure the strike price will hit after federal legalization and up listing to nasdaq. Just feel really stupid i would be losing out in $150 in profit.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Cresco warrants are a good buy, he just way overpaid for them."
03/27/2021,stocks,He didn‚Äôt. r/SPACs have been dealing with warrants forever. You actually get 1/5th of a warrant on some brokers when you buy shares of a SPAC. So you get free-cheap af warrants. One thing making SPACs enticing.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Probably not.

Their time value is decaying. And if you don't know their expiration date it could go by while you're still asking questions.

A warrant is an option issued by the company itself. So it follows the statistics of options, and it will expire.

If you go and do the math on that and think it's still a good deal, then keep the position but give it the extra attention an option requires. If it still confuses you then sell the warrants and buy the proper stock."
03/27/2021,stocks,WAIT! Memory loss about what?

03/27/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt usually frequent this sub to be honest, this post popped up in my feed so I stopped in to help a fellow drinker lol. I‚Äôm glad I was able to help spread some information."
03/27/2021,stocks,"So if it will cost you 1,000 dollars to exercise your contract but the profit on the option is currently 1500, personally I would just sell the contract. A majority of people do not actually exercise the contract we sell it for profit. You would need an extra 1,000 cash to exercise the option as it‚Äôs 1500 value has not been *realized* yet since you haven‚Äôt closed the position. 

My advice is that you sell options for profit and don‚Äôt exercise them. The only time you exercise an option is when it‚Äôs expiring and you still expect the price to move favorably for your position."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Would it *always* be better to sell instead of exercising? No. 

I saw something yesterday that is a good example of this. 

Guy exercised his GME $50 call option yesterday instead of selling. Why do you think that is? If he buys GME yesterday at $50 a share, then to me that says he thinks the price will still go up. So why sell the option and make X amount of money, when you can exercise and hold the shares because you think it‚Äôs going to go up more bringing in Y amount of money. 

We typically don‚Äôt exercise options because it‚Äôs expensive, and the capital has already been used on the options. You are correct in not exercising before expiry because of theta decay, but I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as to say that it‚Äôs *always* better to sell > exercise. 

This is just my opinion tho not financial advice."
03/27/2021,stocks,Just to make this clear that might only be for warrants. I've purchased CRLBF shares with no fee through Fidelity.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I think they are highly situational... and you unfortunately picked a horrible time.. id have to do some research to actually give an answer id stand behind. 


Via google_Warrents_

What are Stock Warrants?


Stock warrants are options issued by a company that trade on an exchange and give investors the right (but not obligation) to purchase company stock at a specific price within a specified time period. When an investor exercises a warrant, they purchase the stock, and the proceeds are a source of capital for the company. However, a warrant does not mean the actual ownership of the stocks but rather the right to purchase the company shares at a particular price in the future. Warrants are not popular in the United States, but they are common in other countries such as China."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I understand they are like leveraged options. What strike price can you exercise your warrants for?

So if they are half the price of the stock you can buy twice as many. Assume a strike price of $6 and no premium/discount.

Stocks - 50 at $12
Warrants ‚Äê 100 at $6.

Let's say the stock goes to $20.

Stocks 50 x $20 = $1000
Warrants 100 x $14 ($20-$6 strike price) = $1400

Or if they were really successful and went to $50:

Stocks $2500
Warrants $4400

That is my understanding of them.

Warrants expire, so that's your increased risk in holding them."
03/27/2021,stocks,I hope you achieve your dream bro. It took me ten years of saving in the military and good investing the last 5 years that finally made the dream come true for me.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Check the price sheet for your broker. There are still a couple of things you can do that cost you a bunch of money just to do them. Especially if you want to take your account away from them.

My guess here is that warrants have a different clearing process than stock which requires a human at the brokerage to do something with the paperwork."

03/27/2021,stocks,"As far as my 5 minutes of research shows.. yea it kinda sounds like a short. But more convoluted and done as a way to promise a later purchase... however the fees he accrued would then be strange unless its what they want for the privilege of a locked price. 

But like I said I am in no way sure, I read a Google supplied paragraph that I posted. But as it sounds like its you paying a fee now for a locked in price for the length of the warrantee. 

 You don't have to buy but if you dont they still keep the ""fees"". However I believe he can buy up to the number he warrenteed for his aggregate amount. $9 a share. For example. No matter how expensive it gets. So on large orders it would probably be safer in a way.   But for small amounts it sounds like a rock around your neck."

2021-03-27 07:09:05,stocks,"Wash sale concerns for taxes. I pulled $30k from my main account to try day trading since my day job is just slow and I work from home. Its only about 5% of my total investment portfolio and its this or online poker.

Basically I've been sitting in cash and waiting for a certain % drop in a few stocks/ETFs I like. I'm mainly buy SOXL with a few options. I will buy and sell within a few days and am sitting in cash again. After a month I'm up $10k but I'm concerned about wash sales and taxes.

For example buying and selling the same stock:

3/1 Buy: 1000 @ $30

3/5 Sell: 1000 @ $40

Net : +$10000


3/7 Buy: 1000 @ $35

3/9 Sell: 1000 @ $25

Net : -$10000


3/25 Buy: 1000 @ $20
Holding current trade


After the first 2 trades I'm back to $30k and have netted $0. Do I owe taxes on the $10,000 in profits because the $10,000 loss is a wash? Or do I not owe taxes on these trades because I am net $0."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Wash sale means any gains or losses are rolled into the cost basis. Based on that, there‚Äôs no taxes owed as of this moment. If you had -10,000, that was rolled into the cost basis of your new purchase, offsetting the +10,000."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Only one person got it right in the whole comment section. I would look up wash sale examples from reputable brokers to get a better understanding. I recommend fidelity. You can just read it by looking it up, you don‚Äôt have to have an account with them."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I recommend talking to a licensed tax advisor but: Wash sale rules state that if you sell a security for a loss and purchase that same security or an identical security within 30 days from the sale, the realized loss will be removed from the initial sale and added on top of the total cost of the new purchase.

This would apply to trades done in all of your accounts across all brokers. Again if you are worried about how certain trades impact your tax situation, please talk to a professional."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I asked the same question before on Reddit and never got a clear answer. But I believe that wash sales really only matter if any transaction results in a loss and any leg of the transactions cross the year mark. So I always thought you were okay if every buy and sell of that stock was in the same tax year. 

I think it was meant to prevent you from selling at a loss on 12/31, claiming it on your taxes and buying back on 1/1. Essentially you kept the same stock since price should not change much in a few days, but you got to write off the loss on the previous year and that would be cheating the government"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Not definitely a tax expert, but if net gain/loss of $0 occurred in the same tax year, I don't think you would have to pay any taxes I think."
03/27/2021,stocks,I believe if you have a loss and you buy the same stock within 30 days it nullifies your loss deduction for taxes. I'm not a tax guy though.

Is it 30? Or is it 45?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think you can write off taxes with losses, but only up to a certain value. It would be worth researching tax write offs for losses"
03/27/2021,stocks,"No tax expert but I have dealt with this a few time for my own taxes. Wash sale is about you selling at a loss to then repurchase the same share or similar before 30 days to get a capital loss. If that is the case you cannot claim the loss. In your case you cannot deduct the 10k loss because you still have the shares. You have in practice 10k in gains.

Edit: Who the hell downvotes a post that is perfectly legit???? Thanks a lot"
03/27/2021,stocks,You only pay taxes on net gains at end of year. Wash sales only applies to losses against your income. So say you have a job and earn $50k a year. You put 10k in the stock market and make 1million but on December 31st you lose the 1 million and 20k from your wage income because you decide to yolo into some dumb stock. You wouldn‚Äôt owe taxes on the 1 million. However you would still owe all taxes on your (50k-($3k max deduction)) of income even tho you lost 20k on your hypothetical dumb yolo. The rest of your losses would be rolled over so for the next 17/3 years you‚Äôd be taxed as if you made 47k.  People keep repeating the wrong information.
03/27/2021,stocks,"So lets say, I buy and sell the same stock all year, day trades or short term sales. Always buying in and then selling 100% to all cash. Some times I net positive, some times I take a loss. On the trades I ended positive I made $100,000 on those. On trades I lost I came out -$90,000. 

So I would only pay taxes on $10,000 for the year?"
03/27/2021,stocks,This right here. Plus your new cost basis is $30 per share.
03/27/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs not true. Read on fidelity if you want to verify this. If you buy and sell within a month, it is a wash sale. However, having a wash sale makes it so that you cannot deduct it from taxes, instead it lowers your cost basis. So you‚Äôre gains and losses would be the same if you were to do the same transactions with 30 days in between."
03/27/2021,stocks,it's 30. https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/a-primer-on-wash-sales
03/27/2021,stocks,That is incorrect. A person cannot deduct the losses if they buy back the same stock within 30 days of selling it for a loss.
03/27/2021,stocks,"But if you sell it again (and it‚Äôs still a loss), then you can deduct right?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes, if you are holding only cash on December 31st, you pay taxes on whatever your net gain/loss is.

The wash sale rule is just to prevent you from being up $10k for the year and saying, ""Wait, I'm holding stock A that is currently down $10k. I'll just sell it now and pay no tax. But I like stock A, so I'll buy it back quickly to not lose out on gains."" Clever, but doesn't work."
03/27/2021,stocks,"You can sell the same stock repeatedly for a loss and claim the losses as long as within thirty days of a loss sale you do not buy back the same stock for less than you bought it for. Honestly a person can get in the weeds with this quickly, especially if the stocks were bought at differing prices, sold in differing lots, etc. IMO it‚Äôs best to stay away from this scenario altogether."
03/27/2021,stocks,"So this guy got screwed because he held a stocks with wash sales from 12/31/20 to 1/1/21? If he would've sold the stocks before the end of the year he would've just owed on his $40k?

2021-03-27 06:31:00,stocks,"How can I think that money is just money? This may be not the best place to ask, but I don‚Äôt know any other subreddit that is suitable to ask this question to.

I am a 21 year old that has been investing since I was 18. When I got my first job, I always put a quite big percentage of my paycheck to the stock market to the point where my close relatives told me that they see me as a person that don‚Äôt enjoy life as I used to. I think about stocks all the time and rarely spend my money on entertainment and going out with my friends. 

My advice request is: how can I think money (and investing) as a part of my life, and not dedicating my life entirely to it?"

03/27/2021,stocks,Declare a % of income that goes to stocks and stick with it. Use rest to enjoy life.
03/27/2021,stocks,"We live in a society that has given up on pensions and is pissing away the social security budget via frivolous government spending.  To tell you to live life and not worry so much about finances is bad advice from an internet stranger who isn‚Äôt invested in you long term.  Money is important and you need to be smart with it, but how strict you are is up to you.  

My strategy.  Just make sure the short, middle and long term buckets are full.

Short term bucket: have your emergency fund in cash on hand.  Some say 3-6 months.  I keep one year.  I know it‚Äôs too much but when the markets tank in a bloody dumpster fire I‚Äôm not tempted to cash out.  I have plenty of cash on hand and shrug it off.  Got that, then move to the long term bucket. 
Long bucket: automate your 401k and IRA savings so that you are maxing out tax advantages accounts for retirements.  If you start early in life you‚Äôll be set just off of these two. Once the tax advantages accounts are done work on the middle bucket.  
When you are done paying your bills every month siphon off everything over your emergency fund amount into a brokerage account you could use/touch if you wanted/needed to.  

Once you have those three buckets flowing naturally every month just have fun in life.  You‚Äôre 21.  It‚Äôll take time to get the full max on 401k and IrA down.  But once you‚Äôve got that, it‚Äôs ride out life and enjoy it.  Don‚Äôt say sorry about hustling until those are set up though.  Nobody telling you to just enjoy life is gonna lend you a dime once you are retired.  Be proud of financial discipline in a world of debt.  But as many have said, just don‚Äôt talk about it.  Nobody cares as much as you do and will only use it against you since they are jealous they aren‚Äôt doing the basics that you are."

And find hobbies you enjoy other than investing. The lure is tempting I know, but there's a lot more out there.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Hey take this for what it‚Äôs worth. 

I‚Äôd imagine the people telling you this are lower to middle class. I say this because everyone has a joy or collection habit. 

Some enjoy collecting shoes, cards, art or just stuff. Some folks pay for Netflix while other subscribe to audible books. 

People pay for gym memberships others use body weight and run outside. 

Folks gamble at casinos and folks gamble in penny stocks. 

Then we have the hobbies. Some peoples hobby is to go out for dinner 20$ a plate others enjoy cooking at home 10$ a plate. 

Some people enjoy reading business news to invest in businesses others watch TV news and are always mad or scared of the next earth destruction. 

If you invest because you like it that‚Äôs wonderful. I think you are asking the wrong question. 

You want to know if you are doing the right thing. 

Are you saving money and mad at life?Do you make others pay when you go out? Not tip servers? Or act cheap around others making the same kind of money as you? If so you may be creating a habit of being cheap to invest to be rich at the end of the day that‚Äôs being cheap and all the money won‚Äôt make you happy. If you have hobbies you enjoy and still save that‚Äôs great. Keep investing. 

It‚Äôs a balance of how much you make and how you spend. I drive a shitty car so I don‚Äôt have a car payment and invest that money. I still fish, bicycle, camp and enjoy life with friends. I don‚Äôt go out to eat often, impulse buy Amazon stuff and rarely go to bars to drink.

What‚Äôs your lifestyle. What do you enjoy and where do you sacrifice to save. Figure that out and if your not sacrificing what brings you joy you are good. 

People I work with collect shoes and think I‚Äôm crazy for collecting stocks. We all play basketball on Wednesdays I always wear the same shoes, some never wear the same shoes 2 times in a couple months. The 150 they spend on shoes I spend on shares of xyz. 

I know this came out as a rant - I am passionate about people saving and don‚Äôt like the bay sayers who don‚Äôt save making you second guess.

for people who find it difficult to spend money for their own enjoyment, he often suggests increasing generosity towards others can help loosen up. maybe start giving bigger tips at the restaurant, or donating to the Red Cross or something with every paycheck. this habit might sort of balance things out for you, and make it easier to spend money on yourself."

There is nothing wrong with dumping a chunk into a indexing/dividend/bond ETF and then buying some bluest of blue chips for your buy and hold.

It pays bills, pays for things, pays for ease of mind etc. Friends are also great. Good friends can outlast money because they like you for you, not for your money. Experiences are tools. Relationships are tools. Educating yourself in other topics that you enjoy can be a tool. You can take some of your money and takes some courses to help you with your job, or certifications, or even explore a different career path. Invest in yourself.

03/27/2021,stocks,all those options are underwater now
03/27/2021,stocks,I'm confused. ARKK closed at $114 today. Are they betting it goes up?
03/27/2021,stocks,I am staying with ITS MARCH DANG IT! thought it was typical for March to be a lagging month. If like me ARKK is in your portfolio your happy to see some of top investments gaining traction. I was going to be concerned if tesla upst and few others didn't start balancing.
03/27/2021,stocks,I started to hedge my portfolio against Arkk. It seems like it could go down another 20%+ easy before hitting the bottom

03/27/2021,stocks,"Not really. These were sweeps, so it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs an equally massive bullish bet vs each massive bearish one. It‚Äôs more like an institution or several institutions made several large bets against a pool of individual bullish investors."

03/27/2021,stocks,Agreed. Although I buy ark I second guess it often. They are extremely risky and the people who invest in them are mostly new investors who sell losses within a year. It‚Äôs insane. However if you like risk ark may have a big reward in a decade.
03/27/2021,stocks,ok so new ATH on Ark by summertime?
03/27/2021,stocks,It says ‚Äúput sweep‚Äù.

03/27/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs a good question. How much competition will Tesla have I think Tesla will go down as companies insert themselves into EV. Tesla will probably separate into 2 companies Tesla cars and batteries then another communications or utilities.

Zillow‚Äôs great that is the only company I see bullish zoom is good but Microsoft teams and this new strike force company may give zoom a run for money as zooms been hacked a few times and has security concerns.

i dont own ARKK, but judging how bearish everyone on this sub is, and considering its already down \~30%, i half expect it to gap up on Monday and never look back"
03/27/2021,stocks,"There's no way it doesn't rally if the Nasdaq is going to rally again soon.

It closed down 1.15% on March 5th where you saw a Nasdaq turnaround that was completely bananas, but it jumped 17% during the 5 trading days after the Monday after that.

Although on the other end, it would definitely be concerning that the Nasdaq-100, as of this moment, is ""only"" -0.8% from March 15th (and even if you think today needs to be thrown in the trash because of that late price action, it was -2.3ish% yesterday) and at the same time, ARKK is -11.57%. If the Nasdaq can't rally, then you're going to see nothing out of ARKK."

2021-03-27 05:08:06,stocks,"How to best trade/invest $184K when I have $188K in student loans? I'm about to receive a large inflow of cash on the order of $184K due to a recent settlement. I also have $188K in student loans, but there is NO INTEREST accruing until the end of September. I'm trying to figure out the best way to take advantage of this cash while also mitigating risk.

I'm not looking to yolo the money or anything, but throwing the money into an index or ETF also seems to slow. I've thought about just selling covered calls until then, although I'm not sure what stocks to buy.

Any ideas on the best way to do this so at the end of September I'll have a decent chunk of change to pay off my loans and also have some left over?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Just to be clear, my loans are interest free until September 30th 2021. I have six months until interest starts again. I think there's some confusion in the comments, of course I would pay my loan off the moment I get my check if the interest is actively accruing right now. Also edited my post to make this more clear.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Just for more information, currently financial situation besides the debt is fairly stable. $20K in savings, $20K in Roth, $16K in stocks, living at home until summer with no non-recreational expenses, making mid five figures until I finish my fellowhship program next year and then I can expect to make six figures.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I don't know what the terms of your loan are, the repayment terms, or at what interest rate.  But if you plan to invest the funds, don't take tremendous risks.  If you lost 20%-30% short term, you won't only have lost the money, but also be losing more because of the high interest rates of the debt.  I would set aside a good portion of the funds (at least 50%) and then if you have the tolerance onvest the rest.  And I wouldn't engage in advanced trading unless you 100% have done your research and have built some experience."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Invest in paying them off.

Edit:
When I‚Äôm considering a loan. Take the monthly payment of the loan. Multiply it by the length of the loan. Anything more than the 188k is interest paid.
Since I don‚Äôt know your monthly payment, I can‚Äôt do this for you. So let‚Äôs do this. 

$40,000 loan @11.99% over 12 years= $525(ish) per month. Divided by 144payments (12years x 12 months) = $272, anything over that is interest payment. So now, 525x144= $75,000(ish)

Do this with your loan, do you want to throw away that much interest money?"
03/27/2021,stocks,Pay off a comfortable amount (majority) and invest a little.
03/27/2021,stocks,This is the wrong time IMO to risk life changing $$ in the market. Your timing could be good as things have been red lately but it‚Äôs still early.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I think pay off the loans all at once is potentially wrong. Like, it‚Äôs not bad but there‚Äôs an interest point where it‚Äôs pretty absurd. If any of it is under 1% for instance it would be wild to pay it outright with cash. Do what you want though. For some people debt feels crushing. For others it‚Äôs just a financial instrument to manage."
03/27/2021,stocks,Holy heck just pay the mf loans off ASAP. The stock market will be open later for you to blow 184k

03/27/2021,stocks,"I was in a similar situation with more money on both sides (student debt and an inheritance that didn't cover it) and I whole-heartedly agree with paying off the loan even though it will absolutely hurt to write that check.

The one consideration I haven't seen covered here is potentially leaving a $10k balance on your student loans if they're all federal/Department of Education as Biden has been pretty vocal about forgiving that amount through either executive action or signing congressional legislation.

Conservatively invest the balance or stick it into a CD until student debt forgiveness is either done or given up on.

But 100% pay off the loan"
03/27/2021,stocks,You should speak with a financial advisor.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Here is a slight compromise. Do not pay off the loan. Do not yolo your capital.

What is your interest payment once your loan starts charging interest? If its a student loan variant, its probably around 5%? I'll go with that, but you should find that out.

Figure your P&I payment. I'm not going to try to guess that for you. Your goal for the next 6 months is to come up with an investment strategy that will earn whatever your payment is. 

Take 24 payments, principal & interest, and put in a savings account. Over the next 24 months, you won't have to worry about making payments, just have them auto-pay from your savings account. This will give you 30 months to hone your trading theta skills.

Use theta gang strategies and use the remaining capital, which will prob be around $125k, be aggressive but not stupid, and collect enough premium to make those payments. After a year or so, I would imagine you could make enough to not only make payments, but also be able to start supporting yourself."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Reverse the #‚Äôs.
Would you take out a 180k loan to put in the Market? If not, pay off the student loans."
03/27/2021,stocks,"oh man, just pay off the loans. 

the interest isn't the big issue, it's not about 'beating the spread' on interest rates. the fact is that most millionaires avoid debt like the plague (go read finance prof. Thomas J. Stanley's books on millionaire Americans for the data). debt increases risk and volatility in your financial life. companies that operate debt-free, or with low levels of debt, are much much much more stable than highly leveraged companies; Nassim Nicholas Taleb has written about this somewhere, as have others."
03/27/2021,stocks,I would be careful selling covered calls/etc as a beginner! But I think the smartest move would be to pay off a big chunk of the student loans with the settlement money first and then trading with what you have left. Invest in the stock market however much you're OK with losing.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Hmmmm!

**$184K**  settlement VS **$188K debt hanging over your head.**

May I ask what your major was in College? Don't gamble away the settlement as tempting as it might be. You will feel a lot better with that debt not over your head."
03/27/2021,stocks,What‚Äôs your interest rate on the loans? Also most settlements are taxed so keep that in mind.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Pay off 90% of the loan, then buy buy like $10k worth of OTM calls."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Invest 150k in half bonds, half in ETFs, over the course of 3mo, leave 30k in cash & pay about $1500/mo. You should be able to beat 6-8% per year, which is what the worst student loans have for interest rates, and you've got plenty of cash set aside that way just in case."
03/27/2021,stocks,Don't invest with money you can't afford to lose. What if the market tumbles just as your loan is due? You will be forced to liquidate and take a loss. Stick it in a time deposit.

I‚Äôm assuming at that number there is a substantial amount of private student loan debt in there at I‚Äôd guess in the neighborhood of 6-8%?

That‚Äôs a mortgage payment. You‚Äôd be better off longterm forgetting the about the FOMO and clearing your position. By then hopefully the market is settled and you‚Äôll have a free $1100+ to invest monthly."
03/27/2021,stocks,"It is a question of what will give you a better return.  If your loans are at 6% and you can invest and make 10% then you are plus 4% a year.  Now, my internal voice is telling me to payoff those loans first.  Debt free is the best way to live.  That's what I did with my student loans and it worked out well so far.

Anyhow if you don't mind some learning there is a guy in YouTube called Professor Choy he has two playlists one is called Simple steps for a better financial future and the other one is called Investing for Beginners.  The videos are short and full of useful information.  Its a good place to start learning about how toanage your money better.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Take $50k, buy the biggest house you can; rent out all of the rooms except your room.   That will generate cash flow to cover the mortgage.   Take $134k and pay down the loans once the interest is about to start, then use the room mate cash flow to pay down the rest of the student loans."
03/27/2021,stocks,"High interest or no interest, debt is still debt. There's something extremely satisfying when you're completely debt free. You owe nobody NOTHING. It's a sense of freedom. 

I can't imagine the monthly payment of that student loan. Once it's paid, you eliminate a huge monthly expense where you can save and invest. Create good habits.

Or invest it in the largest market bubbles of all time and hope it doesn't explode before you net enough gains to pay off the loan + extra."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Always consider how having debt effects your day to day life. For me, having debt is a burden that weighs heavily and I would rather be debt free before investing. That being said, with interest rates as low as they are I understand why people say invest in the market instead since on average the returns are greater (assuming you go s and p 500 or something). Are you in a position to buy a home? That would be where I would invest if I had that kind of money and didn‚Äôt already own my home. That way you‚Äôre not blowing money in the wind paying rent every month. I know it‚Äôs a sellers market right now but it‚Äôs still something to consider."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Depends on the interest rates. There's a chance it makes sense to put it in the market... But I'm concerned by some of your comments like putting it in an index fund is too slow.

If you put it in the market it should be for the long haul. Like index funds buy and hold long term. This might make sense if your loans are like 3% and if you are sure your won't fuck up and gamble the money away making shitty trades.

You sound young and hopefully have a well paying job considering the size of the loans. Paying off your debt right away would position you really nicely going forward and be a big load off your mind mentally. Plus, no chance of being tempted into going all in on tesla with the $180k."
03/27/2021,stocks,chuck it all in a high yield savings account.  make $400 in 6 months with guarantee of not losing money.  pay off loan.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Ask yourself the following question:  

‚ÄúIf I put 184k into the market and the market drops 50% in August and I can‚Äôt pay off the loans when interest starts accruing in September, will I be ok with that decision?‚Äù"
03/27/2021,stocks,If your not an experienced trader pay off your student loans
03/27/2021,stocks,"So this will probably be unpopular, but first, the fact that you have that much student debt shows the problem with our secondary education system and in my opinion, you should resist paying that back simply because it is a scam to begin with; however, if you still want to pay your loans while taking advantage of your money right now, here is my suggestion:

First, many people here seem to not realize that being in debt actually is a really good way to make money.  Paying off your debts, oddly enough, is not always a good thing.  That‚Äôs not to say you shouldn‚Äôt, but let‚Äôs say you decide to pay off the loan upfront to remove the debt.  You now can‚Äôt make money off of your 184k at all, and essentially set yourself to zero, while paying your debt off slowly will allow you to make passive income off of what you currently hold.  Nearly all of the wealthiest people in the world love having debt because it allows them to make a lot of money, and while I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äútake as much debt as you can get‚Äù, don‚Äôt be afraid of it.

Second, I would highly recommend researching into the wheel strategy.  The mentality that investing in a stock and waiting for it to grow over years is a very ‚Äútraditional‚Äù response and isn‚Äôt always what people are looking for.  Additionally, right now is an amazing time to actually get into the market because things are so cheap.  By selling cash cover puts and covered calls, I‚Äôve easily been able to make myself and my friend 10%+ returns per week with the only risk being that I lose my money if the companies I trade on go out of business, but that‚Äôs the same for anyone regardless of strategy.  Even during the last minor correction this/last month, and the one right now, I‚Äôve been making money. You would have to learn how to pick the correct stocks for it as you can‚Äôt just do it with any stock, but it is a very profitable and safe strategy.

My personal recommendation is to use a portion of the money you have to sell cash cover puts (use only a small amount at first to verify the method works and you understand how to do it), then increase the amount as it becomes more comfortable.  I know that people will disagree with me here, but with that much money you could easily make enough money to pay off the loan in full if you really wanted to in a few months with very little risk.  If you want more specifics, feel free to ask."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I had $150K in student loans at sub-2% and paid them off as quick as I could. 

I get that the loans are zero percent for a year but that isn‚Äôt that long of a time frame. I also get that you are financially stable. You could invest in a money market but there aren‚Äôt a lot of low risk high reward investments out there. It feels good to remove that millstone around your neck. This really is a personal choice, I chose to pay my loans off asap."
03/27/2021,stocks,how stupid do you have to be to loan 188K in student loans - pay shit off ASAP with that cash
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm sure it's not the mathmatical answer, but in my opinion being out of debt, even low interest debt, is an unparalleled feeling. I'd pay off as much as I can and never look back."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Put the money in the highest GIC until Sept.

Then pay all your loan.

I think in yout situation, the payment doesn't start until Sept, but the interest is already starting. Every loan start interest asap. Payment can be deferred. Make sure you understand your loan agreement in detail."
03/27/2021,stocks,You should pay your student loan right now.
03/27/2021,stocks,Pay off the debt and enjoy your life
03/27/2021,stocks,I‚Äôd put all of it on the loans if it were me and not into stocks. Pay debt off first imo.
03/27/2021,stocks,If I were you I would shove it right into loans. That only leaves you with 4K left. They are interest free until September so if you happen to lose your money are you going to have another 188k lying around?
03/27/2021,stocks,"The simple answer is what is your interest rate?  Is it lower than your rate of return of 184k in the stock market?  

If I had a 184k, I‚Äôd invest/day trade and turn it into a million in 5 years or less then those student loans would be a joke.

At the very least Id keep 30k in my brokerage so I could day trade above the PDT rule, keep 10k in emergency funds, and the rest in my student loans.

Ive turned 20k into 28.5k in the last 40 days day trading.  If I had 184k that would be 239k (at the very least) while working a full time job.  

Money makes money, the more you have the easier it is to make.  Thats why the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  Wealthy people dont lose wealth, they just get more"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Save at least 50% for taxes and to buy low on a market crash, use 25% to pay off the highest interest loans, use 25% to do a mix of selling puts and buying shares of high-conviction stocks. Do things right and the premium from selling the puts could cover a portion of your loan payments"
03/27/2021,stocks,Don‚Äôt take the great gains posted here at the forums as something easily achievable.. just pay as much as you can to the debt and start with a clean sheet from there..
03/27/2021,stocks,"Personally I‚Äôd set aside enough to make your minimum student loan payments for the next 5 years. You should also have enough to cover your living expenses for a year. If the 5 years isn‚Äôt enough add to that fund. Now you have an emergency fund that will cover you for a year without employment or well through a potential recession. 
Now give the rest to a professional to invest for you in a low risk posture for at least 80% of the funds. You can use the interest made at the end of each year to set aside to make the following year‚Äôs student loan payments. 
I have to say with that kind of student loan debt, you would think you would have walked away with the skills needed to solve this problem."
03/27/2021,stocks,Don‚Äôt buy any stocks and sell puts to make money. You could probably made 2-5k a month selling puts with that money
03/27/2021,stocks,I wouldn‚Äôt pay the loan if you can afford it. In a bull run it could make %20-25 in a year. Diversify in to tech financials semiconductors.
03/27/2021,stocks,"If you are serious, ask your college for a refund..."
03/27/2021,stocks,"This is the best advice here. Plus if you‚Äôll still have paid off loans, 10k to invest, and 6k in emergency savings; do that."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That makes sense to me. I'm really torn between just paying off the loan the moment I get the settlement (plus I have around $20K savings for the remaining $4K loan) and looking for a way to grow what I have. I think waiting a bit and considering my options is a great idea, thank you."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm definitely not looking to gamble! I realize what a blessing it is to have this money fall in my lap. I think what I'm trying to ask is if there's a way to grow this money before my interest starts accruing again in September? I've considered a financial advisor because you are right, such a large portfolio would be overwhelming."
03/27/2021,stocks,But they want to risk everything instead of owing only 4k
03/27/2021,stocks,"Instructions unclear, bought $180k of options."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Truly awful advice. Having 180k in capital is huge. You can use capital to make money (investing), or to make major life purchases like buying a house. Even if you invest extremely conservatively, your $180k will grow with compounding interest. Interest on a loan, on the other hand, accrues at a diminishing rate every time you make a payment.

u/archenon, consider investing the money and paying your loans per the ordinary payment schedule over the next 10-20 years. VOO/SPY are conservative investments. I prefer individual stocks, but I'm also not making $180k transactions. 

If you pay off your loans, you have 0, and will have to work your ass off to have liquid $180k again. If you make regular loan payments instead, you have a huge amount of capital, but with a little bit less disposable income each month. I know which choice I would make."
03/27/2021,stocks,I definitely think I should pay them off! It's just that we're currently in a unique situation right now where there'll be no interest on my loans for another half year. It seems like a lot of lost opportunities to pay them off now when I can grow it for the next six months.
03/27/2021,stocks,"This is great advice, thank you. I never intended on throwing the whole $180K into stocks, just wanted to see what people thought was the best option for the next 6 months before interest kicks in again."
03/27/2021,stocks,Thanks for your input! I definitely intend to pay off my loans within the year. My question is if there is anything I can do in the next 6 months before my interest kicks in again? It seems like a wasted opportunity to pay the loans off now when they won't grow for another half year.
03/27/2021,stocks,Thanks for your input! This is what I'm leaning towards right now :)
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah the recent red is why I'm definitely hesitant about putting in a large amount in play. I have about $16K in stocks already so I'm not jumping in blind, although I only started investing early last year so I'm still new. It's definitely really tempting to just put a big chunk in a few stocks that are beaten down right now but I know that's not the smartest move."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That's fair, thanks for the advice I appreciate it!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Not a troll post. The question I'm asking isn't IF I should pay off my student loans. I plan to do that in September once student loans accrue interest again. The question is what can I do in the next six months that would help grow my money but also minimize risk as much as possible. 

I already have about $16K in stocks plus another $20K in my Roth so I don't really have a trading itch."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That's the thing, the majority of the comments are saying to pay it off now but my interest rate is literally 0% until end of September. I fully intend to pay off the debt within a year but it seems a waste to pay it off the moment I get my paycheck within the coming week or two."
03/27/2021,stocks,"There's no interest on the student loans until September 30th, so six months out. I definitely would pay the loans off if they were actively growing right now. Is there anything I can do in the next six months to grow what I have before I pay the loan off in September?"

03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the input, its nice to get a perspective from someone in a similar situation. May I ask what you ended up doing? I'm assuming you paid off the debt if it was significantly higher than mine."
03/27/2021,stocks,I fully intend on doing that! Just thought I'd see if Reddit had any good insight :)
03/27/2021,stocks,Wow this might be the best response yet. My interest is around 6.5% for 150K of the debt and around 4% for the remainder. I appreciate the compromise strategy you've suggested between the sell-now comments and invest-it comments. Thanks for great input :)
03/27/2021,stocks,"-$4,000"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your input! I was under the impression that there was minimal risk in selling covered calls, at the worst my stocks would get called away but I'd still get back the money I paid for them and also the premium right?

I definitely am leaning towards paying off at least 50% of the loan and paying the rest off when my interest starts accruing again in September."
03/27/2021,stocks,Student loan debt is different than credit card debt idiot
03/27/2021,stocks,"Around $150K is between 6-7% while approximately $30K is 3-4%. It was a personal injury settlement so it won't be taxed (according to my lawyer and researching online). I'm definitely not looking to risk the entire settlement in stocks, but I'm looking for opportunities to grow what I have before I pay the loans off in six months."
03/27/2021,stocks,Yeah this is my other consideration if putting money in stocks seems too risky. I'm getting comments telling me to pay the loans off now but it seems a lost opportunity since my debt isn't going to start growing again for another six months.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Interest rate is sitting around 6.5% for about $150K of the loan and about 4% for the remaining amount. Yeah, I've already reached out to find a financial advisor but I wanted to see what people in the subreddit thought first. Thank you for your input!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm really tempted to do this because I know I'm blessed to have this money fall in my lap. I think the issue now is since my debt won't grow for another six months, it seems a lost opportunity to pay it off now if there's a way to grow it for the next half year. Thank you for your input, I really appreciate it!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the input, this is what I'm looking for. I definitely understand the comments telling me to pay off the loans now, but I'd go to r/personalfinance if that was the only strategy I wanted to hear."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Then he pays the minimum until the market recovers in a few years. If the market doesn‚Äôt recover, we all have bigger problems haha."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your input, you're echoing what a lot of other comments in here are saying. I think for me it just seems a waste of an opportunity if I have an interest free 6 months, but I'm definitely very tempted to just pay off my loans now to get the burden off my shoulders."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Just saw you edited your comment on etfs and index funds. I definitely think they're valuable, I currently have around $20K in my Roth invested in index funds and ETFs."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah if I'd gotten the money three months ago I think I would've been a lot more bullish and likely lost a good chunk of it by now, which is why I'm cautiously exploring options.

The debt is all federal, it's just more expensive because they're grad loans."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I fully intend on paying off the loans within a year! Due to covid there's currently a pause on student loan interest until September 30. The point of this post was to ask if there was a way to grow what I have for the next six months until interest kicks back in.

Thanks for the tip, I'll look into it!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"That's an option I've thought about too, just park the money in dividend stocks for the next six months before I pay off my loans. The volatility of the market definitely is a bit concerning, although AT&T has been pretty stable."
03/27/2021,stocks,Good lord that 6% + dividend is nuts. Thanks for educating me on that.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm looking to pay off my loans at the end of September when student loan interest starts accruing again so I'm not really concerned about beating my loan rate.

That does look like a great dividend stock at first glance though, I'll definitely look into it. Is the 8.7% monthly or annual?  It looks like the most recent dividend this month was $0.11 so I'd assume that's an annual rate not monthly. Thanks for your input by the way!"

03/27/2021,stocks,"Nah I've checked, no loan interest has accrued since COVID started basically. 

Thanks for the suggest, may I ask what you refer to by GIC? Looked it up but I'm getting a few acronyms that is related to investing."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Is an sp500 index fund going to lose all its value? Dude, if that happens we got bigger problems."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Interest rate is around 6-6.5% for the majority of the loan and around 3.5% for about $12K. There's no interest accruing until September 30 though, which was why I made this post to see what I can do in the next 6 months to get some gains while limiting risk. 

I already have about $16K in the market so pretty close to the PDT rule, and another $20K in savings. Right now I'm def thinking just pay off a good amount of the loan but keep like 20-30%. But I'll be talking to a financial advisor so we'll see from there."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think puts/calls are definitely off the table for me, that's too high risk after seeing friends lose a ton these past few months."

Sure. 

1. Look up the payment of the student loan.
2. Pay off the fucking loan
3. Invest the amount of the payment every month for 40 years. Buy VOO on a regular schedule and don't look at it. 
4. Live your life."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Investing that kind of money shouldn't be for short term gains. That is where the risk is. If you invest in ETFs or stocks, you have to invest for the long term.

Options are great, but takes experience and you need to be a pro to manage that size of a portfolio. Active trading is too risky without extensive experience. 

You already ""made"" a ton since it's all money you don't have right now (I get that it was a settlement so you obviously had to go through something to get it) and there isn't any real reason why you absolutely have to turn it into more. Isn't getting your loans paid off enough of a win?"
03/27/2021,stocks,Using the stock market is a gamble. Unless you let me manage your money.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Amen, this guy gets it. Don't listen to the idiots who say to pay off your student loans. Loans and mortgages are such low interest rates it's practically free money, an index fund averages 10% a year which is probably double your loan interest rate. 

I can only speak from experience but my mortgage is 2.1% and my student loan was 3%, however I reside in Canada. I have 600k in the market of my own cash and still 250k left on my mortgage....I'm 31, I'd have to be some kind of moron to sell my stocks to pay off my mortgage just cuz I didn't want to worry about a 2.1% loan."
03/27/2021,stocks,"This is the input I'm looking for. I'm getting a lot of comments to pay them off ASAP but I'd go to r/personalfinance if I wanted to hear just that.

Do you have any suggestions on what investment vehicles I should look into?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"You think someone with 180k loan, won‚Äôt have a high paying job to invest after? Assuming he‚Äôs becoming a doctor/lawyer, he‚Äôs fine. Just because you may be able to invest doesn‚Äôt mean he can, may very well sell at the first sight of his stock turning red."
03/27/2021,stocks,We're also in one of weirdest most volatile markets ever. Not a safe bet.
03/27/2021,stocks,"So you want to invest 184k safely but think etfs are too slow growth? Seems counterintuitive...
Even an etf isn‚Äôt safe in the span of 6 months."
03/27/2021,stocks,"2020 saw some huge growth that I don‚Äôt expect to see this year but who knows, I hope I‚Äôm wrong because I have been buying slowly the last two weeks. I‚Äôm long term though so drops are just more buy ops for me. Tfsa and Rrsp trading accounts(Canada). Good luck!
Edit: I do realize the growth was more of a bounce back from the March COVID drop."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Oh I see, apologies. Well in that case, you should know that right now, the market is in a transition period, and I‚Äôm seeing a large swathe of Redditors not adjusting very well. It‚Äôs riskier than normal right now, not sure there is much reward for the risk you‚Äôd incur over the next few months to make it worthwhile."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The problem is time frame. No one knows what happens in 6 months. We know with reasonable certainty in the long term (years) investing it in index funds will give pretty decent returns.

But you could be down 20% in September if the market goes in the wrong direction.

Essentially the losers are those who have to sell at the dips because they over invested... You don't want to be in that position."
03/27/2021,stocks,"This is sort of the place where they‚Äôre right. You can‚Äôt get into the market and plan on getting out in September. It might be an absurd time to get out. What if you get in and we enter a two year bear market that September 2021 is the bottom of? Are you going to sell at the bottom to avoid your loan servicing payments? What are those payments? What amount can you comfortably pay from your income?

The correct answer is probably to pay down the loan to an amount where your monthly payments will be comfortable (highest interest loans first) and put the rest in the market with the knowledge that you can comfortably service your debt if it takes you a few years to get back out with gains. 

You can‚Äôt afford to be desperate so don‚Äôt put yourself in that situation. At the same time being afraid of debt is a mistake. Ask yourself if the money is a good deal at the price you‚Äôre paying for it. Only you know the answer."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, I forgot about the deferred interest.

If you really want to put it in the market, do cash-secured puts."
03/27/2021,stocks,I put every penny into the loan (don't go to law school) but that was a bittersweet day.
03/27/2021,stocks,"No, worst case scenario is the stock you bought tanks and you‚Äôre left holding the bag until it recovers, if it recovers. You sound like you‚Äôre inexperienced when it comes to options so absolutely do not try them out for the first time with 180k. If you want to trade them start with a wayyyyy smaller amount."
03/27/2021,stocks,"pay off all but 50k of the loans and see if the rest gets forgiven. at that interest rate youll get the max deduction for a while on the remaining balance even if they dont get forgiven. 

student loans are a real drag. i still owe like 40k, but ive paid off over 80k in principal, and my interest rate was locked in super low years ago. 

50kish in loans is way more manageable than nearly 200k...and you can still have some cash left to invest as you see fit."
03/27/2021,stocks,Why are you asking people on this sub? Most are idiots. They don‚Äôt know personal injury is non taxable. They don‚Äôt know student loan is low interest and forgivable after a period of time. They don‚Äôt anticipate the government buying debt back to stimulate the economy in a few years. To pay the government back entirely now when you can use that money to make money is loser mentality. Period end of story. Believe me you‚Äôre paying enough taxes to the government as is. They don‚Äôt deserve your 180k now. That‚Äôs what a sheep would do that is scared to make money.
03/27/2021,stocks,"It would feel good to pay it all off and be free of it 6 months earlier,putting anything in stocks right now is going to be risky.  I'll leave you with an old saying:

03/27/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt mean this offensively at all but it sounds like you‚Äôre wanting to do this out of greed and that can be a dangerous game to play, especially in the market.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah they're probably not thinking about the fact that there's about a 25% chance gov just forgives them all at some point. 

I've got 6 figures of loan debt myself, if I wanted to pay that off before investing I wouldn't be investing for 20 years. 

FWIW I'm pretty confident I'll continue to beat the interest, and I do riskier investment in individual stocks, not ETFs."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Ouch figured there had to be a grad program. Even so best case government might wash $50k. 

Good on your for getting extra opinions. Know how hard it can be to make the safe more responsible decision. Either way congrats on getting out of the loans! Get a nice champagne or something to pop to celebrate the freedom when you make the payment."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Wouldn't selling covered calls like I suggested be a pretty risk free way to have passive income?

The underlying stock could go down in price so, no, it isn't risk free. Covered calls limit your upside, but they also limit your ability to have stop-limits.    

Even selling covered calls the stock market isn't risk free. You absolutely could have less in six months than today, and start paying interest again before you can break-even.

In this case, 4.50 is the price AMC stock needed to hit for the option to hit breakeven. 

Where you are seeing the 6.45 on the option chain, you are looking at options that are in the money, because those options are highlighted in blue.

When you look at the 0.00/0.01, you are looking at OTM (out of the money) and worthless put options.


>what does strikes mean

The price AMC stock needs to be at or above by option expiration for your option to be breakeven

>Do I just gamble to bet against if the stock will rise above the price given to me?

Options were created to serve as hedging tools, but have been turned into another way to gamble.

>What does calls & puts mean.

Calls are bets that the stock price will be at or above the strike price attached to the option, by expiration. (I.e. $4.50)

Puts are bets the stock price will be at or below the price attached to the option by expiration. 

>I‚Äôm interested in investing in AMC & GME.

Today the merger date was announced for April 1. My question is do the shorts need to close out their positions before April 1? Causing the sp to spike? TIA
03/27/2021,stocks,"My understanding (and I could be wrong), is that because shares will be exchanged at an odd rate (around 0.114 to 1) and partial shares will be paid out in cash, it would be expensive to be shorting the stock during the merger.

So, I would expect people who have shorted to stock will want to close their positions before the merger, because the partial shares paid out as cash in the merger would work a lot like a dividend, where the person shorting the shares would have to pay it out themselves.

RKT paid out a special dividend a little while ago, put a hurt on short sellers, and it caused squeeze there."
2021-03-27 04:30:51,stocks,"Globe and Mail: The backing of German governments means Volkswagen‚Äôs all-out electric push is less risky than it appears (VOW, VWAGY) (VOW, VWAGY)

[The backing of German governments means Volkswagen‚Äôs all-out electric push is less risky than it appears](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-the-backing-of-german-governments-means-volkswagens-all-out-electric/)

Excerpt:

> Last week, VW, the world‚Äôs biggest automaker, unveiled its Tesla-killer strategy, though in reality the German company is already eating Tesla‚Äôs lunch in Europe. Last year, VW became the leading maker of EVs in Europe and sold more of them in that market than Tesla.

Also:

> VW‚Äôs all-out bet on diesel has been replaced by an all-out bet on batteries. It looks risky, for a trunk load of reasons. While EV prices will come down as production numbers increase, they might not come down a lot because the costs of the key materials that go into them ‚Äì steel, nickel, copper, cobalt, lithium, among others ‚Äì are all surging. EVs remain luxury products.

Focus:

> VW has evidently concluded that its all-EV strategy is less risky than it appears, but you would never get its executives to admit why. In short, the company has close government connections in Germany, and its bankruptcy is unimaginable.

And:

> While the German government itself has no direct VW ownership, it has always treated the company as a crucial partner in a vital industry. The government‚Äôs lavish EV purchase incentives, recently extended through 2025, are just one bit of evidence of its affection for its biggest industrial champion."
03/27/2021,stocks,">""While the German government itself has no direct VW ownership"".
  
Mhh.. Yes'nt. The State of Lower Saxony owns like 20% of Volkswagen. However in general I'm totally agreeing with you. People outside of Germany might not understand, but the current government is extremly corrupt when it comes to Volkswagen, they're basically sucking each other's dicks off. They'll do everything so Volkswagen will do fine, no matter what. They won't let them fail and give them every support needed."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Some of you focus too much on production numbers and too little on demand. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many cars you can build if people ultimately don‚Äôt like and don‚Äôt want to be seen on them.

In some ways, the auto industry is like fashion, brand image matters. No one buys a Ferrari or Lambo because they compared spec sheets.

Tesla isn‚Äôt seen as a cool brand as universally as young Americans seem to believe. What is so attractive to a certain demographic may be just as repulsive to another.
For someone driving a high end Mercedes for example, switching to a Tesla could feel like switching from iPhone to Huawei. It‚Äôs irrelevant how good the Huawei is, people often just choose to associate themselves with a specific brand image.

The problem is compounded by Teslas lacking variety. They don‚Äôt have an unassuming car, a nimble city car, a dignified middle aged businessman car ‚Ä¶ all their models look similar and target the same kind of tastes. But one size does not fit all. I had a girl tell me she would rather have a Fiat 500 EV, with its crap range, over a Model 3, cause the 3 is too masculine and the 500 cute.

Sure, Tesla is going to be succesfull, but seeing the name pop up on every EV tread of every manufacturer shows how overblown its expectations of success are.
Tesla is unlikely to conquer the luxury market, because there more than anywhere else badges and image matter.
And in its current state it‚Äôs not going to win the lower end market either, because it doesn‚Äôt offer the model variety to meet all kinds of needs and likes."

2021-03-27 04:22:35,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 26, 2021. (Sorry for the late post)  

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures ‚Äì the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred inflation gauge ‚Äì rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months ‚Äúis not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, ‚ÄúWe think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what‚Äôs going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve‚Äù. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it‚Äôs time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

**Highlights** 

* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. 
* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan
* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the company‚Äôs largest backer.
* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.
* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.

TSM is producing at 140% of their capacity, it's not like they can do more in the short term. Increasing capacity requires new investment (which they are doing, building new factories in US), but that's the long-term plan.

Of course, right now they have price power (the best they ever have), but I can't see them being a trillion company in 5 years. It's a producer, the margin is not that great.

03/27/2021,stocks,"You are referring to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) that markets are efficient and that all infor.ation is incorporated into the price and the fact that investors are risk averse and require a higher rate of return for riskier assets.

They are not contradictory- even when using all information currently available, projections of future performance have an inherent uncertainty or risk. The higher the uncertainty, theoretically the higher the required return. 2 similar assets with equal expected future cash flows but differing risks should trade at different prices.

Please note, i am not commenting on whether these two central theories hold in reality (that is a topic far beyond a reddit post), just that they exist and are consistent with one another.

Apologies for typos/mistakes, I'm on my mobile.

Edit: some good replies on the above, particularly EMH. As mentioned, i feel it is a broad and contentious topic. I would encourage people who are actively investing to do a cursory read up on EMH and its rebuttals. An often used counter is behavioral finance which is also a great topic to read up on, both to try and understand market responses a little more and understand and manage your own biases."

People are stupid. Nothing is priced in. Sure, some companies are price better than other, but you simply can't price stocks perfectly.

Why? For one simple reason. Value is subjective. If we both do a DCF and calculate the fair value of a company we will get very different results depending on our assumptions.

As a result it regularly drops extreme values that don't actually reflect the state of the company, future prospects, the price of lithium, current or future demand. As a result some days it drops 20% and I buy in heavy only for it to recover two or three days later. At times it over corrects and I see a 15% jump that I know will be gone the next day. There are too many variables at play to say that any one person understands all of them and even some simply nobody can account for, that's why we diversify.

03/27/2021,stocks,Your mistake is not defining risk. Easy.
03/27/2021,stocks,"You have to take into account a couple of things.  

First, a large part of the market is made of purchases for index funds in one guise or another.  Some of these are outright index funds.  Others use some sort of rule based allocation strategy.  Some pretend to be actively traded but are in reality passively investing.  This percent of the market is a lot larger than is given credit.  There is no price discovery for these purchases.

Second, most actively traded funds have to deal with business realities of running a fund.  I will give you a case in point.  I like to put Aswath Damodaran's valuation courses on while I work on various things.  He always brings various happenings in the current market into his lectures.  Recently he had this anecdote: In his investment philosophy class he had an Indian fund manager tell the class he was facing an existential crisis.  He believed in value investing but could not find anything to buy in the Indian market, and his fund was restricted to buying Indian stocks.  Everything seems to be overvalued.  If he kept to his beliefs he could not buy anything, but managers in competing funds would continue to buy overvalued stocks, riding them upward, performing better than him, and he would soon be out of a job.  If he wanted to save his job then he needed to abandon his beliefs and go along with everyone else; when the market finally corrects, he will not look any different from the other managers.  The point is the big actively traded funds are under pressures that force them to pursue less than optimal strategies.  There are very few managers who are in the position of Buffet who can sit for years on a mountain of cash waiting for the perfect opportunity.  

Most funds live and die based on their results for the last year or last few years, and market cycles are longer than that.  The investment strategy that looks great for a few years may be very sub optimal over the long term.  There is a long list of funds and traders who perform fantastic using high risk/high reward strategies then crash and burn when the market turns.  See the ARK funds for an example.  If you are cynical about it then you can think the fund managers know exactly what they are doing: use risky investments to perform well in the short term, use the over performance to grow the AUM, and collect those fees; after the whole thing melts down, close the fund, and enjoy the millions you were paid to recklessly gamble with the clients money."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The contradiction is a non-sequitur.   


If all information has been factored in to the **price**, some stocks will still be more risky than others. However, they will all be **priced** fairly and efficiently, reflecting that risk. Two businesses that are equal except in risk will have the more risky one **priced** lower to reflect the risk. If they had the same price the expected return of the more risky asset would be lower.  


It is price that is key, not risk.

For instance I rarely read financial sources, they are usually full of noise. However I do read a lot about biology, am doing some popular science writing as a hobby. This way I get fresh info that analysts do not. I find tips on obscure companies that others do not know. I read in Genetic litetacy project in  2019 that Aquabounty started its first batch of commercial salmon eggs.

Inefficiencies exists but they are hard to accurately spot. The market is heavily influenced by emotions and bias, popular stocks might be ""safer"" because they become a self fulfilling prophecy.

The reason they both can be true is because of variance. Some stocks are riskier than others and random variance contributes to that. No one knows if a major deal will be struck, causing a stock to soar. When it happens, it spikes. If you had bought prior, you benefited from random variance. No one knows if a major lawsuit or court ruling will cause a stock to tank. If you had bought prior, you suffered random variance. Riskier stocks do have this priced in, whether it's environmental, political, etc.

03/27/2021,stocks,"You should just ignore the idea that things are priced in. The price for promising stocks are often over evaluated compared to the actual worth of the company (if they were to liquidate everything at this moment how much cash would they be holding). So you shouldn't really be worrying about a stock being priced in, unless if the company is truly under valued Asset - Liability > Net stock valuation, (which rarely happens and hard to catch in the first place).

Essentially stocks valuation can simply be summed up as (Net long term Dividend) / (Risk premium). Seeing how the function is defined by a volatile variable like risk you will find that the stock value will fluctuation and change drastically depending on the mood of the market.

So what does this mean? The stock valuation can be defined as the ""hype"" (the future prospects of the company or the ""risk premium""), and the ability of the company to provide dividends. This means that if the company has large profit margins then the value of the stock will be large as well. However the thing that makes the value of the stock fluctuate is the risk premium. Risk premium can either approach one of two things. None existent or volatile (0 or 1). The lower risk premium would mean a larger valuation on the stock, however it is less volatile (aka it has been ""priced in""), however the greater the risk premium the stock valuation may be smaller, however it is subject to volatility and uncertainty.

Hoped this helped. Happy trading. Here is the full equation below. It is called the DDM model i believe. If you are curious.

&#x200B;

Price\_s = (Divident\_today + Expected dividend growth) / (Risk free interest rate + risk premium - expected dividend growth)

&#x200B;

GL! And Happy trading!

Quick note: It is important to note that investments in stock often time do not follow the classical model of supply and demand. Thus ""true"" ""pricing in"" is impossible because there is no equilibrium. Stock often work in a positive feed back loop where a few sell offs could result in a large sell off, and similarly few buy off could also turn into large buy offs.

&#x200B;

So a recent case study could be Microsoft acquiring Bethesda Studios. People can price in the new acquisition (Net worth Microsoft + Net worth Bethesda - Cost in acquiring Bethesda). However it doesn't consider risk in that acquisition which influences the stock valuation. So hearing news like ""Bethesda Game Studios Says Transition To Working Under Microsoft Has Been Smooth"" - (Gaming Bolt) may influence future prospects of Microsoft's stock value."

Which one is riskier? Company A of course. Now the market may see that risk, and discount the value of the stock based on it, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a 50% chance that the stock will go to zero.

So company B will, in an efficient market, be trading at 10$, company A is trading at a discounted 5$, but once the results of the investigation come out there is a 50% chance it goes to zero.

If you buy 10$ of each company, you're not risking anything by buying company B, but you have a 50% chance to lose 100% of your investment if you go with company A (or getting twice the returns!)"

‚Ä¢ Not many people know how to interpret fundamentals, information and valuate stocks, correctly. 

‚Ä¢ Beliefs, FOMO and emotions etc. may cause many investors to act irrationally causing ‚Äònoise‚Äô and short-term volatility.

Also, Risk-averse individuals can compensate to generate alphas by knowing how to calculate their break-even point by adjusting their purchasing power to reflect inflation and taxes.

Your break-even rate is the rate of return you need to make just to keep up your purchasing power level, not including brokerage fees.

Earning this rate does not provide any real profits, it only maintains the value of your investments. If you are earning less than your break-even rate after taxes and inflation have been taken into account, you are actually losing money on your total investments and may have to accept higher risks just to maintain purchasing power.

Your beak-even rate is especially important if diversified within multiple foreign investments or debt such as bonds (inflation usually increases rates which lower value of fixed income securities in your portfolio).

I don't have the quote at hand, but in his book Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity writes his opinion that the markets are efficient ""more often than not"", but they're clearly not efficient in all cases or all the time -- particularly with lower-volume and international stocks.

several economist have suggested that bitcoin is the ultimate refutation of the efficient market theory. crypto has zero profits, cashflow, dividends, or intrinsic value. by any sensible measure, crypto should all be priced at $0 according to the efficient market models."

I will pose this question though- is alpha a return above the break even point you described or a return above an appropriate benchmark?

This is what makes EMH impossible to prove or disprove- what valuation model(s) is used?"

03/27/2021,stocks,"DFV predicted a move in GME due to the fundamentals of the stock months before the short volume became as absurd as it was. Many other value plays have worked out the same way. The efficient marker hypothesis has its merits, but is held back by the fact that humans are emotional beings with irrational beliefs and opinions. In the GME example, everyone believed that gamestop was already essentially dead, but the cash flow they brought in was more than capable of allowing the company to continue operating for a reasonable amount of time. People were assigning a 0% chance to a recovery for gamestop. The irrational sentiment allowed the stock price to go much lower than it likly ‚Äúshould‚Äù have been, despite the clear possibility of a turnaround. Similarly in the housing market crash, all the information to see it coming was readily available, but people either didnt look or discounted the negative information. Its not like all the collateralized debt obligations were actually good investments that suddenly became junk. They had been junk for years and people didnt notice untill the defaults started rolling in."

2021-03-27 02:19:22,stocks,"Experiment: Selling Covered Calls as a Way of Long Term Growth Theory: By selling covered calls on virtually any stock(in this case VXX) you can vastly outperform the market over both the long and short term.

How it started: While I was holding around 1600 CRSR shares and slowly watching them go down post-earnings call, I started looking into selling covered calls on my shares as a way to recoup losses and lower my average cost per share by buying more shares with the premiums. The idea was to sell the calls just above my buy-in price so that no matter what I would get to keep the premium and worst-case scenario if they were executed, I would still make a meager profit on the sales of the shares. After doing this a couple of times, I started to wonder what the potential downsides of this strategy are. The first one was obvious, since all the money was in one business, if something happened overnight and that business went bankrupt(EX: Enron) then you would lose everything because the shares would be worth nothing and you can't sell any more options. After this, I struggle to find another downside with this strategy.

\*\*The Solution\*\*

In order to eliminate the single stock risk, I started to look at ETFs. The one I settled on was VXX for a couple of reasons. The 1st reason is that VXX is currently at/near an all-time low. This helps lower the risk of the shares devaluing over time and becoming worthless. The 2nd is because while I know I am not smart enough to time the market, I am smart enough to know that at some point in the short to mid-term future the market will need to correct. VXX is the perfect insulation against this because as the market falls and volatility increases, VXX will increase in price. As an added bonus, since VXX is an index that tracks the volatility of the market it inherently has a higher volatility than other stocks and thus has higher option premiums.

\*\*The Experiment\*\*

On Tuesday, March 23rd I decided to pull the trigger and attempt my theory. I put around $54,000 inot VXX for a total of around 4,300 shares at an average of $12.05. After this, I sold 43 3/26 $12.50 options for $20 each for a total of $860 and reinvest into more VXX shares. The options expired worthless today and I kept the $860 and will do the same thing this Monday. If the options were to be worth $20 each and expire worthless every week and I \*\*DON'T\*\* reinvest anything into more shares over the course of a year then I would net $44,720 in additional money for a return of nearly 83%.

Now, I am not naive enough to think that they will expire worthless every week, but in the event that they do get executed and have only gone slightly above the execution price, I can simply rebuy fewer shares and start the process over again. Should the ticker skyrocket overnight(entirely possible with VXX) then I will simply sit on my cash and wait for it to come back down to more normal levels.

\*\*The Question\*\*

IMO, this scenario doesn't leave any possibility of me taking a long-term loss and a very slim possibility of a short-term realized loss. While I am not saying that I have cracked the code and found some genius way to make free money, I do think that the fact that there is SO much room between 83% returns \*\*WITH NO REINVESTMENT\*\* and the average 7% return of the market that it is highly likely that this theory would easily beat the market returns and likely be above a 20% return a year.

\*\*Please tell me what I have done wrong or not thought of.\*\*

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am now aware that VXX isn't the right stock to be doing this with long-term. Appreciate the insight and would like to know how you would feel about it if it was a different stock/etf that isn't predestined to continually go down in the future.

The problem with this idea is it caps your gains. Now, gains are still gains right so that's fine... Still making money.

03/27/2021,stocks,1R0NYMAN is that you?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Nothing, but the fact that VXX is literally not meant to be a long-term hold.

**Listen, folks, VXX is not just ""at a historic low."" It MUST decline over time due to contango decay.** 

In other words, this is a stock that is guaranteed to lose value over the long-term, and quite quickly, at that, unless there's a huge spike in volatility.

Nobody trades the VXX as a long-term hold or talks about ""historic lows"" implying it's going to appreciate over time. It's a daily trade against the volatility index future. Holding it is like holding the inverse S&P 500. Would anyone ever hold the inverse S&P 500 for any period of time longer than it takes the S&P 500 to crash?

If the guy said he was doing this on VIX, then I'd just call it an even proposition that may have merit - except, of course, VIX options aren't nearly as lucrative because the underlying isn't declining all the time. But since he is doing it on VXX, I'd say he needs to seriously consider whether he knows what he's doing."

1. You lower the strike.  You're essentially hoping that the VIX won't spike because you could take a pretty big loss (you buy @ $10, sell strike @ $6, you realize -$4).
2. You maintain the strike and get decreasing premiums.  Premiums fall off pretty quick.  Roughing it--and assuming no VIX spikes, you might get $2.50 to $3.00 on an $12 original price.  But, if price moves to $8, you're essentially breakeven.

This strategy works if and only if price remains +/- constant, but the variability of the VIX itself almost guarantees this won't happen.  That's not to say you can't make good money on this, but it's not a risk-free 80% guarantee."

That‚Äôs not really true though. The loss can be realized in the following tax year if the replacement shares are sold and not repurchased for 30 days. 

The loss from the wash sale was added to the cost basis of the stock, so when it‚Äôs sold, the loss is actually realized in the form of a reduced gain.

Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding your wording, but saying the deduction is ‚Äúgone‚Äù isn‚Äôt entirely correct. You can realize the wash sale loss as a ‚Äúloss‚Äù if you do the right actions. It‚Äôs just that the loss isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúloss‚Äù, but instead a reduced taxable gain."

03/27/2021,stocks,"You are right. I was trying to calculate for the case where the person buys on Jan 1st. In general, I think it's best to sell before December 1 or not buy until Feb 1 of the next year. That way the losses are not carried over."

03/27/2021,stocks,"It doesn't make a difference. The disallowed loss is still disallowed, although your new loss would then be deductible, assuming you don't buy MSFT again within 30 days."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The loss is disallowed on that sale and added to the cost basis of the replacement stocks. 

But the loss can be realized on by then selling those replacement shares and not repurchasing them again for 30 days. You realize the wash sale loss in the form of a reduced gain when you do end up selling ‚Äî since your cost basis was increased by the wash sale amount.

So you sell at a loss of $1 per share and originally bought at $10 per share. So you sold at $9. You then rebuy at say $8 within 30 days triggering a wash sale. 

So now your cost basis isn‚Äôt $8, the repurchase price, it‚Äôs instead $9, the original basis with the wash sale loss added to it of $1 per share. 

So you actually bought it for $8 a share. But when you go to sell when it‚Äôs say $10 (and not rebuy for 30 days ‚Äî otherwise another wash would occur), your cost basis is not $8, its $9. 

Therefore your true gain was $2 per share ($8 to $10), but you only show a gain of $1 per share because of the increased cost basis from the wash sale. This is how that washsale loss is realized ‚Äî in the form of a lower taxable gain than actually occurred.

The huge problem that can occur for people is letting a new tax year occur without accounting for the wash sale. If you sell the repurchased shares before December first, your wash sale loss will be realized in that tax year. 

But people sometimes trigger a wash sale and then don‚Äôt resell the shares (and wait 30 days to rebuy) until the following tax year. So the loss is actually realized in the following tax year or whichever tax year the subsequent sale occurs."

03/27/2021,stocks,"My understanding is not the same. I read the example here: https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/a-primer-on-wash-sales

What I was thinking was that wash sale loss is adding as cost basis to your next purchase if you purchase within 31 days. So, in your example, the 2000 loss will be added as cost basis when you purchase on 06/30. Your cost basis will be $250 per share (because the $2000 gets split equally to the 100 shares you bought, adding $20 to each share).

Now let's say you sold it at $260. Then your gains will be $1000 instead of $3000. And now you pay tax on $1000."
03/27/2021,stocks,"What happens if you sell it at an even bigger loss after updating the cost basis? Still, the loss is realized, right?

03/27/2021,stocks,"The disallowed loss is permanently on the tax form, yes. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt able to realize the loss that year if you sell and don‚Äôt rebuy.

But that loss then is realized on the second transaction of selling because your taxable gain on that second transaction is reduced in the amount of the disallowed loss from the first."

It‚Äôs not that he actually gained more than his starting capital, he just doesn‚Äôt have his losses countering the gains. 

Ex)  I start with $10, make a $3 dollar gain. Then I lose $2. Then I gain $5. Then I lose $4. Then I gain $5, then I lose $5. 

Total gains are 3+5+5 = $13, more than his starting capital when viewed in isolation. 

Total losses are 2+4+5 = $11 

So his true gain is 13-11 = $2, only 20% of his starting $10. Yet with constant wash sales caused by day trading the same stocks over and over, he was kicking the losses down the road and into a new tax year, and is thus on the hook for just the gains in 2020. 

All could have been avoided if he understood wash sale and sold at the end of the year without rebuying for 30 days. Then his taxable gain would have been just $2 instead of $13 for 2020. 

Now to my example, imagine adding hundreds and hundreds of trades with some being gains and some being losses, but then only counting up the winning trades for 2020 taxes. And that‚Äôs how his gains got so high. He probably did hundreds to thousands of trades in 2020. He wouldn‚Äôt per se need any huge winning plays. It‚Äôs classic quantity over quality.

If this does not happen, they do not have a chance."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The company faced much more risk back then.

Model 3 ramp was a huge risk and they were burning cash like crazy. Now you are buying into a company that survived the hardest part and is basically cashflow positive. That's why you simply have to pay a higher premium.

Looking at the price like: ""Oh it already did a x6 so now it must be overvalued."" is just stupid.

I took the risk of losing all my money on tesla and got rewarded. People who say tesla is overvalued are just mad they missed the boat.

The funny thing is. The stock only went up so rapidly because of people like you, who always say the stock is overvalued and short it. Tesla was so heavily shorted back then, it was artifically kept low. 

What even makes you think that wall street estimates are correct this time? Calculate your own fair value, man.

Fair value of 350? Yeah... No.

Even if the fair value was correct. You will always have to pay a premium on top. You think Google or Apple are trading at fair value? Think again."

I've considered options before, but for most things I've traded up to this point, it made more sense to just buy the stock. I recently bought about as many options as I can afford to cover (so not that many), in case I want to exercise them. I didn't realize they keep track of the price while you hold them, and you can buy and sell them without ever covering the shares. So theoretically, I could have bought about 100 times more options. Since the ones I bought expire in 6 months, the price is super volatile. So it seems like buying closer to what I can afford to buy is a bad idea. Thoughts on this? Do you keep options volume to close or maybe up to 2-3 times what you can afford to cover?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Depending on strategy options can make or loose money, but the risk can be minimized to the amount of the premium you pay in some cases. For instance most vertical spreads limit loss to the skin you have in the game.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I think there are many. Stocks soared during a pandemic, federal stimulus packages might stop soon, interest rates already low and can only increase (market seems super spooked any time there's mention of interest rates increasing or inflation), P/E of S&P way higher than usual, weird phenomena with stocks like GME and speculative stocks in general, and stocks often dropping after good earnings reports (possibly going up first then quickly dropping)."
03/27/2021,stocks,"All true,  at least on an individual level. Just zoom out a little,  those are still the abnormal stocks.  The normal stocks just regained their normal valuation (they soared from an abnormal  pandemic crash).  I have to continually remind myself to compare today to 2029, not 2020.

395 of the 505 stocks in the S&P 500 are above the 20 day simple moving average (SMA).  Most of the time that means low volatility and slow upward trend.   Great time to be invested.   Not the type of market to have a higher than normal chance of a large crash within six months."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Good counterpoints. But don't you think if Nasdaq falls enough, S&P and Dow will follow? Or do you just think staying in ""boomer stocks"" will give a normal 10-20% return this year?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes, and maybe? If yes NASDAQ falls far enough,  or even a little,  it has a minor effect on the other index, so an excessive drop in NASDAQ will have a noticeable effect on the other Indexes for no other reason than big mutual funds own shares of both. That is the entire purpose of diversification,  I always have some stocks that surprise me by going down and some that go up more than I expected,  overall I hope to do a little better than the S&P 500 (I' measure against that since that's where most, but not all,  of my stocks are).

Honestly,  I should just buy VOO and never look,  especially since zero commission buying happened,  but it's a fun challenge to try and ""win"" and it doesn't cost me more time (and cheaper so far) than my other hobby (woodworking)."

2021-03-26 23:34:36,stocks,"PLTR - bearish discussion to better understand the company (Please excuse my username, it's the only account that's not doxxable but I swear this is an actual discussion)

Newbie investor here and been in PLTR since early Nov last year. With the downward trend in the stock's price action, I've been having bearish thoughts on Palantir like (the stock really might be overvalued in PS ratio all that shit) so I'm posting this discussion post so I can get some confirmation bias.

Will list out some bearish topics I've been seeing on blind and other forums regarding pltr. Going to skip talking about their products as there's plenty of materials out there that show how amazingly innovative and advanced Foundry looks

**Share dilution**

So according to their 10-k annual report, they have **1.792 billion** outstanding shares and **743 million** outstanding options (exercisable in the period of multiple years) as of end of 2020, of which **133 million** of them will expire by end of 2022. According to the post I've read, apparently most tech companies (at the time of their respective IPOs) average 10-20% share dilution, mostly in the low 10's.

PLTR will be going through **41%** share dilution. I know share dilution shouldn't affect the company's outlook but this seems pretty severe. What could this mean? Could this mean they got fucked by early investors or is it management being greedy? That doesn't connect though considering they barely sold post-lock up expiry (sold 24 million shares out of 600+ million shares they hold collectively)

**Business focus**

In simplest terms, Palantir seems to focus only on boomer companies/organizations at the moment and don't let businesses to freely try out their products (like letting users create an account and stuff, have to contact them and wait for a response). The lack of trial makes sense, but I'm a little confused on their stubbornness with ""only large companies"". That kind of focus seems to create negatives like years of potentially wasteful sales cycles, customer concentration risks, etc.

Most importantly, they don't advocate for use cases for tech industry (after all, they themselves are a tech company). This [post](https://www.teamblind.com/post/What-makes-Palantirs-business-effective-gunhFsRL) states what I resonate with:

""I could easily imagine ecommerce, social media, any type of tech companies leveraging Foundry to organize, analyze data without the need to dedicate a team to create lower quality internal tools""

As a software engineer myself, I agree with this statement. Arguably, tech products/apps can collect data way more easily (users are literally interacting with them) and I've also seen at both big companies like FANG and startups where they dedicate teams to build mediocre internal tools, which btw Palantir states as their biggest competition in all their sec filings.

Plus, it'd make more sense to start top-down. If Palantir can convince tech companies, boomer companies should naturally follow right? Just like how more boomers are adopting newer apps/tools like Slack for communications, AWS for cloud, etc.

I obviously believe that their management (Thiel, Karp, etc.) is super strong and solid but I can't blindly trust them with my hard-earned money. Seems weird that their business focus on boomers actually do sound like the opposite of a growth story, but rather, way too stubborn with their philosophical beliefs, like how they state that they will not work with China/non-western forces, work with only large companies as they create more impact than SMBs, which is subjectively great in ethical/philosophical sense but does not sound that great in terms of growth and $$$

Am I just over-thinking? Would appreciate some discussion on the stock

**TL;DR:** Having some bear thoughts and I'm looking for confirmation bias"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Well if you look at their product, I feel like smaller customers wouldn‚Äôt be worth the time, a lot of this has to be finely tuned and they probably only want to put in that work if the customer is large enough to justify the cost"
03/27/2021,stocks,Will they turn a profit in 3 years very unlikely. Will they be massive in 5-10 years almost certainly... It's long term so not for everyone.
03/27/2021,stocks,Sorry but where in the world have you seen anyone from Palantir state that they will only work with large companies? Karp and the COO have both recently remarked how they think the company can serve small to mid size businesses and that they will be targeting them. To me that's the growth opportunity here if executed.
03/27/2021,stocks,Anybody know why only 18.15% of shares are held by institutions? Kind of on the low side.
03/27/2021,stocks,It's probably because their product is incredibly convoluted and they make more money training their customers on how to use it than actually selling the product. I doubt it can just be used without extensive training which limits its marketability.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Think of them like a half government contractor half commercial but only big clients biz like Boeing/Booze, doing Big Data like Splunk, with aspirations to go big commercially like AWS/Azure...

Then realize that's their competition... and they've gotta sell commercially as well as they've sold to the Gov, where it's a different BD process completely.

They make a good product tho, to my understanding... just heard rumors but I think it's well liked by users."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I am bearish because of their technology stack. As you know, Palantir has been around for awhile. They built their product based on technology that was hot at the time, mainly Hadoop and data lakes. Well, times have changed and organizations are abandoning these technologies due to their complexity as well there are better alternatives out there. Since their technology requires organizations to have data lake, they are looking at diminishing number of customers in the future. If you disagree with this then look at their AWS announcement."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Also, some reassuring words from a PLTR engineer:

>Here‚Äôs my take on the ‚Äúwhy no trials‚Äù thing:

>The product we build is always a bit rough at the edge, and it currently isn‚Äôt designed with the intention of random non-Palantir users starting completely from scratch inside of it. It takes someone pretty familiar with the platform to really demonstrate the platform‚Äôs value and get things up and running.

>I think that the fear right now is that the full trial would be overwhelming in difficulty and underwhelming in its impact (because of suboptimal use). Long term i am very confident that we will improve the experience enough and add enough rails / guidance to make some kind of ‚Äútrial‚Äù possible, but we aren‚Äôt there yet, and that is not our focus.

It sounds like their focus is on improving the core functionality of the product and not adding guard rails to create some kind of a sandbox mode that can be used for scalable trial purposes."

The key is *always* going to be a smart person making the decisions. The point of Palantir is to enable them to make these decisions quicker, with less effort, and more accuracy. Try to offload too much into automation and you end up like the fools who lost to PayPal.

with this deal, its a clear sign, to all investor, these shares are under valued. because another investor is ok with buying it at a premium, and the new investor see the potential growth. so? why am I giving it up?

2021-03-26 22:45:12,stocks,"Is this a correct calculation of average price of the shares shorted? I'm not experienced in shorting. I never use it, frankly my broker doesn't even support it for US stocks. I'm just asking out of curiousity.

Taking the value of shares sold short / Number of shares sold short = Average price of the shares sold short.

I'm not a GME gambler, but let's use it as an example:

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)

**Current Short Volume:** 14,200,000 shares  
**Dollar Volume Sold Short:** $3.76 billion USD  
= Average price of the share sold short: 265 USD?

3.76 billion / 14,200,000 shares  = circa 265 USD.

So, in short, was the average price of the shares shorted 265 USD? Or is this like a drunk monkey trying to beat the market?

(I assume ""average price of the shares shorted"" can be used to make your own estimate if it'll go above that.)"
2021-03-26 22:43:12,stocks,"[DD] Why the GME dream to have retail to fundamentally control the price is wrong. Saw a bunch of comments over at r/WSB that ""WE CONTROL THE PRICE.""  If we say it's worth $100,000 then it is!  This is misguided and I wrote up a response:

You're sort of right. Yes in theory the market could collectively decide that GME is worth $1M a share and if every owner of a share banded together and could enforce this price, a cartel on GME shares would be formed.

There's a problem with this though, first one is what actually could happen if the cartel succeeds but I'll get to that later. This requires a mechanism to enforce discipline on every single holder of GME. Right now traders can buy dips, pretend to be on the train then sell, rinse and repeat, dip and rip.

You might ask, what if the true diamond handers NEVER sell? Then eventually the question arises, when to jump off? At some point you must take a profit right? But as soon as people believe that people are jumping off, no one wants to buy it. So no one wants to be the bagholder. Since market participants are forward looking some people will sell before this event. It's a catch 22, in order to horde shares you can't sell. But to make money you have to sell at some point.

Another problem is how GME executives are likely to act when the shares become $1M or whatever you want it to be. They can issue shares because capital is basically free. They already announced this in the 10K

>Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM (at-the-market) Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives and general working capital needs.

Can you blame them? If the stock price becomes stupidly high, that's just free capital for bonus / comping high talent new hires, transforming the company towards e-commerce, etc. This creates new shares that requires the cartel to keep buying."
03/27/2021,stocks,Yeah you don‚Äôt know much bud
03/27/2021,stocks,"This would only be the case when a hedgefund with a monstrous short position on GME is forced to close all their positions at once, triggering a huge short squeeze. Gamestop could be upwards of 500% short right now. If that is correct, individual members, heck a whole platoon of them losing discipline and selling during the squeeze wouldn't matter one bit, as they need to buy the entire float multiple times."
03/27/2021,stocks,Issue more shares and lose your new fan base? Not happening.
03/27/2021,stocks,"The rules of the game are suppose to be forced buy in, and forced buy in means \*FORCED buy\*.

If you are forced to cover by brokerages do they let you decide the price you want to buy the owners of the shares? Of course not, you are \*FORCED\* to buy them at the price that people set. It isn't about what the market sets the price at.

&#x200B;

Yes, in theory if the brokers force you to buy the stock to cover and the price is P then they buy it at P then when they buy the shares what happens? THE PRICE GOES UP! Supply and demand but at that point there is only demand. The brokerages do not turn around and sell those shares for you because then that doesn't balance the equation. You then own that stock at the price P. But now P went up... and each time they buy the stock, if no one is selling the price P goes up. This is what happens during a short squeeze.

&#x200B;

The squeeze drives the price up higher and higher automatically. There is nothing stopping it EXCEPT when once the shorts are covered. Yes, people will be willing to sell there shares at some price which will limit the maximum P can reach.

BUT there are two things:

&#x200B;

1. If the shorters have shorted over 100% of the stock then, well, what happens once they were forced to buy 100% of the stock? Now there are still owners out there the ones that held out the longest. The price will be whatever at that time, say P, but since they are still holding the price will climb.   
At some point there is the last ""bagholder""... AND HE HAS TO BE BOUGHT OUT! But there are no more sellers to undercut him.   
This is unlike the cause when there are less than 100% shorted. The less shorted the stock is the more people can undercut each other.  
E.g., Suppose ratio of r of the stock is shorted, and of the owners of the stock, there is a ratio of s of people who will sell early and the rest will have ""diamond hands"". Naturally these will actually be probability distributions but we can model them as simple thresholds and simplification to get the general picture:  
Let P be the price of the stock and N the total shares. Now at forced buy in r\*N must be covered. There are s\*N sellers who will sell at some price P. They sell out. The shorters covered and the s\*N sellers got their bank and the (1-s)\*N are still holding the shares they own and we end up with some new lower price P(which might still be high depending on other factors or it might drop significantly, depends on the circumstances). (s - r)\*N is the number of ""outstanding"" shares and s = r since it was forced to be so and so there are no outstanding shares after covering. The ""diamond hands"" group is (1 - s + (s - r))\*N = (1 - r)\*N. It's just the owners that are left ""holding the bag"" since they didn't sell out. r\*N + (1 - r)\*N = N the total shares. The shorts own r\*N and the ""bag holders"" own (1-r)\*N.  
That is the typical circumstance. Now if r > 1, we have the same except (1 - r)\*N < 0!!!!!!!!!   
THIS IS A TEAR IN THE SPACE TIME CONTINUUM! We the ""bag holders"" literally end up with less shares than they own. How is that possible? The stock market is essentially a zero sum game!
2. The logic is simple: When shorted < 100% the shorters only have to buy back from a portion of the owners. When shorted > 100% the shorters have to buy back from EVERY owner. In this case there is zero competition. This is when the owners can set there price to be whatever it is.  
Think about this using a simple example. Suppose there is one owner and the shorter(which is now a buyer) is forced to buy from that owner. Does the owner not get to set the price? Isn't that what forced means? What if there are two owners and the shorter has to buy 1 stock. He can play the two owners against each other. Greed, FUD, etc will play them against each other so that they want to sell before the other. This is how the ""normal"" markets work. If every long simply held and kept buying they could trap every shorter like this, but if the shorts are not over 100% they can always pit players against each other.
3. So with GME or any stock that has been shorted past 100% by using naked short selling, FTDs, etc, it becomes mathematically impossible for them not to end up in the 1-1 case(reductively). They are forced to buy at the owners mercy at whatever price he sets.  This is just how it works. Everyone will sell out but technically anyone can set the price they want because they won't actually undercut anyone else since they are no longer competing to sell. It is 100% that they will get to sell. 
4. So the only two issues with GME are these: Have the shorters shorted more than 100%? If it's too much will they fuck over the owners in some way by using illegal means or using manipulation. If the owners can set their price to be anything, could they not say 1quadrillion per stock? They can, but if the seller can't afford it how can they truly force them? 

&#x200B;

So, these, GME is relatively simple. If you believe the short interest is > 100% then buy at least one stock and you can bank on it. You might not be able to get 1 quadrillion. At some point everything breaks. That is because the shorts broke the fucking universe when they turned a zero-sum game in to a non-zero sum game. The universe must rectify the imbalance. The thing is, you really think the government and rich are going to give up their wealth for fucking up? You think the feds are going to print 10000 quintillion for GME? At some point the government sets something like ""We will give you 1000$ per share, take it or leave it""(they will calculate it out and try to screw retail. It might be 200$, it might be 25$ it might be 2000$). They might help rig the system so that the shorters somehow get out of it. E.g., they might force or bribe GS to dilute shares so that they push the short interest < 50% allowing shorters to win. They could come up with some scheme to make it all work. E.g., get some institutional owners to sell out to bring it down and get GS to dilute, etc and do a lot of other shit. They could try to bankrupt GS which makes it's shares go to zero.

The simple fact is that once they short over 100% it is game over(assuming they have to pay up). The problem is we don't know if they have. Supposedly there is at least 150% ownership of stock which means there's 50% fabricated shares. That is still quite guy. It means 1 in 2 are competing. The institutional investors can't sell all their stock at once since it drives price down so this is still good for small investors, it's ""almost"" like the 100% case but it limits the price, maybe 1000$ maybe 10000$. 

But we know it is around at least 50%! But notice how the shorters are trying so hard to get the stock down and they can't really do it. Why do they try so hard? What about the FTDs? We know there are hundreds of thousands minimum as reported by the SEC. GME also only has 70M shares, about 50M float.

They say it its 18.7%.

&#x200B;

But basically there is 54M shares that are floating about, Supposed 144-177% are owned by institutions... Which should mean that you can't buy the stock(institutions don't sell like crazy because it would tank the stock by increasing supply too fast and they would lose money). Yet people are buying stock no problem. Why?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"The whole idea is stupid from the beginning. In order for a stock to be worth a million dollars, someone has to buy it for that exorbitant sum of money. This short squeze sounds nice, but all the hedge funds will be bankrupt long before the can pay a million per share for these papers. And that is the end of the game. Theoretically stock price can go up to infinity but in reality only until the shorters go bankrupt. At that point it will loose all its value."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Now, every time the shorts are squeeze, they were forced to buy the stock and give it back to the owners they borrowed from. They end up with nothing and lost money.

Some times when you have dug so deep you can't get out your own choice is to continue digging and hope you get to China.

&#x200B;

There is a reason people are putting in their life savings. If the information is correct and it's not a fabrication and the shorts really are screwed, the only way they can get out is through massive manipulation of the market by the government, brokers, and hedge funds. This is extremely unlikely to work, at least in the long run. There are other hedge funds long in the stock, you think they will allow it? Will they be able to figure out how to get out of it? It's possible. They could kill RC, sabotage GS, etc and use their disinformation network to push different narratives. They could do a lot of evil shit. Will they? Only time knows that.

&#x200B;

It's a gamble, but it's a gamble that is almost a sure thing... not quite. This is why you only bet something you are willing to lose. No one knows what truly 100% is going on.  There is always a chance that you would be the one screwed over and so you have to be willing to accept those odds. These billionaires are not going to go work at Wendy's so easily, I imagine they are willing to kill to stop that. They might crash the entire economy to save themselves. Who knows. Look what they did with Epstein. As far as we know they could be manipulating the entire thing and playing both sides to screw retail and all of it is a scam where they win. You have to do your DD and decide what you want cause no one will come make you whole if you end up with the bag."

&#x200B;

Like a lot of people, I started learning about investing a month or two ago after GameStop started going crazy.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôm not really in on that, but what I am looking to do is build a simple portfolio of index funds and ETFs that can be diverse enough to mitigate risk somewhat but small enough to maximize returns. I am investing for the near short term (5 years) and the long term (30 years). I am 31 currently.

&#x200B;

Currently I hold:

&#x200B;

ETFs:

YOLO (I like weed stocks)

MSOS (I like weed stocks)

ARKK (Tech is a no brainer, especially long term)

LIT (Interested in EV and supply chain)

&#x200B;

Index funds:

FAJTX (embracing risk for the long term with an eye on retirement)

BALFX (balanced, to mitigate risk somewhat)

PSILX (for international exposure)

&#x200B;

Currently considering maybe one to three more ETFs to round it out, but I don‚Äôt want to spread myself too thin.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any recommendations on ETFs, I‚Äôd love to hear it. Thanks!"

03/27/2021,stocks,"I work under the VIAC umbrella. Wouldn‚Äôt have touched the stock (other than shares I get issued by the company each year) for a while pre-merger w/ CBS. Full disclosure, I‚Äôm on the CBS side and didn‚Äôt like either stock.

Since the merger I‚Äôve seen plenty of overhead saved in synergies and the leadership has done a really good job from what I‚Äôve seen. 

I started buying in June when the stock was at $23. Sold about half of my accumulated position from $23-26 basis at $60 and $80. Didn‚Äôt tap the register at 100, but still have half my long position at a $25ish basis. Feel good about it. Bought three different times today, at $60, $50 and $45... increased my position to 75% of the share count I had when I bought the pandemic dip in June. I averaged up to $35 because I believe in the company and think this dip is overdone.

Not a super long hold for me, because I don‚Äôt know that VIAC has much to separate it from the other streaming services right now, but a $3 billion cash raise seems like what you‚Äôd need to invest in that space to catch up and maybe try to find a new edge."

IMO this can easily dip into the 30s next week since there's no reason this stock should be worth more than what it was worth in January.

What people don't seem to understand is that not all streaming services are equal. Just because VIAC got a streaming service with mediocre shows in a saturated market doesn't mean it'll become the next Netflix. This should be trading in the 30s imo in any rational market.

2021-03-26 21:19:00,stocks,"Am I misunderstanding the rules of pattern day trading? So I've been buying and selling shares since about December, I thought I had the basics figured out on how to make money and also not get flagged as a day trader, since that's just not allowed as a poor person. However, I like volatile stocks so I try not to day trade at all but I might partake if I see a good opportunity since you can do 4 of them within a week (from what I understand) and then I'm careful after that till the next week. So, from what I've read I took it to mean that I can do up to 4 round trips within a week and that's all I have to be careful of. BUT then I was reading some other restrictions that leads me to believe I'm closer to being banned from daytrading for 90 days or whatever, like you can't buy and sell the same stock at all within several days without adding to the invisible pattern day trading tally and other things that weren't refuted by anyone else (which makes me think they're right).

So for an example, say I buy 5 shares of a $10 stock Monday and then sell them at the end of the day when they're $20. That's one round trip, right? That's all I thought a day trade was, trades that were round trip on the same day. Then, after reading more, it seems the ""4 round trips within a week"" means I can't buy a stock on Monday, and then sell it on Tuesday-Friday (as that's a round trip within a week) which is WAY more restricting and I'm surprised I haven't been banned yet. So what am I really missing here?"
03/27/2021,stocks,In that case lets assume I bought 100 AAPL for my 5th trade. Will it let me sell Calls to synthetically create an exit?
03/27/2021,stocks,Yes a good faith violation is in the cards if you don‚Äôt have settled cash to make your buy/sell trades . There are other types of violations and all have consequences. Fidelity offers a good explanation of each. https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/avoiding-cash-trading-violations
03/27/2021,stocks," With a cash account, only settled funds can be used for day trading. For example, if you have $1,000 settled funds, you can make five day trades for $200 each, or you can use all the money for just one day trade. When you run out with settled funds, you are no longer eligible for day trading. If you insist to buy stocks with unsettled funds and sell them out before (T+2) settlement, you will trigger GFVs."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Dollar cost averaging has nothing to do with buying the dip. Using this method you select a period of time , say every 40 days, to buy shares regardless of price. Some are high and some are low, it‚Äôs about being consistent."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yea I got that now, so DCA is better than waiting till another good entry point?"
03/27/2021,stocks,Buying the dip is not as effective in the current market. Best to do DCA if you want to keep investing in a particular stock. An alternative I like is setting up a  DRIP ( dividend reinvestment program) with a dividend aristocrat. I do this with $T and over time it works out great allowing my cash to invest in other areas.

F Market cap: $48B

NIO makes 1/100 of revenue of F, but is more valuable than F.

Now, I understand that there's big hype on EVs. But if that's the case, shouldn't F be just as valuable when F also plans to go all electric by 2035?

what advantage does NIO have over F?

* It's Chinese market share?
* Already all electric, while F will be in 15 years? Is F's plan to go all electric too slow?
* Just a massive hype?
* F's mediocre stock performance the past 5 years?

\*Disclaimer, I own NIO and I don't own F.

Blackberry is *the key* to established auto manufacturers being able to compete with Tesla in EV and autonomous driving, there's nobody else who comes close to being able to fill that role. Traditional auto manufacturers need BB to be able to compete with Tesla in autonomous driving."
03/27/2021,stocks,Yup!! I really hoping this upcoming earnings makes it move already!!
03/27/2021,stocks,"I am aware. Amazon and cars are the go-to talking points for every BlackBerry fan. I am telling you it‚Äôs bupkis.

Just because it‚Äôs being used on a lot of cars, or that there‚Äôs some kind of deal with Amazon doesn‚Äôt mean BlackBerry is going to be balling anytime soon. It‚Äôs a sign that BlackBerry will still be around in the future, that it‚Äôs probably not going bankrupt anytime soon, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a wise investment.

There are a lot of factors to consider here, and their business is just not all that lucrative, especially when you consider they‚Äôre up against stiff competition in pretty much every market they conduct business in. If market share were everything, then there‚Äôs no way iOS would be outperforming Android on profits, much less by such a wide margin.

Apple and Google pulled a sick double lariat on RIM and razed BlackBerry as a device and as a platform. RIM tried to get back up with the PlayBook, and ended up losing a fuckload of money on it. And now there‚Äôs nothing left to do but license out the remaining scraps for a pittance. It‚Äôs over. They‚Äôre never going to stand up again, and you‚Äôd be an idiot to buy their stock.

Just the fact that they have to resort to creative accounting to puff up their figures, enough so that the SEC had to point a finger at them and tell them to cut that shit out, should give you pause."
03/27/2021,stocks,The SEC‚Äôs letter isn‚Äôt what is sketchy. It‚Äôs the fact MarketWatch decides to wait 2 months to post the story right before earnings and words it like BB is engaging in egregious accounting practices when in reality this is a nothing-burger. A ‚Äúhit piece‚Äù for sure
03/27/2021,stocks,"I see, so Tesla fans say that FSD will make it a multi trillion dollar company, yet the same thing coming from not Tesla with a potentially larger market share will just make BB ""not go bankrupt"". I agree it could be a few years before this project starts to bear fruit from an investment standpoint, but if you don't see potential here then I think you're being willfully blind. Viewed another way, why should cars as digital devices not create a significant amount of new value as Apple did in the phone space? Tesla fans are saying that FSD will make Tesla a multi-trillion dollar company... yet somehow you assert that if BB + Amazon pull it off, this will create merely enough value to not go bankrupt? This reasoning doesn't add up. You talk about the present cash flow from existing products as if that's what matters... Obviously BB Ivy is not yet deployed, and they do not yet have autonomous driving shipped. But take any finance 101 class, how is net present value calculated? In terms of *future discounted cash flow*. If they can prove they can execute on autonomous driving, by what logic would investors continue to assume Tesla is worth nearly $1 Trillion dollars and BB is worth $5B?

Blackberry's existing relationships within the automotive sector are significant. Again, Tesla's OS *cannot* be used by other manufacturers because it lacks proper certifications. Who is going to undercut BB if not Tesla in this area? I'm not saying BB is definitely going to moon, but it's obvious that this is worth watching. The non-GAAP accounting thing isn't great, yes, but it's also true that a number of new partnerships have been announced over the past year - are Amazon, Baidu, etc. all fucking idiots for not seeing it your way?"
03/27/2021,stocks,Aah well i think marketwatch is shitty so no surprise there.
03/27/2021,stocks,I never said Tesla is a reasonable stock either. Go ask a Tesla fan.
03/27/2021,stocks,"You don't have to believe in Tesla. The market believes the thesis that autonomous driving will create new markets and new value, just like the smartphone did. That growing value pie has to be divided somehow in the future, and it's reasonable to believe that BB Ivy will play an important role in how that pie is divided."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Playing an important role is not the same as taking in profit.

Licensing QNX to companies that want a lightweight realtime kernel is not the same thing as driving innovation in autonomous cars. There is a lot of software to develop on top of that. BlackBerry is not going to see much of that pie.

You‚Äôll see. 5 years from now, BlackBerry will be every bit as stagnant as it was 5 years ago."

2021-03-26 20:27:27,stocks,"Can someone point out to me what i'm missing here in this options trading strategy? Let me know if this is not the place to ask and if so, my apologies.

As a European I recently started experimenting with buying calls and puts. One of the things I tried a few times now and worked out every time is the long straddle: I buy an ATM or slightly OTM call and put at the same time for a stock that is volatile enough but not too much. One that's likely to be going up or down a few percentages over the course of one or a couple of days. Pretty easy to find in European stocks (I did this with MT). Expiration date at least a couple weeks ahead. Then I just wait for it to go up or down enough so I'm gaining more than losing (either way it goes, eventually you will gain more than you lose as you can only lose 100% of the premium, but gain multitudes.

I found that with this stock the price only needs to move 2% for me to already have more gains than losses. I sell at 2.5-3% change to get at least 5% gains out of it, including all costs.

This just seems too easy... The chance of the stock not moving 2.5% either way before theta decay starts eating away too much seems really small. So it feels like i'm taking close to zero risk for pretty consistent gains. I need to add so far the stock always moved up so I got profits from the call. Maybe if  it goes down it needs to swing further for the put to make a profit? Is there something I'm not seeing here?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Honestly if you want to be an options trader, selling covered options and using the wheel strategy is what you should be doing.  As long as you are patient during down times in the market, you will never not make money and take very little risk.  With buying options to sell later, if the price suddenly goes the wrong way, you get your entire premium amount wiped away.  With selling options, you can make money no matter what direction the stocks go."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yep the wheel I will definetly try later, this was just some experimenting with small part of my budget to see how the prices behave. And yes I can loose an entire premium but it just seemed I would almost always gain more with the other option I bought and sold at the same time. All my other money is in stocks rn and don't have enough free cash for cash secured puts."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah that‚Äôs always the part that‚Äôs a little annoying is needing enough to buy the 100 shares.  Had to overcome that in the beginning as well.

One thing in case you‚Äôve never considered it, even if you are just buying and holding shares of a stocks you like, always try to buy them using puts and while you hold them, sell covered calls for strike prices you don‚Äôt think they will hit.  It won‚Äôt be super high profits, but it lets you get paid to buy stocks you like, and then you make passive income for just holding onto them."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yep, lots of fun stuff to do with options :-)"
03/27/2021,stocks,One problem with European options though is they can only be executed on the expiration date and there's only one of those per month. I guess that's severely limiting plays like that

2021-03-26 20:12:58,stocks,"Anyone Else Getting Bearish on Midcaps? Still very early, but seeing a clear left shoulder/head of an H&S pattern on the daily chart for IWM. Neckline around $210. If pattern completes would suggest a move to $190. Seeing the same thing in the small caps (IJR) and Microcaps (IWC).

Anyone else getting cautious and thinking of hedging for a move lower? I've been toying with the idea of buying SDD (Proshares 2x inverse small cap ETF) or puts on those ETFs. 

Thoughts?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Disclosure: I don't own or actively trade IWM, IWC, or IJR.

At a glance, I'm not convinced these are headed for a drastic reversal. I don't think the first shoulder and head are as clear as you do. I'll use IWM for example. On the daily interval, the swing high on 2/9/21 was $228.38 at close. The next swing high was $234.42 at close on 3/15/21. That's not really a huge step up from the last high to form a head. If you zoom out on the 1-day chart, it barely looks like an increase at all. 

There is a bearish case to be made in RSI divergence though. There is a pretty clear regular bearish divergence in the past few swing highs; as price reaches higher highs in an uptrend, the RSI is reaching lower highs. This can be indicative of a bearish reversal.

However, there is a bullish case to be made with RSI divergences too. There is a hidden bullish divergence with the past few swing lows; as the price is reaching higher swing lows in an uptrend, the RSI is reaching lower lows. This can be indicative of a continuation of a bullish pattern.

Another thing to note is that all three of the index etfs you mentioned are trading way, way above a long term moving average (on the daily chart). I use an EMA200 and from early November to recently, the price has been getting further and further above the average. It can't continue like that forever, and often times after a long run, stocks will start to trade sideways and eventually consolidate around the long term moving average.  Considering the big run in the winter and the mixed signals from the rsi, it's possible that this could trade sideways for a few cycles and then break out later on. 

I'm not a huge believer in chart patterns without context, but the head and shoulders is one of the more reliable reversal patterns. That said, assuming the last two swings were a left shoulder and head, we still don't have a right shoulder yet. 

If I had a position in any of those index etfs, I'd be waiting until I saw the next swing high and then a dip to the neckline. I'd be looking at my momentum indicators to see which, if any divergences continued, and then possibly setting a stop loss a little below the neckline. 

Not financial advice. Plz don't sue."

03/27/2021,stocks,"The difference between last housing bubble and this one is that the last one was mostly caused by subprime mortgages being allowed by lenders. The increase in prices now are driven by demand - hopefully the past subprime lending practices will have stopped but who knows.

Would have been great to be black rock who helped cause the housing crisis then got extremely low interest rate loans to buy all the low priced real estate"

All it did was increase demand in a world where business has increasingly become remote and office space has been exposed as unnecessary.

There‚Äôs no reason to believe this trend will reverse or that this in fact, a bubble, at all. If anything, it‚Äôs the opposite at the moment."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Hmmm... not to discount whatever it is you‚Äôre trying to say, but these sources Only proves the point that housing values will only continue to be more expensive. As you look at housing values over time and interest rates, base cost for a home is more expensive than ever not as a function of just interest rates ‚Äî- but money in the economy. A lot of homes in popular real estate markets are being bought today, with cash straight up, nevermind the interest rates. They don‚Äôt even need loans!!! 

You miss the fact that monthly payments will either remain As they are ‚Äî or they will in fact, increase when housing values go down, but interest rates go up. This, ON TOP of the fact that, the housing market will be eaten alive by cash investors who always had the buying power *and still can‚Äôt buy real estate to rent or flip and sell fast enough NOW!!*

Just because. $220k home *might be worth $190k next year*, when interest rates go up, doesn‚Äôt make it more affordable. In fact, interest rates going back up to 4-5% would make them more expensive to pay for, AND you‚Äôd lose out in equity as the home increased in value above what you paid for it in the span of 5-10 years, compared to buying today. With every ‚Äúbubble pop‚Äù housing prices aren‚Äôt guaranteed to lose half their value, and as things are, homes will never be that cheap again unless WWIII started and half the population we‚Äôve gained in the past several decades was lost. People simply make too much money now compared to back then, and now there‚Äôs more people making all kinds of money to afford houses, even as expensive as they are now. 

It‚Äôs not FOMO. It‚Äôs a gold rush. Hot markets like major cities in Texas, Florida, Washington, New York, Georgia, Cali., etc... they‚Äôll probably never be the same. They‚Äôre simply too dense with population, demand, and people spending all kinds of money hand over fist. Again, it‚Äôs that simple. Money isn‚Äôt being conjured from thin air in these places. People are actually *spending 20-40% OVER APPRAISAL and listing* values within a day or two of listing in some cases...if this were just a fad it‚Äôd have been over some time ago. 

But it‚Äôs not because the facts and demand are all very real. You can find somebody to buy your home close to 5-10% over market value in these hot markets within a matter of days ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no sign of this slowing down, unlike the conjecture you‚Äôre presenting... this has been true for over the past year, so if anything, the ‚Äúend‚Äù of the pandemic will be the only real tell here as far as home buying trends for remote workers and the decade of 2020s."

03/27/2021,stocks,"If your stock has dipped 20-30%.. best thing is to buy again and step buy and step sell while it's on the way back up.

I have made enough money now to sell my original $135 and not have any loss. 

Unless it's a stock with a never ending downward trend then this tactic will not work."
03/27/2021,stocks,"This comparison is unfair. 

1. Fund managers are being judged based on recent performance. If they lose too much in one year they can lose their jobs as well. The  investment style that is incentivized by this is not necessarily one that will show good long term performance. 
2. Trading high volumes may affect prices for lower cap stocks. This is a problem a retail investor doesn't normally face. Effectively it means the market is less efficient with low caps, which is an advantage to a skilled retail investor.
3. Fund managers are usually limited to act within a specified set of rules.

03/27/2021,stocks,"A 3 fund strategy is the general advice given, https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio   

ETFs are already diversified, so isn't much point in picking similar ones, or picking too many.  I went with, in my IRA, 70% VTI, 20% VUG, 10% IWM.  
VTI is a total stock market index, very diversified, low risk, good returns.  VUG is higher risk, follows CRSP US Large Cap Growth Index, and IWM follows Russell 2000 small caps, lot of potential in the small caps. My Plan B was 60% VTI, 30% VXUS, an ex-US international total market index to reduce reliance on US market (ex-US means it intentionally avoids US investments), and 10% IWM.  But I decided to focus a bit more on growth.    

My ""trading"" portfolio is 50% VOO (follows S&P 500, like SPY).  People pick something like VOO for investing over SPY because it has lower expense ratios.  SPY has more liquidity (more money and more volume) so it's more suitable if you were actively trading it, or buying options.  20% FTEC, tech sector index, similar to VGT, but lower expense, and then 30% in miscellaneous.  I have 10% in Microsoft, 10% in Disney, 5% in Apple, then a little bit in ArkG (Ark Biotech/Health), MSOS (US Weed ETF) and a couple value stocks I felt had some upside, Allstate and Tyson, which have been up over 10% even through the rocky past couple months. I'll see how it goes, I'll probably shift it more towards ETFs and add in bonds as I get older.  

10% returns may not sound like much, but 10% over 7 years doubles your money."

03/27/2021,stocks,"Because people are irrational like that. You should know better posting on this sub. There's endless credible research saying that retail traders do not consistently beat the index yet we have massive communities built on basically retail stock picking. As for myself I enjoy following companies I've invested in and I like to get dividends and see those investments grow. Do I beat the index? Can't tell but I would guess no. But I'm not getting fired over it and as long as I don't lose money and earn more than from my savings account I'm complely comfortable with it. But that's just me. There are many many trust funds and hedge funds that also don't worry about beating an index. I've recently read prospectus of this trust fund and in their own words they don't compare their returns with any index. Rather their goal is long term compounding capital returns from investing in emerging markets value shares. And there are many other examples like that. Again, people and institutions have goals besides index beating."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Passive index investing *can be* aggressive. For example, if the entirety of your assets are in a single total market index fund, that's pretty aggressive when compared to a portfolio of, say, 60% stocks/40% bonds. The difference is that index investing will always be *less risky* than a portfolio of the same level of aggressiveness. So that portfolio in a total market index fund will be roughly as aggressive as another portfolio invested entirely in stocks that were picked by a fund manager, but the former portfolio will be less risky. That being said, there are about a billion types of index funds including for bonds so you can customize whatever level of stability you want with index funds"
03/27/2021,stocks,"The OP was about ""beating the index"". As you have identified,  there are multiple indexes. Should our goal be to beat the DOW? The S&P, the 30yr Treasury?

Dealerships don't even want to sell EVs, that's the true problem. They want that servicing revenue. Every EV they sell is one less car that drives into their service shop. It's not good for their business model to sell EVs.

If you're trying to determine if a stock in a large company is a good investment, compare it to the S&P. If you're trying to determine if a Bond is a good investment, compare it to the Bond Index, etc etc.

This argument that ""could stand some refinement"" in your opinion is super basic stock market mathematics.

Instead Microsoft is just gonna take established beloved franchises that have been cross-platform forever and just pay to ensure Sony can't have them. This sucks for Sony fans and Microsoft fans. If the norm becomes both companies just trying to make good cross platform games exclusives they will stop trying to innovate."

Microsoft didn't destroy Freelancer; if anything, they saved it.

[The Death of the Celebrity Studio](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/a_studiodeath) \- 2001

>The next high profile collapse was to be Digital Anvil, co-founded in 1997 by the brothers behind the Wing Commander and Privateer series, Chris and Erin Roberts. The company soon had four seperate titles under development, not to mention the truly awful Wing Commander movie helmed by Chris Roberts.  
>  
>Four years later their sole release to date is a rather unremarkable space combat sim called Starlancer. In fact, most of the actual work on the game had been done by a British developer called Warthog, so arguably Digital Anvil still haven't released *anything* of their own after four years. **With the company still soaking up money and no end in sight for many of its more ambitious titles, something had to give.**

The ""something that had to give"" was, of course, Microsoft's acquisition of the studio.

Here's Chris Roberts admitting his failure as a studio head in [an interview from 2000:](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/article_29857)

>In the wake of the collapse of Digital Anvil, co-founder and soon-to-be-former CEO Chris Roberts has spoken about his decision to leave the company he founded just four years ago. **As we suspected, the company's troubles were down to ""wanting to develop not only hugely ambitious games, but too many hugely ambitious games"", leaving the company's finances stretched after four years without a single game being released** \- the sole title to emerge with the Digital Anvil name on it was actually mostly developed by a small British company.  
>  
>Having left the monolithic corporate world that is Electronic Arts almost five years ago to found Digital Anvil in the first place, it is somewhat ironic that his dream development studio is now being taken over by the monolithic corporate world that is Microsoft, and Roberts has confirmed that his decision to leave the company is simply because he has no desire to find himself in the same situation again.

Basically, Microsoft saved Digital Anvil from financial ruin, booted Roberts from his leadership position, chopped all the time- and money-sucking fat off Freelancer, and finally released the game in 2003 after a total of 6 years of development, which back then was a appallingly long time for game development. Without Microsoft, Digital Anvil would have shut down due to lack of funding, and Freelancer would have never launched."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Man, this argument of exclusives is such nonsense. 99% of people buy cross-platform games anyways. You would also really have to like the kind of exclusives PlayStation has. I don't like them whatsoever, but that doesn't make the Playstation any worse of a choice."

03/27/2021,stocks,This IS the way.
03/27/2021,stocks,"From an user perspective, Game pass is indeed amazing. The subscription model could become the norm for games as it did for music and movies.

From a business PoV, there is however the big question of competition, just like on music and movie streaming services.
Sony also owns studios and exclusives, and many other companies may want to try and get a slice of the cake. And what‚Äôs stopping any publisher with a large catalog, like EA or Ubisoft, or deep pockets like Epic, or a large user base like Steam, to eventually start their own games subscription service?

Also in the next years regulators may finally wake the hell up and give a real hard look at any companies who own huge market shares.
I always found the practice to release proprietary hardware and ask royalties on the software to be anticompetitive and borderline robbing. These, along with overprotective IP laws, are IMO the reason incumbents in many fields are so difficult for startups to challenge."

03/27/2021,stocks,"I think there's something like 10M consumer VR headsets out there. That's way lower than console penetration but it's growing pretty quickly.

The PS5 will get a brand new VR headset in 2022 and the improvements over the original PSVR will be significant and powered by a much faster PS. It's going to be big.

Oculus Quest 2 has been selling really well and makes VR accessible to way more people because you can get into VR for as little as $299. The only downside is that it's tied to Facebook...

There are some amazing titles available now and the growth in VR means that some of the big studios have now committed to VR releases.

It won't replace regular gaming because the experiences are different. Some games are better suited to a flat, 2D screen... but VR is the future.

It's common to hear people who have bought something like the Quest say that they're lifelong gamers but rarely ever touch their console now because the immersion in VR makes for a way more compelling experience. 

Apple will be releasing a headset likely by 2022 and that will be another huge bump in market penetration. Apple and Facebook are investing crazy amounts of money to be the dominant players in Augmented Reality and VR is a part of that. They see it as The future computing platform that will replace smartphones and PCs. It doesn't get much bigger than that... and that's not far away at all."

Some of the best businesses are tech ones but that doesn‚Äôt mean they will outperform the market all the time, especially when everyone knows they are great businesses and overpay for the growth.

I don‚Äôt know what interest rates will do from here but the 10-year is at ~1.7% and has historically been ~4.5%.  If it reverts to that mean it will get particularly ugly for high growth names.

In one account I did like I said above and basically bought stock at a huge discount primarily with money I earned from a put throughout this sell off. The other account was already long ???? and was running covered calls. I realized things were probably gonna get worse, so I just rolled the covered call to the lowest strike I could, and now I have come from a buy-in price of $17 per share to an even bigger position with a cost basis that probably will average under $13 all without having to sit around holding a half empty bag for the past 2 weeks.

03/27/2021,stocks,Learn what a dip is and then buy on dips. This problem will go away.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm boring as fuck in my investments, so I like VGT. It's a strong, yet safe collection of the biggest players in tech. I have no doubt that it's a safe investment, and will continue to outpace the market in the long term. Even if tech retreats a bit, and goes down to saner levels, it's still the future of the market, and the economy as a whole. Everything will become more reliant on the tech sector for the rest of my lifetime, barring a collapse of civilization."

03/27/2021,stocks,"It's a lot easier on the mind if you you look at performance vs an index.  You already know about the systemic risks of investing in the market, and you already know that rising tides lift all boats, etc.  So why is it so hard to find something that just reports gain/loss  over time vs your chosen index rather than raw numbers?"
03/27/2021,stocks,If the news is suggesting you do it: you're too late.
03/27/2021,stocks,I was going to write about the same. That seemed to happen to me often when I bought individual stocks and up when I sold. As others have stated b4 if the reason I bought it was still true I held it. I also slept better if I had a reasonable stop in place.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Zillow is different from other real estate corp. Real estate is no doubt important part of financial assets. Zillow is pulling in 173 million unique visitors each month. The company maintains an online database of 110 million homes targeting buyers, sellers and renters.The company is undergoing a major shift in how it does business. Zillow used to just focused primarily on selling advertising and other services to real estate professionals, a market estimated to be worth $18.8 billion. In 2018, Zillow entered into the business of buying and selling homes for itself, putting the company into direct competition with its customers. Zillow believes it can use its platform and technology to simplify the home-buying process, resulting in faster transaction times, lower costs and greater volume. Compared with advertising, the market for real estate transactions presented a far greater opportunity, recording $1.9 trillion in turnover in 2019. Their strategy shift was innovative and disruptive. I'm glad that they are part of ARKF etf."

03/27/2021,stocks,"That in a month or two the media will be pumping those stocks again.

Yeah qqq and all the rest of the trendy tech stocks 

I like how you try to imply that I've lost money or that I've made bad decisions. Funny thing is, I've avoided the past two huge sell offs.

I agree, you can't hold losers, but that's why you have to know the company and its balance sheet.

The truth is that a sell off is just gonna be a blip in the long term and anyone who didn't accumulate more of PayPal or Google, fb, Amazon etc out of fear of being ""wrong"" or ""rationalizing a bad decision"" is just going to wish they had. That's all I'm saying."

03/27/2021,stocks,About 3 years ago from today it‚Äôs gone up about 100 points. But if you take split away it‚Äôs gone from 120 to 500. Not sure if that‚Äôs 100 accurate or the correct way to view the past performance of apple. So if they can repeat growth 100 points a year isn‚Äôt crazy.

03/27/2021,stocks,"all correct, they can be part of ARK ETF but it is far away from fintech, the definition of fintech is marrying financial services and technology to disrupt incumbent players or gain moat/edge

Zillow is far from fintech, it is real estate tech or marketplace"
03/27/2021,stocks,"You think the banks are currently overcapitalized and won't need to reign in any credit? That would be very conservative planning of them. That's true, the margin is in proportion with the market and I don't know the impact that reducing margin limits would have on the market, relative to the normal volume. I'm mostly looking at ARKK falling apart for a fire sale on the good, profitable companies."
03/27/2021,stocks,Yea it‚Äôs just ambulance chaser posturing bc it‚Äôs a Chinese business and they know they can prey on peoples fears. Anti China sentiment being high currently.

03/27/2021,stocks,Agreed
03/27/2021,stocks,All good brother! It is frustrating to see so many people on here blindly supporting companies like Tesla.
03/27/2021,stocks,I added to my position at 125. Apple just blew the fucking doors off their last quarter report and it drops. People are dumb.
03/27/2021,stocks,I bought more nio few weeks ago. Definitely buying more pltr. Also stripe Sofi and coin base. Within a year you‚Äôll see article on pltr if you bought here during hell month you‚Äôd have made blah blah %.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes but Starbucks competes with a very specific type of business - cafes/coffee shops. 

Cafes and coffee shops around me have been unscathed as their business model is mostly takeout and their customers are mostly regulars.

It's not like the local Chinese place shutting down or some local clothing store shutting down is going to effect Starbucks and that's the business we're talking about right now."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Also, while I've seen a lot of local shops close, I've seen a lot of new businesses as well. The economy is changing but it isn't collapsing. Businesses just became abruptly outdated and other businesses will fill the void.

Cafes, however, are still popular in my observation."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Right. Anecdotal evidence usually holds up in the stock market. Sure, sure."

""Stay off my stock market, you damned kids!"""
03/27/2021,stocks,Thats my thinking exactly
03/27/2021,stocks,"I imagine that everywhere internationally, Starbucks is mostly supported by American tourists. Our obsession with it is weird. The coffee isn't great and the tea choices are meh. The only time I've visited was when I was living in my car and travelling the US. Would go in for a $1.50 fresh pour over of something decent (not the standard drip stuff) and use their bathroom and WiFi all day. But only when a locally owned coffee shop wasn't convenient. Don't imagine they offer those cheap pour overs anymore tho. But it was kind of comical to order something that was better AND took longer to make than their $5 milk and sugar fest drinks for a fraction of the price."
03/27/2021,stocks,It's been super nice I've been holding a bank and even posted about it here since it seemed they were undervalued and no one agreed with me lol. Probably exactly how I should have known. I'm feeling the value stocks going forward.
03/27/2021,stocks,They are Restaurant Brands aka Burger King and Popeyes
03/27/2021,stocks,"Interesting, I hadn't heard it before and looked it up.   It seems like stocks have performed better since 2013, so the past 8 years now, probably where the stock bias is coming from.   

Wonder what sort of catalyst would put bonds back out in front?  A more sustained bear market?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I agree with your sentiment, but you gotta brag when you are right and you had money on the line."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That's where my 401(k) is. 50/50 small cap and large cap value. 

My personal holdings are in green energy ETFs. This field is going to blow up over the next 10 years as we transition.

Highly recommend that if you can tolerate the volatility."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Only for the last few years have stocks really outperformed bonds. Not necessarily a bear market, but perhaps an environment of lowering interest rates coupled with economic slowdown (not no growth, just less)"
03/27/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm old enough to remember when a good rate on our mortgage was 12%.   Thats when bonds were flying high.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Once the winners emerge and are profitable yes, but owning a bunch of future bankrupt companies in an ETF particularly after the EV bubble peak (so far?)  seems more like a liability imo"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Definitely not, cycles can take years to play out. While the shifting of a cycle can be somewhat quicker, as we see now with commodities, the length of the cycle can be as long as a decade."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Agreed, ignore the naysayers."
03/27/2021,stocks,This is aging well

03/27/2021,stocks,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. All of this is true. There's also the fact that US citizens own the vast majority of the debt and other countries still owe us money as well. Then there's China's impending demographic bubble that's going to burst before they're fully industrialized as well.

The relationship is hyper complex and isn't as easily broken down into one dominating the other."
03/27/2021,stocks,Which countries are those exactly? Census.gov lists China as top import partner (Meaning America gets hurt more in a trade war)....
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yeah. I didn't expect you to actually do it, but I think it's pretty cool that you did. So, props to you for that.

Like I said, I agree with you. The supply chain is not going to be solved next week. I think no-one can predict the end of it, without knowing the extent of the capacity shortage, the amount of backlogs, the mitigation measures that each company has or will put in place, even how suppliers allocate their capacity. Too many unknowns."
03/27/2021,stocks,"What ""religious genocide"" lmal"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think it's because a lot of people are getting Chinese stocks for cheap and don't want to accept the reasons why they are cheap. 

As always with these kinds of things, I hope I am wrong and China reforms and normalizes instead of reverting back to cold war policies, but it's doubtful, and the idea that the US is going to capitulate to China over Ali Baba stock is absurd. At worse, we're going to go to war, at best, it looks like economic sanctions are inevitable. Just the other day they started flying planes further then ever into Taiwan air space."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I don't feel like looking it up right now tbh, but Europe for instance is a bigger trade partner for the US then China. 

And no, as the buyer of Chinese goods we are hurt much less because it just means we would have to buy from somewhere else, vs mass unemployment and empty factories in China."
03/27/2021,stocks,"The good thing for Nio is that they don't have big volumes so they don't need massive amounts of semis. The bad thing for Nio is that they don't have big volumes so they don't have any bargaining power what so ever. Whatever they sell in a month in China(their only market), VW sells one day in Europe. 

Also, if you're a growth company the last thing that you need is having your production line shutdown or downsized."
03/27/2021,stocks,"There wouldn't be a war. The US military is far better equipped and is allies with India, Japan and South Korea whereas China is friendly with Russia, Iran and North Korea, and both nations have nuclear weapons. 

That would be literally WW3 and then NATO would get dragged in unwillingly as well. That's a *baaaaaaaaad* situation for all of humanity. Would... be absolutely terrible.

What I could see China doing is forcing its population into cities, pumping the education and automation in it's own nation, and pushing for unilateral trade agreements and initiatives like the belt/road for food and medical supplies with poorer nations. Seems like the only way they calm an impending demographic and economic crisis with the tools they have available.

If they liberalize their real estate market, it crashes, which is where most of their retirees money is kept so they can't do that. They can't liberalize tech rules to much either, as foreign tech companies tend to be larger, more established world wide and have better global infrastructure.

Their best best, from my slightly educated guess would be to focus on mid-tier manufacturing (cars, phones, modern farm equipment etc) and automation so they can support their aging population while still bumping up GDP per capita. Then they could afford medical supplies and caregivers from lesser developed nations and focus less on agriculture."
03/27/2021,stocks,"These are good points. I do think supplier-customer relationships are more complex though. Your small customer today could be your biggest tomorrow. I mean, would you turn down an order from Tesla today because Audi makes a bigger order ? I known I would want to keep Tesla as a customer."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Both China and the US would lose massively in a war. The US would be stretched thin, but it punches way above its population's weight... like, world class lightweight boxer status, and China has a strong manufacturing base, decent enough tech and a large population. That's a bad bet for either country. It's also bad for all the business shared between the two. War isn't good for 90% of the population on earth ever. The 10% that it is are the E-7/8s and above that make bank during wartime and don't see much combat, the military-industrial complex and those attached to it. 

McDonalds doesn't want a war, neither does Amazon or Microsoft. Neither do the average citizens of either nation."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Execs care only about their next pay check. And the next paycheck comes from what you sell today and not after many years. Also Audi for example doesnt make their electronics in-house but externalize them to 2nd tier OEM like Bosch, Continental, Hella and so on and they have firm contracts on deliveries and quantities which turn those OEMs who may work for the whole automotive industry in giant customers for the semis industry. Maybe you dont want to lose Tesla as a future client but surely you dont want to lose Bosch as a now client. You'll get fired pretty quickly if you do it. And one thing that this 1st party OEMs do is that they hire 2 companies for the same project one of them acting as a 2nd supplier in case something goes wrong with the 1st one, and I dont think that Nio does this yet, which is why they shut down the whole production which hasnt happened afaik with other automotive producers. They shut down either some plant either some car line but not the whole production. This is bad beyond imanigible, as I said Nio is a growth company, they cant afford falling or stagnating numbers."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Well, it's not so much that the US would be stretched thin, it just wouldn't be worth the effort. The US is a heavyweight world class boxer with a military 10x the size of China. In any kind of war it would annihilate China, but it would just cost billions of dollars plus economic damage that lasts decades. 

That's why I don't see it happen. I see China doing to Taiwan what Putin did to Crimea, and then getting hit with sanctions because the US isn't going to want to go to war over it."
03/27/2021,stocks,"You may be right, I don't know. Time will tell. But for sure, this should be factored in as a risk. Anyway, you're cool. I kinda feel bad for ripping on you, but your original comment triggered me for some reason. You raised points which got me thinking and I value that, that's why I come here. Thanks."

2) at the same time I don't think we'll see the sort of growth in the future as we've seen in the past"

I generally agree, but I did buy a record player a couple years ago and gave personally invested in my vinyl collection.

03/27/2021,stocks,"Oh ok, I guess Jack Bogle was full of shit."
03/27/2021,stocks,Does that include dividends?
03/27/2021,stocks,Can I have a number one with a double cheeseburger please.
03/27/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs why I hate this argument. ‚ÄûHow long would it take to breakeven if you bought at the absolute top and never added to the position?‚Äú ugh cmon dude
03/27/2021,stocks,Assumes reinvested dividends
03/27/2021,stocks,">Who has the best smart watch? Who made air pods popular? Who made tablets popular? Who has one of the best chips in a laptop (perhaps the best)?

Apple didn't do *any* of those things first, and I would argue that the Apple Watch is not the best smart watch. They were just the best at marketing their versions of those products. Again, I am not saying Apple is a bad company or that it does not deserve its valuation. But copying what others are doing and slapping on a higher price tag has been Apple's MO for close to a decade. It doesn't by any means make the best products; it makes pretty good products and markets the hell out of them. And it does that incredibly well."
03/27/2021,stocks,They probably think Ford is the most innovative car company in the world because they made cars first...
03/27/2021,stocks,Square has been around for a decade.
03/27/2021,stocks,Crickets
03/27/2021,stocks,"They didn‚Äôt invent a smartphone either...

But they saw existing concepts and took them to a completely new level, becoming the benchmark. That‚Äôs still innovation for me."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt agree at all. You don‚Äôt only have to make things first to be considered innovative.

If you‚Äôre taking existing ideas and pushing them to a completely next level, then that sure is innovation to me. In my opinion, Apple products are amongst the benchmark in their respective field. 

So do you consider Ferrari isn‚Äôt an innovative company because Ford were the first ones to make a car? I presume not!"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Lol even Android fans know the Apple Watch is the best smart watch by a mile.  Wear OS is a complete joke. 

https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/08/im-an-android-user-who-tried-the-apple-watch-for-a-month-its-now-the-only-smartwatch-ill-recommend/"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Apple took the concept of the smart phone and did a lot with it to make it perfect for the market. Thats innovative.

Comparing what they did with wireless headphones to the iPhone is disingenuous. They did jack shit, its just another wireless headphone that is ONLY succeeding because of apples marketing"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I haven't seen Apple push anything to a new level in years. Whenever iPhone introduces a new feature, it's already 2 years old on Android. The HomePod is the least  versatile virtual assistant. Apple Watch's battery lasts less than a day.  Apple's UI is great, but they rarely produce features that haven't already been done, and they rarely do it better than their competition."
03/27/2021,stocks,The Apple Watch's battery only lasts 18 hours...
03/27/2021,stocks,"Not entirely true, they had all the same offerings as Netflix in 2007 with a better selection and more brand recognition. The crash in 2008 caused a crunch in their parent company which in turn led to no investment money available to keep those offerings going. Netflix on the other hand had a ton of cash available to weather the storm. Had nothing to do with lack of innovation and everything to do with poor debt management by Blockbusters parent company"
03/27/2021,stocks,"If that‚Äôs the case, then I think you‚Äôre deluded. We cannot downplay how Apple has popularized air pods, tablets, smart watches and now they have arguably the best laptop chips.

Yes, marketing is definitely part of it, but you cannot become the most valuable company in the world by making crap stuff."
03/27/2021,stocks,Who cares?  When I go to sleep I pop it on the charger on my bedside table in 2 seconds.  Are you often awake for more than 18 hours at a time?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes, they popularized those things, but they didn't innovate when making them. You seem to be under the impression that if Apple's products aren't best-in-class then it somehow means Apple is a bad company"
03/27/2021,stocks,I understand. I have a smaller budget than most it seems lol
03/27/2021,stocks,"Bought some Square, PayPal, AMD, and AirBnB shares right at the bottom today and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Already up about 6% in a few hours. Already stocked up on QCOM yesterday when it was at the INSULTING price of $125.

Bought some dirt cheap WMT, PLTR and AMD calls for June, along with an AAPL 5/7 $124 call (when AAPL was bottoming out at $119) that I believe may have been the best call I‚Äôve ever purchased. I may regret bringing up the specter  of AAPL options after the pain they‚Äôve inflicted on me; but I think I finally broke the cycle."
03/27/2021,stocks,"After losing 2.5k playing with options like a moron, I'm up 200 today. So there's something."

Step2: wait"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I created a Firstrade account with $500 just to see how it feels, put money into Starbucks with 0 DD and got free shares in ET and GE. They're all up 10-15%. My real account with Fidelity that I put real money and effort into is down 10% üò≠"
03/27/2021,stocks,Thoughts on SQ?

Rather than just the normal 1 day, 5 day, 1 month, etc."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Himax pre-earnings should be released this coming Friday (April 2nd), based on company history for previous pre-earnings. Just a heads up. They always release it about 1-month ahead of earnings.

Guidance was ""5-10% QoQ increase in revenue"" and ""EPS increase to .30 - .34"", coming off a record quarter."
03/27/2021,stocks,Thoughts on VIAC?
03/27/2021,stocks,Do you guys use market cap to figure out how big a company is? I'd like to compare companies of different sizes but I don't know whats considered big and small
03/27/2021,stocks,"Too late to jump on the TGT, HD, COST trains?"
03/27/2021,stocks,Does anyone have a recommendation for a site that aggrogrates multiple years of company financial data? Like I wanted to see the last 5 years of apple earnings reports broken out by qourter in a table. Is there a site for that?
03/27/2021,stocks,"May see a small pull back on Monday but assuming that we see the same thing we saw in February and March happen again in April, my guess would be that we're going to see 4200 in the S&P and 34k in the Dow in April, then the rest of the market sees a correction similar to what happened in the fall.

I do not think the tech indices can make it back to their ATHs. They will likely stop just short before this widespread market correction unfolds. 

What will be very interesting for me if this now seemingly wild goose chase market correction does occur is what happens to the high beta tech names that have already taken a major hurting. Are they already too beaten down, or will they continue getting hurt?"
03/27/2021,stocks,How are SQ and LSPD not both e-commerce AND reopening plays? LSPD even derives a small part of its revenue from golf reservations! Thinking about adding more SQ but also concerned the market disagrees with me...
03/27/2021,stocks,"What are you guys thought on SunPower? They‚Äôve just gotten a new CEO and he has his sights set on consumer growth. Also he‚Äôs a Amazon vet so he knows his way around. They‚Äôre down down a ton in the last 30%, but with the focus on on green in the administration I think they can make it."
03/27/2021,stocks,APHA good range to get in or wait for it to drop more (if it does) before the merger run up?
03/27/2021,stocks,Any one have thoughts about when 5g stocks will boom? Seems that it is such a slower roll out than 4g.
03/27/2021,stocks,"INTC has the cash flow and is making the investments necessary to catch up in innovation deficients of recent years.

Thoughts on the future of intel?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I definitely respect that the Fed has been involved in this case, but...

Dow from early November 2016-late March 2017: +15.14%

early November 2020-late March 2021: +24.80%

An absolutely brilliant rally."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Is the recent instability in tech stocks caused by SEC invistigation?

03/27/2021,stocks,"So I bought my first option call today, and I'll be honest, [I have no fucking idea what I'm looking at.](https://i.imgur.com/XLOdPo6.jpg) But it seems like it's doing well? I've read a decent amount of articles on Investapedia, but I'm still confused. Like the stuff about Volume, the bids and asks being different than the stock itself, it being up 250% in not even a day, etc. Any insight?"
03/27/2021,stocks,Do you still expect the S&P 500 to achieve its 10% annual return over the next year despite its current valuation? What makes you prefer the S&P 500 over AT&T's 7% dividend right now?
03/27/2021,stocks,Thoughts on coke puts? Boycott news not going to help them
03/27/2021,stocks,Would like someone else to help me confirm that AMD has reached the bottom of the dip. From what I gather it is way undervalued.
03/27/2021,stocks,"The state of this sub is interesting. My portfolio (nothing flashy just relatively well diversified portfolio with tech overweighted) is like 0.2% below ATH, SPY is at ATH, DAX is at ATH, Nikkei is at ATH, yet the front page of this sub is reading like we're in the middle of a giant bear market. What the fuck?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"This sub is so weird recently. Posts of the last few days include:

&#x200B;

>Tech is tanking at the moment, but it will come back up eventually. Don‚Äôt listen to the big media platforms too much!

What are you talking about? Tanking? We must have looked at different charts because i didn't see any tanking.

&#x200B;

>This is not the first correction.... but online it seems that way

What correction? Are we literally calling everyday flactuations ""correction"" now?

Relax people, save your energy to worry when we're in a *real* correction - not to mention a *real* recession..."
03/27/2021,stocks,How often do you guys use ROE as an indicator? It feels misleading sometimes
03/27/2021,stocks,"Hopefully the future of NIO is night we than their short term failures. I‚Äôve lost too much money to not hold it for a while, but at least I got my cost basis down. Yep other EV plays that are destroying me right now are HYLN and XL. All could be successful down the road. Thoughts?"
03/27/2021,stocks,"The key with AAPL is to sell options, not buy them. APPL seems to trade sideways or down most of the time."
03/27/2021,stocks,Ballsy. Hope it pays off for you.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Depends on how crypto will do. If crypto stays strong and their NFT plan works out well than it‚Äôs very undervalued as they will hit 15 billion revenue or more, though gross profit margin still low, most people should eventually stay and the margins will improve starting next year, if crypto crashes then they might be in a bit of trouble, perhaps seller could catch up. Really up to how you view the future of crypto."
03/27/2021,stocks,I'm no mastermind but I don't like the P/E. I know they're pricing in growth but I feel like when bad news comes these stocks have no legs to stand on. I'm staying away but that's me.
03/27/2021,stocks,i bought in to them recently as they seemed pretty popular. the only thing is i bought in during this last month so ive seen some crazy swings. great when they are green but you get some nasty red days. i think theyre on the volatile side so be prepared for swings. i sold out a week ago due to the crazy situation at the moment. might buy back in a week or so.
03/27/2021,stocks,VT. As you can see US is starting to move away from decades of business and economic growth friendly policies into more wealth redistribution focused policies. There will be far more uncertainty and fear for the economy and business environment. Risk of a big value reset for US stocks is just going to get higher looking at the political trend. Global stock market exposure is definitely a better way to go. Big chance international stocks will perform better than US for quite some time. Have 1-2% of the portfolio in crypto as well.
03/27/2021,stocks,VT has higher dividends but VTI has historically performs better
03/27/2021,stocks,"More room to drop imo; I think it can return to 30s. Its rise since January was based on euphoria and not grounded in reality. People are taking a serious look now.   Decreasing revenue YOY from cable and a streaming service that will be losing tons of money for the next several years makes this company a complete dog. $21 billion in debt, and if they focus on streaming, they cannibalize their traditional cable business. Their shows on their streaming services are also not attractive, incomparable to Disney, Netflix, Hulu or Amazon."
03/27/2021,stocks,I think target has alot of growth. Stay away from Costco or HD. Profits are declining.
03/27/2021,stocks,"It gets shit on around here, but Yahoo Finance+ has all of that."
03/27/2021,stocks,I think the suez canal issue might end up hurting the markets in the short term.
03/27/2021,stocks,Maybe Tesla will fall to $200 like Michael Burry says.
03/27/2021,stocks,I think tech will rejointhe other indices and help drive it to 4200. But im more inclined to think it will be less speculative tech leading the way.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Tax hikes will be announcing next week, which is significantly earilier than basically every big investors/banks expected. gonna be a rough ride for stocks. Was so optimistic for stocks this year till no split congress, sigh. Super close to see some steady but strong bull run like 2017, damn."
03/27/2021,stocks,SQ is lumped in with the rest of high-flying tech so it gets unfairly hammered imo. Good buying opportunity but personally I'm waiting for it to dip under $160.
03/27/2021,stocks,I'd be cautious on this because anything solar/EV/battery seems to be doing poorly now. Not sure when they'll go back up. Probably a good long term hold though.
03/27/2021,stocks,"I personally believe that anytime it‚Äôs under $17, you ought to be buying some calls."
03/27/2021,stocks,"It's been nothing more other than many names went too far, too fast. Many are also completely and totally broken right now and are unlikely to rally again anytime soon. Just see what has gone on with FAANG+M for the most part after they were blasted early in the fall.

Ignore MassHugeAtom. They won't stop fear-mongering about taxes. That has nothing to do with what's going on. Nothing."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Should only be a very small part of it, also it's a weird reasoning behind it anyway. Softbank was just betting the nasdaq could moon with options play. Tax hike threats is the major reason and they are announcing the tax hike bill next week."
03/27/2021,stocks,"If it's up 250%, you should probably sell unless you have high conviction that it'll gain more. Check out r/options for option-related knowledge."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Hey cool cats and kittens! The 10% return is annual average, so since SPY has returned around 75% the last 4 years, in theory, we should have around a -20%/-25% year"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Considering that, even though there's been a lot of jitters, the S&P and Dow are pacing at 23.28% and 32.24% gains so far on a sample size of almost 3 months if they were to continue, yes.

Should note that I suspect this trend likely won't be continuing. But the 2016 analog to an extent seems likely to play out. Tech won't have a losing year, but with the sample size we have, it looks like this is the rare year it loses to the Dow."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Well SPY returned 5.5% so far in only 3 months, and i wouldn't say these 3 months were the best i've ever seen. Returning 4.5% for the remaining 9 months shouldn't be that difficult imo. We will likely see annoying corrections and random red days tho. But in the end my guess is SPY will the end the year up ~15% total, so another 10% to go."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I don't know, but by the looks of it its ready to dip more"
03/27/2021,stocks,They have deals with Samsung and Nzxt. Cheaper than Intel with same performance. Their gpus are just as popular as Nvidia for gaming and crypto. Are they being bottlenecked by the semiconductor shortage? That's probably their only real issue at the moment.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Quality, high growth...but high beta and high multiple mid cap tech stocks have been crushed 20%-40%. SQ, TWLO, CRWD, OKTA, NET, or really anything in the ARK portfolios. Also spec clean energy like PLUG and ENPH. 

For me, that section of my portfolio has been hammered, only somewhat offset by energy, banks, utilities, and boring industrials that during the tech bull run I was feeling bad about owning.

Lots of others around here are probably 100% mid cap tech..."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Diversification is a four-letter word on Reddit. It's the Tech Show, 24/7.

That said I ""diversified"" into reopening stocks and still ended up -3.6% on the week. So I clearly don't know what I'm doing either. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
03/27/2021,stocks,"My two impressions based on some of what I read here:

1) Many people seem very tech heavy and thus very vulnerable to this correction, with many coming off a months-long satisfaction on crushing value stocks.

2) Some people may be investing more than they should, because they seem very ‚Äúshort-term attached‚Äù to it.

I think one or both of these things is dramatically affecting perceptions and creating the false notion that we‚Äôre in a bear market. When the days are red, the bears come out with their unsupported theories on hyperinflation and Burry. When the days are green they‚Äôre almost nowhere to be found."
03/27/2021,stocks,I'm down like 12% this month and I don't have obscure stocks.
03/27/2021,stocks,The new influx of people got super high risk stuff that has been slaughtered recently
03/27/2021,stocks,Dude even the Chinese government is bearish on BABA lol.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Indexes are doing well. But individual stocks have been in a severe correction from February highs. Not just a few individual names. ICLN is down as an entire green sector ETF. SQ, LMND, NIO, TSLA, CRSR, PLTR, SNOW, I could go on for ages with ticker symbols that have dropped more than 40%. 40% is not an everyday fluctuation."
03/27/2021,stocks,"You are looking at different charts. Look at mid cap high growth tech. Down 20-40 percent since Jan/Feb.

But you‚Äôre right, things like Google and the indices are holding strong."
03/27/2021,stocks,"> Don‚Äôt listen to the big media platforms too much!

Some of these statements sound straight up like straight up Q shit. Like CNBC is the reason that SQ and TSLA are down."
03/27/2021,stocks,"I'm probably a bear on EV companies so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.

These are car manufacturers. A historically low profit margin business. Only like 4 of car companies that have been around for some time haven't gone bankrupt at least once.

Who's buying and trusting Chinese cars? China got a stinking reputation. Even Chinese customers usually buy Western. 

IMO Volkswagen, Tesla, Ford and the likes are gonna outsell any Chinese car maker by a ton. And that's not even talking about how the Chinese stocks are getting dislisted soon."
03/27/2021,stocks,"People have to stop saying apple is undervalued. It's a great company don't get me wrong, but come on it's a 2t market cap company"
03/27/2021,stocks,"TSM and AAPL made up about 75% of my portfolio as it was, and all my other holdings were in other tech companies, so I was already pretty high on TSM as it was. Losing Intel was nothing more than a round of bad press. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre hurting for customers, and it‚Äôs not like Intel has made a good chip in the last 3 years. As long as they‚Äôre still fabbing Apple‚Äôs chips, they‚Äôll soar."
03/27/2021,stocks,YouTube
03/27/2021,stocks,Wealth redistribution policies? You mean rolling back Trump‚Äôs massive tax cuts?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Pretty much yeah. You can always rely on MMs to do what is best for them.

Also don't be fooled into thinking this is a bullish sign. The market is still incredibly bearish overall and this wasn't a vote of confidence on the indices into close this was straight up OPEX manipulation.

Stay safe out there everyone, don't go all in yet we could still another flush before the market breaks downward momentum on the NASDAQ and before DOW is allowed to go up some more."
03/27/2021,stocks,"QQQ dropped to support at 310, I bought 312 0DTE calls for $0.30. They closed at $3. That is a 1000%/10x gain and if I had held would have turned $300 into $3000. Instead I turned $300 into $900 and decided not to get greedy.

This was a bet based on MMs making a move to push QQQ into max pain given the huge amount of open option interest (mainly puts below $316)."
03/27/2021,stocks,I bought on Thursday thinking the drop was done. Hoping that it corrects back to at least that.
03/27/2021,stocks,Interesting insight. You don't think it'll go back up in the future? I was thinking about buying a few shares since its down so far right now
03/27/2021,stocks,"I think earnings season is going to be insane for big tech again. Big tech PE isn't super overvalued right now, only marginally above SP500.

Last earnings season we didn't see tech move up despite insane earnings and 100B quarters because rotation was already starting since November. But this time around I expect we see large moves out of AMZN, AAPL and maybe FB/GOOG."
03/27/2021,stocks,"That's not why the pull back is going to occur.

Edit: You are going to see lots of fighting over what should actually be in the infrastructure deal, and eyes being diverted from the market as the US goes back to normal. Once it's known that it will be a while before you see infrastructure, that's what will be the actual catalyst."
03/27/2021,stocks,How did you calculate that entry price?
03/27/2021,stocks,"It gets ~~un~~fairly hammered because its overvalued af. The companies great, but nothing justifies it being worth 156% more than feb 2020."
03/27/2021,stocks,How do options work with mergers?
03/27/2021,stocks,But the taxman!!!! He is the real enemy of mankind!!
03/27/2021,stocks,"Only someone delusional like you will say there‚Äôs nothing to do with tax hike bill, the qqqj stocks might be due to valuation but nasdaq100 movements is largely due to tax hikes. That‚Äôs exactly why infrastructure stocks are rising quite a bit as well. Tax hike and possible regulation on big tech companies has been on people‚Äôs minds since last September and investors are rebalancing their assets due to speculating how to avoid tax hike, regulations plus benefiting from the bill most."
03/27/2021,stocks,Not familiar. Anybody have bullet points on this?
03/27/2021,stocks,Yep. Pretty much.
03/27/2021,stocks,"Well arkk is down 20% so that means we have 120% upside left this year, let the good times roll."

03/27/2021,stocks,"In an effort to get away from tech, I landed in SLM just before ex-dividend. Chugging along."
03/27/2021,stocks,Which reopening stocks? I‚Äôm curious because I‚Äôve done the same
03/27/2021,stocks,"You missed the time to diversify into recovery stocks. The recovery is well underway, thanks to vaccine rollouts and the optimism around a return to non-lockdown life by summer.

03/27/2021,stocks,... so hyper inflated meme stock with incredibly high pe ratios.
03/27/2021,stocks,Yep. I‚Äôve been loading up on F. I think it‚Äôs a decent EV play plus all its normal benefits. I don‚Äôt think it moons or anything at all but it‚Äôs a solid long term hold. I expect $20/share by end of 2022.

03/27/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs only small part of it, also comes with massive capital gains hike and international profits hike. There will likely be lots of new regulations as well. That‚Äôs enough to discourage internal investors over time and they will rotate money out of the US stock market if tax hike policies persists. Market never priced in any tax hike/new regulations. This P/E ratio is justified with the current tax rate and deregulations from Trump administration. If reversed the drop could be very big, VT is certainly much better than vti. Also international stock market returns had not been great which means they will likely push out economic growth/tax cut  policies which could favor their local stock market a lot more than the past decade. That will boost their stock market and keep a lot more companies to IPO on their home country rather than going to the US stock market."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes, there's that. Asset inflation across the board, in every stock market and in most if not every housing market. 

More importantly, though, is that rates will stay low. And that further justifies the premium paid through a higher PE ratio. 

The calculus has changed. Valuations are relative. Our current period of struggling to find inflation and keeping low rates is entirely different from the monetary context of, say, 1995.

03/27/2021,stocks,"And exactly which foreign markets are going to outperform the US? Regulations are tighter in the EU, China‚Äôs markets are suffering right now and Biden‚Äôs admin is launching reinvestments aimed at growing US innovation. China‚Äôs consumer class is nowhere near as broad or powerful as American consumers in most segments, and their country isn‚Äôt exactly friendly to foreign direct investment.

India? Brazil?

There‚Äôs a reason why VTI outperforms VT. So long as the US maintains a healthy immigration pipeline, its very reasonable to assume that we continue to defer mature economy status and maintain a growth economy. I‚Äôve now worked for three transnational consumer goods manufacturers, and sales in the US dwarf overseas sales.

I think the US economy will absorb changes, rebalance on stability, and continue to grow. The market has absolutely priced in tax hikes and new regulations. Biden was on the campaign trail in mid 2020 telling dinner-plate fundraisers that he was going to raise their taxes.

VT isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcertainly much better‚Äù than VTI, and it‚Äôs pure speculation to assume it is. VTI is up over 70% in the last year, VT around 50. VT has never long-term outperformed it. Over the last 3 months, VTI is up about 7%. VT is at under 5.5%.

Your entire post is pure speculation but you submit it very confidently. VT is great to have in a portfolio as a minority holding, and it‚Äôs possible that emerging markets pick up steam over the coming decades, but there‚Äôs no evidence that they outperform the US. Tax hikes and regulation may put a dent in it, but it‚Äôs speculative to think that it‚Äôs a serious dent."

I‚Äôll heed your advice. I am aware that‚Äôs not the only factor. I should have phrased differently. My concern is the hardware requirements.

I‚Äôll happily take any criticism or resources."
03/27/2021,stocks,">As a serious follow up question, do you not see onboard systems being a limiting factor for an FSD?

Potentially, but given the state of self-driving this doesn't seem to be the issue holding everyone back.

I'd expect that if compute within the vehicle was a significant problem, we'd have at least seen a *prototype* EV with a very short range and a massive computer on board. Sure, it wouldn't be possible to bring that to market, but we could at least point to a single car and say 'yes, FSD is completely possible'. Instead we have several systems that each have their own limitations.

This is indicative of the complexity involved in creating several algorithms that all contribute to the decision making process. Seamlessly blending micro and macro level decision making processes that encompass every scenario is proving to be very difficult. As an example, we have good micro level decision making with lane assist, adaptive cruise control, etc. We also have good macro level decision making with google maps, waze, etc. But, the step where we need them both to work together has been a struggle for everyone since self-driving in city streets has been difficult. This is further exasperated by edge cases.

Lets say we have a car that does effectively blend *most* micro and macro decision making processes together (probably the current state of google's car). We still haven't defined how should the car should behave when one or more of its systems either can't be relied on or is unwittingly providing bad information. The macro system is saying turn left but they just repainted the road and got rid of that turn. Now what? Do we still follow the macro system's guidance? If not, we need some other system that sits between the micro (very short term decisions) and macro level (very long term decisions) systems to take over and provide mid term guidance on how to best proceed when one or more underlying systems can't be relied on.

Up to this point we have discussed three systems (short, mid, long term decision making), but there are multiple ML systems under each of those decision making processes. We need multiple computer vision classifiers for identifying traffic signs, traffic lights, lines on the road, arrows on the road. We need an inference process to determine if that particular signal applies to our lane or the next lane over. We need an inference process to categorize that sign, signal, arrow into something meaningful for our system (is there a sign? Yes. what type of sign is it? yield sign. Does it apply to our car? No. If we move one lane to the right does it apply to us? Yes.). We need a system that determines how centered we are in our lane and correct when it is above a certain threshold (keep in mind we need a mechanism to ignore this stimuli when we are knowingly changing lanes). For LIDAR systems, we have this same situation. We need to identify where the objects are in the world around us. We need to categorize what the object is so we know what to expect as we approach it. We need a system that identifies when a sensor is malfunctioning so that we don't give bad inputs to our end-to-end decision making process (mud or snow on a LIDAR sensor could make our car think it needs to slam on the brakes immediately). These are just a *few* of the tasks that ML algos need to do as they pull data directly from sensors. Ultimately their signals feed into the micro level decision making process that combines all of the stimuli and makes short term decisions on how to drive. The complexity from an AI/ML perspective is colossal.

To come full circle, if a company had solved all of the complexity mentioned above, in addition to all edge cases, we'd have seen a prototype of it. Google is absolutely no stranger to literally throwing tens of millions of dollars at compute just for **academic** research. It goes without saying that they'd find a way to get enough compute into a car if compute was the concern.

This is usually done in high-tech harbours with multi-million euro worth of equipment. Think about doing that in the middle of nowhere in the desert with a crane operated from a ship. 

I am thinking that, the stock price of Evergreen Marine, the company owning the ship, could plummet in the next weeks. This could happen, when it becomes clear this isn't going to dissolve overnight, and maybe the desicions made were careless to command the ship under the conditions  thorugh the canal. This could open a lot of lawcases for compensation against Evergreen Marine.   


The questions is by what magnitude would the stock price go down. Is it comparable to deepwater horizon and BP or for example Fukushima and Tepco?   


Also of course, the 10 billion $ going through each day aren't going to vanish in thin air. Still, there is also life stock or other consumables on board of the ships waiting in line, which cannot just wait some weeks in the canal or take the scenic route around Africa."

03/27/2021,stocks,What does ESG stand for?
03/27/2021,stocks,"Sorry to hear about you're mother. I hope you're doing ok.

Having some cash reserved is a great idea. Emergency fund, big purchases etc. 

As for investing personally I would put some in to funds which hold a good amount of companies in different markets.

And then I'd hand select some companies in fields such as tech, green energy, finances and gaming. 
Try to pick companies which you would feel comfortable holding for 10-15 years.

I'd probably allocate around 80 - 90% of your portfolio to these two strats.

Then I'd use the remaining 10-20% to keep some cash reserved for averaging down stocks which may dip a little and use some for some riskier trades on smaller upcoming companies."

03/27/2021,stocks,GM also had a partnership with Nikola....
03/27/2021,stocks,"Yes it HAD a partnership. So since Lordstown is a scam like Nikola please tell me when GM pulled their partnership?? Oh wait they didn't because Lordstowns a real company thats gonna dominate and GM knows. I'm guessing you haven't done any DD on Lordstown, and it shows."
03/27/2021,stocks,Weird that China wants to split it up
03/27/2021,stocks,So your argument is they buy american tech lol
03/27/2021,stocks,"Lol my argument is that the Chinese companies got more cash to throw it ur face. And any usa company 

Lol and I see u didn‚Äôt answer my question. Deny all u want, u know u lost. And u keep avoiding my question too about u know jack shit about China, what a liar u are. I see u avoiding little man. 

Why did trump ban tik tok and huawei. Is the usa scared of Chinese tech? Why can usa ban China tech and not China ban usa??? Huh Hypocrite

The more u talk, the dumber u get."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Tik tok was never banned. Huawei was banned because they want to control who is spying on us. Your best argument is one company that made a popular app internationally (is there a single other example?) and one company that was banned from building infrastructure in certain places. I can still buy a huawei phone in the US, and use tiktok.

But china knows they will lose in every market if they allow western tech companies to come compete there, so they block them all to create a safe space for them to grow"
03/27/2021,stocks,"U bro a hyprocrite, taking double standards. if tik tok isn‚Äôt banned, then why did trump try to block it and WeChat. U hiding the point that both usa and China don‚Äôt want each other companies in their countries as it will control their whole infrastructure. But u basically saying china should let Google and amazon come in China and make usa the biggest pie in the world.... U‚Äôre a hypocrite. Cause u can‚Äôt buy Huawei at retail, it‚Äôs all third party sold. Go to Best Buy, and target to buy one and I call u smart.."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Trump tried to block it because hes an idiot. But its rich that your best argument is a moron trying to block two apps compared to china blocking everything except i guess bing, which still manages to be one of if not the best search engines in china lol."
03/27/2021,stocks,"Lol, then why did usa ban China tech? Wouldn‚Äôt u want to answer that question? Double standards"
03/27/2021,stocks,Yeah your right. Banning one company from doing one thing is totally the same as banning everyone from doing anything lol
03/27/2021,stocks,"lol of course i'm right. how you know it's banning one company, did i say that?

It's multiple fool. ANSWER the question, double standards or what, if not, stfu

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/technology/china-app-ban.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/technology/china-app-ban.html)"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Except none of that actually went through. As far as im aware the only thing blocked right now is huawei building 5g infrastructure in the US. 

But honestly, i say embrace the double standard. Lets see how strong china's economy would be if we blocked all their apps and and people from selling products and services in the US. Half of amazon's 3rd party sellers would be bankrupt overnight, or would have to seek US partners to start working with.

Tiktok would get sold to a US company, or else an unblocked rival would overtake them internationally. Tencent and alibaba wouldnt give a fuck, though it would become much more difficult to talk to friends and family in china without wechat."
03/27/2021,stocks,"It went through but no one in the usa willingly to implement it cause they scared it will break their business. U fooling urself, if u think the usa got power to ban China, basically telling everyone‚Äôs 401k to go bye bye. 

 Lol üòÇ seek usa partners to buy products. Tell that to buyers to pay 2x and 3x the prices. Tell the sellers to make less margin and pay less taxes. You make it sound so easy which the economy is linked together. Aka common sense. 

Tencent and baba isn‚Äôt only a messenger like fb messenger, if actually been to China which I know u having, it‚Äôs a cashless payment system. Already pass usa on that

Doesn‚Äôt matter if tik tok gets sold. It‚Äôs app is a just core, the richness is the code lol and tik tok isn‚Äôt even making any money cause it‚Äôs not the real tik tok. The real tik tok has in real time purchase capabilities"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Well im getting bored of this, you are either not american, 10 years old, or illiterate but its been fun lol"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Then stop talking bro lol did I put a gun on ur head. Lol how u know I‚Äôm not American? U assuming. Always making assumptions. No one wants to hear ur opinion, u don‚Äôt even have any credibility. U nobody, just another person making their opinion on the net. Pretty funny too, speaking to a low class"
03/27/2021,stocks,"I didnt say you werent american lol. But if you arent you must be either illiterate or a child, because your english is terrible. But you sound like a chinese troll, so that would be my guess"
03/27/2021,stocks,"Lol guess so. I don‚Äôt even give a shit. As long as I have cash, u can say all u want man üòÇ"

High level executives move around all the time. Aren't you concerned that half the board also just announced they're leaving?"
03/27/2021,stocks,The old board members are leaving lol
03/27/2021,stocks,"Correct - they were not expected to leave, per the filing. This is new information. Including Reggie (who back when he joined everyone was like ""this is great for GameStop!"" but now that he's leaving and it could be bad for the groupthink narrative gets nary a mention)"
03/27/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm more interested in the new board members coming in. All them have a better experience set for 2021 then the old board. They know how to form a e-commerce hint coming from both chewy and amazon
03/27/2021,stocks,"That may very well be the case. But if half of the board unexpectedly leaving causes a group of people to say ""HELL YEAH GREAT SIGN!"" it should give you pause as to how bought in that group of people are. It's naive and ignorant at best."

03/27/2021,stocks,And then it sinked to the bottom. Will ever come back up again?
03/27/2021,stocks,Yes but not likely for another year until their liquid biopsy is out. In the meantime I‚Äôm moving elsewhere as shorts will murder it for at least a few months.

03/27/2021,stocks,"It isn't about nececarrily ""wanting"" your internal businesses to look more profitable, but when one internal department saves x amount of money for another department, you *do* need to figure out how you are going to record those savings on the books.

If internal company A saves internal company B 10 million/year, do you...

1) make Company B look 10 million more profitable? That *is* what happened, right? Their expenses were reduced by 10 million, so they get the profit on their records.

2) make Company A look 10 million more profitable? After all, it was *their* work that saved the money, they should get credit for it, right?

3) split the difference In some way?

The savings happened, and so now internal politics and negotiations need to happen to determine how those savings get recorded in the books."

What worries me is they have no gaap reports"
03/27/2021,stocks,"It actually found a bottom around 17 bucks and was trending upwards again til the news hit. It is a multi-billion dollar company and it is way under-valued now honestly. The reason I posted is to gauge exactly what you said...how much China will screw them and how much people are just scared. Anyways I double my position...whatever. No way it does not go up over the years. Average is now 13 bucks, which would still be undervalued. Thanks for your input. I got over and threw money at it. I posted when it was at like 12 bucks.

03/27/2021,stocks,"I agree. For example, how many of PTON's competitors had instructors were in Super Bowl ads? The content and subs business is what's interesting about PTON long-term and they've got a big lead there. The hardware is the razor, the subscription is the razor blade."
