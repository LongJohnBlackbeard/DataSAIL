03/20/2021,stocks,Weed isn‚Äôt legal globally EV is. There‚Äôs so many difference this seems like a silly comparison. EV‚Äôs may be over valued but a correlation to weed stocks makes no sense.

03/20/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt see how their too far off though. Both have been ran on significant amounts of hype. Obviously completely different industries, but valuations are pretty similar."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Many of these untested EV companies will fail because most people will buy EV from the dealer they got their ICE: GM, Ford, Toyota, VW, Porsche, Audi, etc. 

As for the charging stations, they‚Äôll be needed where people drive long distances or travel a lot. Even though I‚Äôd probably do most of my charging at home, I wouldn‚Äôt buy an EV without the charging infrastructure. We drive out of state to see family twice a year and we also drive long distances for long weekends."
03/20/2021,stocks,"The difference is there is more substance to the ev hype. Plus cannabis will still rocket long term in my opinion it just hasnt yet. Black market is killing the legal cannabis industry and will continue to eat profits until it is federal legal, dispensaries can use banks, and weed becomes cheaper to buy from a dispensary."

03/20/2021,stocks,5 years?  VOO or FNILX.  Those are low expense (or no expense) weighted S&P500 funds.

03/20/2021,stocks,No such thing as a safe stock. We could have a bear market in five years. Can‚Äôt predict the future. If you need the money in only 5 years for a down payment on a house or something then put it in bonds. If you don‚Äôt absolutely need the money in 5 years then there‚Äôs good recommendations in all the comments

Stock might be undervalued but I feel that market style doesnt have a lot of growth potential. With goods becoming dirt cheap, I personally never have an incentive to buy used goods of those types. I'll buy used tools and games, that's about it. The discount just isnt steep enough to justify buying a used jacket, bedding, or a lamp."

Due to its market cap, it‚Äôs going to be a top holding in a broad index fund like VOO; however, it‚Äôs only going to be around 1.3% of the total weight. Whether to allocate more to it depends on your various objectives and risk tolerance, and those are questions only you can answer. In my view, the main reason not to own it is if you have a better reason or reasons in favor of other things, and there could be many of those.

Disclosure : I hold Pltr 
The thing that worries me about Pltr is that it‚Äôs basically a consulting company using tech. Usually, the stock growth of consulting companies are much much lower compared to tech.( Because of economics of scale) 

And the way I understand it, Pltr builds the software in a unique manner for each individual client using the help of experts in the field. They take a significant amount of time to build a software for each client and have to constantly hire experts for each varying project. 

Even if this software can analyze a lot of data, it just seems to me like a consulting company with a few more steps.

Same with Microsoft. If noone wants it, it's just a pointless list of zeros.
That said, Microsoft isn't just a stock; it's got massive amounts of inventory, contacts, contracts, logistic networks,  IP, etc. If it collapsed, that would all be liquidated and debts paid to people in order.

There might be some cases where a company has negative value die to debts, in that case the stock could really become worthless. However, that is typically just a bankrupty case and does not come out of thin air."
03/20/2021,stocks,Can‚Äôt sell them if no one is buying. So it‚Äôs impossible for literally no one to hold the stock. But if everyone sold at once it‚Äôs a reverse bidding war to the bottom.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Not possible.  Their needs to be equilibrium between buyers and sellers.   That's why I have to explain to my communist friends that the stock market can't ever go to ""zero"".   There is always a price a buyer is willing to pay."
03/20/2021,stocks,So I guess having 10% of my portfolio in MSFT is ok? üòÜ I'm in at 202 basis though.
03/20/2021,stocks,üòÜ.  Maybe I'll pick up a few shares if it happens.
03/20/2021,stocks,Microsoft doesn't use or need the market value of their shares?  They'd survive fine without any help from the outstanding shares?
03/20/2021,stocks,So msft is not going too low anytime soon? üòÜ
03/20/2021,stocks,"to your point about gold, thats something Gene Rodenbery wrote into startrek, they could replicate it and it became worthless as a commodity so it's like copper to us right now, we still need it and use it but you're not exactly going to store your net worth in copper."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You technically need 1 share to change hands for the price to change, though, right? So the ""price"" might stay the same at $230ish, with the Ask going down very low, and if there were literally no buyers, there would be no Bid. But then as soon as someone buys a share, the price is whatever they bought it at. $10 or whatever."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Would msft buy them back I mean?  If there were no other buyers?

I don't see how that would benefit them though.

By the way.

When a company ""buys back"" shares they don't literally buy them do they?  I mean they don't have to use their free cash to buy them?

I heard that they just reduce the amount of outstanding shares?"
03/20/2021,stocks,So I'll never lose ALL my money? üòÜ
03/20/2021,stocks,10% of your portfolio in any one company is a lot in my opinion. But the odds of seeing it plummet drastically and stay down are pretty low so I'd say you should be safe on it hitting zero...I just might think about transferring that 10% to a fund that is Microsoft heavy...as an example I've only got about 20% of my total portfolio in individual stocks. And even then we are talking split up over probably 40ish different companies...so...essentially I made up my own fund that I manage with that 20%.
03/20/2021,stocks,Exactly. Scarcity will be gone when in space. Ultra-stable gold will be abundant in huge asteroids... Then we can just replicate it
03/20/2021,stocks,"With the exception of bankruptcy- even then there will be money paid to creditors during liquidation.   But for good companies or a whole index (SP500), you can't lose it all üòÄ  And if the markets tanked for a long period - you'd have bigger issues in the world going on."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes but even the sp500 has about 5% in msft I think.  QQQ has 10% in MSFT.  I literally have under 6000 in msft so I'm sure people have hundreds of thousands in msft even with index funds.  So they have a lot more exposure than I do.

I'm about 80% individual stocks with only 20 by the way.  So far I got a 25% return my first year investing but I've pulled back a few thousand cause of the tech selloff.

18% of my portfolio is in aapl and msft.

I may be limiting growth for my portfolio a bit though, but I think MSFT will keep going higher over the years.  But the other parts of my portfolio may catch up and I won't have to trim."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt mean to pepper you with questions but Nat Gas is so volatile. 

Are they purely shippers or do they own terminals?  Does either company have long term contracts in place? What markets do they primarily ship from and to? 

Which one do you like best?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Another question to add, how will they be affected by the pipeline from Russia to Germany, which is nearly finished?"

03/20/2021,stocks,Bet on the future... bet on Uranium.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your write up, OP. Green tech's certainly the future. What company do you think will get scooped up for sourcing uranium for the UK Nuclear space shuttle project with Rolls Royce?

Edit: wow! Thanks for the award!!"
03/20/2021,stocks,Good uranium stocks to buy now or on a next dip?
03/20/2021,stocks,"While it is not directly directed to the uranium macro thesis (your thread), 


I do have some questions? Do you know CanAlaska from inside and out? And do you understand their potential bc of their equipment and modelings?

Bc to me it looks like almost certain they have a 200+ million lbs deposit just a few drillings away xD

Edit: They also never go into production*, so that they can make highest returns. Lol, if they are successful, also... exploration is a question of high persistence and experience and confidence...

Edit2: Sorry, I mean: development."

03/20/2021,stocks,Buy the dip.
03/20/2021,stocks,Great pick
03/20/2021,stocks,"Relatively risky jurisdiction, decent early stage cashflow, good plan and tier 2 deposit."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Cheers! I would stick to the front end of the fuel cycle to be honest, that will have the most leverage.

If you insist on taking it directly to the power plants, RR is not a bad bet."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Saving my 4 sample portfolios for my newsletter, but I will say that at this stage in the bull market any dip should be bought. I loaded up last year, but I would welcome a 50% or bigger drop to buy more."
03/20/2021,stocks,"CanAlaska is a high risk high reward exploration play and from my research and communication with the company I have concluded that yes, they might be standing on a giant deposit. I will probably do a company analysis on the newsletter.

That being said, exploration is risky and you never know what you are going to get."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Decent assets, shady company, serial dilution"

03/20/2021,stocks,"I think a company analysis is not the right thing here, I think we have to understand the real risk of the West McArthur exploration.

03/20/2021,stocks,How do you think are the odds? 95% success chance? üßê
03/20/2021,stocks,I think 60/40 is more realistic
03/20/2021,stocks,How do you come up with that actually?
03/20/2021,stocks,"Seeing as they already have had some success and are drilling in the right geographical location, that makes them a 50/50 in my book. The location being close to an already existing mine of good quality? Add another 10%.

This is all my own model, so other people might have different numbers."
03/20/2021,stocks,"To me it is not one of the random ‚Äûjust a step from the major discovery‚Äú away, but to justify my numbers I‚Äòd have to look up that one certain equipment xD bc it‚Äòs this time is a unusual high probability for a exploration to find the major discovery."
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you‚Äôve done your DD and truly believe in the company, and don‚Äôt need the money, stick it out or even average down at the lower prices. The stock market is generally a slow and steady race. If you‚Äôve bet wrong and you don‚Äôt foresee any catalysts on the horizon, get out. Especially if you bought way too high on some SPAC or IPO."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Reassess. Has anything changed? If not, hold. If so (eg: competitor came out with product first), ask yourself if you would buy that stock today at the current price. If the answer is no, maybe sell."
03/20/2021,stocks,Average down
03/20/2021,stocks,"I guess the thing to do is to ask yourself why the stock is down so much in the first place. Is the potential for future growth just not there? Or was it overvalued from the beginning? A lot of speculative stocks are getting crushed right now and I'm assuming yours probably got caught up in that.

If you still have high conviction in the company then just hold on and maybe average down when you can. Diamond hands baby."
03/20/2021,stocks,Cry into my whiskey glass until I‚Äôm back in the green
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have a play that I'm in long, but currently down -35%. Ouch. Maybe it's the same play! I've already DCA'd, it keeps on dropping, but I'm done throwing money at it because the portfolio allocation of this play is way too high now, there isn't much money left, and other plays need attention too. The good news is, it's a solid company with a price target well above my average, so it should be all good in time. Just overvalued when I bought so it's a learning lesson. I'd say hold and reassess at the end of the year."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Unless you think the company is going under, just forget about it for a while."
03/20/2021,stocks,Sell your losers and keep your winners
03/20/2021,stocks,Sell ntm or Otm covered calls
03/20/2021,stocks,Conviction is good but we‚Äôre not perfect stock pickers. Admitting that you were wrong or misled is important. Cutting losses is part of the deal.
03/20/2021,stocks,"What are a few of your ‚Äúboring‚Äù ETFs? I‚Äôm looking to invest in a few to diversify my retirement outside of my 401k that I can‚Äôt touch before 59, so I‚Äôm looking for some ETFs to put some money in. Right now I just have ARKF"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have a stock that I own that I did my research on and projected their price target at 10 years (my holding period). It‚Äôs currently down roughly 8%, but I‚Äôm holding because of my research. I make my investments for the long term. I would DCA down, but I don‚Äôt really have cash on hand which is tragic. 

Short term bumps don‚Äôt mean much unless they have a material impact. If you think something has a material impact on your projection, then you re-evaluate and make a decision to either sell, hold or DCA down."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Well without knowing the stock particularly hard to say. Just beings down is meaningless doesn‚Äôt mean your right or wrong. Opposite is true as well. Unless your doing shorter term trading then it‚Äôs a different ballgame. A company can be mis priced for years, if it‚Äôs successful and will continue to be over the next 5 years and it‚Äôs price isn‚Äôt ridiculous keep holding. Look at Apple same company a few years back it was looked at with scorn had a low p/e then the script flipped and now the stock explodes far faster than the earnings. I think it tripled roughly in a short time frame. It was probably an overreaction now it‚Äôs finding an equilibrium. Long story short if it‚Äôs a good company keep holding if you think you made a mistake and it‚Äôs not long term hold (bad management decisions, decreasing revenue or revenue growth in some cases) leave. Don‚Äôt worry about the is it up or down in a shorter time frame. Most of the times my conviction stocks dipped 20-40% ended up being the best possible time to add."
03/20/2021,stocks,I would hold at least a few more weeks as the stimmy money drips in. Maybe that will give them a pop. If not reassess if you still like it average down. If you don‚Äôt like it cut that shit free
03/20/2021,stocks,its called bagholding - if you hold any stock for long enough youll eventually be ITM
03/20/2021,stocks,EZ... Hodl!
03/20/2021,stocks,Thank you. I do have one that SPAC that I bought at $13 and it is now at $11. I am holding this one - like the company and $11 is so close to $10... only 10% possible downside at this point.
03/20/2021,stocks,Lol. That‚Äôs where I am at right now. I figure I am up $5k. I have a little more than that invested in these idiot stocks. So even if they all disappear I will not be that much behind. But then if I sell them all now I will keep my $5k and feel good about myself... sometimes looking at your portfolio and seeing -30% on some investments is just sad üòÇ
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have the following ETFs or their mutual fund equivalents when ETF is not available. 

1.  VTI and VOO, although they are almost identical. Will be getting out of one and consolidating. VTI has 5% outside of VOO so slightly more diversified. So both are essentially S&P 500 funds. About 50 % of my  total portfolio. 

2. VXUS - Vanguard international fund about 5% but will increase over this year. Trying to slowly build it up to 15-20% of my total allocation. 

3.  VXF - vanguard extended market, so essentially all small and mid size companies that are outside of S&P 500. About 30% here. 

I am also looking at SCHD not necessarily for dividend but to get some exposure to other (non-tech) companies but haven‚Äôt bought it yet. I might move some of my VOO or VTI into SCHD or some cash I am holding waiting for crash but it isn‚Äôt coming so I am getting impatient :).  But I haven‚Äôt decided for sure. 

I think these four are quite vanilla, long-term ones. I don‚Äôt even check my 401k ever. It does what it does."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Not true at all, numerous never recover from their peaks, some even go bankrupt and you lose everything."
03/20/2021,stocks,This is an adorably unhelpful and incorrect answer.

03/20/2021,stocks,Not after merger so just be careful
03/20/2021,stocks,"Oh also!  I forgot to mention - I am looking at VIS as well. Vanguard industrials. Obviously totally different mix and might be a good way to diversify away from heavy tech, but haven‚Äôt moved on this one either yet."
03/20/2021,stocks,Thanks! I was thinking about investing in VTI
03/20/2021,stocks,I stand corrected - guess I meant long term investment
03/20/2021,stocks,Yes. I am hoping for a little spike after the merger but who knows.
03/20/2021,stocks,1 is a weird number. I don't often see stocks with a P/E of 1. Most things seem to be 20+ (possibly overvalued) or -100 (speculative) right now.
03/20/2021,stocks,"This sounds suspiciously like a ""This time it is different"" post.  History shows those posts are inevitably incorrect."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt even really look at PE. If I am buying a long term stock, I look at ‚Äúfuture‚Äù EPS growth. Along with future revenue growth."

03/20/2021,stocks,"US treasury bonds are extremely safe. You will get a pretty much guaranteed return on your investment. That being said, young people don‚Äôt need to buy these really as they can be more growth orientated. Bonds can be good for people who are near retirement."
03/20/2021,stocks,Bonds are for people near retirement who don't want volatility. If your younger avoid them
03/20/2021,stocks,I outsourced my bond holdings by buying Bond ETFs. They provide solid monthly income which I pour into stocks and make my portfolio look balanced.  A Bond ETF is like a basket of bonds wrapped in a nice stock bow. Good diversification I like to think.
03/20/2021,stocks,"You can also add in duration risk in there. One reason to buy stocks is that companies are literally telling you that they will buy their own stocks with some amount of their cashflow through buybacks. In the same way, the government is also telling you that during economic crises, they will reduce rates and buy tons of government bonds. This greatly affects the value of long duration bonds because they will be cheaper when rates are higher and spike in value when the fed reduces interest rates. If you had some TLT in march for example, you wouldn't be too worried about your portfolio because you would have actually made money from these bonds and would be looking for good opportunities to buy cheaper stocks. Long duration bonds are also a bet on the possibility of the US following Europe or Japan towards negative interest rates."
03/20/2021,stocks,"My parents are multimillionaires and are currently in 70% bonds.

03/20/2021,stocks,"They don't know what they are talking about, they are just guessing.  That analyst industry is a fake.   If they really knew what the stock was going to do in the future, they would keep it a secret and put their life savings and leverage to the hilt to make a profit.

Instead, they know their information will move a stock price, so they buy or short before their announcement."
03/20/2021,stocks,So if they actually have ‚Äúthe‚Äù stock why not announce it with their platform to increase the volume and demand? Genuinely curious.
03/20/2021,stocks,"That's the scam they tell their relatives I'm going to make an announcement on stock x next month that will push the price in y direction.   Buy are short the stock now so you are in a profit position when the announcement is released.

03/20/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt have stock picks, but make sure you have a good understandinn of the difference between speculating and investing. When I was new, I didn‚Äôt know the difference, and I almost made a really bad mistake of putting all my money into a speculative stock. Speculative stocks are stocks that are expected to go up based on what they have planned for the future. Theyre often not profitable yet. Examples would be Virgin Galactic, Draftkings, Pot stocks such as Aurora Cannabis, and Canopy Growth, and electric vehicle stocks such as Nio, Xpeng, Fisker, Lucid Motors. 
Examples of investments, which are stocks with value based on a proven track record and expectation of continuing to be a great company, would be Apple, Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, Verizon, Coca Cola.

If you go online and ask people what stocks to invest in, a lot of people will give you speculative companies. Keep your speculating limited to a small percentage of your portfolio

And if you wanna know why speculating is dangerous, just look at Nikola and Workhorse. Nikola went from $10 to $90 cause people thought they were gonna be an awesome hydrogen vehicle company, and then it crashed hard. Workhorse went from being a penny stock to being a $40 stock, and then back down to its current price of $16 because people thought they were gonna get a contract with USPS, and then the deal fell through"

03/20/2021,stocks,"Disclaimer: This is MY prefered method. I love it and it has worked amazingly well for me. With that said; this is absolutely not guaranteed to work all the time. Do the following at your own risk, it's your money and I am not going to be held accountable for losses.

If you're feeling adventurous then i'd recommend buying bull/bear certificates with leverage, preferably for Nasdaq.

If you find a bear/bull certificate pair with a, let's say, x20 multiplier, then wait until the market opens, buy the one that is trending and watch it grow. Sell when you have earned a 10-20% profit and NEVER leave it past closing time. This is a day-to-day thing. Not long term investment. Some days crash, but most succeed.

Settling with 10% is fine and with 10% daily (in an ideal world) you'll be at $161 at 5 days in, $259 after two weeks, $672 after a month, and so on. 

There is no such thing as perfect trading, but if you where to pull it off you'll be at $30,448 after 3 months."

03/20/2021,stocks,"If you're gonna use the $100 to learn about stocks and don't expect much of a return, there are a few different approaches you can take.

* Invest in something mainstream (such as an S&P 500 index ETF) and never touch it again. [Dead people are the best investors](https://theconservativeincomeinvestor.com/fidelitys-best-investors-are-dead/) because they don't mess around with their investments. $100 with [13.6% annual return](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-stock-market-return) ends up at $1281 after 20 years.
* If you'd prefer to get individual stocks so you can pick and chose companies and sectors and take a more economics oriented approach, research what it means for a stock to have growth potential. Earnings, projections, dividends, cashflow, etc. Read up on all the [SEC filings](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/08/sec-forms.asp) the companies of interest have and decide from there if they're worth investing in. Your goal is to beat 13.6% return. 
* Do the ""buy low / sell high"" thing and try to time the market. Good way to learn about stocks, bad way to build up money. Most people are really bad at this - they buy *after* a stock has risen due to exciting news, then sell *after* a stock drops because of bad news. All they're doing is locking in losses. But you can give it a try, see how good you are actually at it.
* Gamble. This gets into stuff I'm really not familiar with, like options and derivatives. You have a good chance of reducing your money to $0 but who knows, you could also hit it big. Kinda like lotto scratch-offs far as I can tell.

You can get really involved in this process - for example, every time you purchase a stock have a defined [exit strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exitstrategy.asp) that involves a set time frame and set price increase, and also [hedge against losses](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/hedging-beginners-guide/) every time you make a trade. This can help you avoid the buy high / sell low emotional part of trading."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Good for you - great opportunity to learn about the market.  What timeframe do you want to hold the investment? My whole investing strategy between day trades,  intermediate (days to months) and going long (years) is completely different.  Keep in mind - day trading a hundred bucks is not productive.  

In general, most people look for a good company or a good fund or even an index that's going thru a rough patch.  An example a year ago was airlines and oil.  Now it's technology (excluding pandemic stocks).  Watch out for dollar stocks, they move fast - often in the wrong direction.  

Also, remember, all stock track the larger index funds, or commodity prices (like oil), or move opposite of interest rates.  So don't fight that.  

Good luck."

03/20/2021,stocks,"This is actually great and congrats on you becoming interested in investing (not gambling). Since you have a small amount of capital I would suggest one stock since it isn't too much. However, in this situation, I would take it as a learning experience. Try splitting it into 4 stocks (assuming no transaction fees). One, do some research on a stock and come to a conclusion of why you should buy or not buy a stock, and until you find a worthy one buy it. Do this for a lower cap stock and one large, relatively stable large-cap stock. Next, put 1 stock in an index and leave it. The other stock, feel free to take some risk and be a bit speculative.

Disclaimer: I am only suggesting the last suggestion stock because this is a learning experience and you will see that many of the times, a passive investment strategy outperforms an active strategy. In reality, you never want to put a big portion of your money in speculative stocks. You will also learn about volatility with individual stocks and the volatility from smaller cap stocks."

Also become an excell god generally . That's not a book"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Because over the course of your entire life, $100 (in 2021 dollars) is basically $0. I think of it as risking capital of immaterial value, so what do I care about how much risk I'm bearing on that? Might as well max out the upside, since the downside loss of $100 is, as mentioned earlier, a drop in the bucket that won't move the needle on your lifelong financial trajectory.

Might as well take the the win/loss coinflip of either (a) beating earnings and you cash out or (b) having a disappointing conference call and those options expire worthless. Option (b) isn't going to make you financially destitute. But if you don't roll a 7 and crap out, you reap the realized gains from option (a) which are nice, but not life changing by any means.

Moral of the story here is that $100 of contributed capital into SPY isn't going to move your retirement date up by 5 years, so you've sort of got the greenlight to gamble with it if you so choose."

Since it's $100, if it were me personally I'd put it into one company / stock that I feel will do well over the next year / few years and then track its progress. This way you can develop a stronger understanding of how different world events affect the stock + what kind of things are likely to affect stock prices. I'd start diversifying once I got some more capital to put in (probably once the total amount of money I'm working with is $350 or $400).

03/20/2021,stocks,"Again ... ignorant... his grandpa gave him 100 for the stocks. Not for anything else. Not only is it not his 100 to begin with, the 100 was given for a dedicated purpose. If you can't be supportive, fuck off! ""If all I had was 100$ to invest...."" get out of here with that shit. It appears to be a learning opportunity more then anything and OP is trying to do just that."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Just not seeing what the big deal is. My grandpa wants to give me $100 to invest in and have a good time. We aren‚Äôt looking to get rich, and it‚Äôs $100. If we lose we lose, not like it‚Äôs that big of deal. Geez! What a sub!!!"

03/20/2021,stocks,He asked for a specific advice. You ventured off making it about you...... if you were not capable of answering his question why even try ?
03/20/2021,stocks,Your mentality is toxic.
03/20/2021,stocks,"All you have demonstrated is that you are not a good trader. You clearly have been out enough cash to try and ""help"" someone by making the same mistake. I'm sure your intentions were .... well? But if you fail at something doesn't mean everyone else will and instead of being negative, take this as an opportunity to learn? You don't have to remain down, but don't drag others with you dude. Selfish really. You should want others to succeed. Not ""if I can't do it you can't do it"" 100 bucks won't yield the most significant return sure but it could still make money and that's the purpose. To see if he can or can't."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Heard a lot. Of recommendations on Cameron Stewart, thank you for the advice"
03/20/2021,stocks,I hated fidelity's website. Currently using TD Ameritrade and having a much better experience.
03/20/2021,stocks,I use fidelity and it seems good. I guess it depends what you like about RH or what you feel it‚Äôs missing. If your goal is buy low/sell high i think it‚Äôs a fine site. I don‚Äôt do options.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Selling Amazon stock would mean you need to pay tax on the gains. If you don‚Äôt need the liquidity, i would suggest just transferring. Your plan for the other stock seems fine.

Regarding fidelity website, it‚Äôs not the best but their support and ability to save your money on order flows is really good. I have been using them for over 10 years and will definitely recommend them."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Been using E*TRADE for 10 years. Always advised against RobinHood, and E*TRADE only pissed me off twice, but both times were due to slow response time from the servers, but I guess that can happen with any of them."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Fidelity and vanguard both have crap sites.  Fidelity has a trading software and their app is slightly better.   They‚Äôve committed to making a better website for people coming from alternative brokers, but not sure of when they‚Äôll fulfill that promise.

Try using active trader with fidelity and things are a bit nicer.   It‚Äôs a good brokerage, I use it for my buy and hold portfolio.   For active trading I prefer Ibkr or think or swim (TD Ameritrade)."
03/20/2021,stocks,I personally switched to Fidelity and hate the site as well. I use a stock screener with transaction tracker to watch my portfolio but have to say fidelity is nice. Prefer them over Schwab.
03/20/2021,stocks,I like fidelity but it's not as intuitive as td ameritrade. It offers other features I like though. Td sometimes doesn't letty me trade the other types of stocks (don't know how to say without triggering bots) and let's me get fractional shares of some.of the expensive stocks. Plus I have their cash back card and can invest rewards in stocks
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have 401k accounts with Fidelity and Schwab. They are fine. Schwab let's you even do some covered calls and simple option buying. 

My after tax/play money account is with ALLY. Their website is fine, quick money transfers and pretty low margin rates. I only use their app on my phone when i'm traveling or golfing or something.  It took some getting used to but you can close positions."
03/20/2021,stocks,"1) wait for your options on GameStop to finish before transferring 

2) fidelity is more complicated and the UI is difficult for newbies, but when you get used to it it‚Äôs so much better. You have more control. 

3) you get FAR BETTER prices on options in fidelity. Far better == more profit. 


Wait to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù until after GameStop fiasco, but Most certainly leave RH"
03/20/2021,stocks,Use Fidelity Active Pro instead of the website
03/20/2021,stocks,I used TD Waterhouse 20 years ago before the merger and liked it and am sure it is probably good. Lost a lot of money on there when I was in my 20's and was going all or nothing. Had a lot of fun doing it. Just not sure I want the hassle of opening yet another account.
03/20/2021,stocks,"My goal is about 75% long holds and 25% to actively buy and sell. Maybe Fidelity for my long-term and margin and Robinhood still for my active trading? I am concerned with the recent news on them, but it is just such a simple interface and I like that. If I want to do a lot of trades I want it to be simple."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Haven't checked them out, I will take a look. Thank you."
03/20/2021,stocks,Just downloaded Active Trader. I think I could get used to that. Thank you for the info!
03/20/2021,stocks,Vanguard just released a Beta app called Beacon. Is it improving more and more.
03/20/2021,stocks,"That sounds like what I will end up doing. I have heard good things about think or swim, isn't that Schwab? I did not know about Fidelity trading software, I will look into that. Thank you."
03/20/2021,stocks,Depends what you go by to figure out what to buy i know the pages have their hot stocks and hot stocks on our sites tips etc. i notice webull also shows price targets on it and the buy sell hold if you trust it
03/20/2021,stocks,"Consider an IRA for the short term stuff if you don‚Äôt mind those rules, it might help for the cap gains and all that if you aren‚Äôt touching the money."
03/20/2021,stocks,"No problem! I also like the way Think Or Swim platform looks and have been meaning to check it out, but can‚Äôt say much more than that. So my opinion is a bit biased towards E*TRADE just because I ended up getting used to it. Checked out IBKR at one point but just feels/looks cheap. With recent comments from IBKR CEO defending stopping buying certain stocks was a nail in the coffin in my opinion. So bottom line: go with the biggest trading brokerage firms you can think of to REDUCE the risk of being a victim of shady crap."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Think or Swim is TD, but TD is being merged with Schwab. Schwab has said though that they will keep Think or Swim."
03/20/2021,stocks,I don't like much change so I am sure I would probably still be using TD if I hadn't stopped trading for so long. If it wasn't for the shady stuff I would just stay with Robinhood. It is just too much on the shady stuff...
03/20/2021,stocks,Open a paper trading account in all the ones you are considering and give a test drive. Probably best way to make up your mind without tying up your money and positions by moving it around multiple times

03/20/2021,stocks,Ark has been dumping splunk for the last few weeks. It ran up a lot. I like $SUMO in the SIEM space. It got destroyed in all these rate induced sell offs. Down to sub $20 from high $30s. It's newer and smaller than splunk but built as cloud based from the ground up. It's better for smaller companies that don't want to spend the money for splunk to come in and set up their software on premises. I started buying into $SUMO once it hit low $20s and have been averaging down. It's a gamble but there's a lot of potential. Current market cap is 2.12B with an estimated total addressable market of 50B.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Great company. The bonds they issued a couple years back were private placement. Meaning investors couldnt buy them at issue. They only went to the elite. At 2%, these bonds obly cost them about 0.5% in interest after tax and if they're converted, it'll end up being negligible.


They've said in their filings they're not interested in profitability but rather capturing market share. They're doing that through some acquisitions. It's one of those tech companies that has good management and a good product. They've diluted their shares a lot because of this but nothing the rest of the marlet isn't doing."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Ive actually done some work using this software. its okay but alot of setup. they recently have had a tendency to buy up technoliges and start projects without finishing them. this could be good or bad in my opinion. they have tools that could explode in popularity in the right communities, they could be buring themselves out right now. i think SPLK could make some money for investors but not before it drops more. not buying right now personally.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Look at the shareholders. They have all been **selling.** What does that tell you, that they don't understand this product? People unloading enough shares to make millions of dollars? I would think they have all the facts, technical analysis and company research at their fingertips if they handle those kinds of funds.

From what I read, it's that they only belatedly moved to the cloud is what is causing them to be ""undervalued."" But now they are up against everybody who has been building their businesses in the cloud from the get go."
03/20/2021,stocks,Splunk cost is expensive for enterprises and competitors (such as ELK and other open sources and other companies) have been eating their lunch...pass for me !!
03/20/2021,stocks,I'm long splunk and sumo.  Splunk is at an interesting spot on the monthly chart.  If it holds the pump could be huge.  Same with sumo.  We want to hold this swing low for a higher low and go test the levels toward the prior highs.

03/20/2021,stocks,Volume is buying AND selling. And fridays are typically dump days with some snatching up the dips. It‚Äôs common. Especially near the end of March.
03/20/2021,stocks,it probably had to do with quad witching day and all the selling that was also going on due to that. volume includes both buying and selling
03/20/2021,stocks,Two words: Quadruple witching
03/20/2021,stocks,Did it happen at 4 on the dot? Pretty sure thats just the NYSE closing auction ([https://www.nyse.com/article/nyse-closing-auction-insiders-guide](https://www.nyse.com/article/nyse-closing-auction-insiders-guide)). It might have been higher than usual due quadruple witching pumping up volume and options expiring.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Schwab. No commissions on penny stocks. ETrade and Ameritrade will charge you $6.95.

You should always have several brokerage accounts. Remember the Robinhood situation with GME, etc.?

I don't know that any of the brokerages will allow you trade penny stocks- not for several days- when you open the account. Even when the number of days pass with Schwab you still have to call them to trade your first penny stock, I believe. No fee for doing so, if anything you can explain that you tried to trade online and it didn't let you. 

Whatever the case, get several brokerage accounts and fund them so you're ready for whatever comes up.

Another advantage to having several brokerage accounts is to reduce your chances of being flagged as a pattern day trader."

IIRC the S&P dividend yield is about 2%, so when you can get 2% from a treasury some investors will prefer the guaranteed stability of a bond to the market. this is most impactful with large pension funds and the like, managing zillions of dollars. they'll sell a ton of stocks or indexes, and buy a ton of bonds. this drives down stock prices in the short-term."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Reposting again

In times like these, it's helpful to zoom out. The rising rates narrative gets trotted out every few years and [dates back over 100 years.](https://www.realclearmarkets.com/articles/2021/01/29/we_keep_hearing_how_there_are_too_many_treasuries_658350.html)

Personally I think weaning off low rates had to be done at some point. Leaving them that low gives the Fed less tools to rescue the economy in the future and it kills savings. Better to bite the bullet now. It was impossible to sustain forever and creates way too much imbalance. 

Also, people still are not understanding that 2020-2021 rates were THE LOWEST RATES EVER.

So basically we are going from the lowest rates ever to the closest to lowest rates ever.

Fed is NOT going to let inflation get out of control, they just don't want to be subservient to a bunch of lame azz bond traders who keep throwing tantrums.

Also these doom and gloom scenarios get thrown out there to sway the masses. For short term traders, it's helpful to see what the establishment is trying to move in the short term and go with the flow, but for long term funds, you're never going to be able to time it correctly."
03/20/2021,stocks,"There's also the risk factor.  If bonds are paying 1.6% and S&P dividend yields are slightly higher at 2%, some investors may still favor the bonds because although there's less yield there, there is greater aversion from risk.  You still have interest rate risk, but not much in the way of credit risk with treasury securities."
03/20/2021,stocks,"As bond yields go higher, interest rates tend to rise as well. Companies need to use more money to pay interests, which means that they can‚Äôt use that money to expand their business. 

Another thing is that when interest rates go higher, people have less money to use for goods and services because they are paying higher interest rates for their loans the same way companies are. This leads directly to smaller revenue and free cash flow for companies which is of course bad.

So that‚Äôs why you should care about treasury bonds."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I though that the interest rates affected the yield rather than the other way around. If you have a bond with a 10% coupon, it's price goes up or down based on how valuable that percent return is compared to market interest rates. When the price of the bond goes up, its yield goes down. When interest rates are high, you would want more return from a bond so the price goes down and the yield goes up. 

Can someone explain why this post is speaking in the other direction?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"mega techs like aapl, amzn, msft, and googl don't really have to care, but small cap techs will be much more difficult to navigate for a higher bond yield."
03/20/2021,stocks,But what happens when they're actually creating inflation to combat deflation?
03/20/2021,stocks,"The fed doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant‚Äú inflation in the sense that they want to cause inflation. The fed predicts inflation to be at or slightly above 2% for the next year, which is within their target. Hence they are not going to do anything to try to combat it."
03/20/2021,stocks,"an issue with rising interest rates is that future earnings are discounted (look up: time value of money) with a higher factor. this means that essentially, if there is a good alternative that pays nice and secure yields, stocks are *relatively* less valuable."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It almost seems as if the big players sold off and our holding onto capital just waiting to see what to dump it in. The market has been volatile, but not in an extreme way. I could easily see a turn around soon once there‚Äôs more certainty with market conditions going forward."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You mean Bond's are being shorted. ( selling off) pure manipulation.

03/20/2021,stocks,[TheStockguy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ei4xyGyAfr0) I think explains it pretty well.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Wow this post is so full of misinformation and straight up bullshit I don't even know where to begin. 

Like WTF, the yield isn't the interest rate a bond pays, the coupon payment is. The yield is the return investors demand on a bond based on its coupon payment and where it's trading relative to par for fucks sake. This is literally you not understanding basic definitions used in finance ffs.

/u/anth1986 please take this shit down - you have no idea what you're talking about and some dumb kid is going to be browsing this sub and take everything you said as fact.

Also - how the fuck are you going to make a post about treasury yields and stocks and not mention the single most important equity valuation input that connects the two - the risk free rate?!?!?!?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Valuations are derived from discounting future cash flows. Inflation and interest rates go up, valuations go down. Companies promising more cash in the future (growth/tech) get hit the hardest. Additionally, any company with variable rate loans or companies looking to refinance loans face higher interest rates causing lower growth."
03/20/2021,stocks,"What about bonds on the stock market ?
 Do they play a role ?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"But doesn‚Äôt this also drive down the Yield on Bonds, driving people back into stocks?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"True but bond yields rising still shows a net selling of bonds. Tech and such was sold off, but probably not for bonds that return less than what inflation probably will be. 

The DOW has ballooned during all this so I think we‚Äôll look back and see this whole time frame was simply the market adjusting to the vaccine putting a very real end timeline to Covid. Covid gave tech some extra tailwinds and now it‚Äôs gone. Meanwhile the recovery and reopening stocks have had a great month. Rising 10 year yields is a bullish indicator for the economy, it just jumped too quickly and startled everyone."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Don‚Äôt forget the interest rates could still go into negative territory, when you talk about the tools available to the Fed. That is a tool that the fed has yet to trot out. That is right, banks would pay you money to take a mortgage. 

Other countries are using negative interest rates with success. 

I bring up negative interest rates because the assumption is the Feds will have no tools at their disposal if inflation starts going up, so they have to get the rates back up prior to an inflation storm. That is not necessarily the case as negative rates prove. 

Inflation‚Ä¶.do we even measure inflation?  There has been outrageous inflation since Post Clinton and nobody has done much about it. Why all of this faux worry about inflation now? Our metrics we use for inflation are flawed. I sometimes think there is an agreement in DC that inflation is a code word for tax rates. 

So I substitute tax rates for inflation and then things make more sense."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes, I wrote that all in my post, I‚Äôm guessing you didn‚Äôt read it. 

Basically, my argument is the Fed will buy down the Bond Yields if they get out of control. This would mean rates go higher but still be near historical lows. Plus stimulus money will help to increase revenues."
03/20/2021,stocks,Tell that to AAPL‚Äôs price action every time the yield fluctuates 0.1%
03/20/2021,stocks,"Mega techs are stores of value. They were pseudo bonds. Now that real bonds are paying something again, investors don't need to use the substitute bonds that mega shares were.

In other words, AMZN and friends are COVID prison cigarettes of the bond market."
03/20/2021,stocks,How do I also short the bind market ?!
03/20/2021,stocks,"Bond yield is the return an investor realizes on a bond. The bond yield can be defined in different ways. Setting the bond yield equal to its coupon rate is the simplest definition. The current yield is a function of the bond's price and its coupon or interest payment, which will be more accurate than the coupon yield if the price of the bond is different than its face value.

I say in my post I don‚Äôt understand everything and this is a discussion, so discuss if you have a problem ‚Äúffs‚Äù!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sorry I‚Äôm new to basic definitions in finance, what‚Äôs ffs?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"My thoughts exactly. How you can not mention the risk free rate, I don't know."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I also believe the people going into bonds at that point control much more capital than any retailers leave the space to speculate in the markets.  When big money turns its eyes to bonds rather than the market, that‚Äôs when the problems arise."
03/20/2021,stocks,"In theory, but it's not an automatic reaction. It's more an expectation, a trend. Things always move in the markets. There are several forces  competing between each other and it's a constant changing equilibrium. You can't ever say ""we have reached this situation. We are good this way. Things are gonna be like this for x years."" 

That's the beauty of the economy. 

And also stop replacing a formal education with reddit posts."
03/20/2021,stocks,The fed doing ycc is basically admitting that the economy is shit and we can't survive without low rates

03/20/2021,stocks,"The bond market is significantly larger than the stock market, anyways."
03/20/2021,stocks,True.  That begs a much larger question as well.  How is it healthy to have a larger market for debt than traditional securities?  I can barely wrap my head around how these factors play around behind the scenes.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Government debt and corporate debt trade in the bond market.

The federal government can print money faster than companies can do secondary offerings."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Right, but at a certain point, many of these high p/e (specifically tech) stocks must have more corporate debt in the bond markets than they have public holdings (in the stock market).  Excluding cash holdings for the sake of this example, what happens when people realize the companies they‚Äôre trading have larger debts that can be monetized in the bond markets than value to capitalized on in the traditional stock market?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Nope.

Tech stocks are physical-asset-light, and because of this, they're actually less leveraged.

It's the usual value stock suspects that have debt, and in some cases drowning in it.

(And don't get me started with the ultimate value trap: energy MLPs.)"
03/20/2021,stocks,Totally! So many of the growth companies I hold have taken enormous hits this month despite having no debt and most having large surpluses of cash on hand based on recent offerings. The blanket narrative seems lazy and facetious

03/20/2021,stocks,Yeah but there is more growth coming i believe they got new govt contracts and they're doing some deal with gunbroker.com so there is new and continual growth coming atleast that's my view of why it's a buy and hold.

03/20/2021,stocks,"The way I see it is (my opinion), the guy below me is kind of right, the company isn‚Äôt the best, they sell bullets which I‚Äôd say mostly sit in peoples closets or safes or something for that ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù when the democrats come for your guns and ‚Äúthese 18,000 rounds will come in handy!‚Äù It‚Äôs never coming. This company ran up in the COVID run on guns, these new govt contracts and deals I don‚Äôt see as continual growth and expansion from current levels, I see them as an effort to catch up to and justify their current valuation.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes there are people dying to buy ammo, I‚Äôm one of them.  But again that‚Äôs short term sales, the vast majority of new gun buyers won‚Äôt ever go shooting at all or maybe once.

2021-03-20 17:44:07,stocks,"How in the world do tax brackets work, upon cashing out after holding long term? Hello! I‚Äôm completely lost on how tax brackets work when someone is cashing out completely. Say someone has a taxable brokerage account, yet they never sell anything until the end. So annually they just get taxed on the dividends (?). Say they put in $10,000 per year, and their income is as follows, as far as years they worked: 

Years 2-4: $20,000/year.
Years 5-18: $50,000/year
Years 19-39: $76,000/year
Then they are going to retire soon but got a low paying job right before, so years 40-41: $19,000/year. Then they want to cash the whole thing out their 45th year, so the last few years of having the account, no work. 

If they cash the whole thing out, after depositing $10,000 annually after all of those years. It would definitely be a nice sum, say they put it into ETF‚Äôs in the S and P 1500. 

What in the world would their taxes be on the lump sum when cashing out, that 45th year? Since their income was all over the place during all of those years. Thank you!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"The only taxable events happen the year you sell the stock. Aside from the dividends that are taxed yearly. The amount of taxes is based off the total amount of gross income for the year you sell, which will include any income from jobs and the value of that stock combined.

Why anyone, who has invested for decades, would want to sell off everything, all at once is beyond me.  If you have spent decades building up your portfolio you aren't going to willy nilly sell it all of sudden.  You are going to plan your sales as carefully as you planned your purchases."

03/20/2021,stocks,"This just has way to many variables.  Any answer is going to be as confusing as the question...and who really knows how capital gains will be taxed 6 months from now, let alone 45 years from now."
03/20/2021,stocks,"The top capital gains rate for long term holdings (held 1 yr or more) is 20% if your total income is over $440k.  Between 40k-440k is 15% and under 40k is 0%.  So choose wisely to reduce the tax burden.  If it's sizable, maybe cash out over several years.  Of course market conditions have to be considered if planning to hold over several year."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Lots of good responses here. I will add that if this includes a sub-question about retirement income/planning, then considering opening (for example) a Roth IRA and contributing the max to it each year would allow someone to do stock/ETF trading without concern for capital gains taxes, either short or long term. Caveat: you can‚Äôt write off the losses."
03/20/2021,stocks,"When in doubt, hire a good CPA. Always worth the money, they‚Äôre cheaper than you think."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It's based off of your income at the time you cash out (you're taxed at a higher rate though, if you cash out within a year). Waiting for retirement to cash out generally means your income is less."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Taxes are based on your income the year you sell out.

Not working will only reduce your tax on your work income. Your wage went from $19,000 to $0 in ur ex. It would only reduce the tax you own on $19,000.You still own the taxes for the $450,000 you invested. 

Difference isn‚Äôt much. Let say it quadrupled to $1, 800,000 when you sell out. You own taxes on $1,800,000 if you have no work. if you have work then it‚Äôs $1,819,000 that you own tax on. 

Working always bring higher net income even if you had to give away like 30% of it to taxes, you still get to keep 70% versus 0%.don‚Äôt need to quit job just to sell stock."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Theoretically yes, although most people in retirement aren't too stock heavy. Their in much less risky assets. Any stocks they own are generally the dividend kings (AT&T, JnJ, KO, etc...)"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Excellent, thank you! 

So only a bozo would cash out making $75,000 that year, if they knew in a year or two they weren‚Äôt going to be working, and could have just cashed out then, when their income was $0"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Guess it all just depends! No point in having a high balance if someone is going to die soon, they saved for so long, maybe now they want to enjoy life as much as they can

There could be a large purchase they want to do in cash (new house), help out family/friends, etc. re invest in something other than stocks

Just because I‚Äôm saying they want to cash the whole thing out, I don‚Äôt mean blow it all.

Just saying there are plenty of reasons as to why someone would need to cash out a lot at once. Maybe someone can finally get their dream house (paid off immediately- so saving a TON on a loan/interest) for the last 20 years they have left, nothing wrong with that. Plus it‚Äôs not like a nice house would go down in value, for whoever inherits it, so it‚Äôs also an investment"
03/20/2021,stocks,"So if someone waits a year after they‚Äôre not working, despite the higher income all of those years, their taxes on the whole amount would be low? Since they cashed out when they had no income?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Lots of variables, but seems realistic since I doubt one person is going to have the same income for 40+ years? I was thinking there has to be at least one person out there that has cashed out after holding/having different incomes"
03/20/2021,stocks,"So if someone is not working, after all of those years, they could cash the whole thing out and pay 0% in taxes? If the year they cash it out, they have no income that year, or the previous year.

That seems gigantic then? Since it would be a large sum after holding all of those years"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Oh wow so everyone should wait 2 years after working, to cash out? If the sum is high"
03/20/2021,stocks,"This is correct, if they like to keep more of their money."
03/20/2021,stocks,Look up long term capital gains rate vs earned income
03/20/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs only if they no other income and the capital gains for that one year is under 40k

Confirm with tax accountant just to make sure."
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you do that, you lose 2 years working income which is also quite a large amount of cash. Depends on your income vs holdings, but i expect for most the loss from not working would be higher than the loss from cashing out your holdings."
03/20/2021,stocks,Will do!
03/20/2021,stocks,"Lose 2 years how? As far as the total balance in the account. 

If they cashed out when they were working for a decent amount, wouldn‚Äôt that be 15% or more in taxes, compared to 0% if they weren‚Äôt working? Say the total balance is 1.5 million. 15% in taxes would be $225,000.

If they wait until they‚Äôre not working, wouldn‚Äôt it be $0 in taxes?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"The federal threshold for 0% capital gains for a single filer is $38,600. 

If you made $0 in a given year, you could realize up to $38,600 in long-term capital gains at 0%.

If you cashed out everything in one year (consult a financial advisor please for the love of god), you would pay 0% for $38k of it, 15% on the next $387,200, and 20% of anything above $425,800. This is assuming you've held everything for more than a year. 

If you made, say, $20k in a given year, you could cash out $18,600 and pay 0% taxes on that. 

Hope that helps. Also, talk to a professional. They will help you come up with a strategy to keep as much of that as possible."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes, exactly. So it entirely depends on your earnings. With those figures, if your income is more than 112,500 per year post-tax, you lose money. If your income is lower, then you save money."
03/20/2021,stocks,Thank you!

Other names are chip makers NXPI, Ambarella (AMBA), Analog Devices (ADI), and Marvel (MRVL). These manufacturers produce chips that are used in autonomous driving systems (MRVL also is in the 5G and Datacenter space after acquiring Inphi).

These stocks are also relatively cheap compared to high-flying speculative plays like Luminar, Velodyne, Xpeng, Nio, etc. The only pure EV stock I own is Tesla and mostly because of the autonomous ride-hailing and home energy management systems they are developing."

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.
*****
> The bond market‚Äôs reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.
*****
> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell‚Äôs briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.
*****
> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is bonds‚Äô ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt call it day in the sun ‚Äî it‚Äôs more like day in the tornado,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúClearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù
*****
> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.
*****
> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.
*****
> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.
*****
> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe bond move has been huge, and it‚Äôs starting to scare people,‚Äù said Schumacher.
*****
> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It‚Äôs incredible.‚Äù
*****
> # Powell speaks
*****
> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.
*****
> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.
*****
> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.
*****
> # Inflation and the Fed
> There is also some key data.
*****
> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.
*****
> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank‚Äôs forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.
*****
> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year‚Äôs numbers when prices fell.
*****
> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It‚Äôs a change to the Fed‚Äôs ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.
*****
> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.
*****
> ‚ÄúFor the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there‚Äôs a consensus problem. There can‚Äôt not be tension,‚Äù said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> ‚ÄúThey will be trying to clarify the Fed‚Äôs message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey will be explaining themselves as economists, and they‚Äôll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.‚Äù
*****
> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.
*****
> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,‚Äù said Grohowski.
*****
> ‚ÄúYet, they‚Äôre committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the market is struggling with. I think it‚Äôs unsettling to me to hear words like ‚Äòovershoot.‚Äô‚Äù
*****
> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‚Äògreat rotation‚Äô from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It‚Äôs not over, but I think we‚Äôve seen the lion‚Äôs share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,‚Äù said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.
*****
> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed‚Äôs willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.
*****
> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike‚Äôs comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.
*****
> ‚ÄúInflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,‚Äù Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year‚Äôs earnings.‚Äù
*****
> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed‚Äôs economic forecast.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It‚Äôs too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,‚Äù Grohowski said.
*****
> # Bond market direction
> Schumacher said there‚Äôs a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.
*****
> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.
*****
He is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.
*****
The Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.
*****
In particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.

> # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One
*****
> ‚ÄúThe stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.‚Äù Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard
*****
> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick‚Äôs Day! We‚Äôve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here‚Äôs to some more today and over the rest of 2021.
*****
> One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ‚Äô29 crash, the ‚Äô87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.
*****
> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn‚Äôt do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.
*****
> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we‚Äôve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we‚Äôll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.
*****
> So what happens now is the logical question? ‚ÄúThe good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAlthough it won‚Äôt be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls‚Äô side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.‚Äù
*****
> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).

> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed
*****
> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.
*****
> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board‚Äôs Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.
*****
> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.
*****
> ‚ÄúGlobal growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators‚Äù according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. ‚ÄúWhen we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.‚Äù
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> ‚ÄúThe level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.
*****
> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country‚Äôs below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.
*****
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**
*****
> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.
*****
> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country‚Äôs relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.

*****

> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid
*****
> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.
*****
> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January‚Äôs 0.5% pace.
*****
> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI‚Äôs value.
*****
> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite‚Äôs growth, while manufacturers‚Äô new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.
*****
> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.

> ‚ÄúIn recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWe are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.‚Äù
*****
> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week ahead r/stocks."
03/20/2021,stocks,"First, thanks so much for these weekend updates. Fantastic stuff as always.

Second, glad the 5- and 7-year bonds were mentioned. I was eyeing them Thursday and Friday as their yields were really shooting up. Most of the focus has been on the 10-year."
03/20/2021,stocks,Jpow can stfu. Every time I see his name the nasdaq goes down 5% that week
03/20/2021,stocks,So do we expect Monday and Tuesday to be another shit show?
03/20/2021,stocks,"A 10% market correction would translate into what, a 30% drop in tech/growth? This reaction to yields is ridiculous. The pandemic highlighted innovative growth companies, it didn‚Äôt just overvalue them to the point of oblivion. Market sentiment seems to think otherwise."
03/20/2021,stocks,Who keeps inviting Powell to speak? Cut it out.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm getting real tired of market makers being constant drama queens everytime Powell speaks. Reopening is happening, there's the stimulus, low interest rates (for a prolonged period), a prediction of GDP increasing dramatically and vast amount of promising companies to put money. This is basically a perfect environment to invest in, this surely offsets potential inflation increases"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Any recommendations for stocks related to Japan?

Low coronavirus concerns and a big stimulus play sounds pretty bullish to me."
03/20/2021,stocks,"This uncertainty seems trending unfavorable for tech. I haven't even get a breath from the last crash yet, so no cash sitting around ü§ï"
03/20/2021,stocks,Michael Schumacher works at Wells Fargo now? Quite the career change for a 7 time Formula 1 WDC
03/20/2021,stocks,Idk what we'd do without you BigBear
03/20/2021,stocks,I hope the treasury yields don't go up by 0.1 and cause a 3% sell-off again.
03/20/2021,stocks,Thank ya kind sir!
03/20/2021,stocks,"Talks between the us and China went poorly. This should surely have an effect on the market, or were the talks expected to go poorly?"
03/20/2021,stocks,Economic recovery looks great. That's why France and Poland went back into lockdown and Germany is soon to follow. What could go wrong in America.  I do the opposite of what analysts say anyway.
03/20/2021,stocks,How can I see this view with all the stocks?
03/20/2021,stocks,I hope the bond market goes to 5% and the panicking nancy's keep selling everything to make these tech and growth stocks cheaper. Great buying opportunity for us!!!
03/20/2021,stocks,Would it be wise to take a pause fun trading for the week to see if some of the volatility calms down?
03/20/2021,stocks,"The thing that worried me the most is the fed is willing to keep pumping money till employment returns what actually happens if the number stagnates at 2-5% higher employment over the next three years, businesses have been operating with less staff what makes the fed think this will change?"
03/20/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/20/2021,stocks,"Kudos my man, you are worth your weight in Gold sir, TY for this info"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Praying for SPY dipping to 3700 in the next two weeks 

I didn't load up on tech at the correction, and wouldn't now."
03/20/2021,stocks,It will probably be like this until the end of March when Q1 ends
03/20/2021,stocks,High frequency algos only care about the here and now. It will all rotate back soon enough
03/20/2021,stocks,"wallstreet guys always play this game of bringing market down to put pressure on FED to make sure low rate and cheap money continues and once fed promise, they will continue the bull !!"
03/20/2021,stocks,">This reaction to yields is ridiculous.

i think the reaction to falling yields was ridiculous. the nasdaq is still up 35% from its pre-covid ATH."
03/20/2021,stocks,Market knows better than you.
03/20/2021,stocks,Amen
03/20/2021,stocks,Good better buying opportunities for us. I hope the whole market crashes so I can buy buy buy!
03/20/2021,stocks,It looks they want to bring stonk prices cheap(er).
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sony, Renesas, Itochu for example"
03/20/2021,stocks,whoever is making sex bots
03/20/2021,stocks,Toyota
03/20/2021,stocks,"Same! I‚Äôm sitting on some annoying losses wondering if I should just eat it and re-structure my strategy. Of course, the day I do that everything will shoot up 10 minutes later so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
03/20/2021,stocks,I thought he was still bed ridden?
03/20/2021,stocks,A man in a supposibly vegetative state predicting the markets? Not that I can believe in!
03/20/2021,stocks,The map in the image? That‚Äôs from here https://finviz.com/map.ashx
03/20/2021,stocks,Lookup any stock market heat map
03/20/2021,stocks,This is a religious belief.
03/20/2021,stocks,nasdaq already had a 10% correction
03/20/2021,stocks,I think it's an attempt for Wall Street to make the Federal Reserve accommodate for them ever more than they are. It's kind of unbelievable to me.
03/20/2021,stocks,Buy that dip. And the next dip.
03/20/2021,stocks,HMC?
03/20/2021,stocks,"Please, for the love of god, re-structure your strategy"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Nobody really knows :( but from what has been said, he is aware of whats happening. I think he‚Äôs just wheelchair bound."
03/20/2021,stocks,About as predictable as HAM BOT VER
03/20/2021,stocks,"Dang, is he still in a coma from that ski accident?"
03/20/2021,stocks,Thanks bro
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think Wall Street is short sighted so they jump into where the short term money is and thats pandemic re-opening plays, banks with the yields like it is. Once they milk those, they‚Äôll be back into tech."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Just because you told me to, I‚Äôm not going to."
03/20/2021,stocks,"As far as I know, unfortunately yes. I'm a huge fan :("
2021-03-20 15:21:03,stocks,"March Madness tipoff boosts DraftKings, Penn National shares! Increased legalization of online betting could make this year‚Äôs March Madness the most wagered on sporting events of all-time. The tournament is expected to generate as much as $2 billion in legal bets, according to H2 Gambling Capital estimates.

Forty-seven million Americans plan to bet on tournament games this year with the number wagering via online sportsbooks set to triple from 2019 when the eight states that had legal sports betting generated $715 million of revenue, according to H2 Gambling Capital.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxbusiness.com/markets/march-madness-tip-off-boosts-draftkings-penn-national-shares.amp"
03/20/2021,stocks,$PENN didn‚Äôt go up because of March Madness.  It went up because trading under $115 before being included in the S&P 500 in a few weeks was a gift to investors.  I want to know who sold at those prices.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Finally got back in PENN.  Bought last year around $12 or so, sold when it doubled.  Was kicking my self and recently just bought more."
03/20/2021,stocks,Love March Madness!
03/20/2021,stocks,Dkng and betz have been solid performers. Dkng especially.
03/20/2021,stocks,Finally opened a position in Penn after . Waited for it to drop a significant amount and glad to be in now.
03/20/2021,stocks,Profit taking
03/20/2021,stocks,It still amazes me that $Penn has done +1800% in the last 12 months with a -32.5% revenue decline year-over-year. How is that 18x share price justified?
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sportsbooks are going to absolutely explode as they open in more states.  Michigan and Illinois had incredible numbers recently. 

Never underestimate Portnoy. He's an idiot, but his following is absolutely rabid. 

I own $PENN, $DKNG, and $MGM."
03/20/2021,stocks,Legislation is most probably already factored into those prices.
2021-03-20 15:07:29,stocks,"Elon Musk denies Teslas used for spying Elon Musk denies Teslas used for spying after China‚Äôs military bans cars from bases.

Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk said on Saturday his company would be shut down if its cars were used to spy, his first comments on news that China's military has banned Teslas from its facilities.

""There's a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,"" Musk told a prominent Chinese forum during a virtual discussion. ""If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.""

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2BC04Q"
03/20/2021,stocks,Thats gonna happen to every foreign car with cameras
03/20/2021,stocks,So is this China wanting to pump NIO as tensions between US and China grow ?
03/20/2021,stocks,"I mean what would you expect him to say? Yes, we are spies and do insider information trading for governmental purposes."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I am not to fond of Musk but I believe him 100% on this.

That is not the issue though, banning a car stacked with cameras from military facilities ist just a logical decision from China, there really isn't much to discuss there."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I bet they‚Äôre just worried about his cars mapping the inside of their bases, like we can‚Äôt do that via our satellites already."
03/20/2021,stocks,"He probably also denies having hair plugs, the guys a pathological liar."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I don't think the concern was Tesla themselves.

The insider threat is what governments care about, and Tesla's let you pull the dashcam footage off to do what you wish with. Anyone with a Tesla could drive through with dashcam enabled, then pull the video off and do whatever with it."
03/20/2021,stocks,"But in the hands of a hacker, they could be."
03/20/2021,stocks,Chief executive? Do you mean Technoking?
03/20/2021,stocks,"""we're TOTALLY not spying on your guys. promise."" 

Elon's on the defensive. not a good place to be."
03/20/2021,stocks,I'm not sure of the numbers but I would be skeptical that the amount of chinese military members that can afford a tesla with all the tarrifs ect is a huge market he is losing. Maybe he's concerned about this setting a precedent with other intelligence agencies. My money is that it's CCP trying to push the needle in Nio and other chinese companies favor. If the Chinese EV makers make it to the states I would expect something similar from the US Govt. It might not be a huge news story though.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yeah and every military in every country will react similarly. This ""news"" is just propaganda."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm not an expert but if you are the Chinese military then this seems like a legitimate security problem. All the telemetry for self-driving presumably makes their location easier to track, whether or not Tesla is complicit in spying.

Not sure why only Tesla is mentioned. You'd think that the same problems would occur for all self-driving cars."
03/20/2021,stocks,by the time probably nio is using stolen tech from tesla.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yup, this is just more of the same old same old from China."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Tesla seems to respects privacy better than FB and google. However, once data lands in their server, anything can happen !!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yeah.

I mean this is non-news. Even if they were, which I doubt, he wouldn't admit it.

Basically it's:
Tesla does: Deny.
Tesla doesn't: Deny truthfully."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the US did it to him too. The government, and especially the military, likes its secretes.

If he‚Äôs part of a much bigger conspiracy then he wouldn‚Äôt give a shit about the company and likely wouldn‚Äôt even be the owner or be anything more than a figurehead and a spy.  It‚Äôs not the craziest idea.  Look at FB.  That‚Äôs probably the best spy tool in history.  China just caught it at the gate.
03/20/2021,stocks,"in Eastern Europe everyone has a dash cam, costs like 15$ and you don't need a tesla; and gps navigator app can record and replay your path on the map since time immemorial; and phones can remember the exact coordinates where every photo was taken with automatic upload to google drive, if enabled, or tiktok, whatever's not banned in there... aaaand we also have remote controlled drones that can zoom x50 from miles away and record in worderfull 4k ulta HD from every angle, aaand.."

Also if they were to build a spy vehicle.....you think they‚Äôd go for something less....flamboyant than a Tesla. They‚Äôd probably go for a 2012 Toyota Corolla or something common.

Your done would be shoot down, and you would be arrested by MPs if they can trace it. Military jail and trail are very different compared to the others. 
Taking pictures will get stopped and it‚Äôs not fun. (I just really liked a row of trees, it made a tunnel..) They‚Äôll let it go for certain things, but those are events planned out at least a year in advance. 
The coordinates aren‚Äôt the most useful in a base. It‚Äôs built like a maze, and has *false building everywhere. Having a ground (street) view on the other hand let‚Äôs you see this information; what building is never staffed? What is, but has no cars? What‚Äôs just a weird patch of dirt? While the street is large enough for my tank; how could they defend against me? MB are logical master pieces and nightmares, a literal example of organised chaos. And they have to be.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Yeah, great point. The camera footage, plus the fact that camera data can be sent back to Tesla servers for review (presumably without Chinese military approved security protocols) is likely a bigger factor in the decision."

Keeping the least amount uninvested, buying beaten stocks when euro is strong, etc. are some strategies. You might find REITS that did not recovered from the crash and are relatively cheap now (same goes with mortgage companies, oil, etc). Just, make sure you study the ticker."

03/20/2021,stocks,"I think that losses from negative interests are covered by degiro up to the first 2500, after that all the losses are charged to you. It doesn't matter how much liquidity you have in degiro, only the first 250p will be compensated back, although if you have a lot of cash you'll reach that limit faster.

It sucks, I don't get why they don't find another solution, it's pretty stupid."
03/20/2021,stocks,Thank you all for the responses. Some of you suggested to invest in funds. I never did that. Can you suggest me some names? If you tell me the symbol even better :) thanks!
03/20/2021,stocks,The nehative interest is so low i would ignore it. The costs for buying and selling should be higher.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Does someone have a logical take on what the fuck is actually going on with GME? There's still so much weird shit going on it feels like. If anyone wants to chime in, I'd love some opinions (please no ape strong together or conspiracy stuff) on the following things:

* why was part of the last congress hearing cut out by CNBC? Even if they were shills for Citadel, what was so problematic with that part? And if it wasn't, why was it cut out anyway?
* How the fuck is GME staying over 200 for so long with ""nothing sketchy going on""? Why did it even go up again? And why was there a battle around $200 dollars? I've been investing for ten years (mostly in local markets and conservative stuff like managed funds etc.), and I've never seen anything quite like the last few minutes of yesterday...
* Why do people talk about ""low volume""? Volume is still multiples higher on GME than it was before January, so volatility is actually still to expect. But then again, how can it be that there are hard price drops and breakouts with (relatively) low volume? Wouldn't lower volume result in a steady and slow pullback? Or is volume high enough to cause such violent drops and breakouts?
* While we're at it, what was up with AMC yesterday? It's rare to see a stock flatline like that, when it has actual volume?
* why in the world are there people literally brigading the shit out of every GME thread, writing multiple comments telling people to sell for their own sake and shit? Why would anyone care so much about strangers on the internet losing money to get so militant/aggressive? Is it just negative karma farming? Trolling? Or butthurt people that lost money and are now on angry crusades?
* Why the fuck would DFV stay in his position for so long? He could have walked away with 50+ million? I love the guy just for the memes, but that is insanity.  Do you think he sold by now? I know it doesn't matter, just curious.
* are there any 'organic' reasons that could explain what happened in the last few weeks? I know there's this theory that some whale pushed the stock up again and other whales fighting against that. If yes, I'd guess that fight is over and that's why it's dropping with low volume. But if that's whats happened, why did so many days end with photo finishes around particular prices? Is there still whales fighting about something? Or is it actually retail buying at certain key points, because they think ""oh no, it's 199, ape together strong, buy buy buy""? But if that's true, why does price always drop right before market close (yesterday it was 201.40 and trending upwards, when at 30 seconds before close, it violently dropped to 199 before closing right at 200.27 after a pushback)?
* Is there any world in where retail actually **does** hold most of the float and this shit could still blow up? Last I saw, there was ~40% of the float shorted. Does the number even matter? Wasn't VW only 12%? 

Anyway, I'd love some civil (and non-elitist) discussion about all this, because I can't really make sense of all of it. I like GME, mostly because I made around $8000 bucks in the first rally and it was fun (and stressful), but I'm not attached to it like most of WSB or detached and acting like it doesn't exist like people in other subs. I still have 11 shares left for the fun of it.

But fuck me, all of this is stupid, isn't it!

03/20/2021,stocks,"For everyone who is confused and sceptical about the GameStop saga, let me break it down for ya‚Äôll. First, WSB diamond hands GameStop to try and stick it to the hedgies via a short squeeze, and it worked. The subsequent rally was a gamma squeeze, but why are WSB investors still so bullish? It‚Äôs because we are witnessing a profound change in company fundamentals: GameStop is transforming from a dying brick-and-mortar retailer to a profitable e-commerce enterprise. Remember that stocks are forward-looking, so although GameStop is not there yet, we are betting it will achieve its e-commerce transformation, especially with Chewy founder Ryan Cohen at the helm.

I was also sceptical at first, but now I have invested $80k in $GME. GameStop is my only position, short of $2k in gang weed, which I will be divesting. I think buying weeklies is too risky, which is why I am theta farming, using the wheel. Also, that IV is very tasty for options writers.

One thing that I have to keep reminding myself is that I have the benefit of reconstructing the last few months knowing where everything went and that 8-10k invested could have turned into a 8-10k loss...I knew if that happened I'd never touch a stock again."
03/20/2021,stocks,"RKT appears to be winning the battle.

03/20/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôll try to use plain English to touch base on some things since there are many new investors with these questions as well

As for organic growth, this is what I believe is the most likely occurrence. I do think the CFO termination and Ryan Cohen announcement acted as catalysts when it jumped to $170, and the subsequent drop to $100 was a large group of people/entities that held exiting their position. As for the climb after, I do think it was fairly organic as it made its way to $200. For months, people held and swore ‚Äúthe squeeze hadn‚Äôt squoze‚Äù. Once it started climbing steadily, I‚Äôm sure a ton bought back in cause FOMO. Then when it took off up to $340, I believe that was due to calls being ITM and MM‚Äôs buying shares to plan for them being executed. As for the sudden 50% drop to $170 and immediate rebound to $260, I believe this was a whale exiting their position and buying back in at the dip to continue riding the retail momentum. Again, all of this is my opinion, but to me it is what makes the most sense out of the ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù.

You can‚Äôt trust the released numbers from this stock. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs a conspiracy, but there are too many ways to legitimately provide false data, plus much of it is weeks old when reported. Now, it will be interesting to see how the new rules concerning short % and transparency affect that. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, anyone who says GME is done is full of it, they said that throughout all of February and we are closing in on a month since the last explosion and we are still over $200.00 per share for fucking GameStop!!! It makes zero fucking sense for it to hold at these levels for so long. It could plummet next week back down to $40, it could explode back to $300, it could actually squeeze up to $1,000, or it could hover around a few dollars up or down. Which is most likely? Which is least? It‚Äôs all guessing at this point.

In closing, there are some upcoming events encouraging people to hold. Earnings on Tuesday is a catalyst, though I doubt it will change much. Announcing a new CFO or giving clarity to Ryan Cohens position are also possible, these could provide a nice boost. People are leaving RH after they revealed that they don‚Äôt own the GME shares, meaning they‚Äôll have to buy them when people transfer out. Also, a new CFO could recall the shares since they are over 100%, which would be the catalyst with the most potential. Then DFV‚Äôs options, but people would have to hold until med-April for that. So .... if you‚Äôve held until now, why leave?




Staying over $200 & low volume are both due to people holding and the price being too high for new investors to buy in, at least not enough to move the needle, It really is that simple. There were some sketchy looking trade chart numbers (like 53 shares being bounced back and forth like 15-20 times in a row Friday), so I don‚Äôt doubt that the stock is being manipulated, but as someone else stated, entities are making a killing off of options.

As for supposed Citadel & Melvin spies on Reddit. Could be true, could be WSB members fuckin with them, there are a lot of members who hate the GME movement and crowd. Regardless, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs having much of an effect.

DFV clearly enjoys the position he is in. He has made a killing already, and being such an important individual to people has to be addicting. When he sells his position (or posts it if he has), that is all gone. There are people who don‚Äôt care about money to the level of others. I‚Äôm one of them, there isn‚Äôt a difference to me between $10 mil and $50. I‚Äôm a simple man with simple desires."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Less than 20% of the float is currently shorted last I read. VW may have only had 12% of the float shorted, but Porsche quietly acquired a 74% stake, while the local government of Saxony owned a 20.2% stake. On top of that, other institutions owned about 4%, so there was only about 1.8% of the float available to trade when Porsche made their position public. VW ran up 800%. GME ran up 1500%.  What‚Äôs happening now is a couple whales are duking it out, and the recent rise in price looks to have been triggered by a massive buy on the 24th that put a lot of MMs in a position where they had to buy to hedge a lot of open monthly calls that were close to being in the money. 

Just as many apes are brigading traditional investment subs as there are people trying to give advice to sell before the floor falls out again. 

DFV is under a lot of scrutiny so he needed to get back in. His original bet was $100 tops. He doesn‚Äôt have a crystal ball and he‚Äôs not a prophet. He made a great call and made millions but his holding means nothing. He‚Äôs also way in the green as the recent spike happened right after he bought back in. 

None of GME has been organic since mid February."
03/20/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs staying at over $200 because no one is really selling but you can see that over the past 2 weeks it has been slowly bleeding out to this level from a high of $300. MMs are making a killing from all this volatility selling options to both sides so why wouldn‚Äôt they let it run. There‚Äôs a lot of talk about hodling but I bet the next short attack will scare a lot of them into selling.

The short interest is too low for a large squeeze now (<15% of float) and being a value investor I hope he sees that. Also hopefully he realizes many of the new short positions are at higher prices.

The thought behind the gains on some of these COVID drugs was comparing it theraflu. The bet is COVID therapeutics aren't a one shot deal; that there would have to be regular vaccinations going forward and there would need to be stockpiling. It's also assumed that there will be a blank check to pay for the therapeutic as the govt will be paying for it."

03/20/2021,stocks,"GME has a long way to go before it‚Äôs actually worth $200 a share based purely on its fundamentals. It‚Äôs great that they are trying to shift their focus to their digital business, but every retailer started doing that last March when the pandemic started. To say they are transforming into a profitable e-commerce enterprise is putting the cart about three miles ahead of the horse. They‚Äôve got to show they can turn a profit again. Stocks are forward looking, yes, but it‚Äôs generally based on the current state of the business, which is not looking great for GameStop. It‚Äôs not an impossible transition, but just because they hired a guy from AWS and tapped Cohen to head a new committee doesn‚Äôt mean anything until there is data to show the transition is moving things in the right direction."

The hype behind it was reassuring at times, but I still feel lucky I got in at $38 and out at $300, when greed came close to getting the better of me. The reality of the situation is that I see a lot of real people who stand to lose everything if some major catalyst doesn't come along. The idea that they can continue to hold and trigger any type of squeeze is beyond unrealistic...but I truly understand why they're doing it.

03/20/2021,stocks,To your question about AMC. I'm not sure what was up but I was browsing the lvl 2 data Friday after someone mentioned it and have never seen anything like it. The orders were stacked both sides $.01 apart with 3-10k shares per price point. It would have take 30-50k shares to move it $.15 either way.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree with most of what you said, and thank you for your insightful reply. As my cost basis for the 11 shares I have is already minus, I'll continue to hold until it either gets even more crazy or dies down. I also plan on buying back in a little if it goes back down to <100, because I believe that it will take some time for this to be over.

I am not sure I can agree with the violent drop last week coming from a whale selling their position though. I believe institutions/whales would not sell a huge position all at once while in a strong uptrend, because that would cost them a shitload of money. It could happen while in a downtrend (even whales might panic), but why would you sell millions of shares for 170-350, if you could sell most of them for 350+?

Also, DFV 'only' has 500 options, which amounts to 50'000 shares. In the grand scheme of things, I don't think that will make a dent."

03/20/2021,stocks,"I fully agree that $200 per share is perhaps overpriced. But over at WSB, my alma mater, there are two ways to make money: YOLO chads and theta gang. Chads buy OTM weeklies, which usually expire worthless. Theta gang hu$tlers, on the other hand, sell options and collect premium. And because the IV is so ridiculously high, the premium is a lot more. Yes, as a theta gang hu$tler, my upside is capped (so no significant upside for me from the next gamma squeeze), but last week I generated a 26% return from selling cash covered puts. Plus, I am reducing my break even price with every weekly that I sell. My March 26 puts have a strike price of $195, but my breakeven price is only $146. This breakeven will reduce every time I sell subsequent weeklies.

When I was little, I would enter money cheat codes in video games and wonder: If only there was a way...."

A single call for next friday with a strike at $350 costs $6 per share. A strike at $450 is still at $4. That is absolutely insane. And the guy has like what, 100k shares?

He can make a happy half mill in a WEEK by selling calls that are incredibly unlikely to expire ITM and would still make him a millionaire if they somehow do."

On the other hand, if I have already been assigned, I start selling covered calls. And with every premium I collect, my breakeven price reduces.

2021-03-20 11:40:04,stocks,"A couple of hypotheticals about a private individual investing on a relative's behalf, without professional financial advisors or dependency Say, hypothetically, a ~~redditor such a myself~~ a friend I know has been approached by their mother - wanting *not* to invest in her own personal account, but to give cash for the son to invest in the son's own account for said mother, so in the future it can be given back to the mother *or* kept by the son in case she passes away. Neither person involved are professionals or financial advisors.

What are the legalities there? It *feels* like nothing is illegal or wrong ethically or morally, but my science brain wants 3rd party opinion and discussion because I'd rather not even accidentally be involved in financial crimes or whatnot.

If she were to slap down $100 buckos each month and say ""Put this into your account, under [$CARZ](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/CARZ) and [$BJK](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/BJK), and we'll see what happens?"" could there be potential ass-bitings in the future from black-suited gentlemen on the behalf of a government agency?

She's 58, on disability and has health issues. I suspect she may be trying to avoid disclosure to her boyfriend - which I don't think is a problem because they aren't married or jointly contracted to anything such as properties or loans - and also because I think *she thinks* that she's going to die soon, but I'm hesitant to move forward because I just can't figure out any legal standings on the matter; probably because I'm a google dipshit.

This is in Texas, and I guess for disclosure I hold VTI, VXUS, VNQ, BND, BNDX and a few solo stocks like Ford (I like the stock) and SIRI (A friendly wager with a friend on whether Sirius or XM radio stocks would take off, they ended up merging as SiriusXM and I hold one share as a fond memory).

I want to help, and she is dead-set on not opening her own brokerage account but rather 'gifting' said money over to be invested on her behalf in my own account.

I mean, my friend's. .............

I've spoken with her about her decision to take BJK and CARZ instead of say, VOO or the Qs and her literal response was ""I like Cirque Du Soleil and casinos, but don't want to gamble. Also cars are cool."" so I think it boils down to her version of 'I just like the stocks.' I've brought up the options of an HSA or even an ABLE account, but.. I'll be honest. This woman spent the 70's and 80's, even up to today, at biker bars hustling people on pool tables. If she tells a man ""No"" then not even a thunderbolt from God can change her mind.

So I guess the TLDR is, 'is it legal for someone to invest a relative's money on a relative's behalf in their own brokerage while not being a professional' and ""would said individuals needs to draft any documentation to prevent legal fuckery in the future?"""

As for capital gains, I have this thing I do where if I want to invest, say, $100 in a stock I actually throw $85 at the stock and $15 into a savings account, specifically to cover those potential capital gains taxes of 15%. It... may not be the most 'best' idea but it's worked for me.

""Similarly, unlimited gifts to medical facilities or other healthcare professionals are allowed gift-tax free to cover a person's medical expenses. It's important in these two cases, however, that you make the gifts directly to the educational or medical provider. Giving money to the student or patient takes away the exclusion and makes the gift potentially subject to tax.""

I am a legal healthcare provider to my grandma and my older brother who has autism. So even if she somehow gave me more than $15k in gift cash, if the said gift cash was invested in order to help cover future healthcare costs for the grandmother or my brother, there could be additional legal stuff I should ask an actual fiduciary about."

You do bring up a good point because my mom does have brothers of her own who are mostly good people. One is a total shit-bird constantly asking to borrow money from grandma and never paying her back, the other two uncles have cut him off. One is a plastics engineer in China and the other is a penny stocks guy heavily in debt, living in California.

Man, my family is wild.

Anyway I literally have a total lifetime debt currently of.. $322 (three hundred twenty two dollars - no commas in that bitch). So I figure my mom looked around and decided to ask me for financial help because I'm not as much as a complete dickhead as the rest of the family lol.

03/20/2021,stocks,"the best way to protect yourself is avoid chasing trends and pay attention to valuation. everything tends to revert to the mean, so you want to avoid too much exposure to over-valued stocks. 

here's an example, about how history repeats itself. 

my wife and I both have the Dodge & Cox stock fund in our 401k plans. DODGX. it's a large cap value fund dating back to the 1960s. Dodge & Cox has a very good reputation in the business, they've been around since the 1930s and are widely respected in their niche. Jack Boggle of Vanguard singled out Dodge & Cox as one of a handful of active managers he would recommend. they're conservative (in the best sense), had reasonable fees and a long-term planning mindset, and were employee-owned so the company's goals lined up with customers. 

when the Dot-Com bubble happened 20 years ago and everyone was chasing trendy tech stocks, Dodge and Cox didn't buy any of the high-flyers. why? those stocks were crazy overvalued, and they buy only fairly valued or under-valued assets. so DODGX lagged the market for a few years. but when the Dot-Com bubble crashed, DODGX came back with a vengeance and outperformed the market averages for a while. 

the same thing happened this year. 2020 was a banner year for growth funds. DODGX lagged. but this year, it's the strongest performing fund in either of our 401ks. 

like Warren Buffett says, you can't time the market but you can know today if something is fairly valued or not."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Yea, you can do that. It's just a lot easier to predict volatility going down than going up, at least in my experiences. 

I've also recently been closing off and consolidating a lot of my positions in preparation for the bubble bursting. However, I'm not taking the approach of trying to find stuff that will go up during the next big correction. I'm positioning myself to buy the dip. 

All in all, I wouldn't worry too much about a huge market correction at least through summer. The economy is picking back up, the vaccines are launching, stimulus package benefits are rolling out, the Fed has inflation and unemployment under control'ish, and right now there's a lot of liquidity floating around the equities markets. 

At least through the summer, I have a sizable portion of my portfolio in oil and energy. There's a lot of potential in that sector because they still haven't completely recovered from COVID. So I'm not super worried about them taking a hit if we get hit with a surprise correction. Never forget black gold!"

2021-03-20 10:24:13,stocks,"Coinbase‚Äôs Direct Listing Pushed Back to April Coinbase Global Inc., the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, is now aiming to go public in April after its plans for a direct listing this month have slipped, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because it was private.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been reviewing the company‚Äôs plans for a direct listing, an alternative to a traditional initial public offering.

A representative for Coinbase declined to comment.

This week, Coinbase‚Äôs backers registered for as many as 114.9 million shares to trade when the stock lists. In a direct listing, investors can begin selling their holdings as soon as a company starts trading rather than waiting for the expiration of a lockup period -- typically up to six months in an IPO.

Investment firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures are among those whose shares could trade, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong and Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam have also registered stock.

Coinbase shares have changed hands at $200 to $375.01 in private transactions this year, the filing shows. The volume-weighted average price per share for transactions from January through March 15 was $343.58, which would give Coinbase a public market valuation of about $67.6 billion, based on the total number of shares outstanding as of Monday. The fully diluted value -- including employee incentive plans and restricted stock units -- would be significantly higher.

The debut will be the first major direct listing to take place on the Nasdaq. All such previous listings were on the New York Stock Exchange, including those by Spotify Technology SA, Slack Technologies Inc., Asana Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and Roblox Corp., which listed this month.

Coinbase‚Äôs latest financial statements revealed that the company is making money, setting it apart from many other startups when they make their public debuts. Coinbase swung from a loss to a profit of $322 million last year on net revenue that more than doubled to $1.14 billion.

[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/coinbase-s-direct-listing-pushed-back-to-april-1.1579729](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/coinbase-s-direct-listing-pushed-back-to-april-1.1579729)"
03/20/2021,stocks,"They obviously don't want to list in the current market conditions right now lol. I do not blame them at all. This being a direct listing really makes this intriguing. I think I am in. They have too much market share to ignore. Though after it settles it will trade in tandem with bitcoin. So if you own a lot of crypto, you may want to pass."
03/20/2021,stocks,I feel like this is the most overhyped IPO. I hope everyone realizes Square does exactly what coinbase does plus a whole lot more minus a few shitcoins.
03/20/2021,stocks,I heard the BlockFi CEO saying they were going to do the same thing by letting current customers buy shares before public offering. Seems like an interesting strategy when your current customer base are all investment minded folks.
03/20/2021,stocks,Listing the first day with a 500 USD price tag per share minimum. Give me a break!
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yeah, no.

They get enough of my money with fees, and for this reason, I‚Äôm out."
03/20/2021,stocks,"This is gonna be crazy, is Coinbase worth that. When it IPO will it go the Airbnb route and debut at much higher range"
03/20/2021,stocks,"would read if someone did a good DD on $COIN.
Thinking of going balls deep if it is not IPO."
03/20/2021,stocks,"There's an aspect of this where I'm really not into it, and I can't quite put my finger on it. And that's coming from a person who bought a few hundred thousand in RBLX and who uses coinbase for all their b tc transactions. I think mainly I feel like the space has become encroached by other players. If they did this three years ago, I'd have been on it."
03/20/2021,stocks,"This‚Äôll open up just like Roblox. A bloated pig that‚Äôs overvalued and too much excitement.

I‚Äôll wait 6 months for a 50% off discount or buy on the next crypto bear market.

We‚Äôre all in agreement it‚Äôs going up start trading at 100+B, right?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Been wondering when $COIN was goin up... sounds almost like they wanna pull a rblx instead of an ipo... 
A Dpo... Either way this is a large object on my radar, I like the stock."
03/20/2021,stocks,Been waiting for this! I wonder if it's better to buy as soon as market opens on DPO day or wait for a potential drop...
03/20/2021,stocks,What does Square do that Coinbase doesn‚Äôt? and vice versa?
03/20/2021,stocks,Square sells Bitcoin at a higher price than they buy it for. That‚Äôs how they‚Äôre able to get away with not charging you any fees.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm not a Blockfi user yet, anyway I can get involved? Is there any media about it? Thanks."
03/20/2021,stocks,What an awesome idea
03/20/2021,stocks,"I mean pre pandemic AirBnB was turning a profit. And so is Coinbase apparently. They are true disrupters who are actual companies, not just trading on sales."
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you look  Roblox you see the price was remarkably steady so far. Now, remember Palantir? They listed for 9.75 and it went 3 times as much within 3 months."
03/20/2021,stocks,Square gives you a bank account/debit card allows you to send money to friends like venmo and invest in crypto with much less fees than coinbase. I just looked at auto investing in bitcoin daily. $10 daily there was a .22 fee on Cash App and .99 fee on coinbase.
03/20/2021,stocks,Sentence doesn't make sense. Also they charge fees.
03/20/2021,stocks,I just saw the Ceo on MeetKevin's Youtube show and he mentioned taking the company public sometime this year.
03/20/2021,stocks,what is coinbase disrupting??
03/20/2021,stocks,"But the valuation to profit , that imp right ?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I've never used Cash App.  Does it allow you to make limit orders?

The fees on Coinbase Pro are better than regular Coinbase. Frankly, I'm not sure why Coinbase exists.  There should just be Coinbase Pro."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You‚Äôre not getting a good deal on the Bitcoin you buy, basically"
03/20/2021,stocks,Don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre disrupting anything themselves. Just Bitcoin and crypto in general I guess
03/20/2021,stocks,"No it doesn‚Äôt, I hate cash app. You just hit buy or sell and get whatever it wants"
03/20/2021,stocks,Don't believe so but I think they'll keep making it better. They do have frequency trading which is nice. I personally haven't used cash app to buy Bitcoin but I'm going to start for DCA.
03/20/2021,stocks,I mean if you're trading it I would understand but it's .0001 differences if you hodle I don't think it make much difference would be interesting to know if the difference in fee makes up for the spread difference
03/20/2021,stocks,Yup but there is a plethora of Bitcoin exchanges and some are starting to waive fees which is a well I wouldn't call barrier to entry but I'm not loyal to an exchange so if it's safe secure and free I'll switch and it's super easy to do so
03/20/2021,stocks,"Without limit orders, I‚Äôm dubious that you‚Äôre really getting a better deal on BTC with Cash App than Coinbase Pro. Just because they list a lower fee doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt making up the difference in the exchange rate."
03/20/2021,stocks,I use coinbase pro but they don't have DCA. So was going to use DCA on square. For large orders of def use cbp. I don't think the limit order really matters tho just need to know which has a better spread.
2021-03-20 10:16:36,stocks,"How much cash should you have reserved to buy the dip? What do you do when you have no more to buy those dips? There‚Äôs been a lot of great opportunities to buy the dips recently but I find myself without cash very quickly because I just go all in when I think a certain stock has bottomed out. 

What‚Äôs your strategy for buying the dips and replenishing your buying power?"
03/20/2021,stocks,A job is a solid idea to replenish your buying power. What other solution were you possibly hoping to hear?
03/20/2021,stocks,Typically 10 percent in a normal market. The November to January run though I think everyone got to being fully invested and more. Right now... probably 30 percent. The bond market will take the 10 yr to 2 percent and we will correct significantly again. That is when I think we bottom. But I am 40 percent cash now after liquidating my bank positions that I was up huge in and some industrials. And I am going to buy the tech I want on every day the market gets slaughtered and continue to add to them when they get slaughtered. I think they make up any loss by August even if they correct another 25 percent.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Think it will depend entirely on how much you‚Äôre able to invest. If you can only put away ¬£200 or ¬£50 per month, you‚Äôre never going to have that cash reserve available - and you shouldn‚Äôt dip into the emergency fund, because that‚Äôs not what it is for.

If you‚Äôre stinking rich already, who fucking cares? üòõ

If you‚Äôre well off enough to be splashing thousands into the market, I wouldn‚Äôt even bother timing it. Just plough it in at every opportunity."
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you are keeping cash on the sidelines then your risk tolerance is not 100% equities. 

What is your desired asset allocation? What is your emergency fund? 

If you are asking how much cash to keep then you need to look at all your assets and make a better plan. Include your spouse so he/she and you are on the same page. 

My wife wants nothing to do with it but at the end of the year i give her an asset summary and offer to go over it all. She only ever wants to know the total. She also has near zero idea where any of it is, invested in, etc. But she is happy to let me handle it all."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sometimes I sell off some of my stable stocks to buy the ones that took the biggest dip, so far its been working out..."
03/20/2021,stocks,I never hold cash to buy the dip. Never know if there ever will be one. Better have time in the market than to time the market.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Have emergency fund, dump extra paycheck money into investments, there is no timing the market, if you could you‚Äôd be a trillionaire"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I usually have quite a bit of money riding on my long term investments, however I always watch for fast moving pinksheets for my free funds chilling in my account. I'll get into the pinksheet for usually less than a week, pull it all out and repeat."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I would wait till Dow or nasdaq has 2 week positive outlook, otherwise this market could go down for another 2 months or more.  Things are too unstable to be buying dips for me."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Remember not to spend more than 50% as it ALWAYS can get worse. 
I keep 50% cash and if I dip into it because of amazing buying opportunity, I sell something that made money/lost least money within a day or two to bring it back to 50%."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I only just learned about doing your best to find the trend lines for the last few weeks/months/year; just so you know where you are relative to the recent stock price highs and lows. 

It was just a few days ago I made the mistake of not judging how low SFT can dip. Invested @9.60 and averaged my position down all day til I had about $20k in SFT@9.20, and it KEPT dipping. I got scared and sold the next day, wiped out 99% of my profit that I had slowly scalped the last two weeks (~$2k). The very next day SFT popped back up to 9.30 at one point, I was so upset with myself."
03/20/2021,stocks,"The more you think bear market is coming, weigh your portfolio heavier on speculative value assets.  These are less likely to be effected by market wide dips, but also hold nice upside.  Treat them as cash, and sell them to buy more of your bread & butter longterm holds when the bear comes."
03/20/2021,stocks,"every time i sell something, i go in another stock with 50% and set aside the other 50%. i usually save the money set aside to buy on red days"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have around 10 percent cash on the side that I don't think I'll touch unless there's a big, big crash. Covid has severely impacted me putting money into my account on a regular basis because of my job loss.

WRT the question, this past week I sold stock that was trading sideways and remained pretty stable throughout the recent dips (i.e my least volatile, long term, safe stock). This gave me some liquidity and allowed me to buy the dip, which I'll sell off and reinvest into the initial value stock again when the ship steadies. I might lose 1% on the value stock, but gain 5-8% on the growth stock.

Market has been very volatile lately, so I might reduce positions in a few growth stocks in a few weeks if they go up and invest it in value stock to give me a little more insurance and access to liquidity."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I never have less than 25% of my non retirement accounts in cash. If I start to get to the point where I am dipping into this reserve, then I am not investing very well. I save this for very short term trades, and big dips. Both of which I won‚Äôt keep the trade for very long and get right back to my 25% in cash."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Newbie here,  but I've been using a strategy similar to something I read here. 50% of my portfolio in long term stocks that major investors own (Berkshire) 40% in companies I personally believe or to Swing, and 10% for fun. So if an opportunity arises,  I have money ready to buy."
03/20/2021,stocks,"When I go all-in 100%, that‚Äôs when I know the market has topped out!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"15-20%.  Large enough to make a sizable dent in dollar cost averaging down, small enough that I don't sweat the missed opportunities.  Buying the dip IS opportunities, so even though it looks like the cash isn't making returns, that is because you just don't see it.  


As for how to replenish it, if your savings are sub 100K, then just contributing monthly should do the trick. Once your portfolio balance exceeds your deposit capability to maintain 15% then you would benefit by staggering your ""maturity"" dates for your plays assuming you are a more active investor with specific timelines for when you expect to see each of your position mature.  You can then use these times to rebalance your free cash position.  


If you are a passive investor, then you simply rebalance twice a year or quarterly if that suits you."
03/20/2021,stocks,"As a Canadian who uses questrade, it's important for me to realize that I may want to buy a dip on the Canadian market or a US market. Given that questrade charges a conversion rate, I need to consider either selling a stock in the denomination that I want to buy a dip in, or have that a sum of cash sitting in that denomination to buy a dip with. I find journaling takes too long to buy a dip with, as such, I only have a little that I leave sitting as cash, and this is generally only to buy options if I see a stock about to head in a certain direction."
03/20/2021,stocks,100pc
03/20/2021,stocks,"I keep 10 percent normally.  But I have 100% cash now in my non retirement fund - worth a little less than my house.  Liquidated a closed end fund a month ago that was over valued - which dropped 15% after I sold.  

Weird position for me to be in.  Besides some day trading I do a couple times a week, I'm just holding cash for 2-3 months to see if something happens.  Kills me not to be earning dividends, but day trades on technology stuff is earning some money."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Never go full in, so you always have cash.  Invest over time by buying dips.  I have only been investing for a few months, but I can tell you this for a fact. I have never gained profit without averaging down my position at least 2 or 3 times."
03/20/2021,stocks,*jotting down notes*
03/20/2021,stocks,Well I was thinking amongst the lines of skimming off equity or profits when opportunity comes up or even selling off one stock for another with greater potential. My wife doesn‚Äôt want me putting any more money into the brokerage account
03/20/2021,stocks,"Ugh, I play WSB so I don't have to waste my life at a job!"
03/20/2021,stocks,The truth
03/20/2021,stocks,Can you explain the bond market sentence for a noob?
03/20/2021,stocks,"Dick fell into a filthy ditch.  
Now he's stinkin' Rich."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that's the optimal situation, wife doesn't need to know what we are necessarily investing. They just need to know if we feel secured about our investments.

Even most are down on the portfolio, the previous year(s) made up for it. The fact that no one continue to average down routinely, and asking people on reddit about whether this is a good time to not put more cash in what they deem the potential winner for years to come, is rather absurd to me.

If one has 6 months emergency fund reserved, and want to build more into it, just set that cash aside to build a 9 months emergency fund, 1 year, 2 year, if partners feel insecured. That's the way to do it. Not to buy what op think as a dip.  No one knows if there's any dip anyway."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree in most cases, but think there are exceptions, contrary to popular belief, esp when the markets are super high. If you bought in February 2020, you could've been screwed in your portfolio, of course it recovered by summer, but there was no certainty it would've at the time, and even then there would've been lots of loss opportunity to have no cash to buy anything that time enter March 2020. Similarly, if you bought Tesla or Ark ETFs last month, you're pretty much bleeding money everyday right now, with another period of uncertainty when it will rise again. If it really does crash like some believe, having no cash would be a loss opportunity, to have so many great deals, but no ammo to buy anything."
03/20/2021,stocks,"OP surely doesn't have enough emergency fund, otherwise who would ask to buy a dip, imo."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Or, just buy when it go down and buy when it go up.

Easy peasy."
03/20/2021,stocks,"alternatively, you can diversify your portfolio into low beta (usually value play) and high beta stock (usually growth)."
03/20/2021,stocks,That is WAY too much cash.  What a waste. I say closer to 5%.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have two active trading accounts, one I deposit to frequently and the other I use to see how much I can X my original deposit lol.

In my first account I'm bogle heavy and DCA in like a good boy.

In the latter I make dozens of trades a day. A 5% spike for a stock means I sell 10-25% almost instantly. I will buy 10-25% if it dips 5%, if it dips again with no slowdown in sight I might just cut my losses and wait out the dip. If we end on a green day I'll probably trim 10% from my highest daily +% stocks. If they're green again in the morning and momentum is still high I might just buy back lol. For insane stocks like GME I'll have 5 stop orders with plenty of limit sell orders to take profits on the way up.

I basically know my desired long term positions (eg 3 NVDA) but will constantly be at 1-4 shares while I'm daytrading to lock in profits. I never sell my entire position unless I don't want to trade the stock anymore, and I will almosy never hold more than 2x my position (eg 6 NVDA)

Overall: highly time consuming, fun, but honestly feels agile. I rarely take big losses, almost always realize some gains, and always have a little cash to work with unless it's like a full week straight of red."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Loaning money to the government, at a pre-agreed interest and essentially guaranteed return (significantly less return, but backed by the full force and integrity of the US government if US bonds.)

Typically you would always maintain a portion of your networth in this as a protection against market corrections.  You do however have to also factor in what inflation will eat out of it.  The Intelligent Investor recommends somewhere betwen 25/75 to 75/25 bonds/stocks weighted both against your own time and attention dedicated to watching your stocks and the anticipation for the direction of the stock market in the future as best you can."
03/20/2021,stocks,I do have an emergency fund. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking about strategy with the money or stocks you already have in your brokerage account. I don‚Äôt want to simply deposit more money when there‚Äôs a dip.

It goes up => buy more to ride the uptrend"
03/20/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/20/2021,stocks,I aim for 10% but really struggle maintaining that.
03/20/2021,stocks,"To each it‚Äôs own.
I have main account which is 100% safely invested and much smaller gambling account which I try to keep at 50% cash."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Look into close-end fund, high dividend yield stocks as passive income. A few I have been suggested to some of my group mates, close-end fund, USA, Stock, PPL, MO EPD, PAA (the later 2 are partnership, so K-1 could be a hassle), then some Russian stocks like MBT, SBRCY (these will have ADR fee.  These gives 5 to 10% dividend if that's what you think as alternative profit strategy.

About close end fund, I use the 2019 ones, USA was one of the top ones in 2019, have like 8 to 9% at the time after expense ratio, but 2021 has less, had STK and some other Pimco fund as well, they did paid quite well of dividend.

https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/cefs/602170/the-10-best-closed-end-funds-cefs-for-2021

The ultimate goal is gain as much as 7 figures in a short time, let say 2 to 3 years,  and then shift to an passive income strategy. That means a well researched company at a pivotal point of profiting and products and services just going to become mainstream and monopoly soon, and hold on the shares, swallow the risk and volatility of market. There are plenty of them last year, and very few this year as competition started (I am not talking about EV).

Do not sit with cash on the sideline, if you have enough emergency fund already, imo. Investment fund is meant to be invested. And waiting for a dip is just as hard as holding your potential winners.

Some go with a simple All-weather portfolio percentage of 30% VTI, 7.5% GSG, 7.5% GLD,  15% IEI, 40% TLT, and tweak it/leverage some according to different economic cycles, but this is kind of professional grade stuff."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yeah, ok. 

Good luck timing the market."
03/20/2021,stocks,Then you‚Äôre not 50% cash...
03/20/2021,stocks,"Finally another closed end fund investor!   Held PFD, FFC, JPL.   Just dumped PFD which had a ridiculous premium.  Honestly, the high dividends have a bad side of eating into the share price over time..   And you have to watch the ROC of funds that eat themselves.   I'm going to hold them only when the market has doldrums."
03/20/2021,stocks,Exactly. I think people fail to realize that the market is already acting as if yields will go to 2%. When it does people will poop their pants and sell while smart money buys then we rip and the people who panic sell miss out of 5-10% rip. Just my two cents.

03/20/2021,stocks,"I have played XLE for the best part of last year, your best bet is to roll out"
03/20/2021,stocks,"The price of oil has been paper and not real prices. I work in oilfield services marketing and we are not going to market new products until Q3 at the earliest. Our customers in Saudi and Chevron are not spending a dime... pay attention to the rig count guys and even the volume of job listings. Pretty much 10 to 20 percent head count was cut. It was a blood bath... again.    
OP you are pretty deep into this. You may get lucky, but maybe its better to hope and if it does not happen... just take the loss and move on. See if you can get some gains back until say mid day Thursday and if you sell at a loss, you may have won the battle."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think that is seriously doubtful in the next 5 to 10 years. To do a full build out of infrastructure, the amount of petrochemicals needed will go up. I think we have not hit peak oil. 

The reason to not be long oil is not ESG or consumption... its because its entire survival is based around a bunch of countries in the Middle East who can not get along with each other. The Saudis have blown up the market 2 times in 10 years and in North America it is just drill baby drill and it kills the price of oil. It is illegal to fix prices in the United States, which is a shame because there are a ton of small operators in the Permian who are complete morons, and do not understand supply and demand."
03/20/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs definitely likely with renewables becoming more common and electric cars becoming less expensive. This was more of a short term thing although I do believe that the top energy companies right now will lead the charge into oil. If they‚Äôre smart they‚Äôd use the billions of dollars they have to try and sustain themselves.
2021-03-20 08:40:14,stocks,"Could AMZN be in 2050 what KO is to investors today What I mean by this is that companies like KO are seen as slow-growth, value companies with wide market share over a core product / service and a decent moat.

Everyone will get a bottled beverage from time to time and it will likely come from KO. It's difficult to penetrate the beverage market because you need marketing, a brand, and an efficient supply chain. Buffett realized this with KO and it worked well for him.

However, KO is not going to be seeing monster growth, compared to something like a small cap, because everyone is already chugging beverages anyway.

Could AMZN become KO? In the sense that building out warehousing, a large-capacity E-commerce marketplace, and efficient shipping logistics (1 and 2 day) are large moats unlikely to be beaten by newcomers? Might not see monster growth because everyone around me is already saying ""check on Amazon,"" but it seems good own for slow-steady growth.

Thinking about buying some AMZN and slapping it in an IRA, seems like a decent idea but wondering other people's thoughts on the security of AMZN as a long-term investment."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You describe Amazon just as an online store. Amazon is the market leader on cloud computing with aws. They have plays on video, music streaming, ai assistance, publishing, kindles, tablets with an entire ecosystem around them."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Coca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures in 1982 and ended up selling it to Sony 7 years later. Amazon is certainly capable of hitting a similar wall with one of their growth ideas, Whole Foods or their healthcare business for example."
03/20/2021,stocks,"AMZN isn‚Äôt going anywhere, so I think yes"
03/20/2021,stocks,"There are only three companies I feel comfortable buying and not having to look at and know they‚Äôll do well in a decade- Amazon, Berkshire, and Brookfield Asset Management. 2050 is too far off to make a prediction, in 2000 you probably would have been into GE and 2010 into Exxon Mobile; neither of which have performed well. You‚Äôre better off with VT or VTI for that time frame.

Amazon will likely get broken up in some shape or form this decade but still has great long term potential and a very enduring culture. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass to value and I usually just look at P/FCF as a guiding ratio and see how it compares to historicals, right now it seems fair."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Can't imagine AMZN will reward investors as much in the next 25 years as they have this past 25 years, ... but still very likely to be a very ""safe"" bet. I'd like to think they'll follow CSCO, MSFT and AAPL and start paying DIVs. Regardless, can't imagine you'd regret slapping some away in an IRA for the long term."
03/20/2021,stocks,It‚Äôs at $1.5 trillion market cap. It would come down quite a bit or trade flat for decades before it becomes like KO as a value stock.

03/20/2021,stocks,"I feel like Amazon has only begun that stuff, though.  I feel like they have a lot of room to grow there--when you consider probably the main competition there, Wal-mart, who has refused to innovate much I can see Amazon doing things that steal Wally World marketshare in the long run."
03/20/2021,stocks,Do you have evidence for your assertion that amazon will be broken up or you‚Äôre just spitballing
03/20/2021,stocks, I have no opinion about that.
03/20/2021,stocks,"The House antitrust committee has been pretty clear on signaling this, Biden‚Äôs Exec branch picks support it as well. This is one of the few issues with significant bipartisan support, I‚Äôm not spitballing here. I think the question isn‚Äôt whether they get broken up but how. I think an AWS spinoff is a given, but the bigger question is how they‚Äôll operate Marketplace (eg Amazon can‚Äôt sell on its own platform). Note this isn‚Äôt necessarily bad for shareholders, in fact it is likely good- the baby bells from ATT and oil breakups from Standard Oil did phenomenally.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Even if they‚Äôre not broken up, the increased scrutiny may deter them from making as many acquisitions going forward, which does help smaller companies gain ground on them."
03/20/2021,stocks,Did you read the house antitrust section on Amazon?
03/20/2021,stocks,"If they broke up first party selling from Marketplace it might end up more profitable overall. As a seller you notice many instances where the algorithms that are heavily weighted in Amazon the sellers favor reduce profits overall. Like during times of high demand the buy box is supposed to show you the best price that‚Äôs available to ship right away. But there were times that Amazon was out of stock on something and instead of giving the buy box to one of the third party sellers who they would have made more profit off of, they kept their own listing up with several weeks back date. Often this would be seasonal stuff that was not going to even be needed in a few weeks."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Nope, just summaries and interviews with the committee members. It was convincing enough for me. 

Do you have an argument for why they won‚Äôt be broken up?"
03/20/2021,stocks,Yeah. Read the report and read the arguments they put forth about Amazon‚Äôs anticompetitive conduct. Then fit it to current antitrust law. I read the report. It‚Äôs not going to happen
03/20/2021,stocks,"Typically to break up a company, there must be some sort of harm to the consumer and there is no other remedy but a breakup. Arguably breaking up Amazon will hurt the consumer because Amazon retail will no longer have the profit center of AWS which has enabled Amazon to invest into their core retail business and improve the consumer experience."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Current antitrust law likely won‚Äôt work. They‚Äôre going to have to pass new legislation. Likely will happen this decade. There isn‚Äôt a lot out there you can get AOC and Hawley to agree on, this is one of those things. We can just agree to disagree."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Here‚Äôs a pretty seminal paper by Lina Khan on how Amazon causes consumer harm. This made waves in the legal community when published. Biden just nominated her for an FTC post.

The belt and road initiative in china was an infrastructure plan that put China in massive debt -- but wait, wait, Chinese Banks now represent the top 5 largest banks in the world. Why didn't they care about debt? Because they understand how investments work, and how investing in your country with a long term goal is a good thing.

Here in America it's always short term, and always acting like the ""taxpayer"", whatever that means, is some how missing money -- some how the taxpayer expects a return on investment, or that we're all in this together as ""taxpayers"". We're not at all in this together as ""taxpayers"", I don't care about the national debt, neither do most poor people. Nobody cares about all the missing money taxpayers see go down the drain at the defense department -- that's why they have never been audited. It's a false narrative. Western countries are losing the global economic battle due to austerity, trickle down theory and massive corruption. It will fail miserably, we need to invest in infrastructure because it is 40 years overdue according to the national engineering society."

This may be true, but you know what they're not doing? Trying to overthrow democracy, or proudly carrying racist flags like a badge of honor. They're not telling people that only the strong will survive this pandemic, and they're not stabbing people for being told to wear a mask.

So I'll happily take overspenders as opposed to people who openly support conspiracy theories with no proof, call for open insurrection, make sexual comments about their daughter, and let's not forget, openly complimented Jeffrey Epstein's taste in young women at the height of Epstein's facilitating of pedophile elites."

AOC is the dems bulldog, she has tons of populist support, engages with younger voters, and brings in the more leftwing/leftist elements, whose favor she continues to curry with by introducing these kinds of ideologically partisan bills that have no chance at passing. This lets the pragmatist dems come to the table with ""compromises"" that can actually pass without alienating the young and more leftwing voters."

How about the leftover rods how clean is a nuclear rod that has a million year half life, or a MoX rod that has a billion year half life. Nuke plants can be somewhat clean, until they are not, then there are very large swaths of land that are uninhabitable.

To anyone that thinks nuclear energy is clean, RESEARCH DEPLETED URANIUM!!!
Why is everyone so scared of Iran and North Korea building nuke plants, if it‚Äôs so ‚ÄúClean‚Äù. There is another side to what the plants produce, and that is the opportunity for Weapons Grade Plutonium.

The news also told you that Biden was going to win by 20% and Hillary was going to win period in a landslide. They lie, they skew polls to make them look more likely. Just like they are telling you that 70% of republicans want gun control measures. They are lying, they were lying then. Most republican constituents did not want a larger debt, they didn‚Äôt want more funding to go to the teachers unions or bailing out state pension funds.

To me, the news was telling you lies, and you bought it. How about those riots last year, were they democracy? How about the Portland riots last week, was that democracy? Dumb people get caught up In the moment and do dumb things. 
Turn off the news, read opposing views. Understand the full picture, big things are a happening and you‚Äôre blaming a handful of people. It‚Äôs much bigger than those trumpians.

However, if Congress passes a reconciliation bill affecting more than one of those topics, it cannot pass another reconciliation bill later in the year affecting one of the topics addressed by the previous reconciliation bill. In practice, reconciliation bills have usually been passed once per year at most"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Exceptions to the filibuster are certainly not a new thing. Republicans used it to push through Supreme Court nominations, and the exception also benefits the other party the next time they have a majority in the senate. Civil rights bills in particular also have a very racist history with filibustering, with the longest ever filibuster (25 continuous hours) to try and stop the civil rights act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination and enforced desegregation of schools and the right to vote. 

Not to mention that this whole debate about the filibuster is asinine to begin with. If republicans (or democrats for that matter) don‚Äôt agree with something, they should put their vote on the record for what they‚Äôre fighting for. And if republicans are worried that more civil rights will hurt them electorally, maybe they should change their fucking platform."

03/20/2021,stocks,That may be but it seems like estimates for future costs like land acquisition and construction are often wildly unrealistic.
03/20/2021,stocks,The point is that everyone claims that HSR is wasteful is somehow claiming that they can see the future. We all have seen historic examples of big ambitious projects which had been painful during construction but really paid off in the long run. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs wasteful‚Äù is a useless analysis as it‚Äôs not backed by anything but emotions.

I can‚Äôt find a single person that needed the stimulus payments. Not one. If you‚Äôve lost a job, you‚Äôre already being covered by the EI program.

In the span of ten months, nine blockbuster events have been fully realized: Nikola (NKLA), Hyliion (HYLN), Velodyne Lidar (VLDR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE), ChargePoint (CHPT), QuantumScape (QS), Stem Inc. (future STEM), Lion Electric (future LEV), and PureCycle Technologies (PCT).

Two of the most recent ones, in fact, have nothing to do with EV startups.

The future Stem Inc. has just had the second-best-ever ""IPO pop"" before ticker change. Such ""IPO pop"" is second only to that of Hyliion.

Just yesterday, PureCycle Technologies was fully realized as a blockbuster event, as its ""IPO pop"" before ticker change was most impressive."

2021-03-20 06:45:20,stocks,"ARK: Tesla 2025 Price Target Update https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/


New Tesla 2025 price target from ARK:

1.	Bull case $4K
2.	Bear case $1.5K
3.	Expected value $3K

Tidbits:

""In our last valuation model, ARK assumed that Tesla had a 30% chance of delivering fully autonomous driving in the five years ended 2024. Now, ARK estimates that the probability is 50% by 2025.""

""ARK Invest: A human-driven ride-hail service could boost Tesla‚Äôs price target in ARK‚Äôs bear case significantly""

""Key updates to our model:

We pushed our forecast price target forward one year to 2025.[2]
We refined our estimates for Tesla‚Äôs capital efficiency.
We added Tesla‚Äôs insurance business to our model.
We added assumptions for a human-driven ride-hail service.
We increased the probability of Tesla achieving fully autonomous driving within five years."""
03/20/2021,stocks,"Ok.  I'll be the bear here.  You can downvote me later.  I'll try to be as mean and as bearish as possible.

Disclaimer: I like Tesla.  I respect Musk for innovating in areas where everyone else scoffed at and dismissed.  I respect that.  It's improving society and the world.

Bear Case:

This is all just getting ridiculous and too much.  Investing needs to return to reality.  It will be better for everyone.

How do you even begin to value a software, car, insurance, battery, ride-hail service company?  What margins do you use?  What revenues?  Do you take the high margins from software and combine them with the massive revenues of automotive?

It's like a forecast of the Frankenstein monster company; stitched together with the best pieces of each sector.  Should we also add in dividend projections from the utility sector for Tesla's solar farm business?

All of this is just getting too crazy and makes less practical sense each day.  A company like this has never existed in human history!  But this time is different?  Why?  Because a fund manager who is hemorrhaging money (and - for great emphasis - not projected to hemorrhage money in the *future* \- but, is hemorrhaging money *today*) needs it to be true?  Because she is trying to save face before her whale clients pack up and leave?

Also, I thought they forecasted self driving to be live and in use across society by 2018.   And that failed.  I thought they were re-projecting a minimum of 10+ more years to solve the harder problems of dealing with visual impairments like snow and rain?  It's why most of the testing is stuck in the blue sky of Nevada and Arizona.  I think all the easy AI problems got solved 10 years ago - only the super hard ones are left.

And why do they believe Tesla is the most probable company to deliver this technology?  I don't know; I like Tesla and all, but, are they really going to beat Google, Amazon, and Apple in an AI tech race?  That seems highly improbable actually - not probable.

And then, there's this argument that Tesla is so far ahead of the other auto manufacturers; which is a true and factual statement.  However, it is not the complete picture.  The other auto manufacturers are always behind in technology.  They choose to be this way.  When the new inventions and technologies mature and arrive, they work out deals with the patent holders for the rights to put the tech in their cars.  They've always done this.  They are essentially outsourcing large portions of R&D.

So, what happens if just about any other company in the world discovers and patents important EV and self driving technologies other than Tesla?

In addition, another more prudent question is: Is Tesla beating Google and other silicon valley start-ups in AI and EV?  I don't think the answer to that question is obvious at all.  I think Tesla might actually be behind Google!  Waymo looks pretty promising.  And this goes back to the Frankenstein company dilemma.  You are rating the tech strength in Tesla to the tech strength in an auto company - which everyone already knows is weighted in favor of Tesla.  But, you are not punishing the Tesla valuation for its small revenues when compared to a true, auto giant.

(And, again, I really like Tesla - but I think the current share price is much, much risker than a lot of people realize.  They really need to deliver multiple world changing innovations at scale.)"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Two years ago, Cathie said Tesla would go to $4,000 (pre-split) and people thought she was overly optimistic and insane. This year, people are still calling her price targets insane even though she's been spot on. Next year, when it soars they'll call her price targets insane again."
03/20/2021,stocks,"The honest reality here is that no matter how absurd you think these claims are or aren‚Äôt, the input from a bunch of Redditors on a stock subreddit isn‚Äôt as reliable to the people who actively run a multiple billion dollar asset managing company."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I love where her bear case involves Tesla launching an Uber/Lyft competitor that then grows to be twice the size of Uber and Lyft combined, all in 4 years.

Outside of the fact that it‚Äôs laughable to believe that would happen, that would also mean Tesla would somehow double the size of a market that Uber/Lyft effectively have a monopoly on. Oh, and Uber/Lyft would need their revenues to go to 0.

They also have Teslas insurance business rivaling Geico/State Farm in under 5 years.

Why not have Tesla‚Äôs energy business compete with Exxon while we‚Äôre at it?

Complete nonsense."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think TSLA absolutely has room to grow in the short-ish term, but it has grown so ridiculously fast that I could see it middling in the $700ish range for a good while.  

Hell it was less than a year ago when Musk tweeted the 'too high' comment when it was at $700 pre-split! 

Meanwhile AMZN has an average analyst consensus of $4k (Bull 5.2K) from its present value of ~$3K... For my money I'd rather be invested in AMZN over the next 12 months than TSLA."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm surprised there was no inclusion of the impact of having so many Giga factories and how that shapes Tesla‚Äôs entry into the micro grid space.

It‚Äôs easy to imagine them continuing to innovate in this space and they‚Äôre capacity to build out large projects just seems immense to me. 

I actually find this to be more interesting than the car space. Taking a big piece of the burgeoning pie green energy revolution and infrastructure upgrades seems at least as enormous has maintaining its leadership in the EV space.

These are just feelings. I guess I should do more research."

Or do they mean a Zipcar knock off where you just rent a Tesla and leave it somewhere when done?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I like ARK‚Äôs style, and I personally own a Tesla. 

Saying that, the current valuation is already baking in at least a decade of growth. And now to this already exorbitant valuation, you‚Äôre saying the bear case is more than double and the expected value 5x in 5 years?

Not to mention their projections include something like 30% of revenue from ride hailing. 

It also includes around 80% annual growth in car sales. I guess there will be no EV competition.

And why will EV companies deserve so much higher multiples than ICE companies? So is every EV company somehow going to sustain astronomical valuations just because they‚Äôre selling EVs?"

03/20/2021,stocks,"Sad to say, this is why I am trying to get out of my ARK positions.  These kind of projections look totally wild and not reasonable, and if enough people put faith in it then their ETF funds will get wildly overpriced (even moreso than now) and ripe for a gigantic fall.

Ev, self-driving cars, genomics, fintech, etc are all the winning techs of the future.  But price matters."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Nonsense in, nonsense out. This is nothing more than marketing. An actual bear case would be something like $100, not a number more than double TSLA‚Äôs existing price. The probability of achieving fully autonomous driving within five years isn‚Äôt 50%, but closer to 0%."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Would be quite curious to look at her valuation model, because this sounds completely detached from reality. The market already has incredibly high expectations for Tesla.

Tesla a $3.8T market cap in 4 years in a bull case scenario is absolutely insane. And $1.4T (>100% increase for a BEAR CASE lol) is just completely puzzling.

My guess is that it's more likely TSLA will maintain its current price or rise slightly in a bull case scenario (because everyone seems to be kinda expecting a huge bull case scenario already). And it will go down significantly in a bear case scenario.

>We pushed our forecast price target forward one year to 2025.\[2\] We refined our estimates for Tesla‚Äôs capital efficiency. We added Tesla‚Äôs insurance business to our model. We added assumptions for a human-driven ride-hail service. We increased the probability of Tesla achieving fully autonomous driving within five years.""

To me it's very apparent from reading Tesla investor dd's that all of this is already expected. All of this should already be priced into the stock and much more. Which makes sense with a 1000 current P/E and >100 forward P/E ratio.

Which is why I personally don't hold the stock anymore. Very high expectations (TSLA) just are much harder to meet than low expectations."

03/20/2021,stocks,"The game has totally changed now that LT yields are rising. She‚Äôs not a genius she got a huge assist from the Fed when they flooded the markets w liquidity. Flip TSLAs PE and you get an earnings yield of .001. It will take TSLA approximately 7 years at 50% growth per year to match the 10 year Treasury bond yield of 1.7%. If yields keep rising the stock will have more ground to make up at its current price. Increasing EV competition from GM, lucid, Volvo, Toyota will clip TSLAs growth. Higher bond yields and increasing competition mean TSLA is more likely to be a $200 stock in a year and not a $1000 stock"
03/20/2021,stocks,Hmm ARK that owns TSLA stock increases its price target? I dont see any conflict of interest here
03/20/2021,stocks,"What cathie woods is doing here is a last gasp for the bulls. Every rational thinking person sees that other car manufacturers are now also offering usable EVs and that these are also being bought. Tesla is losing a lot of market share in the US and has become nothing more than a niche manufacturer in Europe. Also, all the lies at FSD have finally come to an end. Tesla itself has admitted that it is only an assistance system and will remain so for the near future. The whole narrative of robotaxis driving around and transporting people has burst. And the sentiment has also changed considerably. While until 2 months ago the news was still positive, the mood has turned massively: FSD lie, accidents, fires, Covid cases, factory in Brandenburg delayed and can't find employees etc.

&#x200B;

It's over, the bubble is slowly running out of air. The banks and asset managers will sell the Tesla positions in the next few weeks and then start to publish correct price targets, and then it goes downhill."

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sibfRCgMiFE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sibfRCgMiFE)

What peope don't get about Waymo versus Tesla.

Is that Waymo is used in a super small geofenced area.

The cars are also super expensive to build.

Making it incredibly difficult to scale.

Tesla can be used anywhere and of course relatively far cheaper.

Not only that, as you can see from the above - even when Tesla is pitted against Waymo in its own back yard - they still suck (they can't perform left hand turns, can't perform in rain).

Anyone who has spent more than an hour researching into the self driving landscape can see Tesla is quite clearly the pack leader."

Uber could have but last I checked they disbursed their autonomous driving team they bought from CMU. Amazon is the only other one because of their distribution fleet and I don't think they've even started outfitting it with FSD hardware. 

As for how to start valuing an umbrella company I like this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks3BwOe2HQY) comparing Tesla's verticals to Berkshire's."
03/20/2021,stocks,Do any of you realize Tesla CURRENTLY has a market cap larger than all other car producers in the USA combined? And it makes like 1% of all the cars in the USA? Even if they get a patent on a self driving tech. Another company with develop another system.

People just choose which one is cheaper, and if anyone can provide a lower price, then that is where everyone will go. And I believe Tesla can deploy a ride-hailing network that is cheaper for the consumer. There are cost savings from switching from ICE to EV.

This is so misguided. If Tesla does solve full autonomy they have max 2 years of growth priced in. And if they never solve full autonomy at all, but maintain 30% growth after 2022 (they're targeting 50%) based on their automotive business alone they have max 5 years of growth priced in. Just doing the math for 2026:

* 4 million cars sold annually
* $30,000 average selling price (down from 50k today)
* 10% operating margin, around the same as current numbers due to economies of scale and technological advancements evening out reduction in car prices. Expectations are for them to increase operating margin.
* Puts them at a $30B net income annually from automotive.
* 60 PE (quite conservative if they're still growing 30% annually) would put them at a $616B market cap, slightly below today's value

03/20/2021,stocks,"Have they said that data collection is the real bottleneck for this particular problem domain, or in general?

I do ML for a living(not relating to self driving) and have been studying a bit about autonomous driving out of personal interest.

Data by itself is not useful. There needs to be ways to annotate large amounts of data for it to be useful, although methods exist to minimize the amount of labeling needed.

Self driving is not a single machine learning problem. There's a lot of different problems such as segmentation, localization, motion prediction, etc. There's also non-ML aspects such as control and decision making. Industry leaders(Waymo, Cruise) are taking advantage of better(albeit more expensive) sensor hardware and stronger assumptions(geofencing) to achieve more predictability and fewer disengagements.

If Tesla's advantage in data collection translated to better results, then it doesn't show in the latest FSD beta they released.

ML is very easy to hype up and poorly understood on the business side(I think Musk has made a lot of comments showing how uninformed he is). Blaming lack of progress on regulators when there is ample evidence your system can't handle non-edge cases is a bad look.

I think Tesla leads in EV drivetrain, but the ML side of their business stinks to me. Waymo and Cruise are the way to go in this space."

Really they are two different takes on autonomy its up to the market to price which is going to be eventually successful as to sell large amounts of fleet vehicles and capture more market share. Regulation is going to be the major bottleneck for all of these companies, probably the most disruptive aspect of this space and not who is first or last in autonomy/tech. Will regulators allow cheaper camera operated autonomy (its ok for current lane keeping tech right now), or will they demand more expensive LIDAR systems that will cost customers way more money and result in lower volume of fleet vehicles from a capex perspective.

I have no idea what values they are putting into their simulations, but giving a 75% chance to a company, that has already experienced unprecedented growth, to not only continue growing at that rate but accelerate by a significant margin is quite frankly ridiculous. Growth gets harder as company size increases, not easier. It is significantly more likly that teslas growth slows down at this point than that it speeds up and over the last two years it largely has. What are the odds that over the next few years that the current growth rate is maintained? According to these estimates it‚Äôs probably less than 5%. I can understand estimates that say growth is likly going to increase, but giving a less than 5% or even 20% chance to the growth trend staying the same or even decreasing is just bad analysis.

03/20/2021,stocks,Isn‚Äôt Tesla making a higher profit margin on their EV than traditional carmakers are on gas vehicles?   A decade ago everybody insisted that you can‚Äôt make EVs profitable.  Is every car company going to build the $5billion gigafactories that are required to build EVs or will Tesla start supplying batteries for other manufacturers?  Maybe we should all be investing in the energy providers who will need to supply the fuel for all of these EVs.

03/20/2021,stocks,"> Tesla has a P/E ratio of over 1000 which means if there is no earnings growth it would take 1000 years to recoup the share price.

That's only the case if you expect the PE ratio to go to 1 over that 1000 years period, which will obviously never happen for any company, let alone a company growing at 30-50% annually.

> I would be very interested to see your math.

I showed you all the numbers. If Tesla sells 4 million cars annually in 2026 at a $30,000 average price with a 10% operating margin, that would put them at an operating income of $12B a year or $9,6B of net income. At a 60 PE that puts them at $576B market cap (made a small calculation error in my earlier number)."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It doesn't really matter to be honest. Uber's market cap and financials are nowhere near Tesla's, so they would never be able to compete with Tesla in terms of how fast they could ramp up their fleet. Especially when you consider that Tesla could do it at a much lower price because they don't have to pay their own profit margin on the cars.

On top of that, if Tesla is the first to solve self driving, they would be able to launch it together with their platform and dictate how they roll that out. For example they could only allow full self driving in combination with their ride hailing platform and justify it by incorporating the insurance of the rides with their ride hailing platform (or just be a dick and say they don't allow commercial FSD when you're not using their platform, although I doubt they would do that).

Either way, Tesla will dominate how any of these things would be rolled out and even if Uber ordered a massive fleet from Tesla, Tesla would make huge profits on selling the fleet and Uber having to pay for the FSD packages, which at that point would be anywhere between $20k and $100k up front or $200-1000 monthly in subscriptions per car."
03/20/2021,stocks,Tesla energy is the sleeping giant in this case. Auto load balancing so cheap through ai and high battery volume. That combined with cheapest solar costs that alone is a trillion in the making by the end of the decade. ARK DID NOT INCLUDE THIS btw.

03/20/2021,stocks,Not really. Tesla sees and creates the future. Traditional card companies just ride the wave. Tesla surfs the wave. They are not only a car company but a factory of innovation.

03/20/2021,stocks,"> You think Andrej Karpathy can't cut it? or stinks? bold words to throw at a Stanford Professor who started their deep learning courses (became their largest class offered) and is an expert in neural nets/computer vision.

When I say that the ML side of the business stinks, I don't mean their technical talent. I mean they are over-promising on what can be achieved.

I think it's important to note that success as an academic is often very different from delivering a real world product, especially in ML where many top papers aren't reproducible even on the same dataset. There's also a lot more to self driving than neural nets and computer vision. From what I've heard Tesla does some really top notch stuff with how they train, maintain, and deploy their models. However I don't think that's enough for them to succeed.

If Tesla fails to deliver on FSD, I don't really consider that Karpathy's fault or a reflection on his abilities. Sometimes a business bites off more than it can chew, especially one run by Musk. Various public comments by Musk demonstrate to me he doesn't really have a clue how ML works. I've personally been in situations where the business believes that ML can be a silver bullet. Sometimes SotA is just not there yet and more fundamental research is needed before a solution can be attempted for a problem.

Regarding the cost of LIDAR, I don't think Waymo/Cruise needs to beat Tesla on cost. If Tesla can't deliver FSD capabilities, then LIDAR only needs to be cost competitive with a human driver, amortized over the lifetime of the vehicle(something I think it is already or will be possible soon). My suspicion is that LIDAR was never really an option for Tesla because Musk wanted to be able to sell cars with FSD hardware from the get-go. Tesla is in the business of selling cars to consumers, so raising costs to put in LIDAR is not viable for them. Raising costs minimally by adding sensors similar to what modern luxury vehicles have while promising FSD later down the line helps market and sell the car(especially if you can charge customers extra for the promise of FSD). Unfortunately that means they're locked into using the hardware they've already shipped."
03/20/2021,stocks,I think if you claim Tesla and Musk stinks in ML you show proof otherwise downvotes is deserved.

03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm not looking up any numbers right now, but a common bear case is to value Tesla as a automobile company. Toyota, who could very well be one of their largest competitors depending on how the next several years goes, historically runs a P/E ratio of about 10 - which is obviously very low and not common in growth companies. So since Tesla could be a competitor, but is still innovative and growing, we can say a P/E ratio of 30 might even be a decent number to give if they wind up in automotives. For Tesla to currently have have a P/E of $30, their stock would be worth $19.5

edit: ok I looked up a couple numbers. Either way, if you consider $19.5 what a current bear could value Tesla at, then quintupling the value in 4 years is still aggressive growth to land at $100 per share. Will it ever reach a P/E of 30.... maybe not, but it's a bear case"

And that's without taking into account any of their other businesses and using a P/E of 60 which is about 20-30 below comparable tech companies with much less growth.

Ultimately it comes down to how you see the company. Personally, I think comparing it with a company like Toyota who makes $0 from software, has no plans for FSD and has to go through multiple years of losing money to transition from selling ICE vehicles to EVs, is ridiculous."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You're right that it's capped, but as long as long as they keep growing automotive market share (not EV market share, automotive market share), they can sustain a higher PE. In 2026 they will definitely still have plenty of room to grow.

Sure you may not personally care but if you‚Äôve ever driven in bumper to bumper traffic on the way to/from work and it takes you 1+ hours each way M-F, it‚Äôs certainly tempting.

The long term value in autonomous primarily derived from robotaxis not individual sales. I think selling it as a feature now is a way for tesla to monetize it while they develop it

Another argument is that if autonomous cars are 10x safer than humans in 2030+, should humans be allowed to drive anymore? I.e. laws won‚Äôt care if you personally want to drive your car for fun"
03/20/2021,stocks,"You can't understand this that is why you are not a Tesla investor. That is ok.

Also not everyone can see how the world is changing and that the value of Bitcoin will only grow in the future and that it will replace gold as the preferred asset for storing money against inflation or to protect it against anyone threats including your own government (remember there is a whole world with many awful governments outside USA)"

03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes. I am really curious, lets see"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm not an expert, but my work is in ML and I have a hobbyist level interest in self-driving. I think too many people take what comes from Tesla at face value. Whether they deliver on FSD is definitely far from a sure thing no matter how you look at it.

Probably only Tesla insiders actually know how their FSD program is going. But everything available to the public makes me pessimistic."
03/20/2021,stocks,Does he know more than Andrej Karpathy? He wouldn‚Äôt be on reddit if he did.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Again, you don't take market sentiment into account when doing projections for a stock. You take the current sentiment and pretend nothing will change, because everything else is irrelevant."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'll get one or two Tesla shared as well after I get out of Gamestop. While I'm personally not super bullish on Tesla, I'm sure they will be a top 3 EV manufacturer in the future, but tbh im also pretty biased because I'm an employee of Volkswagen"
03/20/2021,stocks,üëç
03/20/2021,stocks,It says that Musk only believes that there will be 27 million cars sold in the electric vehicle market in 2027. That means he believes he‚Äôll probably have at least 50% market share???
03/20/2021,stocks,"Because Tesla‚Äôs entire valuation is based on them being not just the dominant player in the EV and autonomous driving space but basically being the sole operator in it.

Why would Panasonic want to move away from doing business with the company which is supposedly going to dominate these realms?

Tesla supposedly having more advanced battery tech than other automakers is gonna play out like how Sony had the better vhs system in the 70s."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs interesting how people like you only see two realities: either yolo your money into extreme growth companies whose valuation has no basis in fundamentals (but this time it‚Äôs different) or ultra conservative bonds. 

The truth is that investing is an entire spectrum of risk and reward, and just because other people aren‚Äôt willing to risk as much as you doesn‚Äôt make them foolish or conservative investors. 

Also, your response to being wished well and valid points about losing unrealized gains is to be a snarky asshole. This is exactly why Tesla fanboys have such a bad reputation. If you truly believe in your investing thesis then you don‚Äôt need to be this insecure about your choices."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I made more than 300% in my overall portfolio in 2020, but thanks a lot for your concern. I had a rough month last month as well, but not as bad as Tesla shareholders. (actually most of my portfolio is in riskier things than tesla shares lol)"

Do you think this is a serious concern for investors or a minor dip that could turn out to be a good buying opportunity?

03/20/2021,stocks,If you‚Äôre a long term investor im taking this as a huge buy
03/20/2021,stocks,It's a buy. I've literally never seen the DOJ be tough on any company in my lifetime.
03/20/2021,stocks,"When there‚Äôs a chance, grab it.

03/20/2021,stocks,"How about PYPL? Is that a better buy than V?

I was thinking of V or MA originally as many people will be buying through credit cards and debit cards when everything gets reopened, but now I'm hesitant on V due to the antitrust probe."
03/20/2021,stocks,Back off.. wait for details
03/20/2021,stocks,MA dropped because V dropped.  I would buy MA
03/20/2021,stocks,I have a feeling this is just the tip of the iceberg. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see $180 sometime next week & if we do I‚Äôm going to dump as much cash as I can.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Plummeted to levels not seen since November 2020! Over a teensy thing like a Federal probe?!?!

Possibly does not scream ""Once in a lifetime opportunity."" V is really overvalued without this hanging over it."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm surprised nobody takes the antitrust talk seriously. I've noticed that antitrust has become a popular topic among politicians in both parties. And Visa definitely uses its powerful position to dominate the market. It's one of the reasons why investors love it. I'd watch antitrust carefully, and not just for this company. Big tech will have targets on their backs as well."
03/20/2021,stocks,I took this opportunity an bought 1000 shares.  I sold my FB shares to fund this move.
03/20/2021,stocks,More of a reason to buy Mastercard actually. Which is a fantastic company and not in the crosshairs of sellers like PayPal right now.
03/20/2021,stocks,Wait or at least something like a debit spread or collar to avoid too much lost.

They may survive this but I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would pick this company long term.  As a fintech intermediary this is the type of company that is incredibly risky to holed long term."

What?

Credit cards are barely used in EU. Most people use debit cards here.


Credit card volume is half of the US, while Europe has twice the population of the US."
03/20/2021,stocks,I am a long- term investor in V and decided to take some profits today and put them in PYPL. I'm still bullish on the entire payment processing industry but have been wanting to add more growth prospects to my play on the subsector.

03/20/2021,stocks,This comment right here. I can tell he has some wrinkles in his brain
03/20/2021,stocks,Did the same already
03/20/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs never going to happen.
03/20/2021,stocks,Overvalued?
03/20/2021,stocks,Overvalued? Think about how many people use credit and how many credit card companies exist. Now re-evaluate
03/20/2021,stocks,Why is pay pal in the x-hairs?
03/20/2021,stocks,They aren't a credit company so that logic is already flawed.
03/20/2021,stocks,"You didn't look deep enough into the issue.  Kroger started the ban saying that it pays too much for swiping fee to Visa (vs MA for example).  The main reason for that high payment is that many of their CA customers dis-proportionally use Visa at their stores due to good cash back policy.  They didn't pay more to Visa because of higher fee (vs MA or other card).  They were hoping to convert some of Visa customers into cash payers.

A few months later, they reverse the ban w/o any explanation.  But in general, limiting customer from a popular choice is rarely a wise decision.

Stores can stop taking Discover, Amex, Diner cards but the moment the stop taking Visa and MasterCard, they are digging their own grave."
03/20/2021,stocks,Blockchain is 0.001 threat to credit cards.
03/20/2021,stocks,"What?

Even debit cards uses V or MA. V and MA does not even issue credit card,they are just a middle man between merchants and banks."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You do know that Visa and Mastercard also offer debit cards, right?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"In Slovakia (EU), all debit cards are MA or V, and card payments volume grows very fast and each year, much more payments are made in each category - cards themselvs, paysafe, GooglePay, etc. Both companies seem to pretty aggressively compete for market share, and it seems like the leader in market share changes every few years. Plenty of events are sponsored by them, like MA sponsoring a big festival, which lead to a nice perk of being able to pay with my phone at food booths, etc. MA also seems to be used by most challenger banks, by the way (both international and local). And this is in a country with an aging population that is relatively conservative when it comes to finances and has an aging population. So it seems to me like they invest in these markets, because they see growth in EU.

Another thing I noticed when I was in Croatia a few years apart. The first time, you could only pay by cash in most places outside resorts, and had to use their currency. A few years later, most places accepted cards, and almost every restaurant had logos of either Visa or MasterCard engraved on the cover page of the bill holders, which I've never seen here, but seemed like an interesting strategy. They definitely targeted restaurants as a big source of revenue from foreign tourists and it seems like they focus their efforts smartly on the various differences between smaller markets."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Pull out ur wallet and check ur cards, and right bottom corner will indicate what service u‚Äôve been using. Must be V or MA. 

Remember Kerry Lam from Hong Kong, she got sanction by US govt. her financial related service was suspended and Kerry Lam was laughing over America. Saying she does not own any US related assets or financially related. However, she had to call back her son who were in America as a student, and also Kerry Lam‚Äôs credit cards are all revoked and she was forced to use in cash.
This is the power of American financial. Visa and Mastercard are key tool of American weapon and pretty sure, u‚Äôve been using Visa or Mastercard"
03/20/2021,stocks,Clown lmfao
03/20/2021,stocks,There‚Äôs a 100% chance that it might or might not happen
03/20/2021,stocks,"It's an old company with relatively modest growth--in fact, it's revenue and profits are down this year--trading at twice its price from two years ago and at a p/e of almost 50, which is roughly twice its traditional p/e."
03/20/2021,stocks,Are they seeing growth in earnings or revenue commensurate to their rise in valuation? Reevaluate.
03/20/2021,stocks,Lots of people just think Visa is a credit card.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Blockchain is the major threat to credit cards.  If you don‚Äôt believe this then you don‚Äôt know FinTech.  I would like to say I‚Äôm surprised that people are downvoting me down the memory hole, but I‚Äôm not.  The Disruption of financial services is going to be a really hard pill for the market to swallow.  And they thought Tesla was bad.

If you‚Äôre a millennial V is not the company to throw your money at for long term growth."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Look at the past 3 quarters. It‚Äôs clearly rising. If you‚Äôre only willing to purchase a stock once it‚Äôs proven it‚Äôs value, you‚Äôre too late to the game.

A big part of stocks is anticipating value before it actually comes to fruition. We‚Äôre likely heading into a ‚ÄúRoaring 20s‚Äù type of situation over the next few years- people have been stuck at home for a year, mass vaccination will probably be here by mid summer (at least in the US), and stimulus checks hitting people‚Äôs bank accounts will further stimulate spending/buying.

I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, but all signs point to a growth in spending by the average consumer mainly through credit. I‚Äôm taking advantage of this dip and loading up on V."
03/20/2021,stocks,Explain how it's a threat then. You can't make claims with no evidence
03/20/2021,stocks,"No merchant in the world won‚Äôt accept Visa as a payment method if offered to them. They will go for other options when they have no choice.

Money is used to buy stuff, and unless all parties are interested nothing will change. Visa and Mastercard will still dominate the market for decades to come."
03/20/2021,stocks,MC and V are very safe long term.
03/20/2021,stocks,Lol I love how ur being downvoted despite being 100% correct long term. Don‚Äôt worry these are the same clowns that said ‚ÄúTesla is just a car company‚Äù. Blockchain is gonna fuck traditional finance sideways in a couple years and if u can‚Äôt see that I feel sorry for u
03/20/2021,stocks,I bought it like 4 years ago and sold it two years ago because there were better places to put my money.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I mean you‚Äôre right but your timeline is totally off. 

It‚Äôs gonna take decades for blockchain to pose even just a significant, as opposed to imminent, threat to V and MC"
03/20/2021,stocks,We have very different timelines for blockchain progression.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Blockchain has many problems and they are very far from the limelight. Right now its a great commodity, but it's this same concept that makes it a terrible currency. As a result it poses very little threat to V & M. Another big concern is the rise in cyber warfare. Blockchain networks could be compromised and ledgers altered if say a country controlled over 50% of the network. Global viruses promoted by Russia amd China would be perfect for this. The latest dormant virus found infecting Mac OS is the perfect example of how world powers could attempt to affect blockchain networks. You won't find these discussions in the blockchain cult community."
2021-03-20 05:57:26,stocks,"SLGG Analysis Could I actually get some advice and feedback on this stock? It's a stock that I just generally really like, but year over year they seem to have disappointing earnings and I can't seem to understand why the stock valuation is so high based on anything aside from uptrend in volume trading. Am I missing something here? What makes this stock so valuable and is it actually worthy of where it's trading currently? I generally pick up the stock around it's mid to high $6 trade value but it's recently surged to $10 in recent days and I don't want to invest if I'm just going to end up holding forever waiting to break back even again."
03/20/2021,stocks,I believe some of what is driving it was the suspicion that GME May acquire it. Don‚Äôt think there has been much on this since then. But who knows volume stayed so maybe it‚Äôs in play still?
03/20/2021,stocks,The recent run is probably due to SLGG announcing the acquisition of Mobcrush and of them re-upping on their partnership with TopGolf.
03/20/2021,stocks,I bought in the 4‚Äôs. It ran so fast I ended up selling and keeping house $. When I bought at 4 I thought 6‚Äôs would be my target. Now I üíéüôå house shares until this all plays out. Or fizzles out

03/20/2021,stocks,What do you guys feel is a decent valuation of where the company stock deserves to be? I feel as though where it is currently is pretty high but at the same time if I didn't see it climbing steadily over the next two years I obviously wouldn't be interested.

2021-03-20 05:52:08,stocks,"Unilever VS Procter&Gamble As someone who has space in their portfolio for one more holding, I am seeking a position in a defensive stock as a longer term hold.

As the title suggests i‚Äôm in a dilemma between Unilever and Procter&Gamble. Both are massive companies with good fundamentals growing at a modest amount year on year and offering a lower risk ROI.

I would appreciate any thoughts/comments/ideas about any of the two companies and which you‚Äôd prefer. 

Thanks"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Unilever has exposure in different market segments, like luxury cosmetics, etc.  P&G is more narrowly focused in cleaning and household goods. 

I think that's worth considering, one way or another."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Depends if you want to buy an under valued but poorer run company (UL) or an overly valued but better run company (PG). Keep in mind both of these are world class companies and my adjectives are in comparing one to one another. 

I looked at both of these this past week and bought UL which trades ~10% below its historical 10 year PE (while PG is ~10% above). I just don‚Äôt like overpaying and also feel that UL has underperformed for a few years and will turn it around. PG has higher growth but you‚Äôre paying for it. 

Most of the comments so far aren‚Äôt looking at valuations and projections/financials, would use that to guide your decision."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Full disclosure I own PG, but that‚Äôs because I did my research. Unilever is a great company but in my experience PG is a safer & more attractive investment. Dividends are great, but so is stability & that‚Äôs never been more true than now. Pretty much any consumable good you can think of is owned by PG - regardless of what‚Äôs happening in the world, people need those products."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I like (and own) both, but Unilever to me has a better forward thinking strategy so I own slightly more Unilever than PG. They both have lots of everyday product staples (though PG definitely has more), but Unilever has been focusing more on acquisitions in high growth areas like wellness (Olly, SmartyPants, the vegetarian butcher, Seventh Generation) and premium skincare (Tatcha, Dermalogica) etc.

I think both aren't going anywhere and are great long term holds though!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Take a look at J&J and Nestle as well. I do not know enough about this area, but J&J does benefit the most from a weaker dollar. But honestly Apples multiple is getting close to P&G and I do not consider Apple a tech stock. I think it is very similar to these names actually."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I had the same decision to make. I read what I could and in the end decided on Unilever (1 week ago). I‚Äôm still not sure if I made the right choice but I feel comfortable having Unilever in my portfolio longterm.
My recommendation is if the fundamentals are both good you pick the stock which supplies the products you like the most."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I own both. Unilever is somewhat cheaper and has significantly more exposure to growth in emerging markets. However, I think Procter & Gamble has a stronger, more focused portfolio of brands. Both companies should benefit from population growth, pricing power, and rising incomes over the coming decades."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Good point. Unilever is also involved in the food business while P&G isn‚Äôt. Something to certainly think about

May also mean P&G has more room to grow by delving into other market segments?.."
03/20/2021,stocks,"To tag onto this. Agree with the points above. I think UL is slightly undervalued compared to PG but it is minimal. Also consider any tax on dividends: I'm on eToro and there is a 30% withholding tax on the PG dividends as it is US listed. Full disclosure, i currently own both."
03/20/2021,stocks,I like the dividend offered by PG which I believe has increased every single year. Sign of a very healthy company. Most consumable goods I can think of are owned by one of the two companies - however reading through the lists of brands PG seems to have a greater proportion of those well known products
03/20/2021,stocks,"Exactly, to be honest you‚Äôre not making a bad decision either way"
2021-03-20 05:51:52,stocks,"Apple and Cirrus Logic are my two stocks I‚Äôm Looking to invest in on Monday. I know tech is taking a beating but I believe these tough times will pass and both stocks are priced relatively well. Buy the dip they say, we‚Äôll never know in advance where the bottom is but I feel confident in both companies. 

-Apple is a beast 
-CRUS relies heavily on Apple and has a ton of cash in hand and a good balance sheet. 

Any other top stocks that can potentially make a comeback in a few weeks/months? 

P.S 
Somewhat new to investing/swing trading. Any guidance is appreciated!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Appl is a great long term hold and no 1 with a brain would say it is a bad investment esp at its current price point 

I dont think it will light your portfolio on fire but you will make at least 20-30% annually which is a hell of a lot better then interest jn the bank"
03/20/2021,stocks,">I know tech is taking a beating but I believe these tough times will pass...

Exactly this.  I'm betting a whole lot of people getting the $1400 stimulus checks were glad to see this was a red-ish week.  

AAPL may possibly drop a bit more (or not), but if you're in it for the longish term it really doesn't matter.  

I snapped up a bunch at ~$132, $126, $122 & finally at $118 while it was dropping... do I wish I could've known the future and picked all the positions up at $116, ABSO-F*CKING-LUTELY!  But no one knows the bottom and in 20 or so years I'll just be glad I bought at any of those prices."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Are you looking to invest,  or trade?
Big difference. 

IMO, if you're investing (long term, based on company research, Financials, future outlook, etc) then Apple should absolutely be one of your cornerstone holdings. 

If you're looking to trade, shorter term, momentum or volatility driven, you want something with a higher Beta like Tesla or Twilio or AMD.  Again,  IMO."
03/20/2021,stocks,Tech may be taking a beating but now is the best time to get in. I bought and sold AAPL a few times over the last year. I think even at 120 it's a good time to get in and plan to do so next week as well.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Started buying Apple at $116, every time it nears $120 I keep buying. Apple got caught in a selloff of overvalued companies. Apple, NVDA, BABA, and PYPL are not overvalued. All of these companies have exceeded earnings and have solid track records and massive upside for expansion.

With that said I‚Äôm biased. However, I‚Äôd recommend waiting until later in the day to buy. If Apple holds resistance at or above $118 it could be a bullish swap. Anything below, wait for $116 or lower. 

I‚Äôm buying aggressively for long term investment. Their EPS projections for next month went up and will have a new release announcement next month likely about the new iPad generation and headphones. If we‚Äôre super lucky maybe some car teasers. Like I said next month could be promising, but I‚Äôm going heavy Apple for the vehicle. Early forecasts have it pushing their market cap another trillion. Not all is guaranteed and there is a still risk.

Not a short term indicator, but Berkshire, Vanguard, and Blackrock all near doubled up on Apple in filings last month. None of those funds back bad long term investments with that degree of capital."
03/20/2021,stocks,"AAPL is probably the best stock you can buy today. That being said, I‚Äôm still cursing the day I bought it. It‚Äôs a stock to buy and forget about it for a couple of months. I don‚Äôt know which other company sits on a tonne of cash like them. Maybe Amazon."
03/20/2021,stocks,You think Apple will turn 20-30% growth per year for the coming years?
03/20/2021,stocks,Are you me? Bought AAPL first time at $135 and bought on every dip down to $117 and managed to average down to $124.87. But I have only 17 shares. Seeing it at $120  makes me wanna buy more since it's lower than my average. But my gut tells me AAPL will dip under $110 so I just added more capital in my account patiently waiting for the dip. I might be wrong tho.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I may be completely wrong in my approach but my webull account I use to swing trade or hold for a few years max. 
I‚Äôm a cheap investor, I only buy the dip on companies. Like I said in my original post, I‚Äôm new to trading/investing/stocks. I understand we are in a rare steroid driven bull market and we‚Äôre all lucky to be in on the ride. This is the time to be aggressive and buy the damn dip

Any suggestions and advice I‚Äôll gladly take and read. Thanks man"

I understand that's a normal part of investing and given a few months they'll probably be doing okay but I'm wondering if anyone has a recommendation for a mutual fund or ETF that is light on tech because I need to diversify and I don't want to have a heart attack every time the Nasdaq dips. I've been doing some research but it's still very overwhelming but I'd rather jump in now than have my savings languish in my savings account.

It‚Äôs not trading at an absurd multiple either. I just don‚Äôt think the TopGolf merger has been widely reported enough and retail investors don‚Äôt know.

03/20/2021,stocks,"XLI could easily jump another 10-12% from its recent high on the 15th this year.

They will likely pull back some from yesterday intraday, but that doesn't change the likely story of this year.

Edit: Consumer cyclical is not really what I have in mind though when you talk about cyclicals. That was actually a really good performer last year I think. Things like XLI, XLE, and XLF weren't for most of the year."

2021-03-20 04:32:23,stocks,"Struggling with when to sell. I‚Äôve been investing about a year and a half, and I‚Äôm primarily a buy-and-hold investor, so I have always struggled with when to sell and when to take profits. 

I have a ton of gains on Comstock Mining ($LODE) . I sold double the principle about a month ago and am letting the rest ride. It‚Äôs still going up. I know I need to take some more profits but how much do you usually take? I‚Äôve heard 20-25%. I hate to sell a winner but I also know I shouldn‚Äôt be greedy. Constructive advice would be appreciated."
03/20/2021,stocks,I take 50% when it crosses the 50% mark. Let it go another 25%-50% depending on the chart and pull 50%.  At that point I'm playing with the houses money and don't have to care. If I truly love the stock but it is volatile like my pot stocks I set a GTC buy order for 20% or so below where I pulled profits to average back in and protect gains on the way down and use a wheel strategy on the transition in.
03/20/2021,stocks,"There is no right answer here.  Sounds like you have a good plan. If you want to lock in something sell to gain the principle then let the rest ride.

You could also sell some covered calls. You‚Äôd lower you cost basis and gain capital. This covers you if the stock starts to drop. If the stock rises super high you lock out your top end earnings but you still lock in a profit at higher then current value. If you‚Äôre on the fence this is a good middle ground.  

But I‚Äôm just some random guy not an advisor. Ultimately no one on here, myself included, can really give you advice. We‚Äôre not licensed to do so. 

This likely isn‚Äôt a popular opinion but if you want my advice, I‚Äôd tell you interview different advisors and find one you like. One that shares your overall vision. Yes they make money of your money but find one that‚Äôs fee based and not commissions based. 

Just like a lot of other industries, you may be able to DIY but you‚Äôre usually better served to work with a professional in that space."
03/20/2021,stocks,If you do your dd and notice that the up line is higher then it‚Äôs been say the last 2 yrs then  probably the point to sell. Not financial advice because i live in a dumpster.
03/20/2021,stocks,When it 4x at least
03/20/2021,stocks,I just watch the chart. I did a quick one here. It's in a steady short term uptrend. It's framed into a current range about 5.12 - 5.74. As long as it stays above about 5.12 it's ok to keep going up. But the the trend is going up so those numbers have to be adjusted up everyday. You could put in a trailing stop a little below whatever the 5.12 percentage works out to. That way if it breaks down you'll get stopped out.
03/20/2021,stocks,I found just using technicals to sell works pretty good most of the time. Or when you hear everyone talking about it that‚Äôs usually the top. Try and sell into strength. you leave some on the table but can better redeploy into better risk reward plays.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have never understood price targets.  I also dont understand why you would reduce a winnong position.

If a stock or ETF is going up, why sell any?  

I use moving averages.  If they are going up and the stock is going up faster, I hold.  When the stick is going fown faster than the movi g averages l, I sell."
03/20/2021,stocks,My strategy has been to never sell... but i did sell as well and only in case i found super undervalued stocks and was convinced that they are undervalued. Having had no cash i was forced to sell some other stocks where i didnt see that high of a potential any more. Turns out that if I wouldve kept the stocks i would be ahead now... simply never sell
03/20/2021,stocks,"Thank you, that sounds reasonable. At this point 50% of the profits would be a tidy amount since my portfolio isn‚Äôt that large. Been wanting to set some aside to buy some inverse ETFs if/when we have a market crash."

Seeing the teeny 5% gains triggers a little FOMO, but VOO has been pretty bad lately and I'd rather be safe than sorry.  Running wheel in my long term holds isn't going to make bank. I tend to sell OTM so it's around 5% or so but still helpful. I've had six weeklies in a row expire worthless which already knocked down my average $3 a share without additional capital"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Absolutely good bounce ideas off of people. I have a good friend who‚Äôs getting his CFP and S7.  We shoot shit the most days on the market. I also have an advisor who I bounce ideas off. The key is getting a good one. We chat about finances as a whole. He will point blank tell me if it makes more sense to achieve my goal through another vehicle. You also want to make sure you check their returns against market returns. The big piece about an advisor, where they make their money, is all about risk tolerance. Where most people end up sideways is taking risks that they shouldn‚Äôt be. 

Like most things in life, you want to take a bunch of different perspectives and weigh them against each other to make a decision that makes sense for you. 

From you brief comment seems like you‚Äôre at least thinking about it in the right way which is important."

2021-03-20 03:58:53,stocks,"Are companies that short really just a Wolf? If anyone read the short report on Ehang by Wolfpack Research, they would have said it was written by a barely- graduated high schooler. 

There were numerous inaccuracies, and open- ended innuendos ;   dotted with "" other companies don't have this tech yet, so it's impossible that you do""   
There were other things like ' going to their factory and saying there were no workers,  on an obvious Chinese holiday 

In any case:
Why can they not be held responsible for the stock drop? Why are lawyers trying to go after the ehang?

I believe companies that short like that need to be thoroughly audited - by someone reputable
There is just something shady about some of these short companies, { and I would like to bring some more attention to WOLFPACK Research,   so how do you go about doing that?}

Plus, it invokes a culture of ' wanting to see a business fail' ,   possibly at any cost

I think they trounce around in their self -given title of "" the good guys"",   but I wonder if they  are really just a Wolf in sheep's clothing?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"(Disclaimer: I have no positions on Ehang and know nearly nothing about the company.)

I just skimmed their article.  I don't really see the problem.  This is actually the purpose of shorting and why it exists in finance.

This firms believes the company is aggressively over promoting itself and embellishing its financials - and maybe even committing fraud.

So, assuming the article is correct, this is great.  I don't want to accidently invest in a company that commits fraud.  In addition, fraudulent companies of all shapes and sizes deserve to be ground into the dust because they are a burden on the tax payers of the countries they operate in and they steal from their shareholders.

In addition, the beauty of finance is, if you disagree with the shorts' research, just start buying up all the shares.  And, if the company has a quality CFO, he/she will also recognize this and use the company's cash flows to pay dividends or to perform share buy backs which will shatter and explode any short positions.

Shorts have incredibly vulnerable positions.  When they are wrong, they can sometimes lose the entire firm.  So, if an activist short firm, which has a history of sniffing out fraud, is shorting a company you are long, you better triple check your research and really make sure you are investing in a quality company with honest management.

If the company is good, you have nothing to worry about.  The cash generation of the company will ultimately drive any shorts away.  If the company is fraudulent, however, the shorts are not the people stealing from you; the company's management are."

Many other verifiably false claims and deceptive points in the report. Wolfpack has been wrong more than they've been right, I don't understand who falls for this bs honestly, they release the report an hour before market close and ""investors"" sell for a loss and make Wolfpack rich."
03/20/2021,stocks,"There is a huge difference. An organized naked short group can drive down the stock in minutes and create FUD and rip people off that invested legitimately. People pumping stock do not force others to put there money in... but when shorters organize and attack a stock they are forcing people to sell or simply have their investment devalued and stolen from and artificially reducing the value of a company. One is pure theft. The other may or may not be theft but people have a choice. FOMO won't cost you your bank account if you do your DD. Shorting can and there is nothing one can do about it. Even if you know what is going on, if other investors don't then it doesn't mean you won't be screwed in the process. Organized shorting used to devalue a stock is theft. It has nothing to do with ""quality control""... that is what the psychopaths tell themselves and others to justify their theft.

If a person doesn't think a stock is valuable they sell and if someone else does then they buy it... A shorter doesn't give a fuck about the value of a company, they only care about stealing other peoples money. Why the hell do you think there are so many billionaires now? It isn't because they actually work hard. Why do so many companies go down even though they are fundamentally sound? Shorters fuck over society and are the last kinds of people you want to enrich besides murderers and drug kingpins. They literally ruin millions of peoples lives just so they can get their yachts, mansions, and hookers. How much money has been stolen from pensions, 401k's, etc? From people that simply work their asses off every day having no clue how the markets work and are having their savings decimated?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"It's a concerted effort to destroy a company.   So  you're ok with a group of people attacking a company,  even if there is no evidence to it being true?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Deplorable argument.

As dissociated from the actual case examined as saying that if the 1st amendment protects promoting women's rights then it should protect promoting Nazism.

It IS a problem when there's predatory short-attacks against a company because for one reason or the other the shorts' analysis indicates they are vulnerable (not in terms of fundamentals but in terms of public perception).

It's ALSO a problem when there's predatory pumping. 

Well in both cases the easy way to see what's common is the wording. ""Predatory"". Almost by definition implies a short term interest and the execution of an attack, and then they're out.

I personally believe regulation could be introduced to limit that phenomenon, it's obviously not considered ""market efficient"" which is BS for if we can't be predators how are we to keep making billions?
______________________
But also out of curiosity, are you saying Cathie's statements are predatory pumping? I tend to think the ARK team indeed believes in their thesis, and tbh they ACT ACCORDINGLY, they buy and hold the stock they say they believe in their growth."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Who said anything about naked shorting, short over 100% should not be allowed but shorting in general has found out some of the most notorious companies like enron and valeant, nikola. Also you might be surprised how unpopular shorting is on wall street, watch dick full the ceo or former ceo talk about shorts. Also how do shorts exactly force people to sell? They put out an opinion and then people sell based on that but they do absolutely not force anyone to do so."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Also if your advocating for only staying long you clearly haven't been investing very long, ps the best portfolios are long short to minimize risk, you should try it and stop pretending being against a stock is criminal."

03/20/2021,stocks,"It's their opinion, unless you can prove they wanted to destroy the company you have 0 case against them. And that is almost impossible to prove, and plus some short sellers like hindenburg are very reputable and actually find fraudulent companies"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm so confused at the last part, you say ark buys and holds long do they belive in their statements, but shorts also short indicating they belive in their statements. It's kinda the same thing man"
03/20/2021,stocks,"So what are you the arbiter of who can say what, its up to you  whether you listen to the short or not you don't have to do so, stop pretending a stock dropped because some guy in his room made up a story because that's not the truth at all, also ark is doing the exact same thing ark might truly belive in their investments that's why they go long, that's also why shorts bet against stocks they have made a report for, also most shorts try and find fraudulent companies because they want the stock at zero, and the best way to find that is a fraudulent company like enron or lordstown or nikola or many more, remember people choose to listen to the short they don't have magical powers which drive down stock prices, but people choose to listen."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Um, when you drive down a stock to ""test"" it and continue doing that you are not stress testing a stock, you are intentionally trying to extract money from it. You short the stock quickly to drive it down using coordinated attacks. Buying generally occurs over time since any coordinated buying is inefficient use of money. Shorting can drive down the stock with almost no downside except if the stock is not driven down... which doesn't happen unless buyers are able to rally against it in time(which happened with GME to some degree).

Shorters intentionally try to fuck over investors and it has nothing to do with finding bad companies, that is just an excuse. There is almost no downside for shorters in doing this. They can short a stock to drive it down and profit on it then allow it to go back up and profit on that too. The reason it forces some holders to sell is psychological, because if people see a stock crash they do not want to lose their investment and sell.  You can claim this is not forcing them and maybe technically it isn't but psychologically it is, which is why it is talked about and used and is well established."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Um, being against a stock is not criminal and I never said it was. We are talking about shorting, mainly coordinated shorting specifically to drive down a stock for no other reason to profit from it through manipulation... which is what is currently happening all across the market.  You are conflating two different things intentionally so you can justify abusive manipulation."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree,  there are some.   But like you also said,  the people should be able to decide if the product is legit or not"
03/20/2021,stocks,"What the hell ate you talking about man, if I put out a short report no one will listen, why?

03/20/2021,stocks,"How is it happening all over the place, shorts don't magically make a price go down, they put out a report and it's up to firms and people if they want to listen"

03/20/2021,stocks,Says the idiot.
03/20/2021,stocks,"What the hell? A short attack is when a shorters short a stock selling it off, this crease more supply which causes the stock to go down, when the stock goes down this causes some investors to sell to stop losses, when they sell this further causes the stock to go down, which triggers a feedback loop. The shorters further use OTM puts and calls to benefit from the swing down and the swing up. If disinformation is added on top of that then it further exacerbates the problem. You don't understand how any of this works."

2021-03-20 03:50:41,stocks,"GAW (Warhammer) & Cineworld Group DD (X-posted from r/investing) # ***Disclaimer, positions and reasoning for post.***

**Reasoning:**

Financial discussions on reddit are, understandably, dominated by US-based companies. I learned early on in investing, however, that having a diversity not only different sectors but also the currencies a portfolio is in can be beneficial. (Changes in exchange rates saw a portfolio that was invested in US stocks drop in value by as much as high single digit percentages.) 

*For this reason, I want to draw attention to three hopefully interesting UK-based companies in an effort to help encourage people to find diversity, wherever they are based.*

All three are established companies that have the potential for fast growth, with two paying dividends. The third has yet to IPO but I feel might draw interest when it does, hence its inclusion. GAW and CINE are also traded on the NYSE as a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) hence the different tickers. 

**Disclaimer:**

Until now, I've been somewhat new to the details of investing, and am still getting to grips with fundamental and technical jargon, but am doing my best to provide information accurately. I'll provide links to their relevant LSE pages, as well as financial reports, to do a lot of the heavy lifting for me. The numbers I provide are coming from my broker and might be slightly different. If I have anything misleading or wrong, please let me know. 

**Positions:**

I have a handful of shares in Cineworld Group (CWD/CNNWF) and am considering investing in both Games Workshop Group (GAW/GMWKF) and Brewdog, when it eventually IPOs.

[Games workshop annual reports and half-year results](https://investor.games-workshop.com/annual-reports-and-half-year-results/) 

Possibly the best-known company on this list, it is an established company that has well-recognized IP. They own ""Warhammer"" and ""Warhammer 40,000"" along with their spin-offs, the more recent ""Age of Sigmar"", as well as a ""Lord of the Rings"" range that is still in production. To add to those, they also own brands such as ""Citadel"" (not to be confused with the hedge-fund), ""Black Library"", and ""Forge World"". They have a diverse range of products, from their core table-top wargame minis, to literature, a large number of licensed computer games, and even a number of TV shows in development. The most prominent of these shows is a live-action adaption of their ""Eisenhorn"" book series, with [Frank Spotnitz](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Spotnitz) as the showrunner. They also have lesser known [Funko figures](https://www.popinabox.co.uk/franchise/warhammer.list) and even [action figures](https://mcfarlane.com/toys/brands/warhammer/) that have been released, the latter of which was unexpectedly popular. 

In recent years the company has undergone a change in direction which has led to a rapid growth in share value, with approximately 80%/year growth for the past 5 years. More recently, they have seen a somewhat slow but consistent drop in share value over the past 3-4 months. Going forward, they are working to tap into Chinese markets which could potentially fuel a lot of further growth. This will likely be supported by a re-release of their ""Warhammer Fantasy"" range, notably with the inclusion of ""Kislev"" and ""Grand Cathay:"" Fantasy versions of Russia and China Respectively.

Around 2017/2018 Cineworld Group aggressively expanded and bought over competitors in North America with this expansion making it the second-largest cinema chain in the world. The expansion, combined with COVID, however, has left the company with significant debt and close to bankruptcy. That said, with cinemas reopening, and them receiving some bailouts, they now have a chance to avoid this.

# ***Brewdog***.

[Brewdog annual report - August 2020](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://d1fnkk8n0t8a0e.cloudfront.net/docs/BrewDog-Reports-and-Accounts-Doc-2019_v1.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjL_ISFt73vAhVKfMAKHXlNAjkQFjADegQIDxAC&usg=AOvVaw0ma-44dIGQgDCWD1ihuedc) **PDF warning.**

Brewdog are a craft brewing company that has exploded in popularity over the past decade. They are a famous brand, although many might not recognise it by name. Early in their history, in 2009, they gained worldwide infamy for the strongest beer at the time: Tactical Nuclear Penguin, which also almost ruined the company after regulators accused them of promoting irresponsible drinking. Over the years the company has continued to provoke controversy, although this has largely helped increase brand awareness rather than cause harm. As well as brewing, they operate a number of bars globally, and Brewdog also began to operate a small number of hotels pre-COVID.

For those who are interested in ethical investing Brewdog is a certified [B-Corp](https://www.brewdog.com/bcorp) and has a growing focus on sustainable production and distribution. As part of their sustainability commitment, [all their recipes are publically available.](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/community/diy-dog)

As of writing, Brewdog does not have an IPO date, although have expressed a desire to go public in the past.

Share price seems a bit high though?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Games Workshops short term decline is directly related to brexit. It is not only making uk exporters futures uncertain but it is directly impacting their own releases in europe.

I am extreamly bullish on Games Workshop as a company under their new ceo - I run a blog and podcast for one of their games and am friends with many of their staff - this company is absolutely going places.

I currently hold no positions in Games Workshop but it is one i am watching closely."
03/20/2021,stocks,whats up with the brew dog shares they currently are offering? Are they real or is it a gimmick kind go fund me thingy
03/20/2021,stocks,"Nice to see some LSE DD‚Äôs! How do you feel about JD Wetherspoon (JDW)? I think the pubs will be packed this summer (if COVID allows it) and with many independent pubs going out of business JDW will have a bigger market share than ever.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Been holding GMWKF (the version available to me in my US brokerage) since July of last year and am quite pleased.  It's fallen a bit lately, but I'm up 12% over the last six months. Lockdown was really a boon for them, and their aggressive protection of their IP is an asset. 

Been playing 40k since the early 90s, so it's part of my ""companies whose products I use"" portfolio.  And the dividend is enough for a box of dudes."

03/20/2021,stocks,"HMSO has been a nice earner for me, a lot of potential with a Covid recovery and Barclays + Goldman‚Äôs downgrade to sell is questionable. Holding this till atleast December and if they convert some holdings to rental flats it could be very good."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree its a bit high just now, but I wouldn't say its too bad. As another commenter pointed out, they are being hit by export uncertainty which is bringing the share price down. They have also lost some sales from hobby stores being closed due to COVID. Getting that back would probably boost earnings and lower the P/E ratio."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Analyist forecasts for 2021 are for eps of 352p putting them at a p/e of 27. However H1 was 226p so i'm expecting better than that personally.

It's high but for a company with a 5-yr CAGR EPS of 40% and a ROCE of 55% I don't think it's excessive."
03/20/2021,stocks,Like they're trying to compete with Berkshire lol
03/20/2021,stocks,">Games Workshops short term decline is directly related to brexit.

I think it's partly to do with COVID as well. They're seen as a COVID ""winner"" as their H1 sales were so good, so now COVID is easing off investors may think sales will drop as well. Personally I think that's wrong and they'll continue to do well."
03/20/2021,stocks,How do you buy GW on fidelity?
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'll be honest, I actually thought that last round of fundraising had finished so was partly why I included them here.  
My understanding is that it's somewhat like actually buying shares, combined with kickstarter-like benefits. I'm not sure exactly how it works myself though, so I'm going to have a dive into it this weekend. That said, Brewdog are using it as a way to invest in the company, particularly to fund development in an environmentally friendly way. 

As to how that would interact with an IPO... There was a discussion about this on r/UKPersonalFinance and its all a bit murky. My guess is that it's going to be treated like early investments by accredited investors. 

For anyone else reading, [this](https://www.brewdog.com/uk/equityforpunks/tomorrow-raise/welcome) is what OP means."
03/20/2021,stocks,A PDF is available [here](https://www.brewdog.com/uk//equityforpunks/tomorrow-raise/documents) which appears to explain how it all works.
03/20/2021,stocks,"> Nice to see some LSE DD‚Äôs! 

Thanks! I feel that non-US stocks get massively under-discussed, which is a shame. Focusing on a stocks in a single currency can lower diversity in a portfolio, so thought I'd throw my hat into the ring ant try to kick start discussion.

> How do you feel about JD Wetherspoon (JDW)? 

~~Unfortunately I don't have access to them through my broker atm.~~ Edit: turns out I do. That said, it's probably one of the few companies I'd not invest in on moral grounds anyway. I really dislike Tim Martin."
03/20/2021,stocks,I'm seeing a *massive* drop in value over the past ~5 years (3500 down to 35) what makes them a good earner?
03/20/2021,stocks,"I would love to dump a chunk in there as I'm a longtime fan, but that share price is a big turn off lol. I feel bad wanting it to tank so I can get in at a price I feel comfortable with. 

I guess I need to go do some DD to see if they are really deserving of that price range.
I have nothing in my portfolio like it(hobby - type) and I feel like I should have at least 1 entertainment type company I'm passionate about."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs only ¬£96 a share, are you getting confused because LSE stocks trade in pence and not pounds?"
03/20/2021,stocks,Thats fair - i think everyone was surprised at how fast they paod back the governments covid loan - made them look like a lockdown stock when the reality is that they just have such a versatile product that it sells no matter what.
03/20/2021,stocks,Not sure if you can buy the ticker GMWKF shows up on my fidelity account.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Some brokers don't appear to allow users to buy shares in the company directly.

Per another redditor yesterday, they instead use a [depository receipt](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/depositaryreceipt.asp) to trade it on the NYSE. Unfortunately this appears to remove access to dividends."
03/20/2021,stocks,thanks!
03/20/2021,stocks,A lot of people have a issue with Tim Martin I think!

2021-03-20 03:17:57,stocks,"Investing ¬£2500-¬£3000 to get started  Hi, I'm new to investing, so just looking for some advice - I want to mainly stick to ETFs that will serve the long term because I don't know enough yet to venture outside of this.

I'm based in the UK and using the Freetrade App. My thoughts are to initially invest in the following:

\- VUSA - ¬£1000

\- EMIM - ¬£700

\- INRG - ¬£500

\- RBTX - ¬£300

There are a lot of ETFs that I like the look of but they are only available with a Plus account, which I don't want to spend ¬£10 a month on. I'm thinking to invest in the following once I can create a Trading 212 account (assuming they are available on that platform):

\- CHRG (batteries)

\- AIAG (artificial intelligence)

\- ESGB (esports)

\- ISPY (cybersecurity)

Any advice on ETFs would be appreciated!

I was then thinking to possibly initially invest \~¬£500 into 1-3 individual stocks (which don't overlap with the above). I'd be willing to take some risk here as it would also be partly for some excitement.

So I'm wondering, once I've identified a sector I want to invest in, what are the best ways to identifying individual companies for future growth? I realise that's not a simple question haha.

Thanks for any advice :}"
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you‚Äôre young and won‚Äôt need this money. I would put it in a 2-3 stocks you do some research on and believe in their mission over the next 10-15 years. Choose something that is a core competency. A market not only you research but markets you are actively buying products/services in. There is no better way to get a feel for a company‚Äôs trajectory than interacting with it and the employees. Culture and mission are the key difference between good and great companies. Invest in what you know. Once you have profits and need somewhere to park them safely diversify into other areas or etfs to protect gains.

Go out there and skin your knees, learn about finding winners and you will be golden. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take profit and then store it in safe investments. Once I pick a company I ride it up until I can pull out my initial investment and let the rest ride. 

Enjoy the game"
03/20/2021,stocks,Make sure you do it inside an ISA
03/20/2021,stocks,Put the money in slowly over the next 2 to 3 months. I know it sounds ridiculous but the segments you want to be in are going through some turbulence and you should buy after a day they get completely crushed. May happen next Monday or Wednesday. And it may continue until bonds stop causing tech to sell off.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm using free trade as well. You may want to consider investing in a global tracker like VWRP. This tracker covers emerging markets and stocks across the world. You could put the majority of your money in this and then a few in individual stocks. You may want to ditch INRG as 9% of its weighting is in PLUG, which is not doing well."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Are you looking to buy you first mortgage as well? If so a LISA is a no brainier.

You can pay in ¬£4000 and the government will add 25% each year meaning you get a ¬£1000 free, but only if you use this money to purchase your first mortgage.

The best part is you can invest the ¬£4000 into stocks similar to a stocks and share ISA, and any gains you make is completely tax free.

If you invested ¬£4K, you‚Äôd get your guaranteed ¬£1000 which equates to a 25% gain, and then if you put it into the S&P or FTSE, you could see an average of 8% gain.

That‚Äôs a annual gain of 33% and a total of ¬£1320.

The even better part

You can open up a stocks and shares isa, and use the remaining ¬£20k allowance (¬£16k after LISA) to invest in what ever you like."
03/20/2021,stocks,"With that small amount invest in just one or two companies you really love and could go 10x in the next few years. 

Unless you're happy making 8% gains yoy. Which is also a great strategy for older folks.

Also ditch Freetrade, they fucking suck. Get Trading212 - free and much better."
03/20/2021,stocks,Palantir.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Thanks man, I can only have one ISA though right? So I couldn't have a Vanguard ISA and a Trading 212 ISA?"

**Competition**

There are competitors in the field of AR glasses, but none come close to the size that Vuzix has as Vuzix is a field leader. Most competitors sell inferior products (either heavier/thicker, provide inadequate support, or use inferior technology). Vuzix is also a market leader in revenue for AR glasses. 

This is a very niche environment that few have been able to enter, so Vuzix has a strong grasp on future growth.

More can be read about their competitors on their [10K](https://ir.vuzix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings##document-24822-0001558370-21-003001-1) beginning at the end of page 9.

[**Management**](https://ir.vuzix.com/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) **and** [**Investors**](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/vuzi#listings_table-sticky-header)

Paul J. Travers, CEO, President, and Director

Original founder of Vuzix in 1997 and has served as a board member starting November of the same year. Prior to Vuzix, Travers founded e-Tek Labs (acquired by Belkin in 1999) and Forte Technologies. 30+ years in consumer electronics and 25 years in VR. He also owns roughly 6.2% of the company and is the largest individual shareholder.

Grant Russell, CFO, Executive Vice President, Treasurer, and Director

Has served as CFO since 2000 and as a member of the board since April 2009. Between 1997 to 2004, Russell developed a software firm, computer store and cyber cafe, which he sold. In 1984, he co-founded Advanced Gravis Computer, which became the largest joystick manufacturer with sales of $44 million worldwide. Gravis was listed on the NASDAQ and Toronto Stock Exchange, then, in 1996, it was acquired by a Fortune 100 company.

Timothy Harned, Director

The newest member of the board having joined in June 2017, Harned has experience in investment banking, corporate development, and financial advisory with 30+ years of experience in mergers and acquisitions. He also has 20+ years of experience in technology fields and 10 years in consumer and industrial companies. Harned‚Äôs resume in financials is in-depth with experience at Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.

State Street Corp owns roughly 4.8 million shares.

Vanguard owns roughly 2 million shares.

Blackrock owns roughly 800,000 shares.

**Analysts and Estimates**

Vuzi is currently rated a Buy with an average target price of $31.67 (low of $30 and high of $35). An EPS estimate of -$0.27 is given for next year, which would half the current EPS.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI/analysis/

**Risks**

Although not likely, they can dilute their shares again if needed. They are currently sitting on over $40 million in cash, so they won‚Äôt need to, but it is definitely a possibility in the future.

As Vuzix is not a startup and is still cash flow negative by a large margin, they need to improve their scalability and increase profits to be seen as a viable company for future investors.

As Vuzix has not made a profit, rising interest rates could hurt them when they need to take out loans to maintain business (not likely as they have plenty of cash on hand).

**Technical Analysis**

This is my own analysis, so take with however much salt you like.

Vuzi has been on an explosive uptrend the last few days after having been beaten the past few weeks. They have maintained themselves in the upper BB for quite some time (although it is widening), and their 10 EMA and 20 EMA has held very steadily. The MACD signal line crossed mid-February signalling a buy and it has maintained a healthy divergence. Their recent price action increase has them slightly overbought, but not necessarily a sell (at least not to me). 

Current support and resistance around $29.50, $25, $23.80, $21, and $19 (although will most likely not be maintained). More realistic support and resistance around $26, $22, $21, $19.50, $18, and $15.50.

Another thing I noticed is their volume fluctuation on drastic green days vs drastic red days. Drastic green day volume typically has twice the volume of normal and high red days, but red days have a much steeper price change on lower volume. Not sure what to make of that. Maybe people are holding? Maybe the volume is being diluted across multiple days? Not sure.

My buy range is between $18 and $23 (this does not mean it will reach these prices again, and does not mean it will rebound once it does). My current rating is a hold until (if) it reaches these prices again.

**Final Thoughts/TL;DR**

Vuzix is a long-term buy for me, but not at the current price. AR glasses are the future, and I believe they are able to establish themselves in this niche sector. Their products, although not revolutionary, are far beyond the competition and provide excellent ROI for the companies that utilize them. Once they're able to scale up, they will be worth much more than they are now.

I have a current rating of hold until (if) it reaches my buy range of $18-$23 where I plan to buy more. I do believe a pullback from the recent jump is due, but not necessarily guaranteed. I strongly believe in this company and its experienced and well-vested board to increase revenue and push the company into a multi-billion dollar state compared to its current valuation of around $1 billion.

I currently hold 25 shares at $23.50 that I‚Äôve been holding for a month (talk about bad timing) as a means to include it into my portfolio and continuously check the price."

So a friend pointed me to RFP: Resolute Forest Products.  I did a deep dive on the company and thought I'd share it.  RFP is up 41% YTD (as of close on 3/19/31), up 479% for the last year (as of close on 3/19/21).  When you look at the company‚Äôs history and metrics, it starts to make sense why its stock price has grown so much recently and why it probably still will.  

For reasons articulated below, it appears on track to release its best earnings statement in at least decade on April 29 this year, and if commodity prices hold, Q2 should be even better given that home builders project higher volume in Q2 than Q1..

**Brief History Description**

RFP is a Canadian paper/pulp/forestry company that used to gain a majority of its revenue from newsprint and specialty paper.  In the late 2000‚Äôs, the company had way too much debt and with the huge decline in print journalism, it lost a lot of its largest source of income.  They went into bankruptcy in the late 2000‚Äôs and came out of it December 2010 and changed their name to Resolute Forest Products.  Over the last decade the company has been trying to transform itself, building up its lumber and pulp production capacities while consolidating paper production and paying down debt.

The only decent year they had was 2018.  Their Q2 earnings (Net GAAP Income of 72 million; $.72 EPS;) was the best quarter they had had in years.  And the market reaction was pretty dramatic. Here‚Äôs the graph ([LINK](https://imgur.com/a/yjj3tqi?)) with the earnings dates circled.  From March to September, the stock doubled in value; a majority of that price increase occurring in the span of six weeks starting with the Q2 earnings announcement.  

What made Q2 so good? Lumber had a small surge in price in the middle of Q2, as did wood pulp.  ([graph of lumber futures](https://imgur.com/gallery/Q1r1Nbm)).  Nothing compared to now, but it was significant at the time.

RFP‚Äôs Q3 was even better, with a net income of 117 million, an EPS of $1.25, and a special dividend of $1.50/share.  However, the price of lumber dropped like a rock before Q3 earnings, and so the stock started going down with it.  However, that Q3 announcement got a 25% stock price jump in a day.

**Present Day Conditions**

2020 was a rough year for RFP.  Their paper segment EBIDTA was ~85% less than 2019 due to the pandemic which caused a huge drag on their annual income and luckily has kept this company under the radar compared to some of the larger forestry companies that don‚Äôt produce paper.  

That being said let‚Äôs look at their valuation ratios based on 2020 income (As of 3/19/21):

    **RFP**
    P/E				85.75
    Forward P/E		5.50
    Price/Sales		.27
    Price/Book		.77
    Price/Cash flow	4.25

I won‚Äôt even put up the SP 500 valuation ratios because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare them. (But if you care, SP 500 numbers are substantially more overvalued than RFP).  So let‚Äôs compare RFP to the Paper/pulp competitors‚Äô average (in this I used tickers GLT, MERC, CLW, NP, and UFS) [Link for Schwab comparison](https://imgur.com/gallery/IX7hCrn):

    **Paper/Pulp**
    P/E			      31.68
    Forward P/E		12.86
    Price/Sales		.724
    Price/Book		2.138
    Price/Cash flow	18.676

The P/E is high however when you look the others‚Äô in the link you‚Äôll see only two of those paper/pulp companies had positive earnings last year.  MERC, NP and UFS, were negative earnings thus had no positive PE.  Despite that, RFP still has a better forward PE than these other companies. From a valuation metric, RFP seems to have the best forward outlook and by far the most undervalued.  Now let‚Äôs compare RFP‚Äôs ratios to similar forestry/lumber producers (WFG, WY, LPX, UFPI, and IFSPF) ([Link to screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/kADg2st)):

    Forestry/Lumber Avg
    P/E				15.13
    Forward P/E		14.04
    Price/Sales		1.76
    Price/Book	       3.83
    Price/Cash flow	11.4
		
Compared to the other major lumber companies, RFP again has the best forward looking PE and is undervalued as compared to other similar industry players‚Äô price to book and price to sales metrics.  The stock could double form its current value and it still would be undervalued compared to its competitor.  That probably explains why RFP has been performing better, price wise, than any of the larger companies:

RFP‚Äî41% YTD, 80% 6-Months, 479% 1-yr

WFG‚Äî2%, 23%, 229%	    

WY‚Äî1%, 22%, 108%

In terms of why RFP is still flying under the radar, first, they are a company that had not been doing well for years, have been turning it around for the last decade while refocusing their main sources of income.  That takes time and money which mutes their true earnings once those one times costs disappear.  So their 10-year graph and historic earnings reports are not pretty.  

Second, because of how badly the pandemic hit their paper segment, it has hidden the growing EBIDTA run rate from their lumber and pulp segments.  So their earnings are much less than the forestry companies, while being much higher than the other paper companies of comparable size to RFP.

Lastly, any time the major financial media companies (Like CNBC) discuss the lumber surge, they either suggest people invest in Home Depot / Lowes, Lumber Liquidators or the largest forestry companies, WY and WFG, which already have their future profits priced in.  So those investors who do whatever the talking heads tell them to do, they are going to miss stocks like RFP.

**The Bullish Case for 2021**

As of right now, the average analyst projection for Q1 is 1.26 EPS. Let‚Äôs look at RFP‚Äôs yearly GAAP Net income / EPS for the last decade:

    RFP 	Net Inc. GAAP	EPS
    2011   	   41	              0.42
    2012	        -2	              -0.02
    2013	        -639	        -6.75
    2014	        -277	        -2.93
    2015	        -257	        -2.78
    2016	        -81	               -0.9
    2017	        -84	        -0.93
    2018	        235	         1.96
    2019	        -47	         -0.51
    2020	         10	               0.12

Meaning if RFP hits the average analyst estimate of 1.26 EPS, it‚Äôll be the best quarterly EPS they‚Äôve had in a decade, and almost last much earnings in their single best year in the last decade.  

And in all likelihood, these analysists may still be underestimating RFP‚Äôs earnings for 2021.  For example: Here is ‚ÄúRBC‚Äôs capital market issuer disclosure for its analyst‚Äôs [Paul Quinn] $1.16 EPS estimate for Q1 and 11$ price target:

‚ÄúValuation (2/5/2021): Our price target of $11 is based on a blended 5.5x EV/EBITDA multiple using our trend EBITDA of $250MM (weighted 85%) and our 2021 EBITDA estimate of $447MM (weighted 15%). Our target multiple is near the low end of the typical North American Paper and Forest Products trading range (5.0x to 8.0x), reflecting the company‚Äôs exposure to the declining newsprint/groundwood paper markets.‚Äù

In 2018, RFP produced 200 EBIDTA from the mini surge in lumber price, ([Link to Q4 Earnings Slide](https://imgur.com/gallery/QdCqSAv)) and the average transaction price for the year was $446 mbf.  The higher the price of lumber the higher the portions of those sales go to straight earnings.  

If lumber maintains an average transaction price of at least 800 (and it‚Äôs been trading over $1000 Since February), RFP is looking at possibly over 200 EBITDA for the quarter, much less for the year.  And that doesn‚Äôt include any extra earnings from pulp or paper.  So the analyst‚Äôs projection of a run rate of 250 EBITDA for the whole company for all of 2021, is grossly underestimating the earnings RFP will generate form these high lumber sales and suggests RFP will easily beat the Q1 projections.

No only is the price of lumber up, but RFP‚Äôs production capacity for lumber is also higher than 2018.  RFP‚Äôs 2020 purchase of 3 US sawmills have proven to be perfectly timed.  These mills have begun producing lumber at the start of 2021 and will be at 100% capacity by the end of Q2. (Google Q4 2020 Earnings Call transcript; link blocked by r/investing).  These three mills will roughly increase RFP‚Äôs total lumber production by 25%.  That is just extra production capacity at a time when it matters most, meaning much more earning potential than 2018.

As if that weren‚Äôt enough, wood pulp is has also surged to the highest price it has been in at least 3 years. ([Link to Shanghai Wood Pulp Futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21))  My guess is that this spike is in large part to China‚Äôs ban on single use non-degradable plastic, effective in major cities December 2020. ([LINK](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51171491).)  Because of this surge, RFP has announced multiple price increases to their wood pulp in the last four months, that would put transaction prices the highest they have been in multiple years. 

**Issues with RFP**

I think it‚Äôs important to always include any possible downsides.  Things to keep in mind, RFP, being a smaller market cap, is less likely to trade at valuation ratios like the largest companies.  So it is hard to predict when this company is trading at a true fair value.

Also, RFP still has a large amount of debt for their size, and some issues funding their pension.  They are paying it down, but this could also scare off some investors.  They don‚Äôt have as high of a return on equity/assets like some of it‚Äôs competitors, raising some concerns with the quality of management.  

RFP‚Äôs paper still is likely to historically underperform for another quarter or two.  The economy reopening back should bring back some revenue, however, because there are no futures markets for paper, this sector of the company is substantially harder to project.  
The stock itself is very volatile because it is a microcap.  There are probably many investors who avoid that type of volatility.

Lastly, because of its small volume/float size, the stock is more susceptible to market manipulation by the hedge funds or market makers.  So it probably wouldn‚Äôt be smart to play with short term calls. 

If you all identify more, I would love to hear it in case I‚Äôm missing something and need to readjust my perspective on this stock.

**Fun Tidbit:**

While I was looking into RFP, a buddy sent me these screenshots of Keith ‚ÄúDFV‚Äù Gill‚Äôs stock portfolio from his Roaring Kitty live streams in August 2020 ([Link](https://imgur.com/a/Qg3U2Ay))  and January 2021 ([Link](https://imgur.com/a/GIQJRd6)).  Apparently, the man REALLY knows how to pick ‚Äòem.  RFP up at ~ 100% since that August video.

**TLDR**: This paper/lumber company spent the last decade turning things around.  It‚Äôs had the best price performance of any of the paper/forestry companies for the last year.  2021 Q1 earnings projected to be the best Q earnings in at least a decade, with Q2 likely to be better.   This is probably why Keith Gill has been holding it or looking at it for months.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Really hard to say. There‚Äôs a lot of different ways to estimate it.

We could take a hit in one area and make up the difference providing the rest, but with it across the board we have to pass the buck.

There will be pushback from contractors, because we'll be pricing ourselves out of some work, but I don't look for prices to drop until warehouses, lumber yards, etc. are full of inventory that ain't moving.  That's not going to be soon."

It is not entirely costless, but nearly. I need to pay \~800$ in difference + commission/brokerage.

With this collar, the worst case I can lose is 13% from today's value (224). And my upside is limited to 33.9%.  Is this accurate? This feels too good to be true to me, as the upside is 30%  while downside is only 13%. But I read that this is usually not the case when we try to collar. So what am I missing here?"

They have a good App, new programs like Walmart+, plans to go into banking, they have free next day shipping on some stuff. Maybe they are categorizing expenses differently. But Amazons, net profit is on a consistent uptrend where WMT is not. This year Amazon earned 6% profit on nearly the same volume WMT earned only 2% on."

What are others thoughts on their decisions or positions?

EDIT: Yes, I understand I exaggerated the potential gains. Gains of 3-6x are more realistic, which is still completely bonkers. Now, for the love of everything holy please stop sending me messages. I understand."
03/20/2021,stocks,I cringe at all of my investment decisions.
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you're expecting 50x returns in 1 year you are delusional. 

Even your edited post of 3-6x returns in 1 year being ""realistic"" is delusional."
03/20/2021,stocks,"All these hindsight posts are insane.  The market was flipping breakers several days in a row, that decline was nearly unprecedented and the bottom was not obvious at all, I put some money in, but not all, you‚Äôd have to be extremely ballsy or extremely well off to think hey the market is dropping 7% a day and I could definitely lose my job, should definitely take on debt to put in the stock market"
03/20/2021,stocks,ETSY. I don‚Äôt even use it. My philosophy is invest in anything my wife spends a lot of money on. I miss out EVERY SINGLE TIME on following my own investment thesis.
03/20/2021,stocks,Stupid exaggeration is why messed up.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Holding cash during uncertain times is valuable to me, that's how I justify only putting a small amount of money in at that time."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I saw the madness of the crash and decided it was time to finally enter the market.  I am really glad I did back in March 2020 because all my initial stock picks have amazing gains. There are some I wish I had grabbed.  For me my wish I would've was PENN.  I bought MGM instead, which is still great, but PENN really went wild.

I have learned not to beat myself up too much over missed opportunities because that doesn't do anything positive for me."
03/20/2021,stocks,I could have become a multi millionaire on one stock if I had the bawls. Instead I made 4K on $73. Oh well. HODL.
03/20/2021,stocks,I saw it coming in late December.  Told everyone at work.  I cashed out and waited til late Feb-March  Bought a bunch of goofy stuff like PRTY at .40.  Sold at 1200% Whatever was panic sold. I spread it out so far I barely noticed Briggs and Stratton went under.  I'd buy in and cost average my way down until the market turned around in April. 2x-3x on most but some 800-1000% gains.  Now I'm telling everyone to watch out for inflation.  Selling out recovery gains and putting it somewhere safe before the USD crash.  Better early than late.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sure. I wish I'd gone all in on tech at end of day March 16th, but who knew? Almost everyone thought the fall was going to last way longer. Looking back on my buys and sells from last year while doing my taxes I was reminded that when the worst, stomach churning plunge arrived - 12% on March 16 I lost nothing because I'd sold everything 2 weeks earlier. So I didn't do too bad..."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Hindsight is 20/20. You are out of your mind if you think you could predict trade outcomes perfectly. While your imagining fantasy lands and perfect trades, why not think of all the things you could have bought with that 500k. For all the good it will do you or your bottom line.

If your green your golden my friend, relax."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I played it too safe when covid was at its worst, things like developing market indexes and Microsoft. Then sold the indexes to buy some tech stocks just before the September correction. Which was too bad but nothing I'm beating myself up over. Also sold pretty low on some GE.

Best buys during the early covid lows for me were Softbank and JPM. 

Unfortunately I was buying a lot of tech just before this last correction. Which is too bad but it was just when I had the cash to put in. Overall some tactical mistakes, but I learned a lot and nothing too bad. If I could see the future I'd be rich but so would literally everyone else. Been doing a lot of DCAing so I'm not as stressed as people who try to time the market."
03/20/2021,stocks,"No one here thinks that the market is absolutely ridiculous right now ? Just a small uptick in bond yield causing such big movement should be telling us something , no? .... Just an Ape here"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I invested for the very first time last March. I knew enough to know it was a massive opportunity, but unfortunately since I had never done it before I was very gun shy. I could have invested $20-25k but instead only invested $5k. So yeah, I cringe at my reluctance to just take the plunge."
03/20/2021,stocks,"My FIL talked me out of $TSLA and $SQ, then pooh poohed Mama Cathie. March 20, 2020."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Dude I feel you, I'm in the same boat. I'm kinda beside myself tbh, if I didn't have my head fitted snugly into my rectum all last year, I could have bought a new car and moved out of my dad's basement by now. 

Literally missed the biggest investment opportunity I've ever lived through, and will probably ever live through.
I literally cannot drink about this hard enough, lmao"
03/20/2021,stocks,I feel like I timed the bottom pretty well but wish I had put more conviction into my plays. Disney in particular. It's not worth getting too stressed over. Plenty of opportunity ahead.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I feel that. I'm new and had just started learning about investing after inheriting an IRA. In March I got scared and didn't look for months and months. I didn't understand what the fuck either. I did get into a few good plays in Feb and happy I ignored PayPal, Netflix, etsy and teledoc. But I wish I had started learning about the market last year. Oh well!  Hindsight...20/20."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You said it yourself: hindsight is 20/20. Almost nobody in March 2020 could see the lockdowns lasting this long. The picks for a quick crash and recovery would be very different than a prolonged lockdown/depression. I did the former, lol. Although I did have enough sense to pick some smaller cap oil stocks very near the bottom that all did 3-4x (DVN, XEC, MRO). I was looking at crash levels that were down at least 66% from pre-covid normal for 3x gains. Oil was a no-brainer because it's an essential commodity that was bound to pick back up rather quickly. Some of my other picks, ugh... It's gonna be a while till they return to where they were, if they ever do."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Stocks are at the mercy of market conditions and sentiment. 
This is why its so difficult to beat the market. 
One year something like a Zoom does well. 
Next year it does badly and Wells Fargo does well. 
Its incredibly difficult to time rotations and guess what the market is going to do next. Just invest in what you think will do best over the next ten years, understanding that your portfolio won't do well every year."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You‚Äôre on crack, I bought travel and entertainment stocks March 2020 and the best one is up 5x."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It was certainly very instructive how the external factors around a crash affect your investing behaviour 

I'm in healthcare. I was waking up in a cold sweat before work in fear. My colleagues were living apart from their families in fear of infecting them. Huge lines and shortages of food staples at grocery stores. People were talking at work about buying guns to defend their homes. We didn't know if covid was a 1% or 10% mortality risk. Talk over healthcare being completely overwhelmed. Premonitions of having to pull young people off of life support and triage care. 

I deployed some cash early but it began to feel apocalyptic and I just lost interest in investing altogether in the midst of everything. Had I kept a cool head I'd be up 100k+. By the time it became clear the world wasn't ending, we had reached precovid levels. Tons of people including Buffett IIRC were sure we'd retest the bottom. And here we are 1y later still charging higher from that point. 

Crazy."
03/20/2021,stocks,"This hits close to home. I was retarded enough to cash out in March of last year and missed 2 year+ of my salary in gains. I got back in fully last wednesday after the fed's annoucement at pretty much ATH. THen the very next day the market dips, and there is now a lot of bearish sentiment in the market. I am already down like 4k after just 2 days. Not only did I sell the bottom, i have a feeling I bought in at what most likely the top as well. I feel like shit inside."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as easy as ‚Äúnext pandemic I‚Äôm loading up‚Äù. This goes back to hind sight is 20/20. Every time the market is down, especially multiple red days in a row, we naturally can‚Äôt help but think it‚Äôs never gonna end and the sky is falling. When going thru this time period, no one knows where the bottom is so we‚Äôre hesitant to buy because we feel it‚Äôs never going to end and we might be able to buy for less tomorrow or the next day etc. By the time we realize it really is over it‚Äôs too late and we missed out on gains."
03/20/2021,stocks,You greatly exaggerated the potential gains
03/20/2021,stocks,Zoom 1yr calls went up something like 50x. Doubt it was that.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Same, I think most of us had the confidence to buy travel and entertainment that time hoping for an easy bounce back, for me it was that I went too conservative and didn't put enough money, think I put in a couple $1000s, but had let's say another couple $1000s in cash on the side, albeit it's all hindsight."
03/20/2021,stocks,"> I cringe at all of my investment decisions.

Oh wow, the relatability hurts here :("
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you read the original post, you might have a better basis to start your shit show. In MARCH of 2020, you know like one year ago when absolutely everything took a massive dump. Thousands of stock have gone from ~$10 to well north of $100+. Almost everything across the board from March/April 2020 has gone up 2x or more.

Yes, starting today in a newly semi stabilized market those gains would be unheard of probably."
03/20/2021,stocks,"As I've posted in other threads, for the commoner buying at the low was not really an option. Why? Because they didn't have foreknowledge of the bombshell announcements. Here's a snippet from another article just for reference: ""According to financial disclosure forms, Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Richard Burr (R-N.C.) each sold hundreds of thousands of dollars in stocks within days of the Senate holding a classified briefing on Jan. 24 with Trump administration officials on the threat of the coronavirus outbreak."". I think it's safe to say they weren't the only ones that knew and simple emails/phone calls to people in their circles allowed the insiders to get out in time. So let's ask ourselves, how many Americans knew in late January that within weeks society would essentially be shackled? Very few. Once most people knew the markets had dipped and all they could remove was actual losses because they sat on unrealized losses by that point.

In case most have figured it out yet, the market is not designed to make the average investor wealthy. They can do REALLY well, but not insider knowledge $10 million/day good."
03/20/2021,stocks,"At the rate they have been printing money for at least the last 20 years, it boggles my mind that the wheels have stayed on."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Well played, rather excellent time to enter the market."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Congrats on the 5K honestly. Many were too scared to invest enough because the fear mongering that happened. Lots died, but less than 1/5th the originally predicted death count."
03/20/2021,stocks,Damn :(
03/20/2021,stocks,Again hindsight is 20/20. There were millions that missed the boat. Hope you find another path.
03/20/2021,stocks,I placed an edit already explaining the 50x was an exaggeration. I have yet to find Any sizable company that didn‚Äôt increase at least 2x between the lowest day in March 2020 and today. Anybody that invested large sums across handfuls of companies in March is sitting in unbelievable position.
03/20/2021,stocks,"It was an unbelievably uncertain time for sure. Looking back its easy to say just buy tons of stock, but at one point I remember listened to a virologist speak about 2% of the US population parishing. The first time heading to the store post announcement and finding empty shelves on almost every aisle was a rather rough wake call. Really illustrated just how quickly society can go from functioning to off the rails. 

If I had to bet on Buffett's actual behind closed door decisions during the initial dip though, its that he bought a metric ton of discounted stock."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Overall that is true. My issue in particular was just not really paying much attention at all to the market at that point in time. Looking at the charting there was a fairly consistent floor it seems, where things started to creep back up. Buying everything at the absolute basement isn't realistic, but people that had a close eye could see a very consistent tick up 2-4 weeks after the biggest dips. So at least could have taken advantage of say 90% of the total potential gains. The people that waited months started losing out extremely fast."
03/20/2021,stocks,That was stated in the edit note. I've been told over and over again pretty much 2x gains were absurd and nobody did that well. I also told my buddy that all his 3.8x'ed dollars he invested in Zoom were fake in March because Reddit said so.
03/20/2021,stocks,"It was on my watchlist in January 2020 but I didn't pull the trigger. :(

03/20/2021,stocks,"Why did KIRK explode? What's the explanation there? I thought they were primarily physical stores which would imply they'd do badly in a pandemic.

Funny how you think saying someone doesn't know how to read is going to change that fact. But let's for sake of argument assume that I was the brain dead idiot you think I am and had no clue what the hell you are talking about. According to you, any monkey could've randomly thrown darts at a board and got 50x (or 3-6x) returns. And yet, here you are making a thread about how you didn't. How sir, could you not have gotten a *minimum* of 3x return if any monkey could've? 

Perhaps the answer is simple. It is obvious. It is clear as day. **You are delusional.** 

Have a nice day now."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you know the answer to your own post. If everyone had the hindsight we have now, we‚Äôd all be multi millionaires.

For example, are you taking advantage of the current market correction? In a year or 2, this will look like a helluva sale"
03/20/2021,stocks,Yeah it really was good timing/luck that I was able to buy my initial positions when I did.
03/20/2021,stocks,I certainly regret not putting all the money I had into it in March. I got in at the best possible day. But that‚Äôs just the way it goes. Nobody has a crystal ball.

03/20/2021,stocks,"‚ÄúHow sir, could you not have gotten a minimum of 3x return if any monkey could've?‚Äù. 

Well, answer to this is simple. At that point in time I had $500 in the stock market. Had investments other places, but never played stocks before much. Spent a lot of lockdown learning about investing basics. So yes, examining the market in March of 2020, it seems rather clear that dumping money into literally almost any stock at the low would have yielded 3-6x. There‚Äôs a reason Congress members and connected financial entities dumped absolutely everything just days before public announcements of COVID and lockdowns were made. Those fuckers easily turned every dollar into 3-6 at a minimum.

Again, that‚Äôs why I said I wished a trusted somebody had given me an inside scoop and I would have liquidated everything in stocks.

Edited, had put $0 instead of $500. On mobile"

Nobody and I mean nobody expected to double their money in a couple of months. The people who bought in expected to get a good rise over the long term. Now everyone is like ""duh."" 

I'm bitter that I missed most of the crazy run but I understand why I held off. I was also in the market for a house so I guess I was hesitant to dump it in and lose it short term."
03/20/2021,stocks,I bought a bit a few weeks into the correction but am holding off now until we have signs of continued recovery. I‚Äôm ok missing the absolute bottom as long as I catch it on its way up. This irrational reaction to bond yields ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Honestly i would personally be a little worried. Two independent brokerages denying the same thing implies that you have some kind of serious underlying problem.

Who do you bank with? I did some searching and found some info that states some  internet based can run into this problem.

If the problem isn‚Äôt your bank, take some time to dig into your credit and identity history, or try and think of any reason the feds would flag your account. This could easily be a foreign watchlist kind of thing if you come from a list of certain countries."

NVDA dropped from 600 or so down to 508 recently. I ran out of money in my account until next pay period. My cost basis right now for NVDA is 550. I'm partly NVDA drops a bit again so I can buy more a lower my cost basis. Has anybody bought here at what was a nice loss and then a year later you made back your investment and were back up?

Now up 20% and climbing. Similar scenario with SPCE now up over 100% with plenty of growth opportunity.  Same with Ford. Did the same with BB before the hype and sold at major profit.  Now down on RYCEY but picked up more and think I‚Äôll see a lot of green later in the year.
03/20/2021,stocks,"That's good to hear. Haha I like NVidia and these tech stocks and know a lot about that and e-commerce since I am really into technology in general. I was surprised with AMD. Growing up AMD wasn't anything special from what I remember. NVidia and intel were the biggest deals.

Thanks for the response. Made me feel better about buying nvidia at such a high valuation. I'll probably scale down with them as I like the company. QCOM I'll do the same."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I guess I'll scale down with the dip. I like that they are diversified across a few different areas. Crypto, gaming and AI. I'm new admittedly, but plan on staying and I'm learning now haha so I bought shares of CVS, GM, TMUS, HD, LOW and CHWY. Chewy I think has a lot of promise.

I kind of Dodged the bullet on this last market correction because I'm not heavily invested in tech.  But my understanding is there is multiple chips shortages out there, and any of those manufacturers are supposed to be good investments. I'm surprised they got hit by this tech correction.

AMD was a competitor for CPUs with Intel for a long period of time.  I thought they still were.

NVidia was a graphics processor manufacturer.

Not sure if either of those have changed."

I wish I could yell at them. There should be a way to do this that costs a small amount of money. I'd pay 20 bucks easy. All you have to do to open such a position is pay the going price of the security, and whoever takes the bid will get a memo that basically tells them they are fucking up.

2021-03-20 00:18:54,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021 Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC‚Äôs comments earlier this week. 

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve‚Äôs assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed‚Äôs comments, ‚ÄúChairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we‚Äôre at full employment. We‚Äôre a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that‚Äôs the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \[Thursday\].‚Äù It‚Äôs important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.

Despite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed‚Äôs accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish

03/20/2021,stocks,Thanks for the recap. Really need BABA to hit the target.
03/20/2021,stocks,it could be bad for bonds / treasuries and good for precious metals like gold & silver
03/20/2021,stocks,"Also good for companies that generate good earnings now (mature companies) rather than companies with no/low earnings now with the ""promise"" of higher earnings in future (eg growth stocks eg TSLA). Visa for example (Not recommending Visa, just using it as an example.)"
2021-03-20 00:13:29,stocks,"Anyone else is in VIS (industrials) I am so heavily allocated to VOO. I was looking at VIS for diversification but it has underperformed VOO on pretty much every metric historically. 

So one way to look at it is to keep all money in VOO. 

Another is to shift some into VIS because it hasn‚Äôt run up like crazy last year hoping that it will outperform VOO in the next few years. 

What‚Äôs the tribe thinking?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I was thinking about developing a way to rotate between sector trends with a few focused ETFs. But after looking at the issue, I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the effort. I initially considered using 5 % of my portfolio for this, but the benefit, even if I manage to time the changes perfectly, wouldn‚Äôt to justify devoting the additional time required to ride sector momentum. 

And to be honest, this is getting more into speculative trading, so I‚Äôd personally rather put 5% into something with more upside than market sentiment toward industrials/healthcare/etc. if I want to obsess over researching stocks."

03/20/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs not foolish, but putting your entire portfolio into 1 company is."
03/20/2021,stocks,"blindly? yes, foolish. 

$15k in one stock, as your total investment portfolio? also foolish. 

as a novice, your first move should be to put the bulk of money into a low-fee fund or ETF covering all, or a large portion of the US market. things like VTI, VOO, FZORX, VTSAX, SPY, IWB, etc. investing in hundreds or thousands of stocks is much safer and more stable than putting all your chips on one stock. 

single stocks are ok as a small part of the overall picture. but I'd read up on it first before going all in."

The commission itself would be huge and impactful especially when OP is putting in sub 6 figures. 

Honestly just stick with 5 to 10 different stocks and youll be fine. 

Too much diversification is stupification - charlie munger"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sure if your portfolio is like 6 or 7 figures. But if youre going in with like 20-30k, nothing wrong with buying a single stock or maybe 2.

2021-03-19 23:50:33,stocks,"Looking for an ETF or two in order to diversify my tech-heavy portfolio? (VTI/VTV/SPY/QQQ, etc) My portfolio is very tech-heavy and I‚Äôm looking to diversify into some value stocks or ideally an ETF that will give me the best exposure to more-stable stocks. An ETF is preferable because I find it really hard to do DD on some of these older and frankly more boring companies. The fact they are boring is why I need them in my portfolio - reading about cool new technology is very engaging but doesn‚Äôt make for the best stocks picks for me. 

Over the past 2 months I have put a little less than half of my savings in the stock market (with the tickers in the descending order: SQ, AAPL, AMD, DM, ARKK, GME, CRSP, NIO, MJ, SOXL, RVP). I‚Äôm getting in the habit of investing regularly and I would like to put my next few deposits into some growth stocks or an ETF that will offset my exposure to so much tech. From what I can tell a lot of the ETF‚Äôs that I‚Äôm looking at seem to have very similar return rates (VTI, SPY, VOO, VT, VTV and even QQQ seem to move in the same direction). If they are all *relatively* similar and stable should I lean towards something like VTV that prioritizes ‚Äòvalue‚Äô stocks? Or (if I am making a mistake in that assumption) could somebody explain the difference between some of these index ETF‚Äôs?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"If you are looking at VTV then you might also look at VOE or VBR.  The three are Vanguard's large cap,  mid cap, and small cap U.S. value ETFs.  Recently the mid and small are outperforming the large."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I bought VYM; Vanguard high dividend yield ETF. It's been doing great in general, and it's especially nice to have on the days when the tech drops because it usually goes up.

I chose dividend stocks (and not even growth dividend stocks) because the portfolio is made of all the stable, ""value"" and - yes, I agree with you! - incredibly boring stocks that I'd never buy and pick individually. Also, to clarify, even without getting any dividend pay, these stocks rise (and therefore my ETF goes up) whenever the value stocks go up. The biggest holdings are the big banks (JPMorgan, BaC), Johnson and Johnson, cable companies like Verizon... stuff that growth/tech/volatility-averse Warren Buffet would like."

Poshmark, Inc. owns and operates a social marketplace to buy and sell lifestyle products in the United States and Canada. The company offers apparel, footwear, home, and beauty products, as well as accessories.¬†

The company seems to have alot of potential but I would like to hear some other thoughts on it."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Posting from an older thread on here:
I honestly don't see Poshmark as something that will be a multi billion business long term (I am not close to this industry so I am happy to be proven wrong, if someone has information/data). 

I see Posh offering to be very similar to EBay with focus on clothes and shoes. But that seems to be a limited market. Also the way to make money is probably not the $20 clothes but the $4k unique and vintage items... Isn't that where eBay comes in though? Like isn't eBay the first place you would look at if you were trying to find something unique/vintage/antique/expensive? 

When I think app based companies helping small businesses, I think of Etsy. Just app wise, I think Etsy is miles ahead of Posh and has a much bigger TAM. I would steer away from POSH. 

This is not financial advice, just my opinion. I don't have any position in POSH as of the time of the comment."

Then we go over the fact that even great companies are trading as high as 20x revenue multiples and while the Faang's will be fine what do you with companies like Jumia, Pltr, Roku and so many others that are promising future returns but are already trading at those numbers now. This is without mentioning the fact that there is major uncertainty concerning the insane inflation that is happening and if another multi billion $ stymie bill will get passed, we have to pay that money back at some point guys and gals it doesn't just grow on trees.

The idea behind DCAing is that you avoid some volatility in the market.

The idea behind sitting on money is that statistically most people who do this end up losing out on gains and they'd be better off with all their money in equity.  This would mean youre better off holding almost/no cash.

Aren't these are pretty contradictory philosophies?"

03/20/2021,stocks,"One is a conscious choice to invest some sum you've in increments to avoid catching a falling knife and or averaging down your share cost. 

Whereas the other is ""paying yourself first"" asap from your paycheck cuz that's your only option. 

Lump sum is statistically king but not everyone always has a windfall to toss in as they please. People that DCA in place of lump sum are doing it wrong, DCA is a slightly more nuanced tool than that. Otherwise you're simply taking risk later(DCA) rather than all at once(Lump) which makes no difference when all is said and done."

If people aren't shopping then retail sells off, etc.  Why do people continue to say the stock market has nothing to do with the economy?

What am I missing here?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"People that say the stock market has nothing to do with the economy are idiots, that is why. The stock market is the economy. What proof? What happens if the stock market was shut down tomorrow and no one could use it ever again, what would happen? There is a snow cone stand down the road. What happens if it was shut down tomorrow? What happens if a walmart was shut down? Or all walmarts? If you shut down the stock market every corp will cease to function, all banks would fail, no one would get paid, the entire system would collapse, chaos all over the world. The stock market IS the economy. Yes, other things could be just as damaging, but almost everything wouldn't even come close. The stock market is a casino that has been connected to the value of companies.

I suggest you ignore anyone that tells you that the stock market isn't the economy. Even if it isn't 100%, even if it was only 75% or 50% or 25%, it still has a huge impact on society, one of the biggest impacts. It effects everyone even if most people have no idea how it works. If work it effects you. If the stock market crashes money can dry up real quick causing major problems which can cause business not to be able to pay out short term loans which can cause employee's not getting paid(specially since their bosses will pay themselves first).

03/20/2021,stocks,"This is why I think the saying how the stock markets are forward looking really comes in and also the reason why some stocks, that might be making absolutely no money, or even losing money, sometimes with barely any products, can still flourish or even blossom, if it's a stock everyone believes will be big one day, even before it actually is big in the present moment."

Happy Friday! We‚Äôre halfway thru the month of March! Crazy, don‚Äôt you say?! 

The Techy-Wrecky is back again with the 10 year treasury yield up.. *woo-hoo* ... 

This means tech stocks are takin a *BEATING!*

You‚Äôre seeing red in your portfolio??

Well let‚Äôs go back to the first day you bought this stock... why on earth did you buy this stock? Do you believe in the company and its fundamentals, and growth in the long-term? ... or was it for some quick cash, the race to get rich quick..? 

The stock market always will have a good day, and a bad day.. literally like life - there‚Äôs good days, and bad days... in the end, all should be OK if you bought into a well established company... *yes, I know anything can happen at any given time* ...

Let‚Äôs say I bought Apple Stock. *I did, but lets take it for an example* ....

I purchased this for $137 usd , and it is now $120-125 range.... 

Should you sell??

The company hasn‚Äôt changed anything towards it, it‚Äôs just that these treasury yields are up... 

So it‚Äôs more of a buying opportunity to ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù . *This isn‚Äôt Financial Advice. Do your own DD, your capital is at risk.* 

First and foremost, lets take a look at this all..

‚Äî- Keep in mind , this is a long-ish read... read however much you want, comment if you want, or simply view it. ‚Äî Plus , thank you for taking your time to read this! ‚Äî-

#The Mindset

1) We procrastinate buying certain stock at (x) price... so we go ‚Äúwe‚Äôll buy that when its lower‚Äù WHILE HAVIN A PLAN, and doing research... 

2) We see it rise up and suddenly we think we have ‚Äúmissed out‚Äù ‚Äî *FOMO* ...

3) a) It either rises up more, and more, and more... 

b) It rises up, tumbles all the way back down, and we freak out...

4) a) We can take our profits if we wish

b) We start worrying *oh my goodness, I‚Äôm losing money* ... and sometimes results in us selling stock.

*or*

1) We see a stock in an article , ‚Äúthis stock will make you ____ dollars in ____ years‚Äù or Jimmy Joe suggests ‚ÄúBUY THIS STOCK‚Äù 

2) You see stock, buy stock... NO PLAN, NO GOAL, blindfolded buying the stock... 

3) You see it go up ? Wow, you might‚Äôve gotten lucky! *First ones free!* .... or you see it go down??

4) You say **F^ck JIMMY JOE!!** as he made you lose ____ dollars as you were holding ___ shares.... little do you know, Jimmy Joe has a plan of ____ years, ____ price target, and sees the full potential. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

**DO YOU NOTICE THAT?**

Why are you buying into a company YOU BELIEVE IN for a ‚Äúgood price‚Äù to you, and selling it off for less? 

It‚Äôs sheer utter panic.. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm losing money!! I have to sell!‚Äù 

... it‚Äôs not a loss until you sell it !!! 

It‚Äôs like buying a new house you fully renovated for 500k ... and selling it for 475k to a family friend ... or buying something new - literally anything - and selling it for cheaper... even though the stock is always ‚Äúnew‚Äù !!!

#How to manage seeing red - a loss

**Please feel free to add whatever tips you have yourself down in the bottom, but I will list some of mine.** 

1) If you have high hopes, aren‚Äôt in need of money, you can let it slide... a bad day in the stock market will happen time to time. - it will always create buying opportunities, and good selling opportunities if you are patient. ‚Äî **Only put money in you can afford to lose** ‚Äî with certain stocks, or just in general. The Stock Market is no ‚ÄúGame‚Äù whatsoever, and viewing it this way can create an addiction.. 

2) **SET A STOP LOSS** - this should be number 1, but I will leave it as number 2. Why? Because if you are a long term investor, sometimes not having stop loss is your friend... imagine if your stop loss kicked in during March last year.... *the gold mine opportunity* ... you would have lost a LOT of money... and I‚Äôm sure everyone did during that time period... if you want a risky investment that you‚Äôre unsure of, don‚Äôt really know ... sure, a stop loss is great! It will allow you to buy stock of a company you actually really like.

3) Exercise. Walk around for a bit, do yoga, a workout, play Wii Fit , meditate... whatever to help your mind off the stress of ‚Äúlosing‚Äù money..  ‚Äî- also helps by not even looking at your Trading App... do whatever else, do nothing if you really want!! Its okay to let your money work its on powers.... relax.. calm down! You are INVESTING or TRADING! You started a position in something you like which is better than none - and regretting it - and started trading/investing in the first place... which is REALLY beneficial in the long run!! ‚Äî You just have to wait and see! 

4) Jot down the day, and price the stock reached on its low... sounds ridiculous, right? Not overly... if you do this with a stock, you will see that you can take a hard hit of a negative number... and its progression back up to where it regained... - do this with some of your favourite stocks, and you can see for yourself where a stock price remains as a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù for you and a ‚Äúsell‚Äù for you... 

5) Know that everyone is losing money. Yes, you‚Äôre allowed to think of yourself, everyone has different capitals , risk tolerance, etc., ... but know it is not just you.. and we all are either losing a ton of money... or gaining... 

6) Last one - If you don‚Äôt believe in that company no longer, don‚Äôt like its fundamentals / something about it, need money, and ‚Äúits a bust‚Äù because it hasn‚Äôt moved? Maybe that is when you should sell for a loss..

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

We all want to make money. We all want some profits from our stocks, but suddenly when we start putting our emotions into the stock market... it sometimes wins... and we sell low, and buy high... and lose a ton of money doing so... 

That won‚Äôt make you rich... it will give you a lesson that **sometimes** if you‚Äôre not patient enough, you will miss out on great opportunities.  

‚Äî But also, don‚Äôt be greedy. Greed will win over, and that stock will plummet, and you‚Äôll be regretting yourself. Treat yourself to some profits... its OKAY to take profits!! 

Everyone makes mistakes in the market.

**OVERALL** - Stocks !! Stocks last FOREVER! even after you die!!! So if you buy something, see it a low? Replace your emotions, think positive... *I believe in this stock, this stock can reach my stock price of ____ and I will sell (x) shares* .... ‚Äî ALWAYS, ALWAYS, have a PLAN when buying a stock!! 

What is your goal? .. and go after it! If you no longer believe in the company, something changes thats bad / you don‚Äôt like, sure! Cut them losses, or take those profits while you can!! Put it in something you believe in - or a well established company (blue chip) or simply an ETF... and life is good!! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Äî‚Äî- ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 

All in all, 

The stock market is a rollercoaster of emotions. People buy when they think its a good price to buy in, while others think its a good time to sell.... you have your plan... you stick to that plan... and everything should be okay! 

Happy Friday, everyone! 

Stock Market closes in an hour ... (not including after market) ... time to relax afterwards for the weekend!!

What are your guys‚Äô plans? Let me know, down below!!

... and feel free to criticize, give feedback, and any other tips to help out others while seeing a loss! If there‚Äôs anything I missed, feel free to add that in, as well!!

2021-03-19 22:44:04,stocks,"Federal Reserve's dovish state of mind puts quality assets at risk Hello guys.

Of course I haven‚Äôt written this piece, copied from SAXO BANK platform. 

I tried to post the 3 charts as well, but don‚Äôt know how, I am sure you can find them. 

I am not knowledgeable enough to understand as to how serious this is or not? Hope you understand this better than me. 




By maintaining monetary policies easy but letting long-term yields free to move, the Federal Reserve gives support to lower quality credits while putting quality at risk. We are heading towards an unprecedented duration event that will weight on high duration assets, which in the bond market are concentrated within the investment-grade corporate space. The US investment grade (IG) corporate bond sector is heading to the worst quarter since 1981, with the utilities and communications sectors being more exposed to rising interest rates than others. The technology sector, which saw stellar valuations in the stock market last year, is characterized by a duration of eight and a half years, which matches the US IG average.
The market doesn't care about the Federal Reserve's dovish state of mind. The Fed said it itself: the economic outlook is improving substantially with inflation destined to rise together with the country's GDP, while the labour market gets stronger. Nevertheless, the central bank decided to stand still and continue with its accommodative monetary policy. This decision leaves the market with the
ONLY OPTION TO TAKE THE SITUATION INTO ITS OWN HANDS AND DUMPING TREASURIES
that will inevitably lose value.

The steeping of the US yield curve resumed this morning with the curve's belly and the benchmark 10-year yields rising faster than long-term US Treasuries. The big issue is that if economic forecasts and inflation expectations continue to rise, r
ATES WILL NOT STABILIZE UNTIL THE FEDERAL RESERVE DECIDES TO INTERVENE AND ENGAGE IN THE INFAMOUS YIELD CURVE CONTROL (YCC)
. In our view, YCC will be unavoidable because, although the market can function with higher rates now, the higher they go, the more the pain that will be inflicted on those assets with historically high durations.

The market is talking about 10-year yields hitting 2%; however, if the Federal Reserve continues to keep watching, they might rise much further. The Fed has been able to maintain easy financial conditions by keeping real rates negative. However, they will not stay negative forever. In normal circumstances, nominal yields should price over the breakeven rate. It means that if inflation expectations continue to rise, we inevitably will see 10-year yields rising above 2.3%.

The investment-grade corporate bond market will fall faster than junk within this context because of its sensibility to higher duration. Indeed, while the average duration within junk is around three and a half years, the investment-grade bond space carries a duration of more than 8 years. Duration within quality credits has recently increased dramatically: in the past two years, duration has increased by one year and a half. To put things into context: it took four years after the global financial crisis for the duration to increase by as much.

18_03_AS2
If we put Treasuries into the equation, we would see that in 2013 amid the Taper Tantrum, 10-year yields rose by 130 basis points; however, investment-grade corporate bonds fell only by 2%. This year Investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen already by 3.36%, the most in forty years, with 10-year yields rising only by nearly 85bps showing that
DURATION IS A BIGGER THREAT THAN CREDIT QUALITY
. Indeed, by
MAINTAINING MONETARY POLICIES EASY, THE FEDERAL RESERVE GIVES SUPPORT TO LOWER QUALITY CREDITS ON ONE HAND. ON THE OTHER, BY LETTING LONG-TERM YIELDS MOVE FREELY WHILE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ARE RISING, THE CENTRAL BANK PUTS QUALITY AT RISK.
And who sits on quality? Everybody, more in particular real money with long-term strategies such as insurances and pension funds. And again, it is deja-vu: we might be headed towards another Global Financial Crisis?

18_03_AS3
As the yield curve continues to steepen will be essential to limit interest rate sensitivity. It will be interesting to know that the sectors that carry the highest duration are the communication and utility sectors whose duration is well above 10 years. The technology sector is within the US IG average, with around eight years and a half in duration. For those looking for quality while reducing duration sensibly, high-grade financials provide 6 years duration, almost half than that offered by the communications and utility sectors."

(OTCQB:BTCY) (""Biotricity"" or the ""Company""), a medical diagnostic and consumer healthcare technology company, is pleased to provide unaudited, preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2021 third quarter, which ended December 31, 2020. Full financial results will be posted on EDGAR on February 16, 2021. Biotricity's Q3 results continued a trend of both sequential and year over year revenue growth, with revenue setting a new quarterly record in the fiscal third quarter.

For fiscal Q3 2021, management is reporting the following highlights:

Revenue of $1 million (USD) - a milestone for Company in its quarterly results

Year-over-year quarterly revenue increased 162%

Sequential quarter-over-quarter revenue increase 34.5%

""We achieved significant growth during a period of restricted travel due to Covid, so we are even more optimistic about our growth potential as the business environment unlocks,"" stated Waqaas Al-Siddiq, CEO of Biotricity. ""Our sequential quarterly growth really illustrates the importance of our technology and model, where we are enabling a cardiologist while improving patient care. Monthly sequential growth is a sure sign that our platform is on target, and we are on track to continue our strong sequential and year over year growth.""

""During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company experienced a gross margin of 49.2% compared to 43.6% in the preceding quarter,"" said Biotricity's CFO, John Ayanoglou. ""This improvement is consistent with our prior forecast that the cost of devices sold and other technology associated fees will become a lower percentage of revenues as sales volumes expand. We had significant product development activity during the quarter, including an FDA filing, so our net loss of $0.11 per share was higher than the net loss of $0.085 cents per share in Q2.""

In the current quarter (fiscal Q4 2021) and for the remainder of calendar 2021, the Company is guiding to continued triple-digit revenue growth on a year over year basis. With added resources from a convertible debt financing completed in January 2021, Biotricity is currently interviewing additional sales personnel as part of a planned geographic expansion into additional states. The Company filed a 510(K) seeking FDA approval for its new Biotres Holter product on December 31, 2020 and expects the review process to run approximately four months.

Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq added, ""We are coming out of the gate at a full sprint in 2021, with salesforce expansion and work underway on new products that will enable us to target a much larger segment of the cardiologist patient population. We spent years developing best-in-class technology coupled with a compelling technology as a service model. We are pleased with our results and look forward to further"

2021-03-19 22:01:41,stocks,"ZKIN 15m Outlook Just to give you an idea, ZKIN today's trading volume in $ is bigger than:

- Walmart
- Starbucks
- McDonalds
- Ford Motors
- Coca Cola

- All major Covid vaccination companies such as Pfizer, Moderna etc.
-

Since the last 15m Outlook the price gain almost 40% in value as it's currently being traded above $12 per share. To be exact $12.26 now.

The price of ZKIN is in a strong short term uptrend as the price continues to find support and bounce from 20 EMA.

If we look for this trend to continue, the price can't fall below 20 EMA with a full candle body. So a drop below $12 will bring the price to $11.

But if this trend continues, the next buying wave, trend of higher highs would be located at somewhere $14.50 with a spike up to $15.00 per share.

Unfortunately RSI has posted an exaggerated bearish divergence, which led to a correction that we are currently seeing. This is nothing too bad is it's only a correction sign, not a trend changing one. However RSI is below 60, meaning that bullish momentum isn't present. Still the trend of higher lows is present, mixed signals from RSI.

MACD has started a corrective wave while corrective volume is increasing.

Current support is located at $12 and $11 per share.

Current resistance is at $13, $14 and $14.5 per share."

2021-03-19 21:04:26,stocks,"I put $500 into the market for the first time yesterday. Tell me how garbage my positions/logic are. EDIT: While I truly appreciate the Reddit awards, I hope that award and any which may follow came from free Reddit coins, and I would encourage anyone who wants to spend real money on an award for this post to instead either spend it on yourself or give it to someone who needs it in a manner in which they would be able to use it.   

**Thank you** to all of you, today and in past days, who have given me advice on this subreddit. I truly feel as though I've found a home in terms of where I need to go for advice/community information/input. You can't learn if you don't put yourself out there, and I've done just that today, and the information I've gained is invaluable. Thanks again.  

EDIT2: Yes, I am aware now that I'm too far spread out. We're fixing that.  

__________  

Hey y'all. So I'm basically brand new to investing - I've dicked around on Robinhood before years ago, but never anything serious. I grew up in poverty and am only just finding my way out, so investment is still quite new but incredibly exciting to me.  

Yesterday, I took $500 and put it into the market. Here's what I bought. I plan on holding all pretty much until it's either time to retire or until daddy's gotta make a purchase. My logic behind choosing tickers was as follows:  

1) The index is too important to miss, and as I've said elsewhere, a 14% annual return over a lifetime feels much better than jumping off a cliff. **The indexes I chose are FTEC, QQQ, SCHA, SPY, VOO, VGT, and VUG.**   

2)Dividends are probably the most important aspect of a long term single stock hold IMO, closely followed by overall stability/growth projections. You don't need much inherent growth with dividend stocks, they just can't dip too far or else you're breaking even. Even if the stock itself stays even, you'll still compound your way ahead. **The dividend paying stocks I chose are AMCR, HBAN, HPE, KEY, PEP, T, and TM.** PEP and TM could arguably fall under other categories, but they both pay respectable dividends and are staple companies which will likely exist until the end of the current world, so they're on the list.    

-And finally, I chose one stock that I consider to be a knock off version of a growth stock. It has the growth potential, but it also has the dividend to boot, and really I'm looking at **TROW** and trying to find something wrong with the stock, but I can't. So TROW it is.  

To preemptively answer some questions:  

-I diversified within ETFs for two reasons; first, because it means more money overall within the indexes, and second because they'll all perform decently enough, but it's likely one or two might outperform the others, and I want in on those.  

-I chose AMCR because it's been rock steady for as long as the Earth has been round, and the dividend is unreal. I chose T for similar reasons, although T also falls under ""buy what you use"" in my case.  

-To me, HPE was the biggest ""risk"" in this portfolio, just because there's not a whole lot of evidence to suggest that it will grow drastically from its current status. However, again, HPE isn't going anywhere any time soon, it's recovering somewhat decently from the pandemic crash, and the dividend is still there. As long as I don't lose ~15% or more on price over the long term, I should still be in good shape.  

So yeah. I sure feel like a monkey making and describing these decisions, but I wonder how bad or good these decisions actually are. Anyway, thank you for coming to my TED talk.  

EDIT: In the brief time this has been up I've learned quite a bit more, which is honestly typical /r/stocks (thanks). What I'm learning is that I need to pay a little closer attention to what exactly each ETF follows, and that I possibly over-diversified. Apparently I'm still trading with technically unsettled funds, so once everything settles I'll look at making some corrective decisions. Thanks again."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I see plenty of input on the etfs has been awesome but I want to say... I love the AMCR dividend pick. You also hopped in at a great time as it is bouncing off support.

AMCR is a very stable, value stock with some decent growth projected. They are pushing the green plastics packaging industry forward in a very simple way and they are reaping the benefits of the transition. They've had increasing revenue since 2016 and strong margin growth over that same time. They're showing no signs of slowing down and have strong forecasts for 2021. They've basically traded in a channel since they've IPO'D but I believe they could have a positive breakout over the next 2-4 years. In the meantime I will buy as it tests support and allow that 4% dividend to reinvest.

The financial report was encouraging though, and they keep developing so many new types of packaging. Not to mention, they are working with Nestle to create more environmentally sustainable packaging for them ( which Nestle has been a tad behind on). 

I also saw they are slowly trying to buy back shares to reduce the float. This is pretty helpful for investors so the price isn't so stagnant and it shows the executives have faith in the company.

Catalysts:

\- the US wants to remove its dependence on China for rare earths. it wants a supply chain that does not require China for processing, separation, etc. of rare earth metals

\- climate change has made the environmental left take a second look at uranium, and people on the left are now supporting nuclear energy as the most powerful carbon-free source of energy

\- energy needs are set to grow rapidly over the next two decades just as many uranium mines are shutting down, resulting in an impending supply crunch.

\- due to renewed interest in uranium, U companies have restarted purchasing in the spot market, which led to the largest single-day rise in some time just a few days ago: [https://numerco.com/NSet/](https://numerco.com/NSet/)

UUUU:

1. First, as a comparable, MP Materials is the biggest rare earths miner in the US/North America. They had great earnings yesterday, have a share price in the \~$43 range, and a market cap of about $5-6B. They mine bastnaesite and still ship their rare earths to China for processing.
2. UUUU, a year ago, embarked on a program to process rare earths of its own. They are not a rare earths miner. They contractually purchase (2500 tons as of right now) monazite ore from Chemours, from Chemours' mine in Georgia. They separate uranium from the monazite ore, then send it to Neo Performance Materials in Estonia, Europe, for the final stage of processing.
3. Monazite ore is richer in rare earths.

||Monazite|Bastnaesite|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Neodymium Praseodymium (NdPr)|22.6%|16.3%|
|Samarium Europium Gadolinium (SEG)|14.4%|1.1%|

4. UUUU's rare earths value chain is completely non-China, where MP's still goes through China.

5. As of now, MP produces significant quantities of rare earths, while UUUU is at the beginning.

6. MP cannot mine the richer monazite, as it contains radioactive uranium.

7. Price action: after significant run-ups recently, UUUU has taken a breather. It's dipped low.

8. UUUU is currently an $800-900m market cap with share price in the $6-7 range.

Conclusion: UUUU's current share price is massively undervalued. While MP currently produces significant rare earths, UUUU's impending production (up to 15,000 tons per year, equal to 50% of US rare earth demand) will be both higher quality and non-China. Putting together the superior REE play, plus its participation in the broader Uranium bull cycle, in my view, the price has significant upside.

See r/UraniumSqueeze community for more (it is not actually a squeeze community, the discussions are 100% real and good).

03/20/2021,stocks,"so is UUUU a rare earths play, a uranium play, or both?  

is there a pure rare earths play besides MP materials?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"in my opinion, it is both a better rare earths play than MP, and it is a uranium play. (And also a vanadium play)."
2021-03-19 20:29:10,stocks,"Thoughts on Mortgage Securities & Real Estate? With interest rates so low many homebuyers are buying at prices wayyy over asking price. This leads me to believe there is going to be a bubble burst soon, especially when eviction & foreclosure moratoriums end. How likely is it that there is an upcoming dip? I‚Äôm still learning about stocks and economics, so from a beginners point of view I see a bubble. I‚Äôm I wrong in making this guess?

Ideally I would plan to buy when the market drops and then sell a few years later when it becomes stable again and growth looks on par with a healthy economy.

I‚Äôve been investing casually since last spring and got ‚Äúlucky‚Äù I that I bought during the major dip in March. My thought is that I‚Äôd like to ‚Äúrecreate‚Äù the gains I saw in the last year by taking advantage of a potential market crash."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Thank you for going more in depth; you raise good points. I'm kind of getting the feeling that right now, overvaluation is subjective in the current market. I would think this stocks success hinges more on the future default rates, as you mentioned.  I will be keeping this stock on my radar for sure"
03/20/2021,stocks,I didn‚Äôt have margin enabled on that account which is partly why I was so confused I did have the cash available to cover it and owned the stock tho which is why I think I was able to short. I did repurchase (and at a lower price too got lucky) appreciate the advice!!

I made a conscious effort not to put in more than I could afford to lose though, and for someone with huge anxiety issues I am kinda surprised that I dont freak out on red days. My emotions mostly screw me over when I am buying. I need to work on patience there, because I have a big case of FOMO which causes me to buy at the worst possible times. I think I should hook up with people who want to bet on stocks going down, cause as soon as that order fills you can guarantee the stock will drop like a rock. Either that or the company will get more shares and dilute the stock. Sheesh."

03/20/2021,stocks,"One thing that doesn't get mentioned enough and I think isn't considered by newbies is compounding. It's a beautiful thing. Leave your money in the market regardless of what it does. Think long term. Time is your friend. 

For example the S&P 500 has an average return of 13.6% over the last ten years (so Google tells me). 
If you were able to put $500 a month away in the last ten years you would have $126k now. 
Assuming you keep adding $500 a month for another ten years from now and it keeps making the same return (which I doubt, but just for example) you would have $615k. 

If you are young something like this should be your core investment, then if you want to have some play money in your trading account then go for it."

03/20/2021,stocks,"I know what you mean, but for some reason this upcoming Monday got me more excited. üòÇüôà"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Because contrary to popular belief, when things go down they don't always go back up. Holding a year doesn't necessarily mean you'll make money, especially if you buy in at a bad point.

If you factor in potential corrections into your risk and have a defined tolerance for how much something can go down, then by all means hold if it's within that tolerance. But to enter a stock without a plan for the potential for it going down, especially in this market where tech was very overvalued in a lot of areas(the thing people are complaining about dropping), and then panic when it does go down, you should really question what the hell it is you're doing being in the market.

For instance it doesn't matter how much of a long term investor someone is, holding until bankruptcy typically isn't something people want to do. That in itself establishes some degree of an exit plan implicitly, from there you scale risk down to something within your tolerance. Everyone has an exit plan in a sense, but most poorly define theirs until its too late to exit at a point where they'd be fine with the losses."
03/20/2021,stocks,"In your case. I'd set alarms for 930, 1030, and 12. Wake up for 5 mins to review. Must suck trying to swing trade when you aren't even up for the market"

03/20/2021,stocks,"That's exactly it! I don't have any stake in the data - I don't even know if it'll look the same 6 months from now. I just use it to narrow down categories that have the highest probability of success to give me a shorter list to DD

Once you know the highest gaining categories you don't even need my sheet anymore, you can just pull directly from Unbias"
03/20/2021,stocks,"The Unbias site scrapes multiple social media platforms and adds up all the times that ticker is mentioned - that's the score. I copy/paste that data into my spreadsheet so I track the ticker price every day. This lets me see how often each score goes green or red, and how long it takes to get there


What my data has shown is that if a ticker is mentioned on reddit between 250 - 500 times in 24 hours then it has a really high chance of going up on average 15% within the next 6 days"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Hard to tell since the price doesn't change over the weekend. Since I'm using the Google function it doesn't track after hours changes

03/20/2021,stocks,Og wow I feel like a fool. I assumed score was upvotes or something and didnt even think it was mentions. So what you are saying is stocks under 500 mentions seem the most profitable using your method.
03/20/2021,stocks,I'm curious to see the same myself! I'm really interested to see what happens in a bear Market vs a bull market. There will always be something that's a good buy

03/20/2021,stocks,The thing I love about sentiment data is that it just tells you what everyone is talking about. If suddenly 500 people are talking about buying puts on a certain stock in the last 24 hours then chances are I'm going to jump onboard
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes! Love the wisdom of the masses angle. Is there a way you‚Äôre tracking/filtering by what people are mentioning a stock for (calls, puts etc)? Or you‚Äôre just figuring that out by reading the mentions?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"You‚Äôll do so much better when you realize that the only thing stocks do is go down. Now I‚Äôm not saying to short sell, because if you try it they will skyrocket on a insane spike. What I do is go to webull and look at the market page, select top losers and select the one month range. Find stocks that were at $70 and crashed to $30 for example, then wait for it to turn back up towards recovery and buy in."

Right now some people are saying that science and technology [can not continue to give us economic growth](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/02/25/technology-and-the-future-of-growth-challenges-of-change/). It will give us GoogleMaps for free, but not economic growth.  Growing income inequality will choke us. Our politicians won't be able to make policies that increase sentiment or net profit.

Those that just stay the course and continue investing through the down make more money.  There is always some doom and gloom story as the media needs to talk about something to stay relevant.  Just like there is always a pie in the sky story.
03/20/2021,stocks,"people with money love crashes because they make so much money on the recovery. That's what the constant battle in the market is about. Bulls like to keep the party rolling, bears love a crash to buy in on, make money and sell off again. The go back to complaining hoping the market crashes again so they can do it all over again."
03/20/2021,stocks,Psychology and math
03/20/2021,stocks,Yes

03/20/2021,stocks,"all the investors need to take some tranquilizers or something. way too much fear. idk wtf they are on, having fear all the time. withdrawl symptoms? its absurd. every news is bad news. every day is a flat or red day. im so sick of it."
03/20/2021,stocks,"yea, the market always overstates reality. in good and bad"
03/20/2021,stocks,Or could just be that we are in an overvalued bubble driven by liquidity from government borrowing and central bank money printing.  This is a manufactured bubble and the fed has to thread the needle to keep it from pricking.
03/20/2021,stocks,Always remember... Efficient markets is just a theory
03/20/2021,stocks,Ever heard of buy the rumor sell the news?
03/20/2021,stocks,Yeah literally not just you this is what happens all the time
03/20/2021,stocks,"Not just that though, it‚Äôs basic prisoners dilemma. Once you acknowledge that at least some people will panic, even if you don‚Äôt panic yourself you don‚Äôt wanna be the one holding the bag."
03/20/2021,stocks,"So if people didn't become irrational, the market would only go up?"
03/20/2021,stocks,Makes me so annoyed that my money can be controlled by the decisions of idiots
03/20/2021,stocks,"Exactly. But it works both ways. When the stock market is as elevated as it is today, it becomes harder and harder to justify the high valuations, which are mostly just based on multiple expansion.

Everybody knows we are in a bubble by now, and people just try to keep playing the game until the music stops. The further streched those multiples become from fundamentals / reality, the higher the fear of a market correction becomes. Which is a good thing, its basically the markets way to price out excesses. In the long term, its in everybodies interest to have markets pricing assets as effectively as possible."
03/20/2021,stocks,"A 1 dollar drop looks a lot bigger when you're holding 100 shares and you've only been investing for a few weeks.

A lot of people on there that are playing with money that's causing too much anxiety for them so that they cant exercise patience."

03/20/2021,stocks,"But the truth is, cash flow honestly doesn‚Äôt matter, unless it‚Äôs a dividend paying stock.  Everything else is a popularity contest... which is insane.  Tesla isn‚Äôt even cash flow positive.  Its all social clout and demand... again, unless you‚Äôre pulling that sweet, sweet dividend."
03/20/2021,stocks,There should definitely be an \* by cash flow. Many industries have very substantial Capex projects that can lead to negative FCF without any real detrimental effect on the business. Most utilities find themselves in this situation. Yet they still make excellent defensive long-term value investments.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I just invested in bonds, personally. When the shenanigans stop, I‚Äôll sell and buy some more equities."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm always amazed that people are infuriated over these things.  

If you spent an entire year paying .01 cent per gallon and then woke up tomorrow and went to fill up your truck and it was .05 cents a gallon you would freak the f*ck out. Almost everyone would. Because it was a big change in a short amount of time. Human nature.

Edit: We also adapt very well. We will adjust to that .05 cents pretty quickly, and the markets will go back to normal pretty quickly too."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Even something that's priced in has an actuality cost. Meaning there's the expectation and the reality, and both have different values. It's like budgeting for insurance and dealing with the aftermath of your house burning down."
03/20/2021,stocks,"That's what I think is so funny. Like I am a very new investor I got in at the start of gamestop in January. But people keep talking about ""reflation trading"" and buying into stocks that are going to go back up when the pandemic ends. And that is great if these stocks weren't already trading at pre-covid levels. Like the reflation has been happening for a year now ever since the market crashed. I'm still bullish on some reflation sectors like the hospitality and travel sectors despite trading above pre-covid levels but still. Like there's no way in hell am I going to bet that over the next 6 months something like DRI (which went up almost 90% since covid start) is going to continue that trend. Like if you're thinking about reflation you're probably a bit too late. The rates at which stocks recovered isn't going to continue sure they'll grow and in theory the next two years should be a strong bullish market but there's no way the s&p goes up another 40%. There's no way DRI goes up another 90% or UAL another 200%."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Online chatrooms and reddit are not very good ways to gauge sentiment (fearful or greed) anyway. If anything, it looks more euphoric than fearful still atm."
03/20/2021,stocks,Depends on what are your stock picks. My portfolio had already several +/- 10% days lately. I invest on SPACs and growth stocks
03/20/2021,stocks,"Bears are parasites that sell what they don't own. Short selling should be forbidden.

You may think houses or cars are expensive, but you can't borrow my house or car to sell it to lower prices. Then why you can sell my stock?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"lmao. Also Apple is sitting on a huge pile of cash. They don't need to borrow money to invest it, they can just burn their money if they wish."
03/20/2021,stocks,GME was the definitive proof that the stock market is not a market for rational investment. Is just a casino.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Wait, you profit? Oops back to the drawing board :P"
03/20/2021,stocks,I'm starting to think the same thing.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I can't tell if you're saying I should get them high, capitalize on it and get them to sign over their home.

Or if you're saying that a lot of the concepts which only exist in peoples minds are extremely subjective and the tulip could actually be more beautiful and desired than a modern home if we took away all the cultural programming by temporarily eliminating it with drug use.

So you're either a capitalist or a hippie or Buddha."
03/20/2021,stocks,Both?
03/20/2021,stocks,Oh you're still on the highway project? Didn't you hear that CNBC said that Fox News said that CNN overheard a BBC reporter talking to a finance expert and he mentioned that the new thing to be afraid of is his wife?
03/20/2021,stocks,I'm getting a lot of that :) I'm new to this if it's not obvious.
03/20/2021,stocks,That is entirely too much of a mood and learning these lessons is hard. Fortunately I anticipated this and put in very little.
03/20/2021,stocks,Which is why most pros can‚Äôt even predict it
03/20/2021,stocks,"People are predictably irrational. The book, ""Predictibly Irrational"" by Dan Ariely had fascinating insights on this subject."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yup. Think about it, there would be no reason for broad-based selling to result in a crash. Algos do play a role too because they can trigger large sales that fuel these selloffs, but they all begin with human beings getting worried and entering sell orders. Algos don't make decisions based on fundamentals or macro events, they react to triggers like volume, price, technical signals, and so on."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Speaking of diworsification and cannabis, I cringe when weed stockers call the ETFs ""safer"" meanwhile there are clear better and worse companies & the ETFs are basically baskets of future-bags. Maybe it's just me being arrogant about my abilities, and hindsight is 20/20, but I still find no reason to buy a broad basket of cash burning companies rather then picking a few that are either more prudent (with current shareholders' value) or deliver more consistent results. The one case I'd see for it is that we retail investors get to see the short interest materialize when owning the ETFs, but I don't think that makes up for it (and HMMJ agrees)."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think having zero equity exposure right now is pretty foolish, unless you have absolutely zero risk tolerance."
03/20/2021,stocks,Stock market is a funny thing ... Often it is disconnected so much from real life and actual economics of the world. The world goes on regardless unless we get some meteor or catastrophic events like a nuclear war.

03/20/2021,stocks,He's making reference to the Dutch Tulip Craze of 1637-1638. Get the market high enough and people will do some really crazy shit.

People don't behave rationally. They don't behave in their own best self-interest. They *do* behave to maximize satisfaction."
03/20/2021,stocks,predictably irrational or illogical rationales?
03/20/2021,stocks,Haha yea when i read that as one of the base assumptions my head almost exploded.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think it‚Äôs a misunderstanding of the term rationality. The general assumption that people primarily act in their own self interest, which isn‚Äôt that much off."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Just not sure about the logic here. So much irrationality that we're actually rational, we just can't see it? Seems like trying to cancel out too many double negatives."
03/20/2021,stocks,"> Extreme bearish sentiment is bullish for the markets, and vice versa

that's actually not true until you reach capitulation, which we're nowhere near at this point (and even at capitulation, the market sentiment isn't bearish overall because it's the time when bulls take over and reverse the trend). so bearish sentiment is bearish until it isn't."

Edit: Still confused"
03/20/2021,stocks,"That's what it is to be rational. Austrian economists definitely believe in rational actor theory, it's baked in to the assumptions of praxeology."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Nope, that's not always it at all. For example in Microeconomics, you assume people would choose the product with the best utility, yet there are tons of cases they don't."
03/20/2021,stocks,But that‚Äôs demonstrably false.
03/20/2021,stocks,But people often are very misguided about what actually yields outcomes in their best interest... And behave irrationally as a result.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Just buy low and hold on to the stock. If it goes down some more, just buy a bit more. Don't worry about being late about getting into value stocks. Value stocks tend to be overlooked, but you have to learn how to recognize them. By ""value stocks"" I'm specifically referring to ""under valued stocks"". 

No need to rush your decision about these things because that will lead to feeling pressure to buy when maybe you shouldn't at that moment. The ""fear of missing out"" feeling is real, and it's emotional. It's the thing that I struggle with the most. I've noticed that it's a weakness of mine, so I've built a strategy to keep it in check.

I'm still learning the ropes of short term trading myself. There is a lot to learn when it comes to fundamental analysis, which will be the way to find value/under valued stocks."

03/20/2021,stocks,Gamestonk!
03/20/2021,stocks,I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more of a logical inevitability given that we expect the internet to provide almost everything for free. Companies get paid when we click so they better make clicking appealing.

03/20/2021,stocks,"That's not ""irrational"" in economics. You can have stupid preferences, but if you maximize over them you're rational in decision theory."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think what most people think of as rationality is very much equivalent to sociopathy. Corporations are nothing more than profit maximizing machineries, they approach their purpose very rationally."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Cool thanks, the problem with me is that I have think or swim, so I have one account for short term trades and the other account for long-term, and it‚Äôs so easy to switch black and forth on the app so I always find myself checking out the long-term account, but I have to stop myself from doing that on the daily"
03/20/2021,stocks,Bingo. If the company is good and continues to do well ATHs are just a milestone to the next one so even if you bought at it eventually it wont matter. Point and case even if you bought big coins in 2018 at absolute atm congrats you are up over 100% on your investment. May not always get that with stocks but they do all eventually go up more or less
03/20/2021,stocks,"1,000 PE is putting a lot of faith in growth forecast"

03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes I know. That‚Äôs the point of index trackers.

Time isn‚Äôt much help either. If you really want to stock pick, then you need access to data not available to the majority of people. Otherwise you risk a BP/Enron/Hammerson/Intu/VW/Lehman etc. happening to a significant element of your holdings.

(I appreciate that is also a point you make with the ‚Äòconcentrated‚Äô response)."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I mean if a company actually HAS a PE of 30, at least they are making a profit.

03/20/2021,stocks,"If you zoom out enough, the efficient market hypothesis works very well though"
03/20/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't die on a hill for it but I believe there's merit to assuming the other traders are perfectly rational and will lead to your trades becoming more rational. Soo... Smarter long term financial decisions are made when assuming people out there equal or smarter are doing the same. 

It's like playing a video game and assuming your opponents are good('rational') instead of bad('irrational'). You might not be as greedy or care free or cut corners in your match if you assume your opponent knows all of your same tricks and will trip you up if you take shortcuts to undermine him."
03/20/2021,stocks,"When you say ""maximize over,"" do you mean to seek or yield maximum benefits based on those preferences?

My general understanding of the rational actor is that the rational actor takes advantage of available information, outcome probabilities, and preferences to come to a decision that would maximize benefit to him or herself. But then I might reply that those conditions are quite unrealistic - most people have trouble discerning good information from bad, and much less able to determine the likelihood of the potential consequences of their actions or even able to verbalize their own preferences in a way that isn't self-contradicting upon closer examination..."
03/20/2021,stocks,Well yeah but in our capitalist hellscape they are also people.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Long-term is a pretty open-ended phrase. Just curious, what's your idea of long-term? For me, it's 2 years and more. I'm loving all my buys from last March when everything tanked. It's a lot of a tiny, little bit but it's all gone up."
03/20/2021,stocks,Individual stock absolutely do not. There needs to be a distinction between the market and an individual stock.
03/20/2021,stocks,At least it has a positive PE. Many growth companies don't even generate a profit now
03/20/2021,stocks,"For sure, I was just giving a sort of simple explanation. It tends to be a factor of what ads they can show you, which then both depends on length of the ad and how much that advertiser pays for the watch time on their ads. You can notice this if you know someone that tends not to skip ads on YouTube - they‚Äôll almost exclusively get skippable minute long ads since they‚Äôll pay more. There‚Äôs also the data selling aspect in the background too, and this also helps to pay with your attention. For image/link ads however, the length metric doesn‚Äôt really exist as much beyond length of time on a page, so click numbers can count for more there. Other tactics have been tried via showing ads based off your search term rather than your overall behaviour, but still it tends to be pay-per-click and pay-more-if-they-stay. Both of these (and really any feasible way to measure engagement with ads) still can be increased by an increased user base and increased engagement with the platform in general, hence why the internet tends to be designed to keep you there for as long as you can, hence messing with your mental health (obviously the mental health problems associated with the lifestyle disparity you see on Instagram and others is more a problem with humans being irrational than anything else but that‚Äôs besides the point)."
03/20/2021,stocks,If anyone is still reading this I have a friend who has 6 stocks in EV tech like lidar and all that hyped stuff wallstreetbets was pumping out etc and considers himself diversified. Im like bro no thats just roullete its all the same game you just spread your chips around.

03/20/2021,stocks,The problem with zooming out infinitely is that human lifespans and misery are on finite timelines.
03/20/2021,stocks,If u zoom out enough on human civilization and observe it from space it looks like its thriving as well. But that frequently gives a false reality.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Your understanding of ""rational"" is much more broad than the definition used in economics/decision theory/game theory. An actor is rational if they always choose the highest utility (you can use money or pleasure here if that helps, but it's technically only a representation of preferences). Preferences in Austrian economics (and classical/neoclassical economics generally) are thought to be ordinal (you can rank them, but not compare their quantity directly) and fundamental to the agent.

This all sounds like what you're saying until we unpack preferences. Under this model it would be rational for a crack addict to sell his kidney for drug money if (and only if) he prefers smoking crack to having both of his kidneys. In fact, it would be irrational for him to choose keeping the kidney if he genuinely would prefer the drugs. I think most people (including me) would consider this behavior to be insane and irrational, but under the technical definition it wouldn't be. That's honestly one of my problems with rational actor theory: its definition of rational borders on trivial."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Well even if it is their money, the gov will just bail them out so it doesnt really matter."
03/20/2021,stocks,Same. I‚Äôd like to swing trade but I want to create a portfolio that can compound overtime
03/20/2021,stocks,"Indeed. Dollar cost averaging is fine for set-it-and-forget-it index funds, but if you're doing the research necessary to select specific stocks to buy, then why not also time your entry to increase your gain? If you buy some stock at ATH, even if it has solid fundamentals, the market might wake up one day and decide it's overvalued and then it could be six months, a year, whatever until the stock price catches up again."
03/20/2021,stocks,"For all we know their products are getting stagnant and the earnings will be taking a hit this year. I mean the headphone jack change, all these absurd product lines that have no meaning or innovation... Hmmm I‚Äôm thinking we have seen the best from them in our lifetime."

03/20/2021,stocks,They are the government. (by donation and ~~quid pro quo~~ totally fair friendly benefits for no favors)

03/20/2021,stocks,SLS in same cancer immunotherapy genre should publish very positive 10k result on Monday. Remarkable rise in the stock price is obvious.
03/20/2021,stocks,"You can do what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm sitting on a lot of cash and every time the market gets crushed, I buy more of my now consolidated portfolio. It‚Äôs going to continue to happen for the foreseeable future. The market will correct even further when the 10 year hits 2 percent. That may be the bottom. But who knows. But a sharp rebound is possible after it."
03/20/2021,stocks,Thats a dumb example.
03/20/2021,stocks,Are there any bond funds you can buy that stand to gain from this
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree, not only will it increase the yield issue but its also going to result in banks selling off securities to secure more cash to maintain their leverage which isnt going to do anything good for market confidence especially when everyone is this spooked already. I half expect the FED to change their mind at the last second, conspiracy brain makes me think this is just them testing how the market responds and are fully intent on extending SLR at the last minute."
03/20/2021,stocks,"It wont. Basically this is starting to mimic 08 again. The banks have had protection from the fed during covid, so they are still lending even though their capital has not been rising much. Because of other Covid laws the banks have not been going after large loans such as real estate that are delinquent. Now they are loosing their protection, so now they will start coming for the money owed to them from delinquent loans they are allowed to go after to start generating the revenue to liquid funds and boost their capitol funds. 

Problem is, lots of people have still been buying homes they cant afford. Most of the homes bought in the lower working class required 2 people working to get approved. Many of those people still are not working and have not made payments. Many loans have covid relief but not because of a law, but from the lenders. Those homes are about to start getting foreclosed, home purchases are slowing down, banks will have to get out of the negative equity by taking small losses. By the end of this year the banks are going to be wanting a bailout, thats my prediction."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You almost got it. Banks have been lending until this point. After March 31st, banks will have to adjust to the change of SLR.  Higher bond yield are better because if you buy Notes or Bonds, you will get a higher return on that assets. 

This is a win- win situation. Lower prices in the stock market and higher bond yields."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Where are you getting that *banks* are lending? Specifically not FedGov, not Fannie/Freddie?"

03/20/2021,stocks,"I know I'm a beginner, but a stock increasing its value by 50% in a day, then decreasing its value by that same amount the next day is not normal. It's basically a straight line up and a straight line down. Something this extreme usually as a reason"

03/20/2021,stocks,Aren't they expanding into EV? I thought that's what was causing their stocks to go rise like crazy in the first place
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yes, but to a certain extent they are competing with themselves. If a customer who would have bought a gas powered VW instead buys a VW EV they aren't selling more cars overall. They might gain some marketshare short term until there's more competition, but their EV moves are probably more about protecting the marketshare they already have."
03/20/2021,stocks,Agreed. Money talks. You can always buy.
03/20/2021,stocks,I did not know that. Great contribution. Thanks.
03/20/2021,stocks,"What a ride that must have been. Legendary stuff happening. Most folks are oblivious.

Nothing to see here. üòÄ"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Thanks for an opportune timing with this DD in my case because I was considering buying PTON stock today and needed to do more research.

I have little to add to many useful arguments here, so I'll just add a few of my observations:

I think Peloton is tapping into a market that is in huge percentage different from the gym-going market, and other home-equipment-buying market. I never went to a gym. I bought a variant of Peloton by another company, but it broke (a LOT of home gym equipment is terribly made, but most people do not notice because it becomes a clothes hanger), and then I just decided to bite the price bullet and get the Peloton.

My husband and I hate exercising; we never used our gym memberships; I even tried personal training to get me motivated and I fell off the wagon after three weeks. Now we look forward to getting on this bike. We don't even care about the individual instructors at all, but the tablet with a plethora of classes is great. Peloton is the Apple of exercise machines.

And, most importantly, Peloton managed to successfully gamify exercise and this helped people who don't like to exercise actually want to do it. This helps avoid the ""fad effect"" that the personal trainer mentioned here in the threads (even though I understand that he has clients who abandoned the bike - but that is a VERY self-selected group of people because they did abandon the bike and go back to the gym. I do not think that's the sign of the fad; they are just not right for Peloton as I'm not right for the gym. Also, I did HATE Peloton during my first 8 rides until I had a breakthrough (learning how to click out, use the bike, get used to the seat, find the right instructor), so perhaps they did not persist.

I don't know about the effect the competitors can have, but when I find a product I love, I'm not too interested in trying out some bike on which I have to tape the tablet to save money or - as much as I love Apple and am typing on their latest macpro - I'm simply not interested in finding a better home machine because I already feel that what I got is more than I could have ever expected. (Two people who HATED exercise now look forward to it!) If I buy another machine, it will almost certainly be a Peloton along with the continuous membership, and I think this describes their typical user pretty well."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Great reading! And I can add that I have ordered a Peloton which arrives on the 25th of this month! 

Based in the UK and I would say we are slightly above average in terms of income...lots of interesting thoughts on this being a ‚ÄúCovid‚Äù buy and people now preferring to get back to the gym... I would be wary of that, I think the ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù Covid has had on peoples thinking will unfortunately remain for sometime and will knock a lot of people‚Äôs confidence about getting straight back into mixing...

Also if anything Covid has taught me that 1 I need to get fitter and 2 that I love being at home with my family...so a Peloton purchase now is ideal as it ticks both boxes, my daughters can use it and I now have no desire to have to track back and forth to a gym...

I‚Äôm really hoping I enjoy the Peloton and will be watching the stock for a good entry point..."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree with you on the fads, and this might be one too, but those clients you see at the gym are there... because they do not use Peloton, so they self-select. I use it, so you won't see me at the gym. Another point: the power of gamification. For me, nothing worked for long - gym, boring home equipment, DVDs, personal training - I abandoned it all within two months tops because deep down, I hated it.

Peloton created a gamified system which ""hooks"" many people in. I did not believe that it is possible for me to look forward to exercise, but they achieved it, and it's been going on for months. If you look at their reddit, everyone is a die-hard fan, especially people who didn't like exercise in the first place."
03/20/2021,stocks,Would love to see your position. Screen shot would help
03/20/2021,stocks,"I bought a sleu of bank stocks including JPM at the depths of the pandemic but sold them a few weeks back because at some point their earnings have to catch up with their valuations, and I am not sure they will. Also, how much higher can banks go? Not to FAANG type valuations, I am betting. Therefore I sold JPM and the rest of them (PNC, SYF, MTB, BKU, TFC) for a 50+% profit. Historically, banks have a much higher higher chance of having moribund share price action (i.e. stagnant for years) than big tech (FAANG) because they simply don't have as many levers to pull as tech, which literally can come up with products out of thin air that consumers just ""must have.""  I rolled over the proceeds into FB, GOOG, PINS, ADBE, CRM, TWTR and MTCH."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yea thats a great point, kind of what I was thinking. Just not sure if the share price can climb much higher, at the end of the day, its a bank. I read something a while back about JPM having plans to expand to the UK and also were in talks with top football teams in the UK about creating a new super league. If both those were to happen, I guess we could see a boost to the share price potentially, or maybe its already been priced in. 

Food for thought anyway!"
03/20/2021,stocks,Does this mean that tik tok will finally be banned in the us?
03/20/2021,stocks,"so should we ban volvo? 

volvo is known as a swedish brand but its owned by geely, a chinese brand. polestar which is geely/volvo's brand that competes with tesla is also stacked with camera's/sensors and whatever that could gather data for who knows what.

ik this is /r/stocks and not politics but just has me thinking."
03/20/2021,stocks,Well shit. Like TSLA needed any more help dropping.
03/20/2021,stocks,So TSLA leaps are really expensive I justed looked and January 23 @1725 are 93.00. ARKK leaps for the same date @235 are only 12.00. The best way to get exposure to TSLA at this point would be ARKK calls right?
03/20/2021,stocks,"It is a big and already known issue which everyone should know.  China will help their own EV company and try to hinder other EV company.  So if you think Tesla will have a smooth selling it won't.

Only reason Chinese government seemed friendly at first is they rather Tesla build their factory in China than somewhere else like India."
03/20/2021,stocks,neither of which is close enough to hear anything.
03/20/2021,stocks,Global sales is what matters.

03/20/2021,stocks,"China is like 25% of the global market.  Some analysis even say it might be 50% of the ev market by 2030.  So it is not a small pie.

03/20/2021,stocks,I was replying to you talking about Europe sales.
03/20/2021,stocks,They basically just fudged the numbers. Made up most of their sales. They're going bankrupt and being sued. 2 ER reports are considered complete trash. Their CFO as well as several employees were in on it if I recall correctly.
03/20/2021,stocks,"I am an expat living in Shanghai, 

Foreign investment in Chinese stocks is only 8% (compared to 25% in the US), also showing the low prices/confidence.

I am trying to understand the reasons and risks behind this, and maybe diversify into this rapidly growing economy. Especially since Europe/US is so overvalued. But I see that the Chinese economic growth is not reflected in the share-price, which worries me. 

It is true that the regulatory environment here can be a bit unpredictable and creative accounting is something that would not surprise me one bit, yet the underlying economy is doing great, there must be opportunities.

 Because I do not think that any sane person would consider Chinese economic forecasts more gloomy than American/European ones, it is just less transparant."

03/20/2021,stocks,Thanks for the explanation! I‚Äôve always wondered how people actually make money from executing puts.
03/20/2021,stocks,An interesting case could be if the company goes bankrupt and you cannot purchase any shares to sell...?
03/20/2021,stocks,"In theory, executing or exercising is not the norm though. The norm is selling the contract once the price goes down and the premium goes up. If the company goes bankrupt then there wouldn‚Äôt be anyone be willing to buy the put from you or any shares for you to exercise and then sell, unless the put is actually covered by the contract writer."

GoodRx is already being used, has a good brand, has a good image with customers, also I see it in the hospital as an option for patients, and something that patients are actively using. There's just a huge room for growth here with GoodRx"

03/20/2021,stocks,"you need to figure out what ""pre-covid levels"" means. Look beyond the share price, have they issued more shares? Have they taken on more debt? It's not a question of how much the share is worth, look at how much the *whole company* is worth now vs. pre-covid, and then ask whether you think it will increase further."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Answered in another reply but basically trading would likely either move to OTC or shares get cancelled altogether. In the case of former, you'd still be able to buy shares to exercise the put. In case of latter, you can just exercise it to get 100 * strike price without having to deliver anything."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I think you may be mistaking a call option for a put option. You wouldn't need to exercise a put option and then sell since exercising the put option itself is selling the shares to the put writer.

Also you can still exercise the put and trade shares even after the company goes bankrupt so you don't need to worry about trying to sell the put to another person or trying to secure 100 shares to sell.

When a company goes bankrupt, its shares and options will either move to OTC (over-the-counter) or just flat out get cancelled. In the case of former, you'll still be able to trade shares/options at OTC. In case of latter, you can just execute it to get 100 * strike price without having to deliver anything."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Whoever wrote (sold) the put is contractually obligated to buy the share from the person who bought the put at whatever the strike price is if the put is exercised.

The benefit of writing a put is that the writer gets to collect premium when they sell their put. Downside is, they will be forced to buy the shares at the strike price if the put option they sold gets exercised by the buyer. So the put writer hopes that stock price goes up so the put expires worthless while the put buyer hopes that stock price goes down."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Put option gives you right to sell 100 shares but if you only owned the put option but not the actual shares, those 100 shares aren't gonna just magically appear. If you already owned 100 shares originally, then you can just sell those without having to buy more from market. But if you didn't, then you gotta buy them from the market first so you actually own them before you can sell them at the higher strike price to whoever wrote (sold) that option unless you are willing to go short on shares. But that just means you're still gonna have to buy it back at later date.

Alternatively, if you don't want to buy 100 shares and then exercise your put option to sell them, you can also just sell the option itself to someone else. This method is actually more common way people trade options as actually exercising options usually come with exercising fee as well as you actually needing enough capital on your account to buy 100 shares of the stock."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Nice, congrats!"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Not exactly.


Powell says he won't raise rates, and will let inflation increase to 2-3%. The bond markets takes him at his word, and sell their bonds since having a bond that pays below inflation is useless. Then the selling of bonds increase treasury yields, which in turns increases the mortgage rates. Higher mortgage rates = bad for the stock market since less cheap loans for businesses."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I am not surprised that he is talking. After the Fed meeting, he usually has to testify to Congress the next week. Not sure what he's doing on Monday, but the other stuff is standard procedure for him.

It was that story last month, kind of got overshadowed by the Gamestop hearing. It actually worked out fine too for the market during the two-day Congress hearings, but this fact gets overshadowed because the day RIGHT after that, there was an absolutely horrible bond auction.

The rest of this month isn't likely to be that strong, but it's for other reasons outside of ""Powell talking"" for the most part. The moves involving monthly options expirations have been getting more volatile as we go because of the amount of call buying, leading to the market makers having to unwind huge hedges all at once, and the pattern this year so far has been that the last half of the month is weaker after options expire. And they have expired, so it is likely that the S&P has started another pull back, to what destination, we don't know as of right now, but probably not to the early March low."

just wanted to look out for you a bit here"
03/20/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs awesome! Best advice I can give you is to always do your own research into the companies you want to invest in. Some of the biggest gains on r/wsb that I‚Äôve seen were from people who researched into companies that no one has even heard of.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Oh, yea?  Did you know that the taco joint in the same complex as Aphria home office has taco Thursdays instead of taco Tuesdays?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"The information is available to everyone, so you might as well be doing the research yourself to get as nuanced of an opinion as possible. Listening too much to other people can be dangerous because:

A. Other people can be biased (eg wanting the stock to go well because they've already bought it, or they may turn a blind eye/be in denial about shortcomings of the company)

B. Other people can lack the knowledge to actually understand the reports they read, and therefore present it inaccurately

C. Some information can be interpreted differently (especially when talking about future plans for the company, different people may have different assumptions on whether the next product will be a success or a failure)

etc. These factors can mean you get incomplete information which can make a buy seem better or worse than it is. 

When talking about finding companies with great potential at a cheap price, I think that comes with experience after being in the stock market for a while, as well as increased knowledge of finance and accounting. You learn to identify what is promising, and what are red flags. You do likely have to dig through quite a bit of trash to find the good stuff though, and the good stuff can take years before the market recognizes its potential."

Amazon is partnered with whole foods rn. Plenty of ppl love whole foods. Amazon can structure a more advanced retail center from the grond up with better prices, more tech, bougie vibes like whole foods ,and tie it to their amazon prime membership. 

For what it's worth I really like costco and am bullish. But just a counter argument for thought."
03/20/2021,stocks,"OP, FAST graphs just had a great 18 minute analysis on Costco a day or two ago, worth checking out. Basically it is overvalued even with the recent pull back:

I'm a Tesla investor so you don't need to sell me on vision and technology, I like to think of myself as pretty open minded. I think Amazon has a huge sledgehammer and can crack many industries, but I don't give them even a 5% chance of being a legitimate competitor and threat to Costco long term. 

Don't forget that even if Costco is a slow moving behemoth (second in retail sales only to Walmart) they have inroads into other countries and same day delivery with large, bulky items. Not to mention their e-commerce has also had a significant boost. Bottom line, they aren't sitting idle on their laurels."

Through covid, pet adoption went through the roof.

Anecdotal, but I think it‚Äôs safe for now.

Not in it, just speculation"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Fundamentally, they are overvalued by 2x based on current projections of growth. Their annualized earnings growth would have to double from ~19% to ~40% or they would have to essentially double their margins. In my opinion, the Millennial trends for pet ownership are already baked into the price. For those that like to use P/S to compare CHWY to other companies, be careful not to bake in confirmation bias by looking for a more expensive stock and rationalizing that they are cheap. 

That said, according to morningstar, their. P/S is 2x the market index. That corroborates their 2x premium at ~$82. 

https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/chwy/valuation

Alarmingly, their Price/Cash flow is at a whopping  257 vs 15.97 (morningstar market index). That reflects their low margins. 

As a long term investor, I would want to see them increase the life time value of their customers dramatically (not just in a Covid year) and I would want to see them improve their margins so that they can reinvest it in more growth initiatives ala the Amazon playbook. Hence the usefulness of price/cash flow over price/sales.

Don't get me wrong, I love their business model and their execution. They are slated to be profitable and are riding a millenial macro trend. If they can continue to add value to their membership and up their monetization rate by 2x current projections and their valuation was closer to $45, I'd consider them. But atm their are plenty of other companies with less downside risk and better growth catalysts in my opinion.

I don't own shares of CHWY and this isn't investment advice. I'm just sharing my thought process.  

TL;DR
At the current price you are risking a 50% downside risk. Especially if we transition away from a more speculative market as treasury yields increase. That said If they can outperform current projections by 2x they would be worth their current valuation of $82.

Edit: To clarify it isn't the morningstar P/S that determines that their intrinsic value is overvalued by 2x. I think they are overvalued based on a DCF valuation model that bakes in current analyst growth projections. In this context the 2x P/S vs the morningstar us market index makes sense."

Noticed later it was up and thought it had peaked so I sold planning on buying at the new low at the eod. Then it kept going up so I jumped back in, then I thought it peaked so I wasted my last day trade selling and it went way up further, bought at end of day. If I followed my normal plan I would have had a great day, but I was doing ten things at once with a migraine. I normally just hold, but that was too big of a jump to miss the chance to lower my cost by buying at eod. Missed the chance anyway...  Still in and still bullish, I needed that to get some excitement going again. Moving on and holding, back to my plan. Was working great until today. Totally caught me by surprise...

03/20/2021,stocks,"TD Ameritrade has a YouTube video explaining how to sell calls on its platform.

Key things to consider when selling an option:- Sell a call option- Choose a ""strike price"" for the option- Choose an ""expiry date""

Example:

* You own 271 shares, so you can sell call options that are secured by 200 out of the 271 shares that you own
* You decide to sell 2x option contracts with a strike price of $18 and expiry date of May 21st
* You are paid $300 for both options

What happens if $BB goes to $20 before May 21st?

* It is likely (but not guaranteed) that the option holder will exercise the options and force you to sell your shares for $18 rather than the $20 it costs on the market
* Regardless, you can't sell your shares if you have sold a ""Covered Option Call"" because your shares are collateral and locked down until May 21st
* If you want to exit the option contract, you can ""close"" the contract but it will cost more than the $300 you made!

That's just the basics. The other downside is that the price spikes, the option holder doesn't exercise the option, the price crashes and you lost your opportunity to sell your shares lol.

I guess my real question is how on Earth do I actually sell the damn contract seriously I don't understand how one of those 4 options translates into that. I don't want to purchase more stock.

They failed miserably. Price stayed above $200 @4:00 and 5:00 est. Tens of millions of dollars worth of puts - liquidity which shitadel desperately needs - wiped out. Also it was very obv HFT algos battling it out at 3:59. It was not retail that made it close above $200 - it was someone with a lot of money and access to powerful algos that made sure it closed above $200. Whether or not some of those $200 put options were exercised at some point in the day is largely irrelevant - there was more $200 calls than puts anyways so net effect on price should be positive.

You know, almost the entirety of the rest of the economy.

Tech sells off and the money has to go somewhere and it's usually into some other asset class that I already own. So, why should I care if just the NASDAQ corrects?

03/20/2021,stocks,"Lot of competition starting to come around offering supposedly similar quality at cheaper prices (Icon, Gearwrench etc.) Might not get the diehards but alot of entry level people might be more inclined to grab the cheaper options. Also from what I understand their battery tools are a joke especially at the outlandish prices they ask."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I have almost all of their battery tools. Pretty decent quality I actually have multiples of some but I beat the life out of them. The big thing they have going for them is the legacy, also the tool trucks coming to the shop every week. Entry level yeah people are going to use whatever but ask any seasoned mechanic and he will tell you most likely snap on all the way."
03/20/2021,stocks,They may be decent quality but they are years behind the big dogs like Milwaukee not to mention cost 2x as much and the battery system is limited to just the handful of tools they offer.
03/20/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs what I have heard about the Milwaukee battery tools. But Milwaukee doesn‚Äôt show up at my shop every Monday morning with a 2 year warranty. I have been thinking about trying Milwaukee, I wouldn‚Äôt mind supporting them if they make a quality tool, maybe get a couple 3/8 electric ratchets."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Can confirm, the ID.4 looks great vs the Model Y. 

Was a TSLA shareholder and rode it up from last year's crash - finally decided to sit in a Model 3 and found it to be a pile of junk. 

There was just nothing there that I actually *loved*, glad that people love it though - good for them (and me).

Despite how nice the ID.4 looks am going to book an MX-30 eSkyActive Rotary once the lease on my CX-3 is up."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Yea, most people can‚Äôt afford to buy a Tesla. Also, most of the profit the big auto makers make is from their premium lines, just like any commodity. So there‚Äôs that, what most people want doesn‚Äôt fucking matter, if that isn‚Äôt obvious to you yet."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I agree on an absolute basis that Tesla will continue to grow. But like traditional autos, the more competition, the more effect on margins. 

I bought my Model 3 in December because Tesla offered much better financing than others I was looking at. I had to pay 0 money down and got 0.25% interest for 3 years. This was surely for them to reach their annual delivery target of 500k.

If Tesla already needs to offer these kinds of deals to sell some cars, then I am skeptical that they can keep a solid profit margin in the future. 

Note the point above is not exclusive to Tesla. In general I am wary of the valuations of all EVs and related companies. At the end of the day, car production is super capital intensive and has low margins. I don‚Äôt see why EV companies will not eventually have multiples that are more similar to ICE companies than to tech companies."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Awsome list, thank u for making this post!

I also would like to know, did u read all of these books? (I presume u did) If so, presuming u are one big brain for investing, how are u handling the stock market? Like, are u getting them big profits?"

03/20/2021,stocks,"My school allows me to have freedom in this class, they encourage everyone to try project based learning if they choose but that is not a specific goal of the district. Personally all my classes are PBL but what sets this class apart is this class specifically allows students to choose their own passion. My admin is always open to try new things."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Couldn't agree more. Numbers mean little if you're experiencing black swan events and do things out of character. That's emotion for you. 

Some of the brightest people in the world don't have success and are at the mercy of emotions and other mental disabilities. We all know someone who we think is intelligent and doesn't lack common sense yet shoots themselves in the foot over and over when it comes to money, be it investing or personal finance. 

Have a plan and don't trust yourself to do the right thing is where my mental framework is. Mind you I'm a former professional poker player so I'd like to think I can handle volatility and watching money evaporate even with good behavior (following numbers, statistics etc).

03/20/2021,stocks,"So, I got curious and ran the math. Including all closed positions which included major losers (there was around an 8 month period that everything was below the s&p), there were 318 picks since jan 2008. Those picks together had a 39,773% gain OVER s&p. Divide that by the 318, you have an average of each stock being 125% OVER the s%p. I really really want to see your spreadsheet. Please prove me wrong, I legit want you to so I'm not investing poorly. I did this very fast, so if someone else with a sub wants to do the same, feel free. Took 10 mins."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Holy shit are you trolling or are just completely incapable of grasping a point? I am saying that selling cars doesn't exclude a company from being a technology company, not that all car companies are technology companies. Hand-holding you through this is utterly painful. Imagine believing that Beyond Meat can't be a tech company because Stouffers isn't a tech company, or that iRobot can't be a tech company because Hoover isn't a tech company. You should be embarrassed at this point."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You say I have the selective bias while you say 


Cars = Technology 


Tesla Car = Technology 


Ford Car = Not Technology"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Let me make even this simpler for you.

Cars = Technology

Vacuums = Technology


Tesla Car = Technology

Ford Car = Technology

iRobot vacuum = Technology 

Hoover vacuum = Technology

Tesla = tech company

Ford = not tech company

iRobot = tech company

Hoover = not tech company"
03/20/2021,stocks,And yet I‚Äôm the one with a ‚Äúselective bias‚Äù
03/20/2021,stocks,"A counter-example != selection bias.

Just answer this: are iRobot and Beyond Meat tech companies?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Is McDonald‚Äôs and Microsoft tech companies? That‚Äôs about what you‚Äôre asking. 

If I answer no then I‚Äôm saying micosoft isn‚Äôt a tech company, and if I answer yes then I‚Äôm saying McDonald‚Äôs is a tech company."
03/20/2021,stocks,McDonalds is not a tech company. Microsoft is a tech company. Now it's your turn for iRobot and Beyond Meat. You can answer differently or the same for each of them.
03/20/2021,stocks,iRobot is a tech company. Beyond Meat is not.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Saying Beyond Meat isn't a tech company is ridiculous but I only needed you to say yes to one.  Now, is Hoover a tech company?"
03/20/2021,stocks,I would consider it more of an energy company.
03/20/2021,stocks,"That's wrong but it doesn't matter. If iRobot is a tech company that sells vacuums, and Hoover is a non-tech company that sell vacuums, then why can't Tesla be a tech company that sells cars just because Ford is a non-tech company that sells cars?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Because Ford puts the same technology in their cars? 

Same with all the other car companies."
03/20/2021,stocks,Ah so you just don't know shit about cars. And I guess Blockbuster was a tech company at the end too when it desperately tried to catch up to Netflix.
03/20/2021,stocks,Well Blockbuster and Netflix goes back to Amazon and in store retail. One occurs on the internet and the other does not.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Blockbuster became an internet store toward the end. I guess either Blockbuster was a tech company or Netflix isn't, via your logic. Or maybe there's a little more to it when it comes to what we perceive as tech and innovation. 

Also for the love of god google some of the innovations Tesla has put and will continue to put into their vehicles. They're years ahead of the competition."
03/20/2021,stocks,"If it became an internet store by the end then yes blockbuster became a tech company. 

However I thought Netflix bought out Blockbuster?"
03/20/2021,stocks,So is Walmart a tech company now because they have an online store? You went from saying that nothing is a tech company to everything is a tech company except for Tesla. And Netflix never bought Blockbuster.
03/20/2021,stocks,"Ohh yeah it was the other way around. Blockbuster could‚Äôve bought Netflix for $50 million. It was Dish that bought it out. 

I‚Äôd say Walmart isn‚Äôt because the majority of their sales isn‚Äôt derived from their website. However if that online store becomes large enough then sure it becomes a tech company, same as Amazon. 

And you‚Äôre one to talk lol. Tesla is a tech company because it‚Äôs working on FSD, but other car companies that are working on FSD aren‚Äôt tech companies?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"So what makes ""online sales"" tech, but not EV, which makes up almost all of Tesla's revenue? We've had the ability to sell shit online for decades now, while EV is one of the fast growing and most quickly advancing sectors on the planet. When is the last time online retail has seen a technological shift? Even when you try to make up ridiculous lines between tech and non-tech, such as 51% of sales being online, you're still wrong.

There is a lot less shame in being too stubborn to admit you're wrong long after you've realized it then continuing to make yourself look dumb."
03/20/2021,stocks,"EV is just an electric vehicle? It‚Äôs just a car with a different kind of motor. 

Is Nissian a tech company now? Or Chevy? They both have EVs. 

And imo I wouldn‚Äôt call EV a sector. It‚Äôs just a car, at the end of the day they‚Äôre just cars produced by car companies. There are also trends that come and go. 

Power windows, car phones, air bags, Bluetooth, speakers, bucket seats, and automatic transmissions used to be a luxury features. Cutting edge at their time. Now they‚Äôre obsolete or standard. 

Automatic transmissions Revolutionized how we drive in America. Absolutely outstanding piece of machinery. Now every car manufacturer has it to the point it‚Äôs weird to ask for a manual."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You‚Äôre underestimating the platform as a whole.

Just wait until they monetize the actual egaming market, it‚Äôll be nuts. Their Managemnt team is excellent. 

Also, not to insult you but... I‚Äôll let my money follow Morgan Stanley and cathie woods rather then a Reddit user complaining about their solitaire. Ha ha."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Exactly. I‚Äôve been in SKLZ since $15, didn‚Äôt sell a single share when it cracked $40. I am so long on this company. They have barely scratched the surface of the monetization of game gambling.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Take away ALL the money from the 400 richest people in USA, that‚Äôs only 3 trillion, that‚Äôs only gonna give a one time payment of 10-15k per person in USA, and meanwhile you punish people who haven‚Äôt done anything wrong they were just really successful. Now you‚Äôve taken everything from them and they will say ‚Äúfuck you im done,‚Äù and they won‚Äôt bother trying to be rich again. You will have nobody to take money from in the future, and those ‚Äúrich‚Äù won‚Äôt start any companies for you to work at. Imagine how many people lose their jobs if amazon goes under? When you fuck the rich, everybody loses. 

Print more money? That‚Äôs no good in the long run. High inflation. Instead, why can‚Äôt we rely on gov welfare to get through this? Maybe even temporarily loosen the standards of who qualifies. We already have a system in place to help people who need money for food, it‚Äôs called food stamps. They did a moratorium on rent so people didn‚Äôt actually need money for rent. People are just buying ps5‚Äôs and gpu‚Äôs with their stimulus, so tell me more about how we absolutely needed to print trillions of dollars."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Your arguments don't really address anything.   


* Rich People
   * I did not say to take all money from rich people.  I said that taxing them more **is** a way for a government to get money to poor people.
   * You have no idea what a rich person will do if more money is taken from them. I'd assume they would attempt to fight it as much as possible. I doubt they would stop caring about money, regardless.
   * You are describing trickle down economics. Which has pretty much proven to be wrong.  In fact, it's the reason why there is such a disparity between the richest and poorest.
   * Again, I did not say to take all money from the rich, or from amazon.  Do you think rich people would **really** care if they had 40 billion vs 100+ billion.  Ya, they'd fight tooth and nail to keep it...but in the end it wouldn't matter besides having more money than the next richest person.
* Printing money
   * Lets say we never print money again.  Rich people get that money.  They keep it.  At some point, there is a fixed amount of money flowing in the economy.  Pandemic hits and hundreds of thousands to millions of people lose their jobs.  We expand government programs to help them.  But wait, where is all the money?  The government has tax money and whatever reserves they've kept. There isn't enough to give to the people who've lost their jobs. Those people then cannot spend money in the economy.  Which means that taxes are miniscule in the coming years.  Companies lose money, people have no money, government gets no money, government cannot hand out money or create programs to help.
   * The above is part of what happened in the 1920's. By printing money the  government can create the money they need to help the people when they need it. Which then stimulates the economy.  There are still taxes paid on PS5's and GPU's.  Yes, there is inflation, but without inflation the economy becomes at high risk for deflation.  Since there would be less production and work being done, prices of things would fall as the majority of workers would make less or nothing at all.  Our currency would be overvalued compared to the income of most individuals. Which would then destroy the dollar as the main world reserve currency.
   * **Many** countries and economies are printing a lot of money right now.  Not just the U.S.  The goal would be to taper down our (U.S) printing over time and reach a 2% avg inflation rate...which is the goal of the FED.
   * Where do you think the money for food stamps and government programs come from?  Do you think a sudden 1000% increase in demand for those programs without the ability to get the money could actually work?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"Taxing them more, maybe, but they aren‚Äôt just an endless piggy bank and we DO know what happens when we overtax anyone, but especially rich people. They leave. They hide their money. 

We need to also address overspending. The gov should be treated like a business! When it‚Äôs doing bad everyone has to take a pay cut. ALL gov workers should have been on a forced 20% pay reduction for this year. Maybe then we‚Äôd have the money to expand gov welfare programs.

Disparity between rich and poor is not the fault of ‚Äútrickle down,‚Äù it‚Äôs simply nature. If we have everybody 1 million tomorrow, in a week half of everybody would be flat broke and 10% of people would have 5 million+. Poor people are largely poor because of bad financial decisions. That‚Äôs it. 

I think that if you have the tax rate get really extreme past 1 million per year or whatever other idiotic idea people float, then people would just stop making money past 1 million. That wouldn‚Äôt help anyone else. It would probably cause less business expansion. 

There is never a fixed amount of money in the economy."
03/20/2021,stocks,"You haven't really addressed the main question. If you don't print money, then how do people have money to spend during the pandemic?    


None of what you mentioned gets people money during the pandemic.  Taxes next year?  Doesn't help last March/April.  Reducing people's pay?  Doesn't help last March/April.   


Also, you cannot just reduce government worker's pay. It's contracted to companies mostly.  In others, there are unions and laws. They could furlough them,  but that really just exacerbates the problem no?  


If no new money enters the economy...then the money in the economy is therefore 'fixed'.  In the case of never printing new money...the money in the economy would be fixed.  Not specifically to a hard number, but within a range.  The economy could never grow, only prices could increase or decrease.  


The nature of money and 'trickle down' effect are different things altogether.  Trickle down is, ""Please let me keep all this money, I promise I'll give it back in other ways.""  The nature of money is, ""I value money highly and am smarter and luckier than the majority, therefore I will make more money."""
03/20/2021,stocks,I love this company. I got in a year ago and keep averaging up.  In one year we‚Äôll be producing or very close to producing in Argentina.  In two years we‚Äôll be very close to producing in Nevada. Each of those catalysts are going to get us a sweet multibagger.
03/20/2021,stocks,Be patient and keep adding to those positions. Smart plays.

For covered calls, PLTR:

**This is my strategy, DO NOT COPY IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR. TRADE WITH YOUR OWN RISKS.**

Sell order on Monday-Tue-Wed, select expire day is the nearest expired day (Friday). Ex: on Monday 03/22/2021, sell call PLTR, strike price 25, expire day 03/26/2021

Strike price: I usually select 1 USD above market price.

So You need to pay attention on Friday (expire day) 03/26/2021.

If out of money (PLTR price less than 25 on 03/26/2021), option will be expired worthless and you keep premium. YOU DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING.

**If in money (on 03/26/2021, PLTR price is above 25): you need to roll,**

For rolling:

Strike price: keep same strike price or up 0.5 USD or 1 USD, up to you

Expire day: select expire day until you get credit. The farther the more credit.

DO NOT ROLL AND DEBIT.

IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING, YOUR OPTION WILL BE EXCERCISED.

If you are not familiar, just try 1 option first.

This rolling is called: UP, OUT, CREDIT.  You don't lose money when you roll because you receive credit."
03/20/2021,stocks,"yep, it was from an PLTR ex-employee. React was 1 of his many bullish ideas. You can search for it, it was quite recent (less than 1 month)

I was almost about to buy the stocks and that post convinced me otherwise."
03/20/2021,stocks,"Sorry if I'm annoying you with the questions, I've just got a few more. So I assume what you're saying is, wait until Friday, and increase the strike price so that you get your premium, and lose some of the gains, but you get a nice premium, and make sure you don't get exercised. As for credits, why these over debits? I've been messing around, and it seems as if the only way I can get credit is by buying back the option, and then selling the higher strike price as a seperate trade.

Edit: I've been messing around trying to get credit rather than debit, but that requires me to buy an option at a higher strike after selling the option at a lower strike. Is this what I should be doing?"
03/20/2021,stocks,"For covered calls:

Sell order on Monday-Tue-Wed, select expire day is the nearest expired day (Friday).

Strike price: I usually select 1 US above market price.

So you need to pay attention on Friday (expire day)

If in money: you need to roll, 

For rolling:

Strike price: keep same strike price or up 0.5 USD or 1 USD, up to you

DO NOT ROLL AND DEBIT.

03/20/2021,stocks,"Ok, thanks for the longer explanation. Really helped and I think I have a good idea of what's going on. I'll give it a shot. Seems like a great strategy for when there's nothing going for PLTR. I would be worried about any news though.

I remember debating a guy here last year when SP500 was at like 2800, he said ""there's no bull case for stocks from here"" (as it has all been multiple expansion since 2015, which is technically true in the market index sense). I think however that this type of thinking can be very harmful to your wealth. It's better to set a ""hurdle rate"" for yourself (I use 6% or so now) and if you think that a company can get you (the owner) that rate in earnings *and* you have thought the downside through, then you buy and don't worry about what the market is going to do next month or next year.

Since I know you like Peter Lynch, he wrote a great article about this in the 1990s, thought I'd share in case you hadn't come across it:

03/20/2021,stocks,Ahhh sorry!
03/20/2021,stocks,"That definition of intrinsic value means non dividend paying stocks lack intrinsic value and should therefore be worthless. If that‚Äôs what you mean, I guess the discussion ends here. But I suspect that is not what you meant, so let‚Äôs add profits when selling to the list. ‚ÄúThe intrinsic value of a stock is what you receive when holding and/or selling it‚Äù? Seems quite fluffy to me, as it tells me basically nothing other than that the intrinsic value of any stock is unknown as it can even be zero. It also seems quite arrogant as it is by definition becomes something which is defined by the future, but expressed as if it‚Äôs known today.

So let‚Äôs remove the arrogance and say that the intrinsic value of a stock is the current expected discounted cash-flow of owning the stock? That seems somewhat less fluffy as well. But how do you set a target price and target sell date for a non dividend paying stock in order to calculate the intrinsic value? It means the intrinsic value of today is based on an assumption of the future intrinsic value which is based on today‚Äôs intrinsic value. A very circular argument, don‚Äôt you agree?

In my view, your definition is not sufficiently concrete to not be too fluffy or too arrogant to be used to avoid pedantic discussions about different definitions of intrinsic value of a stock. 

As you state even the valuation of the intrinsic value of such an easily priced instrument as a govvy isn‚Äôt free from issues, and as you say there are several different ways of calculating the intrinsic value using different inputs and assumptions. But the different methods do not reach [basically] the same result in different ways. They calculate different things in different ways and call the different results the same thing.

So I stand by what I say, and I believe we have proven notapersonaltrainer to have been correct."
03/20/2021,stocks,"That is indeed what I meant. If a company has no prospect of ever giving me money via buybacks or dividends, then its stock is essentially just a baseball card. Yes, you can own it because it has sentimental value and others may buy it off you because they feel the same way, but holding it doesn't benefit you in any way so the only way you can make money is off the greater fool theory. Companies rarely promise that they will never issue dividends or buy back shares, so almost every stock has at least some intrinsic value because the company has the potential to make lots of money in the future and distribute that to its owners even if it can't afford to today.

There are a few businesses that have lasted centuries, but the vast majority of companies eventually go bankrupt after maybe 50 years. No matter how great the company's earnings are, nobody can justify holding onto a piece of paper that can go to 0 by the time they retire without giving them any reward for holding it, so who would buy the stock off you if you wanted to sell it? I will concede that a large enough buyer can acquire enough voting rights to force the company to start issuing dividends or liquidate its assets before it goes to 0, so the model needs to also discount an expected liquidation cash flow back to today in addition to the expected dividend cash flows, but this liquidation value is grounded in the intrinsic value of the company's assets as well. Because of stock voting rights, there will always be a whale I can sell to before the company goes bankrupt so every stock has some intrinsic value.

I do agree with you that defining something is easy but solving for it is hard. Another example I can think of is that everyone can agree that the market clearing price is where the supply and demand curves intersect, but nobody can agree on how to forecast the supply and demand curves."

03/20/2021,stocks,There are indeed a great deal of short positions open.
03/20/2021,stocks,You do know that the Fed is printing money partly buying treasuries right? These treasuries are then allowed to be used as collateral for banks which allows them lower capital requirements on making loans etc. etc.
03/20/2021,stocks,Get over to wsb let‚Äôs do this
03/20/2021,stocks,"1) Banks can't use t-notes anymore as collateral due to the SLR exemption expiring. 

2) the fed can only buy 80bn worth of treasuries and 40bn of MBS every month. There is a ceiling, there is no infinite money glitch some people think. Printer can only brrrr that much.

The treasury needs a lot more money than 80bn a month, are there more buyers? Fo sho, are there enough for 1.9 trillion in stimmy checks and the infrastructure bill... Not to mention the other deficit spending. Probably not. 

If there are no buyers the yields have to go up, until an equilibrium is reached, at which points enough buyers will be found to start driving bond prices up (and level yields off)"

03/20/2021,stocks,"That's what people aren't seeing (or don't want to see).

Toyota and other Japanese companies have been pushing alternative fuel sources, but they focus on Hydrogen?!?  

* Select LA/SF Dealers: 2021 Toyota Mirai Hydrogen Fuel Cell Car + $15k Fuel Card $23,100 after Tax Credits & Incentives

There aren't enough and based upon the limitations when EV's (most notably Teslas) came around, and the criticism, I don't see how Hydrogen is a viable option at this time.  

For the purchase price, a person can get a nice EV (Leaf or Smart car) or even the Tesla Model 3.  Any EV can be economically charged at home, even in a high price-per-kW/h State such as CA where it's increased because of PG&E or [So.Cal](https://So.Cal) Edison."

My eye has been on the Supra and corresponding Lexus.  If you don't understand why a person would reference the Supra, and potentially even the predecessor Celica, you obviously don't understand cars.

If you're also a driver, not just a passenger in a car (much like the difference in a pilot versus self-loading-cargo) then your understanding is limited in why people buy and use airplanes.

0-60 matters, as does MPG, even on high end vehicles.  If you can't come up to speed on an on-ramp as a driver, you may as well be the passenger being carried around by a driver."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I know exactly where you're coming from.  Having owned (and still own) several Toyota's, they are extremely reliable vehicles.  

With over 300,000 on a Toyota SUV with a bit over 10 years of age, I have found it extremely reliable if you're willing to put in the basic maintenance (fluid changes,  plugs, undercoating, etc.)

This has inclined me to add another Toyota (P/U) and Lexus.  The Lexus is far less reliable due to wiring issues, but it's the same make/model/year of Lexus that I recommended to a family member who also enjoys a mostly trouble free experience.  

Now compared to Infiniti, BMW or MBZ - the Toyota's have been far more reliable in a variety of situations.  Not to mention cheaper and easier to maintain."
03/20/2021,stocks,"People do not by a Lexus product for raw performance, they buy it for refinement and reliability. 

If you're worried about the enthusiast market (not that they buy new cars anyhow), watching Papadakis racing build a 1000+hp B58 should show that there's plenty of interest in the Supra platform."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Mr. Musk has made many things ""crystal clear"" only to change his stance.  Tesla automobile buyers who got in early were told that they would not only be able to get service at home (not always possible) but when they went into a service center, that they'd get a top-of-the-line Tesla when their vehicle was being serviced.  

There is also the issue of lifetime free supercharge connectivity, which doesn't apply if you sell your vehicle.  In addition to reports that certain vehicle options can be removed depending on how you buy it.  

""Buyer lined up at $420 / share"" was a tweet that landed Mr. Musk in trouble with the SEC.

Point is that positions change in the market and buying into TSLA is the only play that individual investors have to get into Space X or into the Starlink system."
03/20/2021,stocks,"People as in ""all people"", or maybe just ""some people"" there?

Some people actually do buy a Lexus product for raw performance.  This is part of the reason why when you got to their web site, you see the 0-60 numbers displayed instead of having to dig for it.

When the Supra Mk IV came out, we understood that because of the engineering, increasing the fuel flow by changing out the injectors, adding a piggy-back controller and going to a single-turbo set up would give us a 1000 HP motor.  

This was back in the 90's

The point is the enthusiasts crowd were also buying Lexus SC 300's because of the motor and increasing performance.  Sleeper cars were in vogue then (and still now) allowing the Lexus platform for those familiar with Japanese motors the opportunity to tune.  

What foresight did Toyota / Lexus do?  

They killed the line.  This then migrated a whole slew of those invested in the platform to the Honda (NSX comes to mind) and Subura lines.  We even had those Neon aficionados due to the weight-balance.

Look up SOGI, that was the old community / mailing list where we played.   There are a lot of Johnny-come-latelies who think they understand today where Toyota came from.  Problem is that many of them ignore the history of Toyoda (and that was stamped on my power steering cap) and what Toyota lost because of lack of planning.

E.g.  Hilux, Supra, Lexus SC, Fortuner vs 4Runner, lack of diesel hybrid options in the US, etc."

03/20/2021,stocks,"Green, EV, cloud, travel/leisure and retail are all overbought at the moment. To be clear, they are all great ideas, but people are investing, driving prices up when theses are new industries that won't pay off in the near term. 

At the moment, ICLN and ARRY remain good long term options. ICLN is still overpriced. ARRY is a steal but it's something for a long term hold and price may drop further.

Everyone is buying things expecting them to blow up tomorrow. That's why travel stocks are overvalued right now. People are excited about the idea and know spending will go up but they aren't willing to wait for that. They're buying based on future revenues. Those aren't going to come back overnight. Meanwhile, the stock prices are being over inflated (same with retail).

That said, a lot of money will hit the market in those sectors. I'll keep evaluating to see if any stocks drop to a more se sible price. 

I think internet security isn't getting the attention it warrants, but the plummet of the tech stocks right now has me holding back for the moment to see if even better prices can be had.

Oil pricing is all over the map, at the moment. As this week showed, it's not a simple, slam dunk investement. 

Large cap stocks are surprisingly well priced at the moment (probably because they aren't as exciting as stuff like commercial space flight), and they offer dividends. At the moment, they're a good place to park cash if you want to be in the market and not dealing with the volatility right now. 

Besides that, I've been using ETFs and inverse ETFs when I have some measure of confidence about where the market may be going on a given day or week. My confidence isn't very high right now. With so much at play, pulling the market in different directions, I rarely see a clear path day-to-day.

I will spend this weekend strategizing but we may be entering a choppy up and down for a while."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I'm holding for 2-5-10 years.  I'm up over 100% on 12 holdings that I purchased inside of 12 months.  I look at 1-5-max charts.  What legs do they have?  MRNA was working on something like 23 applications with their technology, jumped ship to work on a vaccine using that technology and now have revenue.  If Covid requires a booster, that is a large income stream.  I doubt our govt will pay for booster, health insurance and out of pocket will -  which is better for them.  Take UAL, it's no where near where it was a year ago.  Same with CCL.   I bought CAKE, CRBL and SBUX.  Take CRBL, they are just now back where they began BUT they added beer and wine to their menu.  First that's a huge profit margin and secondly, that moves their model from a rest stop travel restaurant to a neighborhood night out because someone can now unwind with a beer or glass of wine.  That opens a HUGE and untapped market for them.  OXY is no where near where it was even tough I am at at 138% gain.  They stopped dividends and there are plenty of people who use that dividend income.  They held through this."
03/20/2021,stocks,"All sounds smart to me, TBH. I just bought beer and wine rather than targeting a specific beer/wine drinker. 

As far as travel goes...

UAL isn't at it's pre-covid price (around $85) and has lots of room to grow from $60. It's just a matter of how long that will take and if the $60 is already pricing in the next year of future revenues. 

Same with CCL.

For me, it's not that they won't come back, the question is how long it will take and how many bumps will be on the road."
03/20/2021,stocks,"I got it.  CCL used to pay out a dividend of $.50 a Q per share.  It went to $0 after the March '20 payout.  That's a lot of money they aren't paying out when they start sailing.  It'll take a long time to get back to that.  That has to be figured in there, too.  I have it in 3 accts.  In 1 Acct I bought in Aug and bought 2 times in Oct, I'm up 110% in that Acct.  I don't want any ST income, so I'm not selling it.  Anyway, I have to go acct by acct, and drill into the shares, I normally bought 4-5 times per acct.  I frequently buy more if a stock continues down or if it drops like OXY did, below $9 and in that case, I bought a ton thinking I would sell the $16-18 shares in Dec for the loss but it went beyond that and never looked back so I have a lot.  I sold a few 100 about 2 weeks ago above $30.  But I'm a hold.  They used to pay $.79 per Q dividend and went to a penny.  Again, that's a lot of cash with oil above $60. Word is they will be a cash cow before we know it.  I have that in 8 accts and range in up 71% to up 195%.  And it's no where near where it was a year ago.  I have to admit, I made some good buys and they are doing very well at the moment with legs still.  It also took a long time, all day for months.  I like my long term positions too in EV's, charging stations, batteries, cloud, AI, weed, banks, opening stocks, fintech (I think I love fintech the best going forward).  My son will leave his wallet and say no problem I can use my phone.  This generation coming up will never write a check.
