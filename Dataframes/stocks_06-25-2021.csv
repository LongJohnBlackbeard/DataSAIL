6/25/2021 19:30,stocks,"I mean, stocks are backed by real companies with profits and products."
6/25/2021 19:37,stocks,"What is arbitrary about Walmart, or Amazon, or any other publicly traded company? These are real, tangible businesses, with real assets. They have calculable value. How you choose to value a company may be personally subjective, but they have actual monetary worth. You can buy and sell both stock and coin, but beyond that they are completely different things."
6/25/2021 19:42,stocks,Just quit before the onslaught of downvotes takes over
6/25/2021 19:44,stocks,"The difference is a stock derives it's value from the company it represents, it also has value in the fact that when a company makes profits you are entitled to part of the earnings in other words dividends, shitcoins derive their value from The fact that someone more stupid than you will buy at a higher price."
6/25/2021 19:38,stocks,Are shitcoin mining operations Plumbers? Puts on rescue rooters.
6/25/2021 19:34,stocks,"Yeah, of course, but looking past that, the prices of stocks are still set by the same forces as shitcoins. Yes, companies have real products but still, the value of stocks is set by the same forces as shitcoins, not the actual products. I am just thinking aloud here.."
6/25/2021 19:43,stocks,It’s arbitrary in the way that prices are based on the whim of individual investors / institutions. Look at GameStop for example
6/25/2021 19:44,stocks,Lmao guys it’s just a theoretical question. Why is everyone so triggered
6/25/2021 19:35,stocks,"""Yeah of course that's the difference between them, but other than that, what's the difference between them?"""
6/25/2021 19:49,stocks,"How you choose to value a company will be subjective from person to person, but does not change the fact that the underlying company has real value. If the company closed up shop tomorrow and liquidated all assets, there will be a real cash value returned to shareholders. If your coin stops existing, you get nothing."
6/25/2021 19:57,stocks,"Game stop isn’t a good example for you’re argument for several reasons. 

The entertainment industry is a behemoth and video games are no slouch when it comes to driving literal profits.  

The business was heavily undervalued and massively over shorted leading up to a new console release cycle. 

Then when you add in all the changes in leadership and corporate strategy, suddenly you have an actual contender for real value to investors.

I know you’re trying to understand some of the basics here, but maybe try to learn WITHOUT the assumptions"
6/25/2021 19:57,stocks,Because we have brains
6/25/2021 19:37,stocks,"Why am I getting downvoted, I am asking a theoretical question here. Sorry, I could have written that last comment in a more concise way."
6/25/2021 19:55,stocks,I feel like that has more to do with regulations
6/25/2021 19:44,stocks,"It’s because the fact that companies have actual assets and profits is a very obvious and meaningful difference and you wanted to look past that.

Why would you look past that?  That’s the difference.  Someone gave you a very valid answer and your response was kinda bizarre."
6/25/2021 19:46,stocks,"Because it's not a theoretical difference. Them having no product, no business, no reason to buy them other than ""to the moon!"" IS the difference. Stock price of companies is not arbitrary (in a typical market with informed investors), price of shitcoins, are."
6/25/2021 19:42,stocks,"It's cause your ignoring the one thing that makes them diffrent, and that happens to be evry important to why one holds value and the other doesn't."
6/25/2021 19:47,stocks,"What I’m trying to say is that even that stocks are based on real finances and products, their value are still set by whatever people pay for them, which means that ultimately it’s their value is arbitrary. Look at GameStop for example"
6/25/2021 19:49,stocks,"Of course but the difference is a stock derives it's value from a real company that makes real profits and has real customers, a shitcoin while also set by supply and demand derives it's value from the fact that people belive more stupid people will buy higher, that's where the difference comes from and that difference is huge."
6/25/2021 19:50,stocks,"Ok cool, you’ve identified a way they are similar.

It’s unreasonable to ask what the difference is and respond to every difference with “what about this similarity though”

Hence the downvotes"
6/25/2021 19:51,stocks,All good
6/25/2021 19:39,stocks,[removed]

6/25/2021 19:55,stocks,[removed]
6/25/2021 19:00,stocks,Might be a reorganization fee or something if the sort. I don’t use E*trade though so I could be wrong.
6/25/2021 19:06,stocks,"Have you tried https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/library/stocks/understanding-cash-account-violations

Sounds like possibly a freeride violation.  Did you actually put the $20 in, or did you open a $20 position and then fail to actually ever deposit the $20?

It shouldn’t be possible to go negative unless you are trading on margin or committed some kind of policy violation that requires a fee"
6/25/2021 19:08,stocks,No I bought it with cash 3 months ago. I was charged this morning. I just learned before I read your reply that the company did a split or reverse split of some sort. Would that affect it?
6/25/2021 19:13,stocks,I think etrade charges you when a company does splits and the like. Pretty shitty of them really
6/25/2021 19:12,stocks,"You gotta get in touch with someone on Etrade then.

A cash call implies you borrowed the money to open the position"
6/25/2021 19:34,stocks,"Looking for growth tech to move downward next week Monday or the start of July, probably see companies like Docu Twilio and Roku go down 3-4 percent as value stocks have been hit and should see transitionary money based on job report and unemployment this week. Some tech will survive but those who have run hot into the end of June should see a pullback"
6/25/2021 18:06,stocks,Highly recommend unhedged.com
6/25/2021 18:07,stocks,Make yourself a simple spreadsheet.
6/25/2021 18:20,stocks,I like TipRanks
6/25/2021 19:04,stocks,Briefly checked this out. I'll give this website a try for a little bit.
6/25/2021 19:02,stocks,I've thought about making a spreadsheet I was just hoping to have all the information in one spot. I'll give it a try.
6/25/2021 18:10,stocks,You should really do research before sinking money into something you’re calling an “investment”. Without you actively putting in the time to independently research you’re just gambling. Peeps who put their time into this aren’t going to just give you their analysis on a company. You’ve already tried asking on WSB
6/25/2021 18:13,stocks,Yeah I get it but the last tips he gave me were good so I decided to invest a little more this time.  And in WSB the ticker wasn't allowed.
6/25/2021 17:44,stocks,Well if you are listening to people on Reddit yell there’s a good chance they are uninformed or overly excited. You can easily look up the short interest to help you know. And yes lots of companies have their share prices drop because the company is underperforming. A lot of times it’s a combo of multiple factors.
6/25/2021 17:47,stocks,Not sure they yell short or short squeeze when it goes down.
6/25/2021 18:21,stocks,Perhaps it’s because it’s human nature to not accept easily or enjoy being wrong. When someone picks a stock expecting the price to go up and it goes down it’s far more acceptable to them to blame short sellers than to admit or at least consider they were wrong.
6/25/2021 17:48,stocks,"A short is essentially when you sell stock you don’t own with a future date to deliver.

If a sock is over valued and you think it’s likely to go down it can be a good play.

It’s totally legal.

The vast majority of shorted stocks don’t squeeze.

Shorted stocks don’t go down because they are shorted, they go down normally as a correction, take Tesla for example."
6/25/2021 18:20,stocks,Because they need someone else to blame for their poor stock picks.
6/25/2021 18:40,stocks,"There are large investors that try to manipulate a stock price - if they can put enough shares for sale - it drives the shares price down - the ball gets rolling downhill and they hope to create panic among individual investors who may get scared and sell their shares in this circumstance- thereby driving the share price down further ….. once the stock price bottoms - that same large investor buys shares at a discount and when the share price recovers, they have effectively taken money from the little investors like us.
So know what you own and don’t get scared - if you believe in the stock - just dollar cost average on the way down"
6/25/2021 19:48,stocks,If obv dont lie than houston there is a problem
6/25/2021 17:43,stocks,"Depends what stock we're talking about. Some stocks are relentlessly shorted by short sellers. These short sellers are like parasites, infesting and poisoning a stock so the price simply cannot go higher unless they happen to cover. And FYI, short squeezes are when the price goes up due to short covering (not down)."
6/25/2021 17:59,stocks,"I get that particular concept, I don’t understand where everyone got the idea that every price drop is related to a stock being shorted. Its like people have convinced themselves that every price drop is an attack by short sellers to make sure no one else makes any money."
6/25/2021 18:56,stocks,[I hate my 500% gains on AMC.](https://i.imgur.com/Surm81t.mp4)
6/25/2021 18:51,stocks,Definitely doing that. I’m guessing by your name that you’re also betting on CLNE as a company?  I’m excited to see where it goes.
6/25/2021 17:52,stocks,"I know, most of the comments I’m talking about sound something like this. Price drops 5 cents “ the shorts are driving the price down. A short squeeze is coming, but the dip and make them pay”. I’ve even seen it on penny stocks I’m following. One in particular is 7 cents a share. I’m fairly certain that it’s not being targeted by short sellers and likely not even on their radar."
6/25/2021 18:44,stocks,It's just the most recent craze theme buzzword. Been like this since GME exploded upwards.
6/25/2021 19:18,stocks,"Grats to you Mr Winner, and for some reason you don’t seem to be complaining about the shorts!

Can we have a bag holder or someone who missed the train on the stage please? Hello Mr Bagholder, how do you feel about the shorts?

“Man, shorts are the scum of the earth, damn parasites!”

See?"
6/25/2021 18:05,stocks,"You’ll be surprised citadel owns over 4400 otc stocks, I’m pretty sure it’s only to short them because of all the new investors lately. I found a guy on YouTube who did intensive research on this matter if interested let me know."
6/25/2021 19:44,stocks,"Keep digging in my post history then.  I've posted before that I think shorting should be illegal, full stop.  There's no reason you should be able to sell something you don't own.  If you want to bet against a stock, buy puts."
6/25/2021 18:07,stocks,That might actually be interesting to check out. Thanks
6/25/2021 18:20,stocks,"I did a post on pennystocks that has the link, just go to my posts and you’ll see it, idk how this sub is with posting links. But if you have trouble let me know. I think you’ll start following this guy after watching."
6/25/2021 17:28,stocks,"If that's what you want to do, then add instead of doubling. 1% down on pypl today, might as well add."
6/25/2021 18:41,stocks,"At this point, I think the most growth in fintech will come from SoFi. Definitely not a sure thing though, PayPal and square are behemoths"
6/25/2021 18:17,stocks,"I don’t think V is overextended.  Zoom out and look at their trajectory over 10+ years. It is consistently up every year regardless crash or what. So it is always at all times high. They have been raising their dividends by 20% because they can. And they jumped into crypto as well, so will not miss out on that."
6/25/2021 17:20,stocks,"I like both. Visa can be a brilliant pick as people travel and spend, but I prefer PayPal, since it probably has more growth than Visa because fintech will be huge and PayPal is at the forefront of it."
6/25/2021 17:49,stocks,SQ is also good
6/25/2021 18:47,stocks,"Am waiting for Stripe to go public, will go all in , future is fintech online payments"
6/25/2021 18:28,stocks,"I bought PYPL @ 270 finally in the green, been thinking of adding more"
6/25/2021 18:50,stocks,Bullish on both for multiple reasons but especially short term due to inflation. They make a % from every transaction so as the cost of goods increases the amount they earn off of every transaction will also increase
6/25/2021 17:54,stocks,Go with PYPL and SQ.
6/25/2021 17:29,stocks,Dca you mean?
6/25/2021 19:00,stocks,Debating opening a position today in SoFi given the pullback. Sad I missed it when it was down in the $14/$16 range and I guess I'm hoping I get another shot at it around there
6/25/2021 17:28,stocks,So you would ignore current prices and double up?
6/25/2021 17:59,stocks,I looked at sq. I want to see another year or two of consistency. I’m sure I’ll miss the boat but I’d rather be a bit more conservative.
6/25/2021 19:55,stocks,Relative has worked for Stripe for years and can confirm it’s a fantastic company in every regard
6/25/2021 18:50,stocks,Would you double your position now if you could? Or wait for pullback
6/25/2021 17:43,stocks,Yes
6/25/2021 18:05,stocks,If you looking for pypl only than buy whenever dips in fractions of stocks.e.g.$100 . growth wise sq have more growth.i have both sq and pypl
6/25/2021 18:57,stocks,"Most likely, long term (3 to 5 years) these will be a lot higher than they are now. Obviously no one knows if there will be a drop in the next few months but I'm guessing you'll probably feel worse if PYPL is 30% higher in a few months rather than if it was 30% lower if you didn't add. Adding to my winners has performed well for me. If I were in your shoes I would add some now and then some more in a few weeks/next dip instead of straight doubling but to each their own"
6/25/2021 19:50,stocks,The CEO of starbucks having to come out and say they are not running low on cups is just so funny to me.
6/25/2021 16:42,stocks,Legend
6/25/2021 17:47,stocks,"Thanks as always, brother!"
6/25/2021 17:49,stocks,How do you decide which specific stock updates to share? (Eg. why Accenture?)
6/25/2021 17:13,stocks,"> * Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 

This just makes me laugh. Cathie Wood is so desperate for crypto to take off she’s doing as much PR as she can to promote it. 

She’s definitely the pioneer of this new fund manager/social media influencer dual role we’re seeing more and more. 

Buy up a security and then pump the shit out of it on podcasts, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and wherever else she can get someone to listen/watch."
6/25/2021 19:51,stocks,"😂😂 I feel the same, one of the weirder headlines I've seen in a while"

6/25/2021 18:15,stocks,Other criteria is larger than $10b market cap and has to come from a reputable firm
6/25/2021 18:08,stocks,Im not disagreeing but curious why you only mention Cathie Wood but fail to acknowledge or talk about the role the Jack Dorsey ans (maybe) Elon Musk could play. She's the least important of those three
6/25/2021 18:34,stocks,"ah yes, bitcoin was worthless before she came into the spotlight"
6/25/2021 18:18,stocks,Childish Reddit hate boner
6/25/2021 18:30,stocks,Because Musk and Dorsey are already billionaires with or without crypto.
6/25/2021 19:36,stocks,ETN's can be risky.  If the issuer defaults you're basically shit outta luck.

6/25/2021 16:39,stocks,"They started off as giving out loans to well educated college students at attractive interest rates (doctors, lawyers, and so on) because they perceived the risk to be less. This drew in the younger generation but they pivoted away from that and their vision now is to be ""Amazon of banking"".

1. According to their research they believe that a) banks are doing a poor job of offering quality digital interface and b) people have multiple banks/accounts because they all their needs aren't met at one bank. 

2. They invested into their digital platform so they can draw in the younger generations who prefer comfort/convenience. Why go to a bank and talk to a rep and get a loan when you can get the same terms on SOFI without leaving the house...similar to why go to a restaurant and pick it up when you can order ubereats. 

3. To be the amazon of banking you need to be vertically integrated, offer a breadth of products, and be the first to market. 

4. They are doing this by obtaining a bank charter (so they can offer better loans and better terms), obtained Galileo (which is the frameworks neo banks like robinhood use). They don't want to specialize in one sector but rather offer a lot and draw in more customers and then improve their services down the road. 

5. Their MOAT? What sets them apart? They are one of the few first to market...while lot of companies are specializing in one area they have done a great job of casting a wider net to capture more. Growing at great rate. Their margins are lower. They have good cash flow and revenues. Great management. 

Interesting prospect."

Joel Tillinghast talks about this phenomenon in more detail in his book Big Money Thinks Small, something about how analysts are usually overly optimistic to avoid pissing off companies they follow. 

I don't have a link at hand, but there's a funny old video with Peter Lynch and Sir John Templeton at some event. Templeton says how investing is very different from other disciplines. ""if 10 doctors give you the same diagnosis and treatment advice, they're almost certainly correct. but if 10 stock analysts give you the same advice, they're almost certainly wrong."""

6/25/2021 16:42,stocks,"I've learned that you really need to take analyst ratings with some, or even a lot of, skepticism. Keep in mind that most of these recommendations are coming from investment banks, who most likely also own stocks themselves or have purchased options on them. They stand to gain a huge amount of money from manipulating the public by telling them to buy or sell the companies they already have investments in. If they've bought a position beforehand and then afterwards tell people they should be buying it, the price of their investments might go up. In other words, the investment banks' buy or sell ratings most likely have huge conflicts of interest.

The fair value of a stock price is extremely important information that is usually kept top secret by companies, so you should be asking yourself why they're giving out this information for free. If you want to go back to the 2000 dot-com crash, analysts have admitted to pumping IPO's they knew were junk because their company was also the one getting paid to manage the stock's public offering."

6/25/2021 18:25,stocks,"They keep track of the date that each stock is purchased, so the amount of time would differ between the two batches of stocks for tax purposes. All of that is accounted for, so one batch would gain the long term tax write off while the other would be short term."

'fundamental analysis' is far more important, which examines the financial status of a company. for example, see the following books all by successful investors: 

- The Most Important Thing, by Howard Marks. very little discussion of chart reading, other than to say he doesn't rely on it too often. 

- The Little Book that Beats the Market, but Joel Greenblatt. focuses on two methods of fundamental analysis, finding stocks with low ""price to earnings"" ratio and high ""return on capital."" looking for stocks that are under-valued (like buying $5 for $2.50), but are good at turning assets into profits. zero chart reading. 

- The Little Book of Value Investing, by Christopher Browne. 100% fundamental analysis. 

- One Up on Wall Street and Beating the Street, by Peter Lynch. mostly focused on fundamentals, with a bit of chart analysis."

I don’t think it is the end all be all, but I think it can be a good final confirmation for timing your trades if you have already done your DD on the fundamental side. That being said, I’ve read through this website which was useful and has a nice strategy that covers a bunch of indicators and how to limit losses when your trade goes south: https://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/index.html

6/25/2021 17:26,stocks,"Here's some advice: don't confuse speculation with investing. It's fine to speculate a bit (I hold AMC, GME and HYLN myself), but you should make a clear distinction between these and the rest of your portfolio, which should be investments for the long haul. That way, you can also make sure the speculative portfolio doesn't become too large (I'd recommend 10% or less of your total portfolio value).

Other than that, I'd second the suggestion of not selling now. Just be patient and see what happens."
6/25/2021 13:31,stocks,"My advice to you is to do your due diligence and research. AMC and GME are very different from the other “meme” stocks that they are trying to push in the news.

6/25/2021 17:33,stocks,"Don't view it as a ""second savings account,"" individual stocks, especially the types of stocks you mentioned can easily drop 90% or more.

6/25/2021 18:54,stocks,Because if you think they're the same as the rest then you aren't paying attention. No one owes you their time when the information is freely available.
6/25/2021 14:41,stocks,"You do have time to read up on the company and make a determination yourself whether or not BB is a good long term play. As others have stated, BB was very different from the other ""meme stocks"" in the way it was presented and characterized. IIRC, the narrative was that BB was undervalued as a cybersecurity company because people only thought of it as a failed phone company. You're only down $50, take the time to read up on the company and make an informed decision as to whether or not it's worth your money. If it's not, or it's not worth your time to research, cut your losses and move into something lower effort like a good ETF."
6/25/2021 14:52,stocks,"Quite right, appreciate the input. Won’t deny that in relation to my other investments I did far less DD on BB and just kind of let the hype take the wheel and steer.

Compare this to the number of enterprise Windows users who use both Teams AND Zoom, (and vastly prefer Zoom because lets face it, everyone else does).

Yes, the 3000 companies that already spend more than a hundred thousand a year on Zoom contracts are going to magically cancel their contracts next year and screw themselves over when suddenly their customers or suppliers want to have a Zoom call.

It’s easy to say to yourself that you should have bought and held when you see it taking off now. But you must remember why you didn’t initially buy and always take that into consideration. Greed will eventually be your downfall in the stock market.

6/25/2021 11:50,stocks,"I think this is one of the most important bits of advice for newbies and it's the way I deal with regret (I don't feel it anymore)

None of us walk around with foresight, we exist and make decisions in the present and that's all we can do, the future is not in our control. I bought Tesla before it mooned and sold when I thought it was overvalued and soon to crash, no way I could've known it would go this high so I don't regret selling and missing out on what could've been a 600-700% gain. It was overvalued at the time and I was up a small amount so selling was a good idea at the time, I made the right decision"

For example: just 3 months ago, I posted a story about $IHRT on this subreddit ([this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m6iga4/iheartmedia_stock_takeover/)), and the only response it got was to stay away because of the company's large amount of debt. Since then, this stock has risen about 50%*. Things like this can uncover valuable lessons about investing in stocks (such as: Debt isn't, by itself, a bad thing for a company.)."

It is infuriating insanity when you keep seeing comment after comment on stocktwits or reddit where morons (or shills) are pouring money into a stock because “it’s about to squeeze!!”  

No, it isn’t going to squeeze because a bandwagon campaign doesn’t equate to an actual short squeeze set up.  You are just feeding right into the hands of short sellers.  You pump it up, they short it, wash, rinse, repeat.  They are smarter than you think.  GME and AMC might have kicked off a revolution of sorts but holy shit - do you think maybe those institutions might have learned from past mistakes?

Yes, I’m salty.  Lost around a grand on PUT options that logically should have paid off very well since they were for stocks that were up 15-20% with no recent news to justify it other than people screaming “to the moon!!”  $1k isn’t the end of the world, I’m more pissed that the net result of all your efforts swimming upstream is maybe a short term gain - short term because it goes up but instead of taking a profit you hold.  Only, enough people sell so shorts can cover and you are back where you started. It is arrogant and idiotic. I hate the childish bandwagon shittyness that has taken over stocktwits and WSB. 

I fucking hate you all.  Lesson learned on my part - there is always an army of stupid with endless cash to piss away on the other side ready to fuck up even the most obvious plays."

I am fairly new to investing and this is the first time i’ve ever picked a company that might be picked up by another one.
6/25/2021 11:13,stocks,"Totally dependent on the deal structure. If a straight acquisition occurs (not creating a newco), your shares in VIAC will become shares in CMCSA, you will be paid in cash for your shares, or you will receive a combination of shares and cash. Impossible to predict ahead of time which will be the case. 

Shares will most likely not be exchanged 1:1.  Share conversion rates will be dependent on factors like deal structure, share prices at time of deal close, etc. 

Hope this answers your questions. I hold VIAC too. Good luck!"
6/25/2021 11:13,stocks,It depends on how they structure the deal.  You may get cash for your shares at the sell price (which will be a premium to the existing price).  Sometimes you will get some shares in the acquiring company.  Sometimes it is a combination of cash and shares.

If they can pull off their vision of sitting on the couch, as you change the channel it switches betting sheets and make the whole experience really interactive then they will do well. Their advertising revenue is also growing and is already above industry standards.

In terms of management, a lot of the exec are ex-warner brothers and know the core business well. So far they have exceeded what they promised.

Recently had the realization that I was a fool for buying as many naked calls as I always have and that spreads would have saved me a lot of pain over the years. Apparently I needed approval for them though on etrade, which I applied for earlier this week and got rejected for, without a reason being given. Surprising to me because spreads actually seem less risky than naked calls/puts, so not sure why it's off limits.

Listed that I'd been trading for 5+ years, shares and options (no bonds), income neither highest nor lowest bracket. My account size is pretty tiny (4 digits), not sure if that's a factor. 

Anyone know what I would have gotten rejected and what I say/do to reapply and get approved?"

I am trying to make sense of everything going on. There are lots of things I do not understand like Hawkish vs Dovish.  I believe the debate right now is do the Feds raise the rates to slow down inflation or do they leave them low to support the labor market?

If we look at labor restraints for manufacturing, shipping, etc I think the general assumption on Wall Street is that we are getting back to full participation at some point.  We are just having a difficult time figuring out how long that will take.

If for instance the Junes job report shows job losses, what is the impact on the market?  What if we have a continual drain on the labor force of let's say, 100k people exiting the workforce every month?  Would that catch up to a company like American Airlines and force them into Chapter 11?  That is to say, what if American Airlines actually loses more staff and has to cancel 100 flights/day in September?

That gravy train is set to run out in September through unless they extend it yet again.

Edited to add that FL's unemployment is maxed out at $275, there are probably people who collect even less than that.  Still though, the $300 federal bonus is received by anyone on unemployment except in the few states who are getting rid of it as a means to promote people getting back to work."

In other words, if people don't come back and instead are willing to quit, that creates different problems for the government.  Birth rates are down, people sitting at home will drive a greater wealth gap, etc.

Would the gov't value having a large portion of the population working over inflation?  IE: let inflation happen and don't worry about the stock market because we need people working?

Edit: Probably something I am not seeing with this argument.  If they let inflation happen it is harder for companies to hire but they have this conflict where they are trying to close the wealth gap somehow, I think."

Thanks!"
6/25/2021 9:23,stocks,"Thanks for the reply.

I was actually asking what happens if less and less and less people are working at all.

Let's say the unemployment rate goes down to a normal percent but people are just living at their parents.  Jobless claims go down and Wall Street is happy bc less people are going onto Unemployment for the first time but if those people are instead out hiking and not actually working then that's actually bad, right?

If the Jobless rate goes down the assumption is those people are not starting Unemployment so they must be working.  What if they were just like ""screw this"" and they are being lazy and still not working.

It's kind of why I think there may be a conflict here.  Wall Street is assuming the unemployment #'s are going down so people are going back to work.  However that doesn't gel with massive labor shortages.  I think what is happening is more and more people are just kind of giving up and retiring with $10 and living with their parents.  Hence the unemployment rate drops but people are not actually working."
6/25/2021 10:54,stocks,"I really should do something more with stocks.  I went to Bentley, used their little trading room.   That was a long time ago and I have 401k's and Roths with my buddy.  He's series 6 and all that jazz.  Owns his own company as a Financial advisor.

I am trying to more understand what is going on with the Feds and interest rates.  I think they might be concerned about a bunch of people retiring in 25 years with next to nothing.   Social Security cannot support an overwhelming % of people having next to nothing for retirement.

Having that conversation opens up crazy internet conversations though.  Any time I talk about the Millennials struggling it always brings up debates on student loan write offs, just go to work, don't expect handouts, etc.  I work 50 hours/week and take $2-400 out of savings to pay rent.  I think there is a large group in the same camp.  It's basically a growing wealth gap and shrinking of the middle class.  

Further, I am obviously in the camp that thinks there will be a growing labor shortage as many Millennials just give up.  I think that we will see a continuous exit of people from the job market, or a downward trend, over a long timeline.  Something that I do not think most traders are considering (my buddy was very adamant that I am stupid lol).

How would the government and stock market reflect on that?  I think the answer is companies will automate the low pay jobs out and get more productivity with less people.

However, that may provide a direct conflict with the government's long term thinking.  At least IMO.

Thanks for the post."

6/25/2021 9:51,stocks,"True true.  We have the self check outs at supermarkets too.

I suppose as McDonald's replaces workers those people might go out and become a stewardess, for instance.

The other thing I was contemplating is, going back to my American Airlines example, if they are at 60% staff (example) and have to cancel flights.  Then another 10% just drops off, now they have to cancel more flights.  If they go under it would affect the market, but those employees would get absorbed by Delta maybe.  Now Delta is closer to full staff w/ a greater market share of flights.

I wonder how much certain industries can get away with automation?  There are massive $10M conveyor belts that might eliminate the need for forklifts?  Not sure.  Trying to think it through."
6/25/2021 11:21,stocks,"Again, just trying to bring conversation and not conflict here!

I am actually seeing the opposite believe it or not.  Which is precisely the reason I am creating this topic and getting concerned.  When only 1 person on the internet is saying it it cannot be true, right?  ;)

We have I think 26 states that have ended or will very soon end at least the $300 benefit.  Indeed just released a survey that in the states where that benefit has ended job searches are actually down.  Which is the opposite of what you expect when these benefits go away.

My goal is not to say it's the case but nearly to point out the possibility that we may not see a lot of these people return to the workforce.  Baby Boomers have retired, as an example.  We see the odd #'s for Apr/May jobs reports.  Why is the gov't acting the way they are RE rate hikes?

I could be wrong.  I  hope I am wrong.  I likely am wrong.  I think the June jobs report is 7/2?  Maybe I am giving something interesting to think about when we see those numbers.

Of course, my topic title is what if the participation rate goes down?  Which is entirely 1,000% the opposite of waiting until September."
6/25/2021 11:21,stocks,You should look at the different metrics of unemployment. Also look into how an increase gross productivity can balance out a drop in labor force participation.
6/25/2021 11:02,stocks,"It’s a valid issue many don’t look at (other than right now due to the pandemic toll). Unemployment numbers have never counted those who have given up on the workforce completely so is a quite misleading benchmark. I guess as long as ppl continue to believe it is the benchmark tho, we won’t feel it in the market."
6/25/2021 13:56,stocks,"As a market, as a society not do much.  The effect can be seen 2x in Canada.  Capital is so much more valuable than labour up here it's crazy.  Most people make more in housing in the last year than 10 years of working.  There is an overabundance of youth just sitting at home not participating in the economy because even if they did they would not be able to afford that basics."
6/25/2021 16:04,stocks,"Yeah, that's true. It seems like places like California are going to forgive poor people’s back rent too."
6/25/2021 11:50,stocks,"September will be here before we know it.  It is only a few months away and of course it will still take awhile for people to feel the economic impact and really get back to work.  Still though, negligible amount of time considering people who invest are in it for 20+ years.  

As benefits end and inflation continues driving up the price of things people will be motivated to get back to work because people like having money and buying things.  Remember, its not just federal unemployment that will eventually end.  State unemployment ends at a certain point too at which point people will eventually have to either choose between joining the workforce, homelessness or claiming a disability/SSI. 

The bigger uncertainty in my opinion is things like how many people will continue work from home vs. going back to office work, or will it be a hybrid model.

If you really want to look long term though, automation will have a larger impact on the workforce than people simply electing to stay out of the workforce."
6/25/2021 14:35,stocks,"Yes!  This is exactly what is happening in the U.S. too.  At least from what I am seeing.

I've been studying the Millennials for the last 1.5 years trying to figure out myself and I started to see some shocking trends.  A lot of stuff that I, myself am very guilty of:

1. They distrust companies.
2. They change jobs.  A lot.  I have had 10 jobs in 16 years.  Mostly due to companies not giving raises.  A Gallup survey concluded Millennial turnover costs U.S. companies $30.5B/ year.  Whoa boy is this going to skyrocket in this job market.
3. Because they have not gotten raises they have been perpetually squeezed into not hitting milestones like home ownership, kids, etc.  Student loans are not helping.  This ironically might give them leverage to not need to work since they already do not own anything.
4. I noticed that when the 2008 bubble burst most Millennials graduating college couldn't find jobs.  The entry level ""good"" jobs (not retail) required 2 years experience.  Companies just stuck with their Boomers, Gen X, and older Millennials and ignored a significant portion of the workforce.
5. I feel like the problems the US is having are happening everywhere.  I saw something on Twitter about Millennials in China or Asia ""lying down"" where they choose not to give their whole life to companies.  Europe is I think also not raising their interest rates and possibly allowing some inflation?

In a weird way I feel like the Baby Boomers are a large portion of the U.S. population riding out unemployement and a lot of Millennials never even really got into their field of study.  They've been kind of floundering for 10+ years.  I also think that a lot of them are kind of on strike and Wall Street is not noticing (likely doesn't care anyways).  Makes me feel like a Wide Eyed Scientist.  ""Great Scott"".

I was able to buy a house but we defaulted and my company refused a raise, so I had to change jobs YET AGAIN (6 years ago).  It was insanely frustrating.  I graduated mid 2000's before the bubble and have barely squeaked out the life milestones.  Including divorce now lol."
6/25/2021 14:45,stocks,"Sorry man.  Blowing you up.

Not sure how it works in Canada but in the U.S. I don't think we have much support for people just not working.  I think a lot of young Millennials and Gen Z here are working landscape jobs, trash collecting, whatever.  Just under employed instead of not employed.

I was talking to some people and I cannot think of anyone under 30 that I know personally that doesn't live with their parents or is in college."
6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"What do you guys think about coursera? I am really amazed by the platform, I went to great universities (2) and I would not recommend to just do not go to college and do online courses but mainly because uni is more about network and signaling than knowledge, but for some people that live in countries where education is scarce or unafordable it could be a substitute (+now with covid I think online school is more valued than before). And for people that do have acces to college (my case) I think is a really good complement tool to show in your CV that you reinforced some skills or just learned new ones. 

That said I went full Lynch and went to see if it is a public company, and it is. And with a really good balance sheet. The main problems that I see and this is why ask for advise from fellow strangers is: Coursera has losses (it doesn't really bother me, it is a growing company) and my main concern: a price/sales ratio of 20. This is a lot of growth discounted there, for reference is a similar multiple than tesla but without earnings.

That being said, I didn't see any benefit to taking any of the certifications that cost thousands of dollars. I did do one certification that I thought would add value to my resume and received no increased interest from recruiters.

6/25/2021 17:15,stocks,"I'd say it could only be a substitute if you already know how to learn complex huge topics. Learning is a skill and what you learn most of all at university is learning. Of course in a specific direction of your special area and on the way you learn a lot knowledge to apply.

So if you can learn and apply the stuff you learned to learn it even better, then Coursera is great. A few people have that skill or drive naturally. Most learn it the hard way at university under pressure.

Imagine your math professor from university days. Hell 2/3 of what he wrote on that blackboard made no sense at first (only for the craziest math nerds). You need to do all the mistakes on the way to get to such a solution or proof yourself, discuss with your learning group, learn to apply till a deadline and then use it again in a homework or thesis.

On university you become a lifelong learner and you learn how to learn. If you start with video tutorials only, I believe only a few people will succeed, even if the videos have multiple choice test interruptions and some exercises."

For instance if I’m looking for a marketer and I see certifications for data science courses, that’s a huge plus for me.

I think it’s also really beneficial if you’ve been out of college for 15-20 years, so you’re showing that you’re still learning and improving, not just relying on what you learned in college. Obviously just working in the industry teaches you a lot too, so it’s not everything, but it’s nice to see.

College is basically a requirement at this point, so I barely even notice it any more, but Coursera certifications show me that you value learning and improving and gives me insight into what you’re passionate about, which is what I look for when hiring."

For the Investors:

* [The bipartisan infrastructure bill's framework](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/) agreed upon in Washington yesterday explicitly sets aside $7.5b for Electric busses (scroll 2/3 way down to see the allocation table).
* PTRA is not some 2025+ until revenue ""company."" They're building and selling electric busses all over the country right now. [Miami](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proterra-miami-dade-county-announce-120000467.html), [Maryland](https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/MDPGC/bulletins/2a5ae3d), [1000 busses through 2020](https://www.proterra.com/press-release/proterra-celebrates-1000-buses-sold/), before many catalysts occurring this year.
* Backing from Washington.
   * The Secretary of Energy - Jennifer Granholm - was [previously on the board of directors](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/27/politics/jennifer-granholm-proterra-stock/index.html) of Proterra before surrendering the position to take her position in the administration.
   * Before the reverse merger, on the [board of Arclight](https://arclightclean.com/our-team/) was the co-founder of lobbyist Clean Energy for Biden (now Clean Energy for America), Audrey Lee.
   * Biden recently took a video conference tour of the factory. I won't link it here because auto-mod kills posts with links to certain video websites to protect against grifters. Easy to find with a simple search though. 
* As crowded as the EV space is, there just isn't solid US-based competition keeping them from seizing the moment. [This article](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/5-electric-bus-makers-shifting-next-gear) does well to show the competition, which is all EU/CN-based. Over and over, the Sec of Energy and President himself have stressed they want US-based companies to reap the fiscal initiatives. They are a E-bus company, not passenger vehicles. They're not wasting capital trying to edge out TSLA, F, GM, VW, etc. They know their niche, they are the main player in it, and it's about to get big fiscal tailwinds for this.
   * Municipalities aren't just buying this to show how ""green"" they are. EV busses promise to dramatically reduce preventative and corrective maintenance over the lifetime. If the Feds are fiscally rewarding you for making this switch, why wouldn't they go this route over renewing ICE busses 100% on their own dime?
* The odd pump-and-dump you see from a few months ago was when it was a S\*AC at the height of those pump-and-dumps, and it entered into an agreement with Proterra (it's no longer a S\*AC). The wheat is separating from the chaff among those companies now.

Now for the short-term opportunist crowd:

* Short Interest is hard to tell from [Ortex](https://www.ortex.com/symbol/Nasdaq/PTRA/short_interest) this early in the new ticker's life, but:
   * 99.80% utilization
   * [iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/PTRA) shows a measly 1,000 shares available to borrow at. . .
   * 86.8% cost to borrow. Lenders want serious interest on something they feel is at risk to squeeze.

6/25/2021 11:19,stocks,"VG is targeting suborbital human flight. VG's feathering reentry only works because the spacecraft is suborbital (it isn't traveling at orbital velocities). Like their launch system, their reentry system does not scale to orbital human space flight. This is one of their greatest weakness. If VG decides to try to compete in orbital human flight, they'll have start from scratch.

SpaceX is already doing orbital flight and and they are looking beyond that. Blue Origin's orbit rocket New Glenn, is building on their suborbital rocket New Shepard. VG isn't a competitor in orbital flight. 


The market for suborbital flight is limited by the future success of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and others. If they are successful in reducing the cost to orbit, then VG's market dries up.

I'm a fan of VG, and wish them luck. I even bought some shares early on. I sold those shares and I'm happy with my profit. But betting of VG long term as a launch provider is betting against SpaceX. And that's not a good bet.

>there still using rockets and fighting the atmosphere on re-entry

Let me also comment of this misconception. Traditional reentry does not fight the atmosphere. Instead it deliberately uses it to slow down. Orbital flight requires velocities around 17,000 MPH. And the traditional reentry uses the atmosphere as a break to shed most of the orbital velocity."
6/25/2021 11:37,stocks,Nonsense- VG isn't even leaving the atmosphere or getting close to orbital speed in the first place.

I know there is an argument for suborbital point-to-point executive business travel, which VG has talked about in the past. But this is a niche part of the airline market. Worse, the argument for this travel dissolves when you consider that the passengers have to undergo several days of training before the flight.


It also looks like VG is pivoting away from this market. When you look at their recent investor presentations, they don't mention it at all. Instead they describe their target market as 1) private astronauts 2) microgravity research, and 3) astronaut training."

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"$SKYT - Skywater Technology - American semiconductor foundries with short and medium term catalysts upcoming for starters: this is only the second time I've done a DD like this, and I welcome criticism if you have any. I'm not a financial advisor, I'm like many of you, a redditor who got too interested in the markets while I've been working from home. 

Allow me to introduce you to an American semiconductor company that's poised to do very well in the short and medium terms. Skywater Technology is a Minnesota-based foundry that helps companies develop prototypes for highly specialized semiconductors. They're currently opening a second facility in Florida to expand production and capabilities. They also build radiation-resistant semiconductors for the Department of Defense, aerospace, and automotive sectors. While it was established in the early 90s, it only IPO'd a few months ago, so this is a stable, solid company with an established client based that's poised to grow as semiconductor demand increases.

I'm not going to get into balance sheets or earnings reports or anything like that, because they mostly don't matter for the catalysts I'm talking about, and we only have two from this year since they IPO'd. If you want earnings or income or whatever, look elsewhere: they're still negative. That looks to change as their second facility comes online in Florida, but like I said, it doesn't matter for most of the information below.

The stock has increased significantly since it IPO'd near $14. It's currently sitting closer to $30. It has a number of very short term and medium term catalysts that will propel the stock to new highs, but first let me explain:

* One of the reasons it has had such an increase in price is because it has a very low float, about 7.5 million shares, and most of its investors know that there's nothing but up for this company, so they never sell. (The short-term catalyst is based on this knowledge.) 
* Another note is that this is not a short squeeze, because nobody shorts this company because it's absolutely suicide. The stock only goes up. It's %short is less than 2% of float.

#Short-term: Russel 3000 today.

[The Russell has announced that $SKYT will be included in the Russell 3000 later today.](https://www.skywatertechnology.com/press-releases/skywater-technology-set-to-join-russell-3000-index/) This is the first time this stock has been indexed, and as such the index will be forced to buy shares. With a low float and a small shareholder base comprised of buy-and-hold investors, this volume will cause a spike in the price. 

#Medium-term: Semiconductor funding

The US federal government has been working on a bill to secure American semiconductor manufacturing. Skywater is wholly based in the US, with a foundry in Minnesota and another about to open up in Florida. It's a key provider for radiation-resistant chips for the Department of Defense, and might be the only company able to fulfill some of those contracts. At a market cap of 1.2 billion, it's very likely to receive the most money from this bill by market cap of any company. [Shortly before the Senate agreed on their version of the bill, the senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar, as well as their US Representative Dean Phillips toured the plant.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005861/en/SkyWater-Hosts-Senator-Amy-Klobuchar-and-Representative-Dean-Phillips) This company is on Congress's radar. They're getting a nice piece of the pie.

#Another catalyst of questionable term

Another factor is that Skywater does not trade options. This is likely due to the relatively low volume of the stock. The above catalysts could propel the volume high enough for options trading. If options start being traded, volume will further increase. Volume is $SKYT best friend, and if you're a $SKYT investor, it's your best friend too.

positions: 531 shares with an average cost basis around $27. Will add today if it drops below $30 again but I don't think it will.

6/25/2021 13:36,stocks,I've been holding SPCE since last year. It seemed about as close to a sure bet as you can get in the stock market that the price of Virgin Galactic was going to be higher on the day that Richard Branson had his flight than it was when I was buying it in the teens with no hype. And likely much higher. I just had to be patient and wait for them to finish testing.
6/25/2021 13:50,stocks,In flight entertainment systems bought to you by GME!
6/25/2021 16:18,stocks,RIP those guys lol
6/25/2021 16:31,stocks,"Hey, does anyone think this will keep rising ? Me & my friend are a little lost, we both made quite alot on this stock overnight, we both went in at $32 and got about 50 shares each, but it's hard to determine to sell or just keep grinding a little bit. What are your thoughts anyone ?"
6/25/2021 9:31,stocks,"Way to hold and have conviction. my cost average was $22, and I got scared off during the big tip into $16 with the flight delays and institutional fear (ie. Chamath and Cathie dumping shares). I was a dummy and I should have remained more diligent and patient. SPCE is very speculative, and I didn't adhere to my principles of letting speculative investments run.

Great work man!"
6/25/2021 11:20,stocks,"I thought I was smart for getting in and out at $32 and $54. Figured I could get in again closer to actual action from them. Pretty exciting news, although I wish I had bought in again one last time before literal rockets taking off."

6/25/2021 15:41,stocks,"Nice - I didn't go all in, but I've been in at around $19 for a few months now. I ALMOST sold when things were looking really bad, but I'm so glad I didn't."

How many $200,000 tickets are they really going to sell? It’s wonderful that Virgin and SpaceX are pushing the boundaries of space travel but it’s not going anywhere until we make fundamental advancements in propulsion technology. Don’t get me wrong, the reuse is an absolute must, but without major advancements in  propulsion, it just isn’t viable commercially."
6/25/2021 12:01,stocks,That's my entry point
6/25/2021 19:41,stocks,Yeah they will not survive one disaster.  At those altitudes there is no way of survival.   I know the ticket is probably bullet proof from lawsuits with the waivers.

I see a lot of posts here, that the current environment isn't a bubble like the dot com, because we don't have companies with little or low revenue trading at ridicolous prices. SPCE and AMC prove that we do."

Amazing images and videos will roll in and the regular wealthy people will eventually get on board too.

Thing is I never realistically considered that I myself would be able to do this, but people in the middle-class are going to start seeing that it might be possible if just once in their lifetimes and the appeal will be strong."

6/25/2021 12:04,stocks,"This was why I decided to just hold long term. I did some estimate. Assuming stocks like spac in 2 years quadruples (I am already at 250%) and pay 15% capital gain tax, if I was to do short term investment and pay 30% capital gain, I would need to sell at 100% gain at least 3 times to match my long term goal. I know I am not good with timing my trades especially since I work full time so I hold for long term growth.  Also I realized over the years, once I sold and cut the umbilical cord, I am less likely to invest in the same stock soon or if I do, it would be a small portion of my gain and not my original pot and therefore I would miss out on major gains.  Understand my own psychology helped me find peace in my investment decisions regardless of the outcome."

6/25/2021 12:01,stocks,Wowza!
6/25/2021 16:15,stocks,"Sorry to be a pedantic ass, but being in space isn't what causes weightlessness. This is a sub-orbital flight that reaches the edge of the atmosphere, but the weightless sensation is caused by a lack of acceleration as the craft travels along an extended arc in a near vacuum. Its the same as that sinking feeling you get when you drive over a small hill quickly, except on a much larger scale. It has to do with the vector they are traveling, not so much where it's happening. You can actually experience weightlessness on a jet airplane that goes into a dive at terminal velocity. That's how they shot the weightless scenes in the movie Apollo 13."
6/25/2021 11:10,stocks,"My original plan was to hold for 2-5 years and sell weekly calls. I think I will sell 300 shares today if it hits $60, just to get my original investment back ($18,000 + the calls I’ve already sold). The rest will be gravy."
6/25/2021 11:03,stocks,I am so glad I didn’t sell my weekly SPCE calls the last couple of weeks due to being out of town.
6/25/2021 12:50,stocks,"I guess my justification for speculative is that they're entering a market that doesn't exist. So its TAM and use cases are highly subjective. There is no space tourism market, so its hard to judge how many people with an extra $250k would be able to spend money to go up to the outer edges of space on a rocket plane.

But beyond that, their rocket plane technology could potentially adapt and change so that it targets high value business customers to travel across the world in a couple of hours rather than a full day. If they get that, I could see super rich traveling from London to Shanghai in 2 hours using rocket planes run by Virgin Galactic.

There's still a huge question mark over their engine usage. As I understand, their rockets aren't reusuable. Maybe they're betting on future technology to solve that. But thats also what makes it speculative.

But you're right, a sound business plan is better than really speculative companies like operate in the pennystock world."

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,First time buyer questions So how does stock worth grow? For instance I know there's a lot of interest in Sony just as an example. Would it be profitable to start investing while there's so much buzz around the company and their Playstation 5 model. Does stock grow by interest or by buying stocks? Is it both?
6/25/2021 7:34,stocks,"There’s two things to consider. Stock price and company value. Company value grows by increasing revenue, increasing margin/lowering cost and becoming more profitable. Sell more stuff, take in more revenue, grow the business. Typically, this growth reflects in the share price. However, a stocks price is really based purely on demand. A popular stock can sky rocket in price for seemingly no reason, imagined reasons, expectations of the future or anything else. If lots of people are buying the stock, the price will go up. But this can be dangerous since if there is not real value to justify the stock price, it could also drop very quickly also for seemingly no reason. In that case the price is based purely on sentiment, which is fickle.

I would be very careful as a new investor taking a plunge into buying single stocks without doing research and making sure you understand the business and the value you are buying"
6/25/2021 7:32,stocks,"Both. When there’s interest in a stock, people buy it. Stocks grow when more people want to buy the stock rather than sell it"
6/25/2021 8:15,stocks,"If u only go for company value, for a LT horizon, it keeps you logical & removes all emotion. You’re way less likely to get ‘caught up’. 

And always buy the numbers not the news. It’s more boring but much safer"
6/25/2021 9:18,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

&#x200B;

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you). You can see example entries here: https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uySEqjQE.png

&#x200B;

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:

a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock

b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."
6/25/2021 9:37,stocks,"On the PS5 part of the comment. Anything that is happening currently to the company will likely have already priced in. So when there was a rumor that a new PS5 was being planned the stock rose then. For the stock market PS5 is already old news. Unless there is a sudden shocking news for better or worse about the PS5(like PS5 suddenly combusts and causes house fires), what happens to it will likely not effect the price of sony. So if you are buying now based on the PS part of sony then you'll likely be waiting for the rumors of the PS6, which is going to take a while I'd imagine(I'm not into consoles so I'm not too sure on how old PS5 is).

Edit: For first timers I would recommend you try paper trading first before you jump into real trading. Paper trading is just simulated trading where you are trading with fake money with real data. I would do at least a year of that and once you feel comfortable and knowledgeable jump in to the real market.

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"What happens to Amazon stocks if they split the company into separate businesses (eg. Retail and AWS) Considering taking a position in Amazon as I think it's undervalued (that's a story for another post...)  
My concern is what would happen if Amazon was forced to split, such that AWS became a separate company. I'm investing largely for the growth prospects of AWS."
6/25/2021 6:47,stocks,"AMZN shareholders would be issued shares of any businesses that are spun off, and the price per share of of the original AMZN shares would adjust accordingly."
6/25/2021 8:52,stocks,"Then you would receive shares from all of the new companies. If this does happen, I wouldn't worry about it too much. After all, take a look at Standard Oil breaking up, it turned Rockefeller into a billionaire."

6/25/2021 6:46,stocks,If that happens you'll receive AWS stocks equivalent to your holdings in AMZN
6/25/2021 7:11,stocks,You'll have a few stocks in your portfolio...which gives you a choice .   You may want to transfer it all to one business. Like aws etc. Whichever is valued the best
6/25/2021 18:03,stocks,"A while back one of the Jeffries analysts was on TV and asked about the risk of tech breakups. His reasoning was that it would actually be a net benefit, as the tech units withing a lot of these bigger names would be valued quite high on their own. So don't view it as a risk to your investment."
6/25/2021 14:10,stocks,"I wouldn’t be concerned with it. Lawmakers do these things for campaign reasons, they have no idea in practice how to actually split up a company like Amazon. Also everything Amazon does between its platforms is in benefit of the customer, which antitrust is supposed to protect. Amazon dominates its competitors because customers choose its products and services - that’s called capitalism. 

There’s no basis for this BS jokingly (and comically fast) making its way through Washington. Good luck actually breaking up Amazon into Marketplace, AWS, Pharmacy, Grocery, Streaming, Logistics, Ads…."
6/25/2021 14:03,stocks,"I think that it would actually be a good thing. We would get shares of both Retail and AWS, and I think that the stocks for both of those would do better than they are with them combined as one. I think that being combined as one is limiting their potential.

I don't think it is likely to happen though. If any of the Big Tech companies would be forced to split their businesses, I think that Google would be the most likely one to be forced to split first."
6/25/2021 10:06,stocks,"You'll get shares of both. That said, I don't see Amazon having to sell off AWS. That would be bad for consumers and that's what anti-trust law is all about."

While voluntary rather than forced, eBay spinning off PayPal surely enriched all. Can't help thinking AMZN spinning off AWS would do likewise.

6/25/2021 19:47,stocks,"Right so abolish all store brands then? Amazon is far from the only company employing that strategy. At the end of the day, customers are clearly fine with it. If your business relies on an easily replicable, minimal IP protected product sold on Amazon’s marketplace, and Amazon offers a cheaper version that customers will buy instead…? Well, you never had much of a business. Bezos built the whole company on the premise that he doesn’t give a shit about margin if it means he can capture market share, unlike almost all other financially (narrow) minded business owners."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

6/25/2021 5:49,stocks,"I think weeks like this are a good example of why trying to time the market is a fools errand for most people.  How many people sold between June 14th and 21st when the Nasdaq looked like it may have triple-topped, only to be left in the dust this week.  

You never really know which week or month or day it's going to rip.  Having a bit of cash to buy a dip on a stock you like can be a good thing, but trying to sell the top and buy back in is going to cost a lot in gains over time.

Do proper DD and invest in good companies.  Have patience and buy them on support levels, and average down if that support breaks down.  Don't sell for measly gains just because you think you can time it."

6/25/2021 9:56,stocks,NIO was named the more promising growth company in China
6/25/2021 12:10,stocks,"Retail as a whole is doing really well right now. I think traders and investors are responding to really good consumer spending data that we're seeing.

AEO (American Eagle) up 15% in one week, on really good indicators that people are going to spending for work, summer and back to school.

Their Aerie line is firing on all cylinders. 80% yoy growth. 150% plus e-commerce growth. I've said this before, but I really think they can **overtake Victoria's Secret for number one in the women's underwear, swim and lingerie category in 5-7 years.** In addition, their OFFL/NE athleisure spin-off is a legitimate value alternative to Lululemon and Athleta, and I expect it to grow at the same pace as Target's All in Motion line. I know for a fact from girlfriends that their bike shorts are selling really well. I love the branding, sounds a little like OFF-WHITE, but I'm cool with that. Also love their tag line ""Built for real motion"" which is a direct bullseye shot at Target's line.

We are entering the first jeans supercycle we've seen in 20 years, as skinnies have dominated the landscape since we bought that first Strokes CD in 2001, and yoga pants have dominated the last 5-7 years. Time to clear out your old wardrobes, and replace those skinnies with the relaxed styles we saw from the late 1970s through the late 90s. I seel AEO as really well positioned here, as we are in the beginning stages of this cycle, and we still don't really know what type of style will dominate. Flares? High waisted ""mom"" styles? Mid 90s wide legs? Late 90s boot cuts? Relaxed Levis 501 styles? Fortunately, AEO has styles in all of these categories.

Valuation wise, retail as a whole is good, with the category lagging the entire S&P in forward P/E and FCF yield, as they have really really been hit hard over the past five years due to the pandemic and the closing of malls. Only Oil and Gas as a broad-based category has been hit harder. Those who transition the fastest to e-commerce in this beaten down category will win. Fortunately, Shopify now makes it really really easy for most retailers to pivot quickly.

Valuation wise, among the sector, AEO has a lower forward P/E than peers Abercrombie and Fitch, Levis, L Brands, Lulu, GAP. They also have had better e-commerce execution than all of them with exception of Lulu.

850M cash on hand, a 100% increase from 2020, with 330M in long term debt, a 50% decline from 2020. 282M ttm free cash flow against a 5.8B enterprise value (EV/fcf of 20, which I think is low for a company with a growth machine like Aerie). Pretty good financials.

Stores, which are still mainly located in enclosed malls, will be a drag, but continued closing of underperforming/low foot traffic stores, opening of new leases in multi-use urban or urban-adjacent outdoor ""malls"" or high streets (you know, the places that have an Apple store), and shifting to a asset-light e-commerce model servicing suburb/exurb/rural areas will help them overcome this.

Leadership wise, CEO/Chairman Schottenstein is a good financial guardian and head, but the real secret sauce comes from Chief Creative Officer Jennifer Foyle, who's a real superstar. Expect her to be considered for the CEO role if Aerie can execute to the highest levels and become the largest intimates brand in the US.

I have a significant position in American Eagle started early Jun and this is my back of envelope 10 minute to type rationale. You can look back at my post history for the exact genesis of this idea and start of my position."

Based on the data I’ve seen, the fool stock advisor and Morningstar ratings have produced good results over the last 20 or so years, so it’s weird to see them so diametrically opposed to each other. 

Is it possible Morningstar ratings are very DCF based whereas Motley Fool is focusing more on promising future developments due to the business model? I’ve noticed a lot of the fool picks are stocks that would be considered overvalued using past profit and cash flow growth."

(J) has come a long way from the days of its large exposure to the oil and gas sector to becoming a government stalwart in aerospace, defense, and security projects based on ESG principles. Its total addressable market for high value projects continues to grow as it wins new contracts for nuclear and water projects that will transform future cities into more sustainable versions of themselves. An upcoming potential $2T bipartisan infrastructure bill could be the cherry on top for this company already making regular new 52-week highs.

Interesting take from an analyst. Essentially the guy is arguing that engineering firms like J will be beneficiaries of green bill, new space race, ESG push and smart cities. I suppose makes sense as all those things will have to be built by someone.

> 25% of Jacobs' Critical Mission Solutions revenue comes from space solutions for NASA as well as the Department of Defense. With a Total U.S. government Addressable Market of ~$20B a year, space budgets could expand rapidly in the coming years as pioneers like SpaceX's (SPACE) Elon Musk, Blue Origin's (BORGN) Jeff Bezos and Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. (SPCE) Richard Branson push space initiatives at breakneck speeds forcing NASA and other government agencies to spend heavily to keep up with the latest breakthroughs.

####Please let me know if you have suggestions to make this roundup better for /r/stocks or if there are other subreddits that you think I should post in. I can search for posts based off keywords in the title, URL and flair. And I can also find the top comments overall or in specific threads."
6/25/2021 10:23,stocks,"The way the bond market moves can play a role with stocks but I thought we went over it not being about ""oh it's up some"" or ""oh it's down some"" most of the time. It's more about the speed of the moves (and if it moves fast, everything can get torched).

PS: Too many people are looking for TNX to end up at 2%. So, that's not going to happen. Not this year, anyway."
6/25/2021 16:48,stocks,"Alright so let’s say you had $1000 to invest in rn, what would you buy?"
6/25/2021 9:38,stocks,Amazon going down again.  Back to $3200 we go.  Stock just can’t do anything at all.
6/25/2021 10:28,stocks,Anyone getting into the grove ipo?
6/25/2021 12:42,stocks,[deleted]
6/25/2021 17:08,stocks,Needed a week like this. Just a Yellen away from perfect.
6/25/2021 17:25,stocks,Is there a tool or site that lets you chart institutional ownership % in a stock vs other stock parameters?
6/25/2021 17:48,stocks,Any thoughts on RIG a crude oil play. Oil’s cycle is reversing. Largest offshore oil rig company. Super cheap at the moment. Has some long term debt. 6 months to 1 year play.
6/25/2021 18:06,stocks,Anyone know when the Crop Acreage report comes out?
6/25/2021 18:26,stocks,Just what the fuck is going on with ASAN for the past few weeks?
6/25/2021 13:29,stocks,This is way more silent compared to another subreddit. Is NIKE pop temporary? Crazy that $0.93/share earnings on a $140+ stock is considered good. Does it have so much potential? looks like a boomer company to me.
6/25/2021 10:04,stocks,"10 yr treasury note going up, I would get out of growth/green/tech. Everybody about to dump that shit."
6/25/2021 16:20,stocks,"lol the algos pumped Express today  
  
to distract from the movie stock"
6/25/2021 10:09,stocks,I have a feeling we’re losing a week’s gain today
6/25/2021 17:02,stocks,"You’re given $10K. You have to buy shares of ONE company. You get to keep everything ONLY IF it increases 10x in 5 years. What do you buy?

If your pick doesn’t go up 10x in 5 years, you lose everything and get nothing."
6/25/2021 10:36,stocks,"BB rant: 

I like how after earnings the [post-]market's sentimentality to bad EPS but imo good news was positive (SP rising), But now that the market's open it's a fire sale down -6%."
6/25/2021 12:32,stocks,[deleted]
6/25/2021 13:26,stocks,"TNX really breaking out now. Up 70 bps since this morning. If this thing hits 2 I have no idea what happens. Adding to SQQQ calls because they’re cheap, but tech seems to be ignoring it for now"
6/25/2021 10:38,stocks,[deleted]
6/25/2021 14:59,stocks,"Hopefuly Oil gets to 76 - 77 before july 4th next week. Im up 19% just for this week, hopefuly it gets to 10% or more next week."
6/25/2021 15:47,stocks,[deleted]
6/25/2021 5:58,stocks,Entirely agree this is what I have learnt as well. Luckily I held through everything at one point I was 20% down now I am 9% up
6/25/2021 7:01,stocks,"I actually went all in on growth and tech in that week because I was fine betting on Powell. I thought the months before that were overspeculating and overcorrecting tech, and so far it has worked like a charm. Only stock I traded that I miss now was my one Nike share, but it was just one."
6/25/2021 5:52,stocks,perspective is powerful
6/25/2021 10:17,stocks,"mmmmmm depends what you're invested in.  It's hard to time the indices in my opinion but not individual stocks.  For example, I sold LEG and JPM near the peaks and then bought them back.  They keep moving in the same sort of patterns so it didn't take much analysis to know they'd drop hard when they hit $57 and $165, because it always happens.  And those were 10% drops, they fell harder than the market in general."
6/25/2021 16:42,stocks,"Cheers!

Today sure was interesting!"
6/25/2021 8:28,stocks,"Up 19% premarket now. I've been watching my shares bleed out for months, but kept trying to catch the knife. I guess I grabbed the handle afterall."
6/25/2021 19:57,stocks,Sold mine last week. Shoot me.
6/25/2021 16:54,stocks,Love to see it. I’m just waiting on the ant IPO and hopefully we’ll see a rise. It will happen eventually but I honestly thought we’d have more clarity by this point
6/25/2021 8:09,stocks,luckily I bought at 230 before going to 210
6/25/2021 13:39,stocks,"I enjoy my women in aerie items, hence why I bought some awhile ago.

Invest in what you enjoy/ know! Haha"
6/25/2021 13:01,stocks,"Followed you into some TAP shares & calls which worked well (some of which were up stupid big last month), and AEO shares as of last week so a nice bump.

If you don't mind me asking, what did you pay for 35C JAN2023? I'm looking that far out and even OTM looks very expensive to me."
6/25/2021 16:24,stocks,Yeah BABA and JD doing well these days
6/25/2021 16:16,stocks,I managed to average down to 217 so I’m finally green this week. Look like JD is also hot.

6/25/2021 12:38,stocks,I’ve been eyeing this one and finally decided to jump in today at $19.01.
6/25/2021 15:48,stocks,"I've been wondering the same thing, of course it drops 10% the day after I buy shares..."
6/25/2021 10:17,stocks,"I'm not complaining, but also not getting my hopes up. It's pattern for the past 6 months is fall 30 points, climb 20, fall 30, climb 20...."
6/25/2021 12:19,stocks,If you want to sell then do it. I’ll take your shares. No amount of FUD and regulation is going to take down that giant.
6/25/2021 12:23,stocks,"So … sell close to the bottom? To buy what?

From a risk / reward point of view, among the stocks that get talked on Reddit, I think BABA is one of the safest to hold now."
6/25/2021 12:04,stocks,"If you’re willing to hold for 5 years and assume there are no catastrophic events in that period it could give 100% return but there are many risks: Chinese company, geopolitical risks etc."
6/25/2021 11:24,stocks,All the FUD in the world has been priced in
6/25/2021 11:16,stocks,I'm wondering this too. Gonna keep a very close eye towards eod
6/25/2021 11:00,stocks,I think all BABA holders are in a similar boat. I like the company but just seems like you’re not going to get the same returns with gyna stocks
6/25/2021 15:55,stocks,I just unloaded half…
6/25/2021 16:07,stocks,Went from up half a percent to down a fifth to up a tenth to close. At least everything I bought today ended green.
6/25/2021 7:13,stocks,Because all of those ratings are mostly bogus. Don’t waste your time looking at those.
6/25/2021 10:10,stocks,"The Motley Fool offers stock picks that benefit the HF, not readers."
6/25/2021 14:32,stocks,How long are you on baba?

6/25/2021 15:45,stocks,"GOOG is the only one getting buybacks so it's trading at a bit of a premium.

also the majority owners hold the majority of the votes regardless so the voting right shares aren't in as high a demand as you would think."
6/25/2021 15:44,stocks,google only buy's back class c shares 'artificially' inflating price.
6/25/2021 16:00,stocks,it was 2700 a year ago.
6/25/2021 16:27,stocks,Profit taking
6/25/2021 16:21,stocks,Sometimes prices dump at close so HFs can attempt to make AH and premarket prices look appealing when it goes back up. That’s my theory anyway.
6/25/2021 9:00,stocks,Is it a buy right now ? Is it really going up or just another hype.
6/25/2021 8:59,stocks,"Green is good.

6/25/2021 7:21,stocks,"Not seeing anything specific.  Just a bunch of ""should I buy PSFE"" articles and hedge fund interest in past 48 hours."
6/25/2021 7:41,stocks,"Look at WSB, they’re on it"
6/25/2021 9:46,stocks,"They point to decline at least until 2023 or 2024. Intel is relatively ok in the notebook market for the moment, but a dumpster fire across most of the rest of the business (automotive and telecommunications excepting) and with TSMC's node development cadence I expect their competitiveness in notebooks to disappear within a year or two also.

If Intel can get their 7nm node scaled up before TSMC scales their 3nm node then they have a chance, but nothing I've seen from them (or ASML's order book) tells me that'll be the case. If it isn't I'd wait until Intel sells or spins off their foundries before buying because that's where they're headed in the longer-run at this rate."
6/25/2021 9:56,stocks,"My personal view with $INTC is the same as my view as the overall market. Barring any black swans or other major events, I see is staying in a consolidation zone through the summer. Once vacations are over and school starts back, I see us having a bull market through the end of the year. For $INTC, I see $55 to $58 as being the zone. I added to my position the other day, but will hold off adding more till it bounces and comes back down or has a strong break of $58."
6/25/2021 10:22,stocks,"Their new process node isn't going to be ready for a while. I'll go in big at some point, but I think the excitement of the new CEO will wear off over the next 6 months due to the lack of any exciting news. 

Intel basically has to succeed long-term or a ton of security-sensitive US tech will be hit hard."
6/25/2021 9:40,stocks,The answer is buy AMD
6/25/2021 9:50,stocks,Buying any dip on banks earlier this week was the right move
6/25/2021 10:24,stocks,If only I bought more than 4 shares
6/25/2021 10:36,stocks,Let's break $10 today! 51k OI on the 7/16 12C's. Just insane.

6/25/2021 18:57,stocks,"UWMC is a wild ticker, so a quick trader could make gains if they're good/lucky.


I'm not that trader though, and I look for quality.  The best of breed company by far is Rocket (RKT). Vastly superior management and leadership.  Number one in every metric where they compete, except for wholesale, where they're taking share from UWMC.   Huge customer satisfaction, enormous revenues and profits.  The founder is creating the American Dream in places like Michigan and Ohio.  The company itself contains multiple companies within, several of which would be meme stock darlings if they were spun off on their own.  They have their own version of DOCUsign.  They have their own financial AI.  They just the run the business very smart.  

So what's the problem?  The ownership structure means the public trading float is small and has thus been ripe for all kinds of manipulation.  The ticker is also doubly cursed: the traditional market views it as a WSB meme stock, so they don't respect it, while the WSB meme crowd views it as a possible pump play, so they hate it too.  It's massively misunderstood as people mistakenly think it's a lender, not a fintech.

Meanwhile it just grinds on, reporting jaw dropping excellent numbers that never get reflected in the share price.  

UWMC's mattress salesman-style CEO is always talking garbage on RKT in fairly obvious envy.  

UWMC does have a lower multiple, which is tempting.  But as fears of a real estate/mortgage contraction continue to swirl, if there is some kind of industry turmoil ahead, I'd much rather own best of breed who can weather it best and emerge stronger."

Now maybe it pulls back just a little but the index that's generally driven both since that 10% correction ended months ago (which is not the one that is generally shown) is fine above 13.8-13.9k. It'd be below that where it could get in trouble.

6/25/2021 14:22,stocks,"It's closest to post-war 1950s, the Boomer generation, in terms of the combination of low risk free rates, discount window, federal funds rate, and low inflation, and almost deflationary effects on things like consumer packaged goods and transportation. Today, inflation is held in check by deflationary pressures as a result of technology and the mobile/e-commerce revolution, and by globalisation.

It's not perfect, but it's the closest you'll get.

Labor force participation was higher back then by the pure numbers, but I'm not sure that's accurate because I don't think they really counted people of color back then, of which the rate was extremely high due to systematic racism. My theory is that its similar today, with a higher rate of whites out of the labor force compared to the 50s.

The 1950s was also a time of rapidly fomenting civil strife, as a result of markedly visible inequality (between the increasingly wealthy whites and blacks) which came to a head in the 1960s era. We are seeing similar things happening today........

Much of the inequality can be seen via white flight during this era, in which whites bought homes in tony suburban areas, that then increased rapidly in worth, while blacks continued to rent in the city, unable to afford housing.

Again, we are seeing the same thing today, but the difference isn't urban/suburban/black/white, but its 1st tier cities/decaying cities. The black/white problem also still remains......"

If you're a traditional buy and hold investor, and you're looking for just a tad more volatility in your overall portfolio, in a low volatility environment, consider adding a small position in one of those meme names.

Also, lots of funds are going full barbell. So in a portfolio that's like 50% bonds, another 50% spread in high risk/high reward plays may actually get you similar returns with less risk than a traditional 80/20 portfolio. The big action in the bond market earlier this year makes me think that a lot of this is going on. We've seen a recent flattening of the yield curve in the past week, so you may see some unwinding of the barbell strategy in coming weeks, and a slowdown in ""meme"" action as a result..........."

6/25/2021 12:39,stocks,That’s not a good thing.  The fact that support has remained at $3k is a disaster.  It has now hit $3500 5-6 times in 11 months and each time it drops hard within a couple of days.  I have no doubt that it will happen again.  That’s a terrible sign.  That’s just too much of a drop too often.  Won’t sniff $4k.

6/25/2021 12:05,stocks,"Ok cool, that was pretty much my thought process too. I wasn’t super concerned, especially since the NFT fad has been slowly fading anyway. I figure people who bought in because of that have been slowly selling off over the last month or so, and today was the kicker.

I think Funko played the NFT thing really well. During their earnings call, they were very clear that they were going to take it as slow as they needed to. Not including it in their guidance was a great decision. Price target is still $30 in my eyes, however long that may take."

6/25/2021 10:12,stocks,"They didn't crush earnings, they were expected to earn 51 cents but earned 93 cents - do you know how many companies did that last season?  They also ""doubled"" sales but only if you compare to the trough of covid lockdowns.

Nike stock is in a bubble (P/e > 40 for an established company that isn't growing much despite the verbal gymnastics the media does).

The truth is, it's just a stock that the financial media likes to hype for no good reason.

Again, if you think 93 cents earnings on a $150 stock is ""crushing it"" then I got a bridge to sell you"
6/25/2021 10:03,stocks,"Nike has been like that for decades now. I don't get it and never will, but they're a cultural icon in a lot of places."

Most people (yes, also not vaccinated ones) can't wait to fly away this Summer, it's June and the industry is already preparing for high season in July and August, it's going to be nuts. 

But concerning airlines I think that they're down because intercontinental travel still isn't a thing really and A LOT of exotic destinations (most of Asia, Australia, South America, Africa...) are still struggling with COVID. Especially, UAL that is focused on long-distance routes is hurting because of this."

6/25/2021 13:46,stocks,"They're predicting higher freight costs in the 2nd half of the year and more recently an analyst downgraded them due to an assumption of higher inflation hurting their margins.

I'm interested in DLTR since I think they're very close to fully turning around Family Dollar and they're making moves to boost margins and sales via Dollar Tree Plus and combo stores. 

Most of that should be finishing up or accelerating over the next couple of years, so basically any analysis that isn't at least 2-3 years out isn't useful to me."

When government spending plans are both frequent and insanely large, there will be wild speculations and rebalancing in the market will be relentless. Earnings mean less and what the government want matters more. 

If you watch Cathie wood’s videos few months ago, she already said the pre Biden aggressive growth stocks will likely face the most volatility because Dems’ policies will lead to valuation reset due to increasing taxes, inflation and least likely to receive government support. She still believes growth strategies will do best in the long run, if situation really becomes real bad they can still move out and be successful somewhere else."
6/25/2021 12:29,stocks,"I’m a newer investor so take with grain of salt but my rough understand is no, for a couple reasons. 

Housing bubble was caused at least in part to the massive growing debt amongst borrowers/consumers.. here you have lots of people with cash in hand and debt at an extreme low (lots of ppl paid off during pandemic i heard) but housing shortage due to demand and rising material costs. Also that led to a recession whereas we’re entering reopening and we know shits gonna be booming.

Dot com bubble despite the unprecedented growth you had a lot of companies and IPOs with crazy valuations but a lot of them with no earnings or net losses.

6/25/2021 12:43,stocks,"You realize it has done nothing in about a year, right?  That’s not an exaggeration.  It has done nothing.  It has done this 6% climb 5 other times in 11 months, only to retreat all the way back down.  It is about 20-25% below the price targets that were set 10 months ago.  It’s no where near it.  It’s already a failure this year, because it has missed that mark by such a large margin.  The worst mega cap to own in the last year, and it’s not even close."

Sure you will find some minor issues, like an infotainment that could be better.

But then you look at Tesla and their build quality, FSD lies, shitty assistance. If one accepts that, he has no standing to be critical of others.

Edit:
See also how Tesla can’t get some basics right still, like automatic windscreen wipers that work, and has a cruise control is often rated below VW and others for being jerky. Or how won’t offer some fairly common options like a HUD, or Apple/Android auto. Or a decent variety of cars to choose from."

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,Amd / Nvidia stocks. I bought AMD stock but also thinking about buying Nvidia. I went with amd because (simplified explanation) the much lower price felt there was more chance at a greater gain. The company CPUs and graphics are highly rated gamers and tech use of them on the rise. With Nvidia I wasn't sure if i'd make a large gain as quickly and the amount of stock in comparison to amd I could comfortably buy. Also very new to stocks been reading and studying them only for 2-3 months so please don't be to harsh trying to setup a decent retirement fund. Being an artist we usually don't have a retirement.
6/25/2021 8:39,stocks,"I have held both for years and intend to hold them for a long time. I prefer AMD at the moment due to valuation, pending xilinx merger, and constantly improving tech - it’s a fun company to watch. I think their ARM based chip could generate quite a bit of buzz when they announce more details. AMD is making waves in the server chip business. 

NVDA is awesome and has more of a moat and specific strategy. If they somehow acquire ARM, they are on the road to 1000 sp. Their ARM based server chip has me interested.

tldr; I am long both and TSM"
6/25/2021 8:33,stocks,"I was always fearful of nvidia being overvalued and kept missing out on buying. It just keeps growing! What a company! (My broker in Denmark doesn’t offer buying a fraction so never really been in a position to buy anything meaningful) 

But I hold EQQQ etf so I have exposure to nvidia 😊"
6/25/2021 5:57,stocks,Smh etf
6/25/2021 5:02,stocks,"I’m also relatively new so take what I say with a grain of salt. There certainly isn’t anything wrong with owning 2 similar stocks. Keep in mind that as they are similar, often times they trade together, meaning they will rise and fall somewhat together. If there is bad chip news they both fall. If it were me I would look at different sectors unless you are already well diversified.

Lastly the share price of a stock doesn’t matter. So 1 share of Amazon compared to 35 shares of apple are simply  around 3500 of each company respectively. the share amount is inconsequential and don’t let share price turn you away from what you want to invest in(unless your trading BRK:)"
6/25/2021 5:01,stocks,"There are as many strategies to purchasing as there are investors and speculators. You may want to diversify beyond the sector or buy an administered fund targeting the broader sector as opposed to targeting individual stocks. And of course, as you sound like your strategy is disciplined investment as opposed to speculation, have the discipline to hold long term and dollar average into those stocks you decide to purchase. You will find that this disciplined attitude and time in the market will benefit you greater over the long run than trying to pick short term winners or timing the market. I’d suggest Benjamin Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” as a good starting read, and Jesse Livermore’s “How to Trade In Stocks.”"
6/25/2021 5:42,stocks,"I held both for two years while I watched NVIDIA grow and AMD try to grow..  Eventually I pulled from AMD and put that on NVIDIA as well.  Don’t read into this and think AMD isn’t a good buy, it is and I will be getting back in ASAP because I look for them to make some moves soon.  NVIDIA is definitely pricey but IMHO, this things going to be a beast, forever.  There is a 4 to 1 stock split coming July 20 for NVIDIA.  Price per share will be more reasonable, that’s your opportunity.  With AI and deep machine learning (necessary for automated vehicles) exploding in the future, NVIDIA GPUs are going to be worth more than their weight in gold.  This article I read the other day only solidified my stance.  Tesla Unveils Top AV Training Supercomputer Powered by NVIDIA A100 GPUs

https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/06/22/tesla-av-training-supercomputer-nvidia-a100-gpus/

So my advice would be hold for now and wait for the NVIDIA split, grab some NVIDIA and make sure to hang onto some of your AMD."
6/25/2021 9:05,stocks,AMD a better bargain rn but price aside both companies are fantastic
6/25/2021 5:26,stocks,I was thinking of doing this as well. Is AMD and NVIDIA a good buy at the current price? If so which one or should I buy both?
6/25/2021 5:52,stocks,"AMD has done a lot of great things lately to increase revenue in existing markets but if you dig deep you should find that NVDA is expanding their tech into new markets that should reap 10x to 100x TAM over the next decade.  Their management vision is unparalleled.  I'll choose NVDA 100% of the time, especially for a long term retirement asset.  Good luck."
6/25/2021 17:44,stocks,"Both good, probably NVDA better short term, but that hopefully doesn't matter. ASML and AMAT are good tangential picks too."
6/25/2021 18:00,stocks,The price of the stock being a low or high number shouldn’t factor in to your decision.

6/25/2021 6:49,stocks,True. Unless your broker doesn't allow purchasing fractional shares.
6/25/2021 5:36,stocks,So i did buy this long term in the sense that 2-5 yrs is long term depending on its value and activite. Also bought some smaller lower costing stock just get a better grasp on when to sell and buy just incase I lose out I won't lose large amounts. Also purchased $MRIN just on the chance I get lucky on it. I'm trying a few things out but trying to be smart about it. Thanks.

This really doesn't matter if you have a broker that lets you buy fractional shares."
6/25/2021 9:22,stocks,"Call me crazy, but I don't agree with your NVIDIA advice. Unless you think it will drop significantly in valuation post split, you should be buying now. 

Although the price will be cheaper post split, you will likely be buying at an ATH, so if you can afford it and plan on holding, the sooner the better. Unless once again you are going to wait it out for a bit post split in hopes it comes crashing down a bit. 

But saying buy just because it is a cheaper price doesn't really make sense unless you can't physically cant afford one share right now."
6/25/2021 5:59,stocks,Thank you.
6/25/2021 5:38,stocks,I went with amd because the cost was much lower thought there was more room for a greater gain at lower risk of losing a larger amount of money I put into it.

Nothing wrong with speculation, but it serves a different purpose than long term retirement planning. Look for proven winners and, if you can, purchase those breaking out or above long term trend. Looking at AAPL, ULTA, BG, NVIDIA, and FNV right now for end of month purchasing, V, FUBO, and KR also on my watch list."

6/25/2021 9:31,stocks,"Yes you can buy fractional shares but is the 4:1 stock split going to be available to those with fractional shares?   Has the company confirmed this?  Or will the fractional shareholders be paid off in cash because they are a nuisance - bookkeeping wise?

Reason for asking is when one company buys out another any fractional shares are turned into cash and the cash returned to the now former stockholder."
6/25/2021 9:28,stocks,"And that’s the impression I got from the OP.  He wanted in but it was too expensive for him at the moment.

6/25/2021 12:27,stocks,"Share price does not matter, buying a 1k stock is the same as buying 10x $100 stock. At the moment AMD is a better bargain in terms of evaluation as NVDA already rallied."
6/25/2021 11:38,stocks,Thanks picked up 2 shares all I could buy at the moment.
6/25/2021 6:25,stocks,OP this is good advice. Heed the advice this person has given.
6/25/2021 13:19,stocks,I’m not sure the answer to that one.
6/25/2021 8:28,stocks,Thank you.
6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"How do you come up with your valuation for an individual stock? Everyone has their own tricks for coming up with how much a stock is worth. When doing your DD what do you do to determine the actual dollar value you’re willing to bet a stock goes up to? Obviously it doesn't always work, but what do you use to figure out your best guess?"

6/24/2021 23:02,stocks,My theory is this it doesn't matter what you think or know or how you interpret news. It matters how the majority of people do. I could find what I think to be a very undervalued stock and it could be true but it won't matter unless a lot of people feel the same.
6/24/2021 22:53,stocks,Look at the number of searches of '<symbol> short squeeze' on Google. Add $1 to current stock price for each search hit and multiply by outstanding shares.
6/25/2021 0:03,stocks,"I’ll let you in on a little secret, most people just pull it out of their ass."
6/24/2021 22:02,stocks,"You asking a million dollar question!! I really hope you get an answer. But I doubt it. In all honesty, there are so many variables so there's no one way to calculate value. 

Marko at Whiteboard Finance has a great video on how to read data on Finviz (I've found it useful for learning about EPS and projected EPS, debt, etc.) I'd definitely start there. PE ratio is an okay starter indicator (e.g., ""only buy stocks at or below a PE of 20!"") But you'll see that many strong companies blow that rule out of the water. 

Aswath Damodaran has a pretty good tutorial on YouTube. But again, it's not straightforward. You have to look at financials, balance sheet, and read analyses to make an educated guess at what a company should be worth!!"
6/24/2021 22:42,stocks,"Excellent question!  To set the stage, I only use what follows on companies that have a track record of growing sales and revenues over a long period.  I also like companies that do not have a habit of increasing the share count by more than 1-2% annually as this could throw off EPS projections and market multiples having a meaningful impact.   


I will look at historical data for 5, 10, and 15 year intervals (if available) for revenue, net income, shareholders equity, shares outstanding, etc.  I compute the CAGR for each 5 year period and for the total run.  If the growth rates differ, I look for and note the reasons. Once I have the CAGR rates on hand, I look at the prospects of the current and likely future environment to figure out whether the rates are likely to continue, drop, or improve.  I then use my growth rate assumptions to project the future 5 and 10 year potential figures for revenue, net  income, shares outstanding (to calculate EPS), etc. 

I then look for data on the historical P/E trends for the stock, use the low and the middle of the range-- assuming the highs might not return-- and then multiply things to project possible price targets/ranges based on different P/E levels. 

THEN, I discount that future target(s) back to the present using two rates, and just a straight calculation using current/target prices and the time duration. The first rate is the current 10yr + 2% to allow for comparison vs alternatives (adding the extra percent to allow for possible FED rate increases over the period, with the idea that anything over a 2% increase is going to cause market problems and a reversal of policy).  The second rate is the rate of return that I would demand over the next 10 years.  This is typically 12%.  Last, I calculate the CAGR on the current price heading to my target price.

From all of this, I know what prices I believe the stock could reach based as well as (1) the price I should pay/wait for now to get a return equivalent to putting my money into bonds in a few installments, (2) the price to pay to get my desired rate of return until the target price, and (3) the rate I will get if the stock hits my target bit I just go ahead and pay today's price."

6/25/2021 1:09,stocks,"I actually don't. I operate off of sector comps and growth narratives to determine if I think something is undervalued or overvalued.

Maybe that's a dumb thing to do, but it has worked out well so far and most of my big regrets in regard to investing have come as a result of analysis paralysis.

To be clear I do rely on a certain amount of expertise and niche/obscure data for the relevant companies and industries, so it's a SWAG rather than a WAG, but there's still a large element of guesswork and luck involved."
6/25/2021 1:40,stocks,"I don't have a mathematical model, I look at competitor valuation, general product and tech understanding, potential of growth in current environments. I then only pick 1 company that's winning their segment of their industry. Worked out pretty well so far."
6/25/2021 5:35,stocks,"Look at their revenue in relation to their market cap. YoY growth rate PE ratio etc. Also Look at other similar companies in the industry. One example is NVDA, it’s now considered overvalued because it’s PE ratio is 3 times the average of PE comparing to similar semi companies."

6/25/2021 2:30,stocks,"No one says they use their gut? That's my #1 criteria; what price would I feel comfortable, warm, fuzzy feelings owning this at? Very, very little fits that bill for me right now! Investing is right out for me at this stage of my game.

But maybe I want to jump in and ride gains now or perhaps soon? At that point one could use any sort of fundamental analysis to come up with yet another number they may or may not be comfortable with. Is it becoming more expensive and likely to keep becoming more expensive? Ok, well obviously others with more money than me think its worth more than it currently is, so maybe I'll buy now if everything looks acceptable on the DD front?

As for how far I think it'll go, I used to have a system based on rough fibonacci ratios based off various trends and previous price data, and successfully used it for swing trades until I got popped for PDT. By the time I was off the market had changed off easy mode and I had forgotten how to swing so that didn't work well for me anymore. Currently my theory for swing trade exits is to use rough TA lines to select points where I take some profit, set the orders, and stick to the plan. Nothing fancy, as long as it consistently works I'm good and I can fine tune later when I'm ready to start working more hands-on with the quant setup I'm working on."

6/24/2021 22:56,stocks,"I like to use revenue projections, and then use price ratio trends for the company and its industry. A top down approach considering more than just the specific company can tell you a lot about where it’s headed.

6/24/2021 23:16,stocks,Look at past growth and valuation metrics of a company compared to their competitors. Try to project how they will do going forward.
6/24/2021 23:25,stocks,"Depends on the play. 

Long term whatever it's most successful competitor is if it has potential to become market leader. But generally eyeballing somewhere in between. 

Short term with no change in fundamentals just whatever the TA shows as significant resistance. 

Unicorns such as short squeezes I don't set a target. 

But in all circumstances these are just rough indicators. Always ride the trend and pay attention to the news. And just develope a gut feeling too. For example if I'm lucky enough to land on a pump and dump I'm selling that shit just before market close whatever the price is."
6/25/2021 2:43,stocks,Ehh it depends on what industry and what type of company it is? For high growth rate companies i tend to use DFCF . For mature companies i can used the divident discount models. If im lazy i will just check the multiples of similar companies and make my valuations based on that.
6/25/2021 4:22,stocks,"I look at some of the ratios, although in the current market scenario, I'm not sure if they work. I also look at charts for breakouts"
6/25/2021 8:09,stocks,"First, make a projection of the revenues/profits for a company for the next 3-10 years.

Then, for a profitable company, look at the current P/E ratio and make an estimate of what P/E ratio you find reasonable in the future based on the growth and other factors. For an unprofitable growth company, look at the P/S value and make an estimate for reasonable P/S ratios in the future (this is less accurate, which is why investing in unprofitable companies is more risky).

Next, use the future P/E or P/S ratios to calculate a price target."

There are a number of different key things to look at, but I find that having them side by side for a list of stocks adds a bit of perspective that is easily lost with the more tedious task of looking them up one at a time.

One of the values that often is available, but not always, is Price / Book. Seeing that number range from less than one to double digits has me realizing just how much bullshit there is to thinking one can be purely analytical about valuations.

This is a fairly new thing for me, but I have noticed that the opinion I form by looking at such numbers would have kept me from buying the stinkers I now own. And the ones I am doing well with look even better when using this comparative analysis.

When i like a stock and i've done DDs, if i can't find validation by anyone on my list of respectable great investors i pass.        
    
Which makes me unable to have lots of stock, which is actually what Charlie Munger encourage, which is actually make me richer every year since 15years. Im not smart enough to do valuation, and most of people who does it are actually just pulling future numbers out of their ass. I sheep the ones who always did it right for decades. I bought Canadian National Railway for cheaper than Gates paid (before me) long ago, i'm totally fine with my disabilities. Most of the time SEC/13F reports comes too late and the stock went up a lot by the time you know it, sometimes it didn't!

Beyond that, I just look for companies that have a lot of growth potential given technologies they're developing (e.g. MRNA), markets they're expanding into (e.g. TCEHY), or a known supply shortage that I expect that they will ultimately satisfy (e.g. TSM)."

You have to make assumptions for cost of debt and cost of equity, typically your cost of debt would be the historical interest rate payed by the company and cost of equity can be calculated by taking the risk free rate (such as a government bond) + market risk premium (you can get country risk premium by searching demodaran market risk premium online) * Beta (calculated based on comparable companies - a sector which moves with the market will have a beta of 1, a sector not prone to market fluctuations (i.e. supermarkets) would have a beta < 1 and sectors that will fluctuate more i.e. luxury cars will have a beta > 1.

This post is specific to these 2 companies as I am about to contact investor relations but I figured as nearly 3 million are members someone may share other ideas.

So just a tiny bit of background. I also wrote a post on HMPT and LDI a few weeks ago, however it hasnt done anything to these stocks... These are both mortgage companies that are cash cows, but were crushed 2nd week of May right after RKT missed earnings. RKT is the market leader. Before RKT report HMPT was under 1% short and LDI was maybe 7-8%... I say this because I believe the whole sector was attacked immediately after a small miss on RKT. RKT was always heavily shorted since its IPO..... The only thing is RKT and UWMC have recovered HMPT and LDI have not!

LDI has given a 200 million special dividend 62 cents a share and declared a regular 8 cent dividend a quarter..... I guess those dont matter as its near an all time low?

HMPT hasnt done anything just yet but they made 150 million last quarter alone!! Are set to make 300 million this year, and the company is 900 million market cap and heavy short. LDI is under 4 billion and set to make nearly 1 billion. they both have amazing cash flows and enough to pay all bills... and do a serious share buyback....

My question is, should they do another special dividend? a buyback? go private? Pay people on social media to garner interest on the stocks?

I am ready to make a pitch to investor relations. I figured a pitch with a brainstorm of ideas would be better! 

Thoughts please share"

Margin is indeed charged monthly, and tabulated daily, to determine a monthly average.

The components of that average are **your margin balance each day at the close of after-hours**, i.e. 8PM EST.

This means that if you open margin in PM, and close it in the AH, **you are charged nothing**.

Weekends are indeed charged as two extra days.

This ninth film in the *Fast & Furious* franchise was originally slated to open over Memorial Day weekend in 2020 until COVID-19 muffled those plans. The studio took the long-view and pushed the film into 2021 and eventually settled on this final June weekend for its release as part of a staggered global rollout that began with China’s launch in May.

Box Office Pro says: ""there’s little doubt that *F9* is in the best position of any film since the pandemic began as the next — and perhaps biggest yet — blockbuster release.""

After **F9**'s $136 million May 2021 debut in China exceeded *Hobbs & Shaw*‘s $94.9 million back in August 2019, and its $6.7 million opening   weekend  in Australia (good for exhibitor Reading Int'l $RDI who is one  of the largest exhibitors in Aus/NZ in addition to presence in US) also   bested that spin-off’s local start of $4.9 million, Box OfficePro   forecasts opening  weekend North America domestic revenue at **$60 – 80 million.** Check out their total forecast and Pros & Cons influencing these numbers in the following article:

>EPS of 93 cents on revenue of $12.3 billion, up 96%. North American sales shot up 141% to $5.4 billion. Europe, Middle East and Africa sales jumped 107% excluding currency changes to $3 billion. Asia Pacific & Latin America sales surged 76% to $1.46 billion.

>Greater China sales grew 9% to $1.9 billion. China called for a boycott of Western goods after Nike and others accused Chinese officials of using forced labor in the cotton industry.

>While most Nike stores are now open, digital purchases have fueled sales throughout the pandemic. Nike Brand Digital revenue jumped 41% in Q4 after soaring 147% in 2019. Online sales surged 59% in Q3, after accelerating to 84% growth in Q2 from 82% in Q1.

>Pivotal Research Group analyst Mitch Kummetz said in a June 21 note that favorable U.S. market conditions likely drove higher-than-expected direct to consumer penetration. Strong full-price sell-through on lean channel inventory may have also boosted profits.

>""We're very bullish on the company's North American performance for the quarter,"" Kummetz said. The report adds that Pivotal's May Footwear Survey indicates that ""even as U.S. consumers are now buying a wider range of footwear, they continue to buy shoes to get outdoors (for a run, walk or hike), which is right in NKE's sweet spot.""

>Kummetz has a buy rating on Nike stock with a price target of 167.

I disagree with this being a ""boycott."" This is actually the Chinese government taking actions against Australia with a trade embargo. These actually do work. This is the same as a Trump tarrif on China. As far as I know, there's no official CCP stance regarding any form of embargo against Nike.

>I believe Tesla are in a precarious position being in China and sharing their trade secrets to competitors like Nio. It's only a matter of time before those decisions turn around and bite them in the ass..

Possibly but as long Biden and future admin block Chinese EVs into America, I think Tesla (and F, GM, etc) can still strive. Next step would be to form a collation with EU to block the sales of Chinese EVs. But I think that might be too late because I believe NIO will be deliverying to Norway this year."

* AMZN: 29.9%

**5-Year EBITDA CAGR:**

**5-Year Net Income CAGR:**

* AMZN: 87.3% 
* MSFT: 39.8% 
* GOOG: 24.7% 
* AAPL: 8.5%

And no, this is not skewed by an outlier 2020 for AMZN - it has continually outpaced YoY on each metric, with no indication of slowing down as marketplace continues to benefit from e-commerce adoption and international expansion, and its highly profitable non-marketplace segments continue their hyper growth trajectories.

Amazon is nearing $500b in annual revenue and is still significantly outpacing the other big tech companies in growing the top line, and it’s blowing them out of the water on growing the bottom line. All while dumping almost $100b into R&D and capex and hiring half a million people in the last year.

What other company can boast a business model as expansive, yet still innovative and high growth as Amazon? It has an increasingly diversified and cohesive platform, and all of its segments are category leaders (e-commerce, AWS, gaming/video streaming) or emerging major players (logistics, ads, pharmacy, grocery) in massive addressable markets. Most important, it’s not afraid expand into completely new markets, unlike its mega-cap counterparts.

In my opinion, it’s only a matter of time until Amazon is the highest market cap of the bunch, and frankly I’m not sure how it isn’t already (antitrust be damned - I’ll gladly dump 100% of my portfolio into AWS in any breakup, as if that will ever happen).

6/24/2021 20:04,stocks,Somewhat off topic but I think Amazon would go even higher if they split 10 or even 20 for one. Initially you might get some sell offs as people see it as an easy way to get some cash and still keep a decent stake in Amazon. Smart buyers will wait a few weeks and then jump in with a decent chunk of money.
6/24/2021 21:48,stocks,"It’s truly remarkable what they have built. Yet people somehow still don’t see it in my opinion. AWS and Ads are complete cash printers with huge growth runways that can fund continued market share capture in marketplace, pharmacy, grocery, and streaming.

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"Work from home index? Some companies seem to be more reluctant than others to keep work from home going in a post covid world.  Lots of workers, including myself, view work from home as a perk and would prioritize a company that offered it over one that didn't. 

Where I'm going with this is that in the near future is that any company that offers work from home will have a bigger/better talent pool to choose from while hiring and might see some better numbers. 

A **ROUGH** list of some of these companies is: 

Amazon

United health

Humana

Dell

PayPal

Shopify

Spotify

American Express

Nationwide Insurance

Kelly Services

Microsoft

This is just me doing like 5 minutes of googleing after a shower thought, so if you all have some further thoughts I'm all ears."
6/24/2021 22:15,stocks,It’s a perk that’ll hurt you unless you own the company. Most companies are bringing people back to the office or a hybrid. I guarantee that those in the office will get the raises and promotions while those who aren’t will get screwed. Most will be back in the office very soon.
6/24/2021 20:42,stocks,"I bought UPWK last year because I figured a decent amount of work-from-home people would end up being fired and outsourced. 

It's a solid company but extremely expensive. I don't know if I would buy at these prices but I'm not selling either."
6/24/2021 21:19,stocks,"I can understand all of these except for American Express. I wouldn’t label it as a “work from home” stock. I’d call it an evenly rounded stock. People will always use credit cards regardless of the economic situation, and Amex benefits from that."

6/24/2021 23:18,stocks,"The only thing I will say to that point is this, speaking for myself (and possibly a few friends, family, and coworkers) if I were offered two otherwise equal jobs and only one of them had any form of WFH accommodations post covid I would be willing to overlook up to a $5k difference in salary to take the job that allowed flexibility to work where I wanted when I wanted.  In other words the promotions aren't that important because I would advance by switching companies and the salary is something I (and potentially others) am willing to trade for work from home.

Just my two cents and all that.  I'm not gonna go all in on something this play, but I might fiddle around with some dicking around money and see what it does."
6/24/2021 23:00,stocks,"Agree. I also wonder if most of the best people really want to work from home all the time anyway; I think what most people really want is the ability to work from home when they actually need to without being hassled about it. Most of my coworkers come in 4-5 days per week even though my company only technically requires 2 now. 

I’m sure opinions vary though, and it’s also region dependent (if you live 15 minutes from work like I do it’s different than 75 minutes on NYC buses and subways each way)

The other question that needs to be asked is if getting marginally better employees would actually make a noticeable difference for a large-scale company even if the theory is true"
6/24/2021 22:03,stocks,">a decent amount of work-from-home people would end up being fired and outsourced.

Except if this were true, it would've happened before COVID anyway. There are reasons why jobs aren't outsourced, it's because the companies that it gets outsourced to generally suck."
6/24/2021 23:10,stocks,"Thats a fair point, in the long run their business model/revenue stream isn't gonna be effected a ton by higher ups allowing employees to work from home.  I did notice a lot of these were concentrated in tech and insurance so I figured some diversification was good though."
6/25/2021 0:50,stocks,What exactly is your point?  The whole market is priced post-pandemic.  So unless you're suggesting no one ever buy another stock after covid then I'd have to ask you to elaborate how it affects this specifically.  You're better off buying and holding than trying to time things perfectly.
6/25/2021 0:40,stocks,Shit only 5k? Most people spend 5k on commuting to and from the office alone.
6/24/2021 23:14,stocks,"I don't have a ton of hard data to back this up, just anecdotal evidence which is that myself and more than a handful of others in my office would like to keep some form of work from home going whenever the company decides this is all over.

Looking solely at it's chart history(ewww I know), it has had several times where after a rapid drop of about 25-30%, it proceeded to bounce back 30-40%. I've been wondering when the next bounce back might be, if there is one at all, and it might be next week. Again this is just from looking at charts.

It may not bounce for a few reasons. IPO lockup ended, shares have diluted and they are projecting much less revenue next year than they are this year, all of which seem to be baked into it's somewhat cheap price right now(close to an ATL). I don't think ABCL is undervalued, or overvalued for that matter. I'm just looking for some feedback as to whether or not tomorrow might be a good time to buy and have a potential major rally next week of up to 40-50%. Thoughts?"

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"Pandemic related market trends Heyo /r/stocks

The purpose of this post is to create discussion about which plays to make based on current and predicted macro market trends.  Obviously right now the world is coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to vaccination.  This is currently the trend I'd like to focus on.

A good example to start with is the cruising industry.  Royal Caribbean was at a pre-pandemic all time high of $133 per share, meanwhile it dropped to as low as $23 per share during the pandemic and has since recovered to $87 per share - still well below its pre-pandemic level.  Cruise lines have recently been reopening.  Some are facing further delays.  But it appears to me that a stock like Royal Caribbean could be a potential investment.  The market will stabilize eventually and its possible RC or Carnival are currently undervalued.

I'd like to hear from other users as to which markets they think were most affected by the pandemic and which will have high potential for recovery/growth as the economy begins to normalize."

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 24, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)
* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. 
* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. 
* **\*\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* Apple (AAPL) target raised by Morgan Stanley from $161 to $162 at Overweight. Stock currently around $133
* Accenture (ACN) target raised by Stifel Nicolaus from $305 to $342 at Buy. Stock currently around $292
* Enbridge (ENB) target raised by Wells Fargo from $51 to $53 at Overweight. Stock currently around $40
* Equinix (EQIX) with a host (8) of super bullish price target increases. Very interesting to see. Average price target $888 at Buy. Stock currently around $779
* KeyCorp (KEY) target raised by Wells Fargo from $32 to $34 at Overweight. Stock currently around $21
* Eli Lilly (LLY) with two target raises. Stock currently around $232.
   * Cantor Fitzgerald from $245 to $300 at Overweight
   * Cowen from $235 to $250 at Outperform
* Roku (ROKU) target raised by Macquarie from $400 to $485 at Outperform. Stock currently around $423
* Valero Energy (VLO) target raised by Wells Fargo from $99 to $102 at Overweight. Stock currently around $82

I can't expect them to keep up with that type of culture in the sales department. Plus, the entire cybersecurity industry is heavily commoditized now. People are way too optimistic on Crowdstrike, but what makes them different than other cybersecurity companies that were huge? Symantec and McAfee owned this space for years, but what about Trend Micro, Kaspersky, Palo Alto Networks, FireEye, ForeScout, Fortinet, etc. Crowdstrike competes against these vendors. What makes Crowdstrike's products better than theirs that their customers will want to stay for years? Newflash: they won't, because the whole space will continue to see vendors lose customers, the space will see now companies get started every damn year (new vendors would show up to RSA Conference every fucking year), so what's Crowdstrike's UVP?

This is to be included in the ‘22 model of the XC90. Looks like this is for highway driving only and utilizes sensor fusion (LiDAR, cameras, radar). Volvo is claiming this will be an “eyes off, hands off, brain off” autonomous system. They (Volvo) are also willing to take full liability for accidents that occur while the system is enabled.

This uses Luminar’s Sentinel system which Luminar is claiming is a full-stack autonomous solution for self-driving vehicles. This combines Luminar’s sensors with Zenseact’s OnePilot. 

It looks like this model has been delayed a few times (apparently it was scheduled to be available to customers late 2021), but it looks like Volvo is saying it will be available next year.

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"Using historical PE Ratio data, QQQ is nowhere near ""tech bubble"" territory like it was in 2000. TLDR: QQQ current PE ratio is mid 30s, in March 2000 it was 190. QQQ might be overvalued, but it's hard to make the case that it is in a bubble.

I have heard people say that the Nasdaq and technology in general is in a bubble. While you can certainly make a case that it is overvalued, there are some key differences to the tech/dotcom dubble of 2000 that would make it unfair to say that we are that those levels. 

There are definitely tech stocks that show similarities to the stocks that were responsible for 2000 tech crash, such as little to no earnings, pe ratios at 100, 500, or even 1000. But the tech sector and QQQ, which is overweight in tech, is not showing these bubble like characteristics as a whole. Most of these companies are large or mega cap companies with years of solid growth and profitability. Yes, they could very well be overvalued, but investing in overvalued companies or sectors is still reasonable if you buy and hold into them with a long time horizon, while dollar cost averaging. 

The current PE ratio of QQQ is somewhere in the mid 30s. The historical PE ratio of QQQ in March 2000 was 190."

It's not as bad but  I think this is the closest we've been by far since the dot com bubble popped.
6/25/2021 0:24,stocks,"Just because we're not on the same level as the tech bubble where many stock went down close to 99% doesn't mean that we're not in a bubble where a bust would cause a 50% crash. Another issue is, that the top 10 weights of the nasdaq is making close to 50% weight of the index. So it is entirely possible, that the below top 10 companies have a massive crash without affecting the nasdaq so much, if the top holdings are doing well. (So to say a invisible crash) 

Besides that, it seems that the current market condition is more a general bubble than a only tech bubble, e.g.  Buffet Indicator is already higher than at the peak of the tech bubble and many non tech stocks have also high prices."
6/24/2021 22:36,stocks,TQQQ all the way then!!!
6/25/2021 12:18,stocks,"Agree. Tech has largely grown due to earnings growth which was way different than 2000. If you look at a chart comparing tech market cap to tech earnings growth, they’re in step. In 2000, tech market cap exploded while earnings did not so you could plainly see a “bubble” between cap growth and earnings growth. Price to free cash flow is another metric that is hovering around long term averages, while late 90’s/early 2000’s & 2007 was about 2.5-3 standard deviations above LT averages. 

PE’s will compress but it’s likely that they do so with earnings growth. Even if earnings underwhelm and there’s a decline, it’s likely to be more of a 10-20% thing and not a 50-75% bubble burst."
6/24/2021 21:13,stocks,"We'll probably have a nice dip this year, I'm looking forward to buying.  We're not overpriced though considering money expansion.   If money printing continues then I expect tech to soak it up since the equipment expense is so low.

US is at risk of following Japan into a stagflation scenario, but I think the Fed is afraid of letting the stock market reset since so many Americans rely on 401ks for retirement.  

Most likely result is small dips get supported,  interest rates are kept low,  money inflation stays high for as long as possible. And that could be much longer than most of us think.  This will keep QQQ on an upward trajectory and create a secular PE  expansion cycle where 50 pe ratio becomes the new average."
6/25/2021 14:21,stocks,"I'd argue that current p/e ratios are going to be higher than the historical past. Companies now expected to have a global presence which means larger TAMs, more young people are getting into investing, free stock trading which allows anyone to access the markets, and digital advertising makes us aware of business that we never would have known about before."
6/25/2021 8:29,stocks,Only difference is that bears are wrong 9 out of every 10 years. So the real smart ones aren’t bulls or bears but those who regularly buy and hold regardless of what bulls and bears say
6/25/2021 0:34,stocks,always a good idea to assume railroad companies and tech monopolies should have similar PE ratios. A very compelling argument indeed
6/24/2021 21:28,stocks,You can’t compare the market a hundred years ago with the market today; there’s so much more money in the market compared to historically and tax rates are also no where close.
6/25/2021 19:10,stocks,"If you think we’re in a bubble, short QQQ and post it here. Talk is cheap. Put $ where your mouth is."
6/24/2021 21:32,stocks,"Yes, but the Nasdaq 100 index was created in the mid 80s, and QQQ has only been around for about 2 decades, unlike the S and P 500 which as been around much longer. And QQQ also contains more tech and growth stocks, which tend to trade at higher multiples than SPY."
6/24/2021 21:27,stocks,"I went on a few online investment websites and just looked at the research for QQQ. If you go to Robinhood (or really any brokerage website) it should give you some basic stats about a security such as the PE. On Robinhood, it says the QQQ pe ratio is about 37 or 38 last I checked."
6/24/2021 21:34,stocks,"You have a good point, but I think it is also important to look at the top holdings of QQQ now, compared to 2000. A lot of the newer tech companies that don't have earnings are not anywhere near the top positions in QQQ. Back in 2000 the troublemaker stocks were a much higher weight in the index."
6/25/2021 15:18,stocks,"All of that, sure, and more importantly, interest rates have been dropping for 40 years now. You can no longer park money in a savings account or a bond and earn 5-6% a year."
6/24/2021 20:24,stocks,That’s exactly what I was thinking
6/25/2021 12:22,stocks,"Agree. I always read articles “Joe, the investment manager who called the tech bubble and 08 decline, issues a warning the market’s in bubble territory.” It’s not hard to find that “Joe” releases a monthly warning over a 20 year period to get press coverage to either explain why his fund is underperforming or attract investors into their fund."
6/25/2021 14:46,stocks,Well yes. Because railroad companies have a solid moat and lots of cash where as lots of tech fails regularly
6/24/2021 21:38,stocks,Completely correct. They fed has to remove eight trillion from their balance sheet which will in turn decimate the market anyway.
6/25/2021 2:15,stocks,According to my German broker QQQs PE is at 42. Robinhood might be using the Shiller PE?
6/24/2021 21:48,stocks,"Actually just found a pretty good article that makes almost the exact comparison I was talking about. And, no, we're not close to dot com valuations. Most sectors are still about half what they were in the dot com bubble.

https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2020/11/03/dot-com-redux-is-this-tech-bubble-different/

But, keep in mind, dot com bubble was really the biggest modern day bubble of all time. It dropped by 75% in the subsequent 2 years. 

We don't have to get to all-time highs to get a major market correction. Say 30% to, in a bad scenario 50%. That is, we're at half the dot com bubble valuations so we  get half the correction. Which would still be major. 

There are a lot of eerie similarities between the dot com bubble and now. Like IPOs happening left and right. The Spac craze where you have companies with no revenues, and made up future projected revenues based on nothing but speculation, getting crazy market valuations. There are definitely dot com like bubbles in some sectors of the market. I agree though it's not as proliferative as the dot com bubble."

However, inflation is affected way more significantly by velocity of money and what actual layer of the economy it hits and where it sticks (I.e. if it accumulates in one sector or echelon over another - a good example of this is wealth inequality). 

It’s also important to understand the difference between CPI/PPI inflation and asset inflation.

You create a new energy savings program, people spend to upgrade, they save money, you created jobs, very simple. These plans take years to work but they always work if left alone.

You upgrade the system so you can have the option to go significantly faster.

As far as your 'train takes 2x as long"".. not really.
Currently trains can go nearly 400mph. Not to mention new technology that could significantly improve such speeds while increasing efficiency (think hyperloop types of ideas, reducing air resistance etc).

Commercial airline cruising, and this significantly depends on distance, altitude, traffic, plane, etc., is 400-500mph. Not far off from already proven train speeds /systems.

Add on showing up to airport 2hrs early, TSA BS, boarding and delays, taxiing (people have literally sat on planes taxiing for hours - my brother just did a few days ago going from orlando, then they had to refuel because they wasted too much), luggage bullshit is handled better on trains if not entirely by yourself and no bologna weight limits.. there's a lot that adds up with plane travel and while some things will exist anywhere (weather pauses everything).. there's significantly more bs with planes.

Oh and trains are roooomy not crammed into a tuna can next to crying babies and the dude that showers once a month.

Many countries use highspeed trains effectively for both business and pleasure schedules. But the US is probably WAY too dumb to get it right anyway.. we do still have useless security facade that is the TSA - as someone who lived with a tsa agent a few years back; they fail their 'spot checks' allllll the time.

No but you probably should lose the rose colored glasses. The world speed record for high speed rail is about ~350mph. Though most sits a lot closer to 200mph. And airliners cruise about 500mph. 

High speed rail makes a lot of sense in certain scenarios and it makes absolutely zero sense for the majority of America. It is expensive as hell to build and maintain that infrastructure, and the fact is the passenger loads just won't justify it in most places (like where I live, the empty midwest).

Doesn't mean it won't happen though. We are building highspeed rail in the US, just where it makes sense to like large population centers in California, and around DC and other dense east coast areas.

6/25/2021 0:00,stocks,"$WUGI ETF is a great opportunity to Invest on time in the 5G Technology and Semiconductor Industry.  **$WUGI 5G Technology ETF**

 WUGI is an actively-managed ETF, been holding for a month with nice gains that dont appear to slow down.  

We agree that 5G will empower the next generation of technology that will  rise the global digital economy. 

5G is not a light-switch; it is an evolution. They invest in that long-term growth with adjusting allocations  dynamically as the 5G cycle evolves. 

There 5G assumptions are based on 4 Pillars.. 

1.  **Semis are the nucleus of 5G**:  Every existing device and every facet of the 5G cycle must be upgraded with new semiconductor technology to run faster and smarter, while being more energy-efficient. 5G will require a massive expansion of semiconductor content.  **Because everything needs a Semi now! From your cellphone to your washing machines, Cars, Smart Homes, Drones. Heaviest investment sector of this ETF, companies like $AMD $TSMC $NVDA $QCOM.**
2.  **Cloud giants push into Edge Computing**:   Edge Computing and 5G are interlinked technologies as both are poised to significantly improve the performance of applications (faster speed) and enable huge amounts of data to be processed in real-time (low latency). Applications running on edge locations demand lower latency and reduced bandwidth. **FAAMG stocks come into play here and are VERY important.**
3.  **Cloud-native software to manage data**:  5G will result in a massive amount of new data. The ability to continuously filter and process this new data in real-time will be critical. A new generation of database platforms, big data analytics, and agile software development tools are emerging to help individuals and businesses build digital experiences. **$NVDA and its Datacenter come to play, $NET, $TWLO, $AMZN AWS. The growth will not slow down.** 
4.  **Enabling Technologies**:  When all 5G building blocks are in place, the potential big winners will likely be the enabling technologies (think of Instagram and Netflix in the 4G cycle), giving rise to a wave of new 5G business applications, devices, and services. **Companies like $SE with huge gaming plataforms, as the cycle evolves there will be clearer players here.**

**% Top 10 Holdings**: Sea Ltd 7.98%  NVIDIA Corp 7.97%  AMD 7.94% Meituan Dianping 5.85% Marvell Technology Group Ltd 5.44% Qualcomm Inc 5.26%  Bilibili Inc 4.32%  Taiwan Semiconductors 4.09% Google 4.05% Microsoft Corp 3.70% 

**% Top Industry Group**: Software 36.14% Internet 22.27% Commercial Services 3.84% Computers 0.97% 

Hope this helps!

Good Luck!"

Whats going on??

Example 1: Today, $RSLS shows:

Market cap = 19M on Webull & TDA, but 40M on Finviz & Trading View. 

Shares Out. = 3.3M on Webull AND Finviz

Free Float = 3.2M on Webull, but 0.52M on Finviz, and 6M on Trading View

% Short of Float = 21% on Webull but 52% on Finviz

How are they so far off with very little fluctuation in price today??

For comparison, Today, $AAPL shows exact same data for everything across all platforms.

It makes it all very confusing to know which to go off of, any help appreciated!"

Vinco Ventures Inc.'s shares were under pressure Thursday after the buyer of digital media and content technologies said it would spin off its Emmersive Entertainment operation as a standalone traded company.

In morning trading, the stock was 8.3% lower at $4.38, eating into a rally in 2021.

Vinco said the transaction for Emmersive Entertainment would be conducted in the third quarter, with shareholders gaining an equity stake in the separated company. Emmersive Entertainment would be led by current Vinco Strategy Chief Brian McFadden, it said.

The company, which late last year closed the sale of its SRM Entertainment Ltd. subsidiary, in January agreed to merge with content and distribution company ZASH Global Media & Entertainment Corp."

6/24/2021 21:36,stocks,"I've gotten a couple of investment ideas from Bloomberg Businessweek Magazine. Back in August 2018 they had an article about a company called Cardlytics (CDLX) that reminded me of Facebook and Google. I bought it at $18.69 per share. Less than 3 years later it is trading at $127.49 per share! Best annualized percentage return I have ever had, by a lot.

Back in February Bloomberg Businessweek mentioned another company called Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited (HPGSF). I bought it at $1.65 per share; since then it paid a dividend of $0.018 per share and it is currently trading at $1.72.

HPGSF buys up the rights to lots of classic rock and pop songs and then collects the royalties. I doubt I will get rich on this one, but I see no reason why it won't result in solid steady returns for a long time.

In both cases I read about a company with a business model that sounded interesting so I looked at their financials to see if they seemed reasonably priced (they were) and not on the cusp of bankruptcy."

6/24/2021 21:43,stocks,"The danger here comes with the understanding of what exactly risk tolerance means, how well you understand it, and how well she understands her own. 

Lots of people, particularly early on in life, think they have aggressive risk tolerance in pursuit of the highest gains. However, look at NIO or PLTR or clean energy or TSLA or marijuana or trendy penny plays like Zo - Medica over the last six months. People who went all in on those this winter are looking at 20-50 percent losses while they watch the broader markets reach ATHs. 

Not only does it take an unusually clear-eyed perspective to appreciate risk tolerance, but it’s amplified when a high-risk play doesn’t work out and the portfolio is benign weighed down by bags. 

Considering all that, look at your relationship. If you fully trust that you can clearly articulate all this to her, she can understand it and accept the risk, and then the worst can happen, and through it all, it doesn’t strain your relationship, then:

1) go for it
2) marry her now.

Then she can add more overtime as she is more familiar. Let her pick the stocks, you can show her what you bought and explain why, but let her decide all the moves. If she wants to know options eventually(not sure if you do them) explain exactly what it is, and the fact that you can lose all the money(probably have her stick to selling covered calls for the mean time of any since there is no way to lose money if you’re already holding stock unless you’re dumb and sell below value with those).

It removes sticky deposits of a protein called amyloid beta from the brains of patients in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's in order to stave off its impact, including memory loss and the inability to take care of oneself.

Lecanemab is also being studied in a large trial on people with evidence of amyloid in their brains, who do not yet have symptoms of the disease.

What’s the catch? China has to allow the merger, which they may not because of monopoly laws. Tencent would be majority share holder and with China cracking down hard on big tech, you can see why there is such a discount.

6/25/2021 9:18,stocks,">the stock broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern today

here's the part where I'd normally insert a quote from billionaire investor Howard Marks about how Technical Analysis is mostly worthless and should not be the primary reason for buying/selling, but I'm too lazy to find the exact quote. it's in *The Most Important Thing*

https://www.amazon.com/Most-Important-Thing-Uncommon-Thoughtful/dp/151138347X

IMO Tesla is still crazy overvalued. It's not fairly valued until market cap is *below* GM and Honda, if not far far lower. Tesla sells under 1% of cars worldwide, and is rapidly losing ground as other companies step up their EV game. share price needs to reflect those facts. fair value for Tesla IMO is in the $300 range."
6/25/2021 18:38,stocks,35 shares at $41/share. Tesla is the apple of cars. I said it in 2016 and still today believe in it. I don’t believe legacy cars can catch up. There’s just too much change that’s needed. Maybe one can survive the switch to autonomous EVs.

6/25/2021 10:04,stocks,"I agree with your analysis on the valuation part. I have a few questions for you-

* What according to you should be the fair value of Tesla?
* If Tesla is overvalued, why did so many analysts give it a buy rating a few months back?
* Cathy Wood is heavily invested in Tesla. Managing hundreds of millions of dollars in funds, does she not know that it is overvalued.

These questions are not to undermine what you said but to let you know that no one can predict the markets and we all follow our own analysis irrespective of what others think or say. Tell me which stock or security is perfectly valued in these crazy markets?"

Also yea you’re right, you are in the minority of people who think Tesla’s are ugly. And you are wrong to say competitors have higher quality EVs. If you meant the interior looks nicer than you’d be right, but again this is an opinion based argument. Tesla’s technology is yet to be beaten.

If you read a little further down on this thread you’ll see that I’ve read the future as I just talked about how you bears all day the exact same thing. Stock is overvalued followed by opinion based arguments that few agree with... why even bother talking? Say something that actually matters next time."

Autonomy is not the same on other cars. I recently drove a new bmw with the newest ACC and it was nothing like the self-driving in a tesla. While Tesla’s aren’t there yet, I’m not sure other companies will get there first. 

Servicing for Tesla’s only take a day or two. And you get a tesla to drive as a loaner. I had a major upgrade to my computer and it only took 1 day to complete in Atlanta."
6/24/2021 20:04,stocks,"I am a Tesla-tard and fine with it, it’s clear I’m a strong believer in the company. But I actually listen to what others say and I pay close attention to what competitors are doing and developing. The facts are that they still don’t make comparable products and people still don’t make any actual arguments against Tesla. 

I’m open to learn and encourage discussion about why Tesla won’t be the winner, but no one says anything other than things like you’ve just commented. Tesla bulls get blown off with “they aren’t profitable” “competitors will catch them” “stock is overvalued” but these aren’t based on facts, it’s FUD and speculation and not reasons why the company won’t continue to win. 

The only thing I’ve speculated on is that it is the best investment Long term, and that they will be the largest company by revenue. Which I backed up with reasoning that is based on current information available to everyone. 

To comment on your first point, if all those things were true then how would they not be leading in revenue? The top companies by revenue are in energy, oil and gas, and automotive (other than retail), if Tesla is leading in all these sectors and continue to post insane profit margins they would be leading in revenue.

Tesla is also about to turn insurance on its head and will have the best possible rates due to large pools of data that their cars collect for them for free. If they solve FSD their robotaxis will be free money, they have all the keys to solving it and are the only company actually attempting this. Waymo is limited to level 4 autonomy and is not able to profitably compete at scale because of the amount of effort it takes to render and update their maps which are needed for the cars to work, unlike Tesla who’s cars actually understand what they are doing and have been doing this safely for millions of uninterrupted miles. 

There is so much to be bullish about and so little to be bearish about. As I said, please point out something I’m missing that is backed by facts and not fake news."

Miners were buying 10, 100+ GPUs. You don't have enough gamers to buy this volume, probably it will be enough to keep up the GPU sales volumes for a month or two.. and that's it.

6/24/2021 23:51,stocks,"Nvidia is a long term hold for me - is it pricey right now? Probably. Are you going to care in 10-20 years? Almost certainly not, assuming the fundamentals don’t change. You just have to ask yourself if you’re looking for a short term trade here, or to buy long term...

Nvidia is a lot more than just GPUs for gamers. My opinion is, their tech is going to be fundamental for the next few decades.  Their advanced GPUs > CPUs for AI / machine learning applications, as well as autonomous vehicles (sensor fusion processing rapid data from inertial measurement, LIDAR, RADAR, etc.). This isn’t even counting the gaming and data center revenue."

6/25/2021 3:45,stocks,"Good time to get in? Yes. No. Maybe. Depends on your philosophy of trading. Your intended time of holding the stock (daytrade or until retirement?).

Or what is needed to handle and mine upcoming state controlled crypto currency. Finally define yourself, then define the criteria for a stock you want to own, then check the stock.

Tesla pays money for the factories which produces their cars than makes money. So you named factories like they are some great thing. The only thing they are going to do is produce more product which doesnt matter if the demand is not there. Also Starlink IPO? Those are two separate companies. Tesla is not Starlink and Starlink is not Tesla btw. Also airplanes and boats? Boats are pure speculation and Elon Musk already commented on airplanes. He said they are way far off from building airplanes and they are not going to be in his lifetime. He says its lack of engineering and people plus the technology is not there.

The level of tech in modern heavy equipment improves customer retention since it would be difficult to get it repaired by a 3rd party, non OEM endorsed dealer. Yes, there is some pushback on the amount of tech and who owns that tech, but that is the nature of the industry and farmers will adapt.

Stories like this have been around for literally more than a decade. In the last year Deere stock is up over 130%. Your post is overly dramatic and I would wager you don't have much insight into the heavy equipment/ag market. 

The tech is going to be what drives the growth for Deere and others. The majority of farming is done by huge corporations who have no problem spending a little more on service. If you know anything about precision farming, they are more than making up for it with the gains in yield and efficiency"

Georgia’s nominal GDP (per capita): $4,285

Uzbekistan’s nominal GDP: $1,831

Kazakhstan’s nominal GDP: $9,686 (higher than I expected)

I think 65 restaurants across three countries is actually an ambitious goal, especially for a restaurant that specializes in burgers (sandwiches). Wikipedia says Georgia has 18 McDonalds, Kazakhstan has 20, and Uzbekistan has 0, so around 20 stores per country is probably what Wendy’s could hope to achieve as a best case scenario.

In western countries, fast food is the cheap option, but I expect Wendy’s and similar options to be a premium/high-end dining option when their current diets are based on much lower spending power. I’ve never visited Central Asia, but this is what I’ve observed in South and Southeast Asia and parts of Africa."

*“The economists Lance Taylor and Nelson Barbosa-Filho suggest that Biden faces a policy dilemma. Reducing inequality is one of his stated goals. But an increase in the wage share will lead firms to increase prices to an extent that will force the Fed to raise interest rates. This monetary tightening, in turn, will adversely affect asset markets and generate “political resistance from Wall Street and affluent households.” Though the authors do not emphasize it, this would represent a historic shift in political economy. From Marc Hanna to Paul Volcker, rentier spokesmen have traditionally favored tight money, while workers and debtors have longed for expansion. If asset owners now have their own reasons to resist tighter Fed policy, the cause of full employment may have gained an awkward but powerful ally.”*"

6/25/2021 9:56,stocks,">Is this a decent approach?

not really, sorry. 

>Does it have a name?

it's called ""technical analysis"" or ""chart reading"". apart from a few narrow instances, it's not that reliable and most professionals don't use chart analysis as a major part of their strategy. there's been a massive amount of research on this point, and the result is they find chart reading is often little better than astrology. there's so much room for interpretation that it's difficult to determine if you made a good call or were just lucky. 

'fundamental analysis' is far more important, which examines the financial status of a company. for example, see the following books all by successful investors: 

- The Most Important Thing, by Howard Marks. very little discussion of chart reading, other than to say he doesn't rely on it too often. 

- The Little Book that Beats the Market, but Joel Greenblatt. focuses on two methods of fundamental analysis, finding stocks with low ""price to earnings"" ratio and high ""return on capital."" looking for stocks that are under-valued (like buying $5 for $2.50), but are good at turning assets into profits. zero chart reading. 

- The Little Book of Value Investing, by Christopher Browne. 100% fundamental analysis. 

- One Up on Wall Street and Beating the Street, by Peter Lynch. mostly focused on fundamentals, with a bit of chart analysis but it's mainly only on the price of the stock relative to earnings/profits.

EDIT- to be clear, buying a stock when the price drops can be a good strategy, but it's not necessarily about the movement of the price on a chart. you might think the company has good long-term potential, so you buy when it's 'on sale' for some reason. or you might decide the company is good but the stock is too expensive at $100, but you'll buy at $85."

if you want to ramp up the risk/rewards ratio, I'd recommend adding more small and mid cap holdings. for the US, maybe do 40% large cap, 30% mid and 30% small. over a long period, 10+ years, mid and small cap stocks as a group will tend to outperform large cap. they're also more volatile, sharper ups & downs, so you need to commit to riding this plan out for a while and not panicking in the short-term."

But in the comment I responded too, you said there was no true value of a company and I disagree with that part. On any given day, you can look at a company and say what are their assets minus liabilities on their balance sheet if they were to liquidate the company. That would be true value. People never pay close to that when investing, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist."
6/25/2021 10:23,stocks,My larger point is that the value of anything is totally based on what people are willing to pay for it.  Take gold as an example.  It is a medal.  The reason it is more valuable than other medals is because people perceive it to be more valuable and are willing to pay more for it.
6/25/2021 13:46,stocks,"Right but what I'm saying is that isnt true to an extent. Sure what people are willing to pay for it can affect how much it's worth above it's intrinsic value, but things still have intrinsic value. 

A bond for example is worth say 1000. It will always redeem at 1000, however it's traded price can go up or down based on rates and the market. If held until maturity though you will 100% get 1000 back. 

A stock is similar in that if it were to liquidate, you will get a % of the assets that exceed the liabilities relative to the % of the company you own. This has nothing to do with how the stock is traded price wise."

If he wants to encourage other wealthy people to be generous that is great he can do that. But what he actually is doing is setting himself up and building his legacy as this great philanthropic guy but he still wants to change the system that would prevent others from doing the same in the future.

He comes across as viewing himself as being morally superior because he and a few others like Bill Gates can be trusted with their wealth but the system must be changed to prevent anyone else from becoming so wealthy because they can't be trusted to be generous to society. Oh this up and comer is so greedy let's tax his money!!! He isn't paying his fair share!!! Oh so what if I never paid my fair share I am giving my money away to charity after I am dead and I don't need it anymore!! If he doesn't feel that way then why would he want more wealth being sucked into taxes and away from future charities from future warren buffets and bill gates? Because he is doing it with his own money now for his own future legacy and that is the real motivation for most of these billionaires (and that isn't necessarily bad if the money does good anyways but let's be honest about it)

Bottom line: if he thinks the tax system is unfair and he thinks he didn't pay his own fair share then he should pay it to the people who would have gotten it if he had paid his fair share - the IRS!! Otherwise he should give his money to charity and shutup about taxes and fairness."

6/25/2021 19:42,stocks,I think they wanted docs to invest so they could tell everyone- see docs believe in our company!
6/25/2021 15:07,stocks,"It is crazy. I have no idea why anyone other than Alphabet would buy GOOG at this difference. Alphabet has to buy the excess GOOG shares they used for giving shares to executives, buying out other companies...

If they buyback all the excess shares so that there are an equal number of GOOG and GOOGL shares then I think they will buy back both.

It is crazy that the tracking shares GOOG are at a 4% premium to the real shares with voting rights. Sure the voting rights are not worth much but they certainly are not worth a negative 4%.

My guess is that when Alphabet starts paying a sensible dividend given how much excess cash their operations generate the difference in price with quickly evaporate.  The anti-trust pressures around the world add a new pressure to not use the excess cash to eliminate competitors and grow their monopoly power. My guess is dividends are very likely within 2 years."

6/25/2021 7:37,stocks,It prefer a single highly diversified ETF and add single stocks once you are above 30k with your portfolio. Kindly note that focusing just on the US market is a speculation. Might look into a market neutral portfolio by buying an ETF which is based on a global index such as the MSCI WORLD or ACWI. Keep it single and invest steady.
6/24/2021 22:19,stocks,That's the same thing lmao
6/25/2021 7:39,stocks,"Finally got an update from Merrill Lynch yesterday.

They said pretty much the same thing as Robinhood:

Yes the ex-dividend date was reported as 06/14/21

The DTCC said the date should have been 06/16

Its not your fault you had the wrong info, but sucks to be you."
6/25/2021 8:03,stocks,Sigh. Thanks for the update. Nothing can be done it seems.... sorry
6/24/2021 22:27,stocks,"I bought 25 $3 calls  of ATOS for $1.15 when the share price was $3.32... I sold 9 when it tripled and got my initial investment back... The the ""sell the news"" event occurred on June 9 and my remaining16 calls dropped significantly.. but I was only playing with house money so I held, and I REALLY believe in this play..  My $3 calls are now up 350%.. I'm actually wishing I had held the other 9."

Because the flip side of that coin is “no one ever made gains money holding no equities”. 

Which is just as true."

6/25/2021 6:08,stocks,Everything gone up

6/25/2021 12:40,stocks,ARM is entering the data center cpu space to compete against AMD and INTL. AMD's CEO have said the data center space is where the big money is.
6/25/2021 13:12,stocks,"There's already tons of ARM products in the server space. Despite that mainstream cloud providers aren't looking at them. Lisa Su said that if customers are considering ARM products, AMD would already be designing them."
6/25/2021 18:27,stocks,"Wouldn't AMD be at a distinct disadvantage in producing ARM products? Since NVDA is acquiring ARM, wouldn't AMD be paying more expensive licensing fees?

>Despite that mainstream cloud providers aren't looking at them

Didn't Amazon recently roll out ARM-based servers?"
6/25/2021 9:54,stocks,So should we expect tech to start going down?

6/25/2021 16:42,stocks,Lol
6/25/2021 12:09,stocks,"Here's what I've read on Motley about this:

""What's missing from NVIDIA's press release is the ex-dividend date. Because the stock split is being initiated in the form of a stock dividend, the ex-dividend date governs which investors are eligible to receive the newly split shares. In this case, NVIDIA's stock split goes ex-dividend on July 19, according to a spokesperson for brokerage house Charles Schwab.This means that investors can buy NVIDIA shares right up to July 19, and still be eligible to receive the additional shares from the stock split once the shares begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens July 20."" 

This coincides with what TD Ameritrade told you. You're fine to buy and get the split."

6/25/2021 12:31,stocks,"Thanks for this! 

I am still unsure on the whole shareholder of record date thing. What is even the point of that?"
6/25/2021 10:13,stocks,"There is the dividend, and the split, which they're calling a split dividend. The way their release read, to qualify for the split pay out, you had to own shares at the close of the June 20. They're calling the split a stock dividend. I don't think your comment is correct..

""If you bought shares before market close of June 9th, you qualify for the added dividend payout (3 additional shares worth).""

That is the split, and their press release said you have to be on record by June 20. 

The cash dividend ex date was June 9, I think thats what your thinking. They're not doing another special cash dividend and the split.

Their press release says 

""If approval is obtained, each NVIDIA stockholder of record at the close of business on June 21, 2021, will receive a dividend of three additional shares of common stock for every share held on the record date, to be distributed after the close of trading on July 19, 2021.""

If you read that statement a few times, it makes it seem you have to own the stock 6/21 to get the dividend split shares on 7/19. Judging from the comments, I think thats not an issue for retail investors, but holy hell, the way its worded seems otherwise..."
6/25/2021 13:30,stocks,So there is no actual stock split? Just an increase in dividend payout?
6/25/2021 13:47,stocks,The dividend is in shares and it's a split.. but they call it a dividend split.. yea this just seems they made it complicated.
6/25/2021 6:13,stocks,"Do you live under the rock? Amazon, Etsy, Baba, and eBay been selling fake stuff all the time. People love to buy stuff that is cheap. Wish will be number 1 online dollar store which is good for business."

6/25/2021 6:50,stocks,"I completely understand this, but ease of returning/refunding disappointed products is much easier on amazon/ebay. I think wish has to get a little better with their customer services and also crack down on false advertising. Amazon are constantly under pressure about counterfeit products and I think they will be hit hard soon.

 I'm not trying to say one is good one is bad. I'm literally speaking from user experience. Selling low quality products is bad in general. As the old saying goes, buy cheap, buy twice."
6/25/2021 9:24,stocks,Customer service and false advertising can be corrected and remember 5 years ago Amazon wanted to buy Wish for 10 billion dollars and Wish declined. Why would an amazing company like Amazon would make an offer like that? Wish has a lot potentials in my mind and they haven’t even entered the India market. I think $10-$15 per share is a fair value to say the least.
6/25/2021 6:16,stocks,"I guess you never shop on eBay, Etsy, babe and Amazon. They will way more fake stuff and mostly coming from China sellers."
