03/24/2021,stocks,"Gamble by buying calls near close after a series of shitty days. Usually limit sell orders are cancelled by the broker at the end of the day. If there were any looming low limit buys, you can bet the firms who can see the order stack and are directly tethered will get pick of the litter. Market orders are adjusted to reflect the change in prices based on the Greeks. It’s very unlikely you’ll get that order through on open. If you get something at morning surge prices after a big after hours I’d be on the watch to be ready to dump at first sign of profit. Unless it’s a deep position bought cheap that’s secured a large enough margin I tend to dump at anything over 20%. The only thing worse than selling early at a solid profit is missing the window entirely and losing.

Usually it’s a high IV period, so you really don’t want to be buying options during those times if it can be avoided. A lot can be said for betting on the next day’s open after a prolonged period of contraction. There’s risk and if you play this strategy don’t go over 5% of your available account balance."
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m like you I just buy without market orders when I’m ready to buy. I do not care about a few cents difference when I’m ready to buy
03/24/2021,stocks,You can set limit orders expiring same day. I use this a lot.
03/24/2021,stocks,"if you do this with less liquid stocks, you'll eventually get burned. blue chips? not a big deal"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep. I'm a long hold guy. When I buy, I buy. When I sell, I sell."
03/24/2021,stocks,As long as that bid ask is tight you’re doing it right.
03/24/2021,stocks,Buys only
03/24/2021,stocks,"A GTC buy limit that executed is one of only two things that closed green today.

I'm DEFINITELY using limit buys."
03/24/2021,stocks,For myself...it depends on the stock but if I see an opportunity to squeeze little more profit from a stock I will add a limit.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same. I'm a buy and hold guy. I've got a thousand other things to do during the day and don't feel like checking back over and over again to save a few cents. Over a long holding period it's in the noise.

Only exception is for less liquid trades.

I find my broker does a pretty good job of getting me a good price and it's one less thing I have to worry about."
03/24/2021,stocks,I don’t use them and I’m on fidelity. I usually get price improvement so I don’t mind.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I used to use limit orders almost exclusively, it’s a good way to keep making profit. I wish I hadn’t left that strategy but times changed. I do market orders practically all the time now. It can swing prices in your favor sometimes, both by pure market momentum and by synergistic orders from POF customers that like to trade with you.

I do more trades now but the amount of profit I pull in has decreased slightly. I think there is a lot to be said for strategies revolving around getting good deals but it’s often not easy to do during market hours. 

As for order expiration I only do same-day orders. I don’t have the capital to just let hang out for too long unless it’s something that I know I want and for a specific price. Options are another matter, and I do tend to let those hang out for the quarterly expiration for the most part."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I only did limit buys when using Robinhood because it always seemed to buy ~$.02-.20 worse than whatever the ticker was showing. 

Since I switched to Fidelity I've been doing more market orders as I haven't been seeing that behavior from them."
03/24/2021,stocks,Only use limit buys for that other type of stock where its required. Otherwise market only.
03/24/2021,stocks,"When I was trading on Ally, I almost always used limit orders, because it always appeared to me as if I paid a premium to the ruling price when I placed market orders. I was running TDA and Ally simultaneously"
03/24/2021,stocks,I have mostly used them for selling but not buying. There have been times I have regretted setting them on volatile stocks. Seeing later on a busy day that I was within pennies of my set gain can be frustrating. Watching those gains shrivel on the vine hoping to get back to the limit has made me use the less and less and check my accounts more often throughout the day.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same, and I can always change my limit too as long as it hasn't been filled so I can always set the limit to market if I want"

I’m an convicted felon believe me when I say I don’t fucking like pedos that being said She is the daughter of said pedo turning your back on a family member especially a parent is very hard especially if there was any abuse in their own life (we don’t know if that’s the case or not) but what I’m getting at is it’s still her dad she views him differently than all of us. Let’s not cast shade on her for the actions of her father. Now if she had any involvement on fucked up shit like that then that changes the story
03/24/2021,stocks,"It’s good to have 20%  30% of your portfolio in high dividend yield stocks (and have low taxation), provides a bit of a shield in the long run for your portfolio... same goes for going long on vol (5% is more than enough)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"What’s the opportunity cost though of not putting that money into growth tech, etc?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Wait til you find out what you’d have if you invested that $100K on Amazon instead.
03/24/2021,stocks,Unless they stop paying dividends like a lot of companies have
03/24/2021,stocks,"Dividend irrelevancy states that before taxes and fees, there is no logical basis to prefer receiving cash from a dividend over receiving cash from selling shares so long as $1=$1. 


You can own 90% of $100,000 (selling shares) or 100% of $90,000 (receiving a dividend). In the end it makes no difference to you the investor. This happens because the share price drops by the amount of the dividend on the Ex-date."
03/24/2021,stocks,I love dividend stocks and adding the DRIP. Grow stock in 2 ways.
03/24/2021,stocks,I would put that 100k in AAPL and worth way more than $200k with T
03/24/2021,stocks,"Opportunity cost can be tricky, and if you’re using it to apply hindsight, you’re misusing it. 

In 1995, we don’t know what T or the rest of the market will do. We just know T has already established itself and its dividends, so the opportunity isn’t what’s being pursued, it’s the combination of the upside and limited downside. 

There’s always “opportunity cost” when you use hindsight to see you could have made more with another security, but in the present, it’s a risk-driven calculation, and the height of the floor involved is very relevant."
03/24/2021,stocks,More of diversification. Steady retirement income on a part of your wad over rolling the dice.  It's a 30 year payoff so you need money elsewhere.
03/24/2021,stocks,Hindsight is great but if you threw that in Yahoo.... Yeah.
03/24/2021,stocks,T hasn't missed a divvy in like 70 years.
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you aren't selling ever, how does share price matter besides a tax write off?

And if you get 13% roi with that write off, isn't that a good thing?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Most big dividend stocks are stagnant
03/24/2021,stocks,In 2000 you'd say the same thing about Yahoo... This is about steady retirement returns in 30 years for part of your wad.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I mean that was the point, you also cherry picked one of the few highly successful dividend stocks in AT&T. If it was 1995 you might have instead picked GE for your dividend stock at the time. That would be really sad."
03/24/2021,stocks,You are just cherry picking data. If you had put $100k in Apple instead of T when it ipo you would have millions now. Would you still care about your T dividends?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I love how you deleted the previous comment, anyway here’s what I would’ve said: 


> And again, 13% guaranteed with a tax write off says you're wrong. Proven by your divvy calculator.


Please explain to everyone how you can achieve **13% annual gains and have the ability to sell those same shares at a loss.** Please explain. 


And honestly I don’t know where you’re pulling this 13% from because I’ve never had 13% show up on the dividend calculator yet. 


Edit: on mine it shows T had an annual rate of return of 2.8% from 1995 to today. So I think you’re just pulling this 13% out of your butt. 


Edit 2: And please explain to everyone how you get a **”guaranteed”** rate of return of 13%. 



> And again share price is either irrelevant or a bonus., as proven and agreed upon by your metric. 


That’s because you’re interpreting the data to mean things it doesn’t mean. You’re operating outside of reality. 


On the ex date, the share price drops by the amount of the dividend. This is why there’s no logical basis by which you can justify your preference for dividends over selling shares. I’ll say this for the millionth time: you can own 100% of $90k or you can own 90% of $100k. 


Keep in mind you’re the one that: 

A) Didnt know how to calculate a stock’s yield 

B) Didnt know that companies set their dividends, you thought they set yield and adjusted their dividend to fit the set yield. 

C) Think rental income from tenants is the same as receiving dividends from a company 


Ok and for what you said now: 


> If you aren't selling ever, how does share price matter besides a tax write off?


Someone else deal with this guy. He doesn’t understand yield traps or any basic knowledge about stocks and dividends yet he acts (he doesn’t act, he says he is) like he’s smarter than Buffet and all the academics."
03/24/2021,stocks,The ones with huge dividends yes. But aapl and msft give me dividends and those will continue to grow.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah but my JNJ shares are up 10% and I only just started investing 6 months ago not counting dividends. Also they may not be heavy growers but they do pretty well in market corrections. But sure keep shit talking dividend stocks ;)
03/24/2021,stocks,"That's the point though, if it's stagnant you just get more shares for more steady income in 30 years at retirement for part of your wad."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes. I just don’t see T can maintain the div. they are selling their direct tv, trying to sell CNN and more. Plus they are spending crazy amount on 5G, and HBO max platform. 
Idk if T is the best option at this point, but time will tell."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I picked one of several stock that haven't missed a divvy in 70+ years. There's plenty of others like IBM.

GE is a horrible divvy stock by the same metric, even in 1995."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm not cherry picking data. I'm talking about divvy stocks that are proven to not miss a divvy.  Cherry picking is pointing out APPL in hindsight when there's plenty of losers that didn't do apple.  T, IBM, PRU, etc don't miss divvys.

But Apple isn't a bad place for other than 30 year retirement money, which isn't the question for parking part of your wad for retirement"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Even if they cut it in half, it'll be about 3.5% and the same gains from 1995 to now.

And is Netflix a horrible investment?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"GE was a bluechip,  divvy stock until it wasn’t. You can always find an example one way or the other to help"
03/24/2021,stocks,GE never paid a divvy like T or IBM.
03/24/2021,stocks,Don’t know why they’re fighting you so much on this. Could have chosen any high quality dividend aristocrat. It being at&t is not the point
03/24/2021,stocks,"That is why tech is lower, people are rotating their money into stocks that hurt during the pandemic to capitalize on the rise.

Then they will probably rotate back once those overshoot.

The problem is that some won’t recover as people may expect, movie theaters for example may not return to the same volume because now some of the bigger producer are happy making money off streaming. 

People will still go to the theater because it is an experience in an of itself. But the option to watch at home will be there for the lesser movies and movies that aren’t particularly visually striking."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You’re looking for Recovery stocks. On the flip, examples of companies benefitting from pandemic are Clorox, ups, Amazon"
03/24/2021,stocks,I looked into movie theatres in Canada and the US and they were all actually on a strong downward trend pre-covid if you look at the last 5 years so I changed my mind on that real quick.
03/24/2021,stocks,But people weren’t stuck in their houses for a year with literally nothing to go do. I think the movie theaters will peak for a bit and then fall off to their pre-Covid numbers.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m new to investing and it’s been hard to watch after spending my initial first month or two in the green. Now it’s absolutely bleeding. I realize now that I bought in at some pretty high prices.

Thankfully I listened to the advice of others and bought stocks that I believe in, so I’m actually excited to get more at a lower price.

However, this correction did get me thinking that I should start some positions in some ETFs or blue chips. I might not have the stomach for as much volatility as I thought I did."
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm sorry to bring bad news but stonks dont always go up
03/24/2021,stocks,A lot of these tech companies still could have a long way to fall. For example square was a 33$ stock within the last year
03/24/2021,stocks,"Market corrections are 10% but that doesnt mean that specific stocks or volatile sectors wont get hit much harder. Sometimes there are share dilutions to service debt or finance business activity or operations funding too which will cause sell offs, but usually that's for smallcaps or pennystocks. You can always search the ticker on yahoo finance and check the news articles related to it to keep up to date."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The 10% refers to the market as a whole. Individual stocks are individual stocks. Some will be down 40% and some will be up 20%. It be like that sometimes. Welcome to the stock market. 

That’s why it’s so important to choose the right stocks. Don’t get caught up in meme stocks and in chasing last years winners."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because it’s been a pump and dump. Institutional/hedge/MM buying massively for months pumping everything sky high, then short it all, then sell, leaving retail investors as the bag holders not knowing what hit them.

Also, get the media to run interference on the way down by explaining that it’s all because of bond yields. Or a rotation into cyclicals. Or maybe interest rates. Or maybe a rotation into recovery. Or, what JPow said.   Or...(you’ll have to wait till next week)."

03/24/2021,stocks,"ETFs is the safe road but even those have had some struggles the last couple of months. The market is very much trading sideways, hopefully next month we start to see some good green. 

The post March 2020 run was incredible but you do kind of wonder why it was so strong considering what happened last year. Tech absolutely boomed but everything else not so much so the last few weeks have been pumping the undervalued stuff up prior to reopening."
03/24/2021,stocks,"yeah I feel this aswell, being a YOLO investor is fun when market only goes up but personally speaking the volatility (especially when it's red) is personally too exhausting for me"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same, I think for my current price targets, I look at what the price was a year ago, then think what my price target would've been or actually was when I bought it at the time. Almost every stock I bought the price target has been well achieved, if anything exponentially. Like when I bought Square several years ago, my price target was $100, so today I pretty much only buy if it's close to my original price target, since it's what I consider fair value. Almost nothing is fair value imo in the market right now, of course it's all subjective, but yeah personal opinion."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I dont know. With how far some stocks have fallen, I can't imagine them falling the rest of the time until then"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yup, my friend invested heavily last March and he’s a total tech geek so he turned me on to a lot of those companies. Went great initially like I said, but we all know how it is now lol. I’ve realized that I don’t understand it as much as him so I’ve started to turn my attention towards things I do understand.

I’m younger (Mid 20s) so I think in the long haul, ETFs will inevitably pay off in retirement."
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s thought to find fair value stocks now I agree 100 percent with you. Do you currently have your eye on anything?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Just for some perspective at how overvalued we might be. You could argue our Shiller PE Ratio is about 9 or 10 points too high from the post-Internet average right now. Today, it fell 0.19."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This may not even post, more lurker than poster in my time on Reddit, but lol

Sounds like you might want to look at dividend paying stock, or ETFs for lower risk and with div some GTD return that can be reinvested for compound div gains ... It's where a chunk of my portfolio sits ... I'm new to the game as well and was an initial move to yours having had built a decent rainy day fund so switched from savings to a reit stock with a nice dividend. 

ETFs iv not researched into but basically a collection of stocks so diversification built in to lower risk.

Make sure to look at the tax side on dividends tho as some scenarios where it can be taxed differently .... Mine is in a tax free on gains account so not really looked into it but read a little on how it can be different even in that type of account if foreign div (I'm Canadian so possible us dividend payments are taxed differently but again not fully sure as didn't dog too much, only have a few us stocks in one of those accounts and not div payers)

Anyhow hope this gets posted and helps provide a bit of info based on what sounds like your thoughts on reason to invest.

So much to read up on, and I kinda jumped into other areas a little head on and learning observing as it goes ... Some bloody days but have to hold through, all depends on reason for investing tho (trader vs investor etc, I'd probably hold too much if I had the money and felt they would bounce back ... Lot of dips to buy aka good sales sometimes)

Cheers"

 I bought some of this last March and exited last week. I honestly thought COVID would not last an entire year but here we are."
03/24/2021,stocks,Who the fuck is this guy? The cruise line oracle?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think there is a possible option to make Bahamas as their main port, like Royal Caribbean did and announce sailings from June."
03/24/2021,stocks,What's your short position on CCL if you are so confident they will drop more?  Did you buy puts or short shares?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don’t think Fauci banning cruises will/is as easy as you’re making it sound. I held CCL last year at $26 and was told it was going bankrupt but now it’s come back to those levels again despite them not operating and cancelling cruises left right and centre. This is a big industry and billions are invested, I don’t think the suits in the industry will admit defeat and accept bankruptcy easily. I’m sure some dirty politicians will be getting paid to fight for the cruises to be back in business if it has to happen. They just made a very big ship recently and I’m sure they’ll want a return on that. While they may loose some revenue from the US, you need to realise that US is not the only country in the world. There’s Europe as well and and other countries.  As unsafe as they are, people are tired in being locked in so I don’t think cruise fans will be giving 2 phucks that much as long as there’s some good precautions taken to make sure that people are safe. 

For those who are holding, don’t loose hope. I sold mine at a loss because I thought the price wouldn’t recover but I don’t regret it. I lost some money but over all, I learned a good lesson. Not saying I’m 100% sure they’ll recover but I also wouldn’t take OP’s word as gospel. Sure they can go bankrupt but that’s the risk you also take when you’re investing."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'll be buying more PEJ, LUV, &UA when everyone panics again."
03/24/2021,stocks,"OP: ""This company has a lot of debt and it is unlikely the current administration will lift restrictions. Best to stay away.""

Guys who bought at $29: ""Reeeeeeee! Why didn't anyone warn me! Fuck off shorty I'm not selling!"""
03/24/2021,stocks,"They’re crashing it before earnings. Either to soften the blow or to buy the low. CCL will make
It. No doubt. Once positive news comes out. This is lifting.  It’s like saying you can’t have dessert as an app. Then they say it’s pushed to after dinner. You’re still having it. Just expectations got shifted. Real money doesn’t care. Wait till July August."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think Royal and Celebrity are fed up with CDC.  Happy to see they announced they are going to start sailing in June.  The lines need to be allowed to start up.  It has been crazy to keep them shut down this long. Hate that the US is not going to be part of their restart, but just happy to see some lines figuring out ways around this."
03/24/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/24/2021,stocks,New Covid variants completely doom any chance at lifting restrictions. If I had the money I’d buy some puts on Carnival.
03/24/2021,stocks,Covid isn’t real. People need to stop being sheep. It’s the same as a cold. Boohoo
03/24/2021,stocks,Yay losses.
03/24/2021,stocks,NCLH puts paid huge today.
03/24/2021,stocks,A bit late for the short... already down 20% from the most recent high.
03/24/2021,stocks,Additional travel expenses for cruises that are being restricted for safety reasons.  No one wants that shit.
03/24/2021,stocks,i have been shorting it for weeks. mostly intra day. more recently swings. i have been warning people that this was going to happen.  i have been open about my bias.
03/24/2021,stocks,you're compare the price at 52 week lows to the price near 52 week highs?
03/24/2021,stocks,i would love to get your march entry.  that was a great investment. my money was tied up at the time and i missed out.
03/24/2021,stocks,just someone who can read
03/24/2021,stocks,I don't think that will help much.  The scientific consensus is that these cruises are not safe. You don't have to agree with it. It is what it is.  Too much confusion and uncertainty moving forward.
03/24/2021,stocks,shares
03/24/2021,stocks,There is that low IQ rage I often talk about.  When lowlife degenerate gamblers are allowed to trade this is what you get.  Uncontrollable mood swings when trades don't go right.
03/24/2021,stocks,You're a dope.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Still another 12 dollars from its November numbers. Earnings in 6 days as well. What are the odds they have a positive earnings surprise?

Edit: $28 Billion in debt up from $11.5 billon in 2019. Maybe I'm mistaken, but it looks like they'd need a miracle to save them from bankruptcy."
03/24/2021,stocks,Lol just sounds like you don't want that. Not everyone is scared.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Dude, deaths in the US as a whole have dropped in half in a month. 

With vaccinations rolling it’ll be another half again in a month and at the lowest point since the outbreak. 

At some point things are going to open up with people still dying. I don’t know if you’ve prepared yourself for that..."
03/24/2021,stocks,"

COVID has been around for over a year. 
Anyone that thought it would go away by the end of 2020 is delusional. No offense to anyone. 

It's not expected to go anywhere for the rest of the year. 

So what warning?
Your oldest post is about 14 days ago related to this."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm saying that when I bought, I did so fully intending to hold.  My cost basis and risk tolerance is such that I am comfortable doing that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I was lucky and exited a very big and very long position in January and had a lot of money available, COVID wasn’t even a word then. Then I was working in Singapore and just watching COVID getting ready to slam the US (unfortunately). I bought a lot of stuff when there was blood on the streets and exited a lot of long positions (many of them travel and entertainment) over the last two weeks. I feel a little guilty having profited so much off the pandemic though."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not safe for sailing in USA waters. They are implementing all of these safety measures and they are require vaccine for crew and passengers. Uncertainty at the moment yes, but that old horse will get back on track soon."
03/24/2021,stocks,"There is no scientific consensus saying that. Once the cdc realizes ppl are just traveling to Mexico and Florida etc, they’ll reopen stuff."

03/24/2021,stocks,MSC has been sailing from Italy almost thru the whole Covid pandemic.  They stopped for a few weeks before  restarting.  Royal has been sailing out of China for several weeks.  Cozumel is offering to allow ships to come and sail from there.  There are options and just by pass the US and the CDC.  I would step on a ship tomorrow.  I cruised during the beginnings of the pandemic last year.  Ships are some of the cleanest places you can be.....
03/24/2021,stocks,"You're shorting this and saying that people holding shares is ""gambling"".  Odd."
03/24/2021,stocks,Dont take it personally.   The best shorts are logical thinking.   Why wouldnt you short a company generating 0 Dollars ?
03/24/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/24/2021,stocks,Don't feed the trolls
03/24/2021,stocks,Has nothing to do with being scared. Who wants to pay big money on a vacation that will have limited amenities and entertainment?  You people are such dopes.  Like I said. You people refuse to recognize the current environment and instead try to trade your feelings.
03/24/2021,stocks,"This.  At some point, things have to open up or Biden will preside over a total market meltdown, at which point I really won't give two shits about the 5% of my portfolio I'm holding in CCL."
03/24/2021,stocks,I've heard this the entire time I was warning people.
03/24/2021,stocks,Speculation shifted to restrictions being lifted early due to vaccine rollout.  That is why it made it back to 30.  I was warning that they were wrong.  The balloon popped.
03/24/2021,stocks,the risk buying at $11 is much lower than buying at $25.
03/24/2021,stocks,No guilt dude. You were trading the market like everyone else.  You just made good plays.
03/24/2021,stocks,Keep deluding yourself.  Fauci is Biden's chief medical advisor and he has been clear on this.
03/24/2021,stocks,You people are letting your rage cloud your judgement.  I got the same arguments during Part 1 and 2 of my warnings.  You people refuse to trade the environment you are in and instead try trading the environment you want.
03/24/2021,stocks,may your calls rest in peace.
03/24/2021,stocks,Why do you keep trying to trade based off what you want?  The current administration doesn't give a fuck about what you want.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Maybe you don't and thats fine, but plenty of people do, will, and allready have."
03/24/2021,stocks,"What speculation?
From who?


I have read articles, seen news, and seen YouTube media as far back as January 2021 that the worst is not yet done for leisure and airlines as many countries are going into lockdown, once more.

The news from the CDC is at no surprise. 

The balloon hasn't even been inflated to pop."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It’s not faucis choice. And eventually, lawsuits will come out for restricting businesses with no merit. People will vacation no matter what and the cruise line industry will be next"
03/24/2021,stocks,"The environment we are in is that cruise lines are seeing pent up demand that isn't showing any signs of receding.

If you want to make a purely political and/or legal argument, make it.  If we are trading on what consumers want, they will have no trouble filling these as soon as they are able.  And whether they will be able to soon is right back to that political/legal argument.

I am skeptical of the federal government's ability to continue to prevent them from operating."
03/24/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/24/2021,stocks,You think they are going under. I disagree. I think if we keep the country locked up and starve businesses you will see another complete market crash let alone CCL.
03/24/2021,stocks,From who? The market dude.  Why do you think the price made it to 52 week highs last week? Just started moving based on nothing?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Biden has entrusted Fauci with the job of chief medical advisor.  Fauci is making recommendations.  What part of this are you not understanding?

May your calls rest in peace."
03/24/2021,stocks,"1) You are buying the pent up demand bullshit being pushed by the cruise lines.  Dumb.

2) It doesn't matter what consumers want.  The political/legal side of things won't allow it.  Again. Dumb."
03/24/2021,stocks,There is that rage I was talking about.
03/24/2021,stocks,"
You just come on reddit to prey to persuade CCL holders to hopefully sell.

14 days is not a warning for something that has been going on for over a year. 

Nice job shill."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yea well see how long father fauci holds businesses back. I’ve never seen a man go from the most loved man in America to having thousands of death threats in a year. And I don’t have any positions in cruise lines.
03/24/2021,stocks,">The political/legal side of things won't allow it.

You just keep repeating this, though.  I specifically asked you to make the legal case."
03/24/2021,stocks,why do you think it started running a few weeks ago to 52 week highs?  just based on nothing? no shift in speculation?
03/24/2021,stocks,He has no reason to change his mind now. He has the full support of the Biden administration.  You are letting your hatred of Fauci cloud your judgement.
03/24/2021,stocks,"The same way the government can shutdown other businesses(restaurants, bars, spas, doctor offices, etc) for not meeting health safety standards they can shut down cruises. I have no idea why you are unable to grasp this."
03/24/2021,stocks,Dude everything is going to open up when ppl are vaccinated.
03/24/2021,stocks,"yea and that's definitely not happening by July, the Biden admin's been pretty clear that September is their optimistic estimate."

03/24/2021,stocks,Hold
03/24/2021,stocks,"Why did you buy ? If your reason of buying haven’t changed , then why do you want to sell ?"
03/24/2021,stocks,These look like long term holds so why are you worried?
03/24/2021,stocks,I would just hold and build your portfolio. Also maybe try and buy stocks after they dip. Not when they are mooning
03/24/2021,stocks,My buddy sold gme literally hours before the big squeeze. You just never know when and where. Did you invest for big payday then hold.
03/24/2021,stocks,If you don’t need the money let it ride. Stock market has always been a long game. Especially strong stocks like AAPL.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Unrealized losses at 1500 out if 10000, only gonna lose if you sell. Hold till it comes back. If you break even and want out, do it then. Then save your money for when the next pullback happens"
03/24/2021,stocks,Stop being emotional and hold if you want to make money
03/24/2021,stocks,You should do your own research and get more more information about each stock. Only you can decide what’s best for you.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Do you believe the companies have a future? Did you do your diligence on these companies before buying? Do you believe that the ark etfs and the person who manages it is a successful investment?

If you answered yes to these questions then the answer is simple. 

Now if you want to day or swing trade, that's another conversation entirely and comes down to where you think your most profit comes from. 

But if you are investing, and you believe these companies will be successful moving forward, then why sell?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Please explain why the “buy high sell low” approach to investing seems rational to you.
03/24/2021,stocks,Don’t change your plan unless your thesis is no longer valid. Also they are all long term plays. None of these are high risk gambles. Time in market > timing the market
03/24/2021,stocks,"Soon as you sell, shits gonna moon

If you like the stock, you like the stock!"
03/24/2021,stocks,What do you guys think about the ARKF and other ark funds
03/24/2021,stocks,I have many of the same stocks.    Be patient and don't peek from day to day
03/24/2021,stocks,"Unless you're going to need the money really soon then I guess yea probably be best to sell, but if you don't need it, if you like your positions & still believe in them, just hold."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Most of the advice here is horrible. Buying at ATH is really irrelevant, if you avoided buying at close to ATH at the time you would not have bought most stocks over the past two years and missed out on tremendous gains. With the exception of AMD and AAPL you invested into hyper risky stocks/etfs. Combine that with the fact that we’ve had almost 5 years of tech being valued at 30 times it’s p/e looking forward and the market was bound for a pullback. The problem is when you try to time it, there is no way of knowing when a pullback or bull conditions will occur and anyone that says anything differently across a sector is always wrong on a long enough time frame. There’s a quote that hammers the point home, “time in the market beats timing the market.” Have you considered broader etf’s instead of picking individual stocks? QQQ seems like a more risk adverse play than your bundle that has seen great returns. Also, the comment from the person saying everything is tanking because of GME is literally insane, true short float is 20% currently. I made 1000% on my calls the first run up, a few hundred on stock in the second, but have always known it was a $12 stock."
03/24/2021,stocks,They may take a few months or longer to recover but I think they are all good stonks
03/24/2021,stocks,Looks like you made some good choices. I would hold.
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you are not worried about wash sales, I would sell (Highest cost) only to improve your cost basis. Historically, March is the second worst month for the stock market."

Later (defined by your timeline): Reassess your reason for buying, assess your goals, make small adjustments as necessary- walk away, focus on life"
03/24/2021,stocks,You can always sell calls to add to your position.
03/24/2021,stocks,U/Hesheboii I don’t believe in riding stocks down. I sold and looking for reversal to buy back in. Right now everything is much cheaper than when I sold so I’m ready. The only things I’ve kept are CVX and WM.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Aapl LT hold... Look at their history, stock splits and dividends, keep it during the good times and the bad..."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That is what a ""Stop Loss"" is for.  To limit your downside."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Price matters,  I get that you like the product,  and it is a good product,  but would you have bought your AMD processor and Coursair RAM if the price was  10x, or 100x higher than what you paid?  If yes, then the company has pricing power and might be worth keeping because they will raise prices and sell the same amount (higher margins).  I don't buy high end gear and wouldn't pay much more for something marginally better than the competition but you would know better than I would. 

The other reason to think that the stock is going to go up is if you think they will sell more.  Do you think the number of PCs sold will be 10x or 100x more?   Or maybe the number sold stays the same but 10x or 100x more of them shift from INTEL to AMD chips or from (I have no idea who the competition for RAM is) to Coursair?   The third reason would be if you think they have new product coming that will  (without cannibalizing existing products) sell 10x or 100x?

Investing is much more than liking the product. Good companies at the wrong price are bad investments.   Bad companies (tobacco) at a good price can be a good investment."
03/24/2021,stocks,That’s the plan
03/24/2021,stocks,I bought because it was green and thought it was going to keep going up!!!!!!!!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good advice, my reasons for buying haven’t changed"
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah that’s the big mistake I noticed I made. I tried to not time the market and just hope they would keep growing because I didn’t have patience. Next time I will not buy at the ATH’s.
03/24/2021,stocks,I agree and that’s what I have been told. I will give it time
03/24/2021,stocks,I was being emotional a couple months ago but quit worrying so much for the past couple months. I haven’t been tempted to sell at all until now. I just wanted to know what my best option going forward was.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I edited my post explaining why I bought each stock. I didn’t buy any of them on hype or technicalities, so I think I made the right choice and I believe they will do well."

03/24/2021,stocks,I like the stock!
03/24/2021,stocks,As soon as she started talking about how god told her to start the funds I was out. She’s loco and the funds ran very hot all year ly
03/24/2021,stocks,I agree
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I plan to"
03/24/2021,stocks,You think I’m joking?
03/24/2021,stocks,yeah if you liked them before either add to your positions or just hodl.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Horrible timing. You've got to learn that the market is cyclitic and so certain sectors take turns going to all time highs and then some. When their time is up... they're supposed to fall to a reasonable buy prices before going up again, IF they're good companies.

With that being said, I don't give financial advice."

03/24/2021,stocks,Hold it if you don't need it for immediate use!
03/24/2021,stocks,No I was taking you seriously. Sorry if it came off wrong
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ok, last March Dow was 18k

I held and added more of what was cheap at the time

Ended the year green 

The fact is hedge funds have lost their pants in the GameStop and meme stock episodes and they are shorting the market across the board in a planned attack

They will stop when they have recouped some of the losses"
03/24/2021,stocks,"It is more institutional investors locking in gains and cycling out of growth because March 31st is the end of the financial year in a lot of countries.  

This always happens, just not usually this dramatically.

If April is still a major shit show than we have more fundamental problems in the market."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Interesting take!  Serious ?, how can one detect that HFs are shorting like that?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I agree
03/24/2021,stocks,Word gets around. I know people who work for these funds. Meme stocks put a hole in many hedge funds. It will continue through the year. They will short at every opportunity
03/24/2021,stocks,No other real reason for the market to behave like this!   Has rising interest rates caused you to sell? No!
03/24/2021,stocks,AAPL bottom jeans
03/24/2021,stocks,Just buy now and keep buying on red days. Don’t over think it on a company this powerful.
03/24/2021,stocks,If the markets keep sliding then there's a likely chance you see the same 116 opportunity.
03/24/2021,stocks,110 is my target though I bought some at 116 while planning to buy more if it gets there.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Seems like AAPL is going to keep getting shit on,and retail investors are going to keep buying it. The hedgies are going to squeeze the weak longs as much as possible, then scoop up the crumbs as all the new investors puke out what they thought was the safest of all investments. 

AAPL $85 by June."
03/24/2021,stocks,AAPL was one of my most stable stocks and the drop today was discouraging. I certainly hope it doesn't drop but if it does I hope for both our sakes it goes back up as I'm in it for the long run also.
03/24/2021,stocks,Boots with the fur
03/24/2021,stocks,I would like to lump sum as I don’t have that much cash compared to other investors. My bank fees are also $10 per trade so it’s a bit steep and I would be only buying 10 shares
03/24/2021,stocks,If AAPL hits $110.00 I am taking all the money I have in my checking account and buying AAPL that day.
03/24/2021,stocks,You really think it can get to 110 that would be amazing but I feel 115 already be pushing it. But I’m super new to investing so I don’t really know
03/24/2021,stocks,Tell your friend you know someone with an avg of $19.42 :)
03/24/2021,stocks,My dad loves to rubs it in my face he got in at $10.

03/24/2021,stocks,You’re going to need SPX to dip near $3200-3300 for that to happen.
03/24/2021,stocks,It was a 2% drop. You are making it seem like it’s the end of the world.
03/24/2021,stocks,Shouldn’t worry too much it seems to have very strong lower end support. Demand will increase once there’s news.
03/24/2021,stocks,The whole club was looking at her.

03/24/2021,stocks,"$10 per trade!? That is insane. CAnt you get a broker with much nicer fees?
For the record, not everyone has so many thousands of dollars invested. I think 10 shares are quite much.

Dont undervalue your own money just because others have way more. $1200 is a lot."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Solid chance if it falls below $118 it can lose support to the $100-110 range if the bears have their way. Lot of pressure against it right now since AAPL has such a hold on the market and skittish holders trying to take profit after last year’s gains. Personally I’m buying every time its at or below $120. 
With that said if it falls below $120 with a low IV before EPS I’m going all in on calls.

They’ve just been quiet since last EPS after getting violated for making too much money. Making solid moves, through more buybacks, their expected earning estimates went up generously, and there’s the looming prospect of a formal announcement of the car which will probably cause another runoff. Any day now formal invites are going to hit for their next rollout hype goes up, EPS comes then we’re back to praising Tim Cook."

03/24/2021,stocks,For apple it's certainly not. But when a lot of my other stocks dipped AAPL were pretty stable - this time I wonder if it's more of a canary in the coal mine for the correction that people keep talking about.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Lmao, truth... It's been up and down from $116 back up to $127 and now to $120... Aapl is solid LT... Last Friday huge support at $120, it closed at 119.99, someone worked really hard for the $120 plus call options not to hit..."

03/24/2021,stocks,I'd also reach out to r/personalfinace. If I were to guess the 270 is another tax return (state or federal) and not the stimulus check.
03/24/2021,stocks,I don’t believe this stimulus was protected so I think debt collectors were able to take

03/24/2021,stocks,That’s a question for the government.
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m not sure but I think this stimulus the irs was able to take if you owed money

03/24/2021,stocks,"I feel really bad for you.   I had a run in with the NY State tax people (entirely their fault) and it was a nightmare.   I wasn't a NY resident (military gets to keep their original state of residence, but they kept sending me bills and were really horrible to deal with.   Your comment about being on hold for 18 hours and hung up on isn't an exaggeration (the 18+ hours will be spread over multiple days because they don't work much each day.   I sincerely wish you the best of luck. 

That said,  if you need the stimulus money for bills,  you should seriously consider keeping the rest in a savings account.   You can't predict some low probability bad thing happening that sends the market down 50% across the board.  Unlikely,  but get the personal buffer secured first,  then when you have at least $10K emergency cash, look at putting something in the market.  Look at the drop last March, it could happen again for a different reason,  if you predicted a global pandemic a year ahead of time in 2019 they would have put you in a loony bin."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Is it possible to receive more than one tax return?  Also, if the IRS tracker said the payment was due today then what happened to the actual payment?"
03/24/2021,stocks,This seems like a reasonable explanation if she recently filed her 2020 taxes.
03/24/2021,stocks,So I just got home and she showed me the deposit and it literally says EIP3 on it so I'm fairly certain its the stimulus.
03/24/2021,stocks,Any idea who we can go to to ask these questions?  Like is there a helpline?
03/24/2021,stocks,We did not owe any money.
03/24/2021,stocks,We filed taxes a few weeks ago.  So that shouldn't be it.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have a savings account with enough in it that this money disappearing would just be a bummer.  I just have already dipped into it the last few months and I'd rather not again, especially if I'm expecting money, for exactly the reason you said I should have one."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I do know that sometimes the state and federal returns arrive via direct deposit at different times, so this may have been the case and then you would have multiple returns. Also, the IRS tracker may not be perfectly accurate in terms of timelines, so it may be delayed. I'd give it another week or two and see if the numbers sort themselves out."
03/24/2021,stocks,Have you bothered to try googling?
03/24/2021,stocks,":( dam then I wouldn’t have any clue, I hope you all the best and hope you get some answers"

03/24/2021,stocks,"Ok.  Thank God.   The way you wrote your original comment had me sad.  Seriously,  call the IRS, you have no choice but to put up with the atrocious ""customer "" service.   It's unfortunately the only way to get it resolved.  Good luck."
03/24/2021,stocks,"So far this is the most plausible explanation (assuming its not the obvious one) but my mother had already received her tax return that she expected is the one problem.  This would be extra.
And she has never received separate ones before this."
03/24/2021,stocks,"While that's a fair criticism.  I was hoping somebody might be able to explain the issue before I have to wait on hold for 18 hours only, be hung up on 163 separate times, only to be told that they are closed and no longer accepting calls at this time until I finally catch them and then find out they have no idea either."
03/24/2021,stocks,Thank you.
03/24/2021,stocks,I did not file but my mother did and received her tax return already.
03/24/2021,stocks,Theyre closed right now aren't they?  I think im fukd either way because I don't have time during the day to call.
03/24/2021,stocks,How much did she owe?
03/24/2021,stocks,Idk the specifics but she says she doesn't owe anything.
03/24/2021,stocks,This sounds like a call to the IRS then.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't think it's malicious,  but there are a lot of people who recently got into buying stocks because really,  what else was there to do for the last year?  They think ""an investor "" buys and holds,  and that's almost true. They miss the part about buying things that are undervalued and and having a margin of error,  and then holding because even if it goes bankrupt the assets are worth more than they paid.  The down voting people (i think are just young and ignorant, oh I wish I could go back to those days).  Just ignore them. 

Buy real value, not what everyone else has bought,  and track your performance to a benchmark.   If you are buying big companies then compare how you do to the S&P , if you're buying small caps, track the Russell.  Use the feedback to get better."

03/24/2021,stocks,I bought stocks at the close today to hopefully sell tomorrow for profit.... if not I will average down
03/24/2021,stocks,"Interesting point - what is an investor?

* If you buy and hold a close-end-fund, does that make you an investor?
* If you hold a stock for 1-2 years for the capital gains, does that make you an investor?
* If you leverage your knowledge about sectors (e.g. Pharma and the COVID vaccine) and move based upon the news, does that make you NOT an investor?

Your time horizon at 20, may be different from someone managing generational wealth.  The timelines will vary, as will the reasons why a person ""invests"" in a stock.  

If there is a better option, if there costs are mitigated by the gain, and if you take cash to exchange it for ownership in a firm ... doesn't that make you an investor?  

Regardless of how long you've bought for?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"It seems that on a down Dow day, people downvote more.  I get more upvotes when the market is up.  Might have to do with crowd psychology or something."

There’s definitely a bearish tilt on the market at the moment, but it’s not going to be permanent. The more credibility you give the bears by panic selling the worse these corrections will be. Eventually, just like bulls, bears get cocky about the volatile state of the market get caught and go back to hibernation to stock up on low volatility puts till it’s their season again.

Worst case if you’re holds are high enough open some calls during this time of crazy volatility and find profit where you can take it. Sad to see GME fall, I was getting to used to selling two week out $400+ calls at $40 premiums."

Dont buy bonds, they are illiquid and useless in the hands of an average person, look into 10 and 20 year bond ETFs if you're interested in that but right now the best thing is to have cash on hand and wait."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Wouldn't do anything. I'm heavily into growth as well, but there seems to be little sense in selling this low only to catch the last drops left in the barrel of the rotation to value stocks. I've been buying stocks that are heavily beaten such as $OSTK or $TREE. Lots of assumptions, just my 2 cents."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You seem worried about losing your money. If you are all in tech, maybe reevaluate your risk tolerance. After the dot com bubble the nasdaq dropped 80%, and that is an index, many companies that are still around today dropped 90%+ and they didn't go bankrupt or anything they were just overvalued. I'm not saying this is going to happen, just that you should be prepared if it does, and hedge or something at least, compared to someone in their 20s who wouldn't be that bad off if their small egg goes to zero."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like steel, hopefully China cuts the rebate EOM."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ive been investing in foreign materials (Rio, Bbl, and Vale). If FCX drops below 30, I will buying that too during this dip"
03/24/2021,stocks,TLT. Bought a call 3 days ago and am up 40%.
03/24/2021,stocks,That sounds like great advice. Maybe I’ll take a breath and quit checking my balances lol.
03/24/2021,stocks,do you have stocks or options ? Because if you are in stocks I wouldnt even care about rotation or fall... Tech is very safe bet in a long run... Can you imagine future without Tech and its ability to inovate?  ( not a financial advice)
03/24/2021,stocks,"yep. at this point, it's just chasing.

The rotation sector is already overbought, and selling tech at a loss, just to enter the rotation which has no more short term profit left, is dumb"
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm actually going to set up a new brokerage account so I can just leave my current one and hopefully forget about it for a few years. Time to start anew with a refreshed strategy.
03/24/2021,stocks,"i remember 2000, people tried this with the nasdaq

80% losses

lol"
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes no actually bonds here. Funds tho. I don’t understand them or what makes them move. Is cash better than a bond fund right now? Ug so many of my investments are growth. Sounds like I need to be patient
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thank you all, kind strangers, for engaging with me here!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"That makes sense. Just never thought all that much about hedging. Personal Capital says I’m about 25% tech, 12% Communications (but mostly internet related), 11% financial (but a lot of that is fintech). Most of these aren’t going anywhere. I think reevaluating my comfort with risk is where I am. I still have 17 yrs or so of income so it seems there’s time."
03/24/2021,stocks,How are you invested in steel? Through a particular company or ETF?
03/24/2021,stocks,Tech will grow. Remember this. We’re only just getting started.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not the same thing, tech companies are now the biggest in the world with actual earnings and market power."
03/24/2021,stocks,"lol this is not the crash dude, wait and see"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you want somewhere to park significant cash and not worry about burning it through inflation for like a year then go for the bonds, if you mean bond mutual funds, avoid them, bond etfs have lower MERs and give you the same return. If you plan on getting back in the market within a couple months once things settle, then just hold cash. If you want something low volatility with some growth potential still then look into low volatility ETFs like this https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LVHD/holdings?p=LVHD"
03/24/2021,stocks,Ive invested in STLD and FCX (copper/ Green tech play).
03/24/2021,stocks,CLF.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Companies, mainly one, I’ve got quite a few saved to favorites but my portfolio is not large enough to be diversified all across the board so I just went for one company that seems undervalued but is not going to benefit from Biden’s 4T infrastructure deal as much, but will benefit more if Asia is going to use more for the domestic market and less for export.

I do believe there is a steel sector ETF out there by Van Eck, I can’t buy it though it’s not on my broker."
03/24/2021,stocks,"PKX is a big South Korea steel company I've been looking at,  but the price ran away from me before I picked any up.  If it comes down a chunk I wouldn't mind buying some."
03/24/2021,stocks,When you are looking for legendary drops in video games but only get them in your portfolio. 🤣

03/24/2021,stocks,This is a Corona virus recap. It's so far from what happened in the market today...
03/24/2021,stocks,Where are you copying this crap from? All of those upgrades are complete trash.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah red days like today can be tough
03/24/2021,stocks,My pleasure! Glad you found the recap useful!
03/24/2021,stocks,My pleasure!! Happy to help
03/24/2021,stocks,The coronavirus situation around the world (and a multitude of other factors) all effect how the market performs. Don't understand what you mean
03/24/2021,stocks,"A screener by marketbeat provides the daily analyst ratings changes, I'm just passing on the ones I found interesting, just the messenger. I have little to no opinion on them, just passing on the info like I do with all the recaps.

03/24/2021,stocks,Yesterday wasn’t great either

Upon searching Allen's recent history of upgrades and such... he hasn't done any in over a month. I'm doubtful he's going to pop up out of the blue to upgrade something he doesn't even cover.

The link within that top article leads to... NOWHERE."
03/24/2021,stocks,The upgrade has a NAME tied to it. That particular analyst doesn't cover apps. It's simply a paid fake upgrade to dupe people into losing money before a big dip.
03/24/2021,stocks,"So I wrote a 500 word recap to hide one tiny bullet point in order to pump a stock, makes a lot of sense.

Best of luck moving forward my friend, today was a tough day in the markets."
03/24/2021,stocks,"People are emotional and reckless. Also if you’re watching meme stocks it’s a lot of younger, less experienced traders."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Institutional trades or FOMO. There is however a whole strategy geared around sniping after hours peaks when volatility is high. The good ol pump and dump.

Pretty much every random article you see pre-market that says “Reddit Traders are eyeing this stock for the next squeeze!! Don’t miss out!!!”

On cheaper, already low volume stock in ext hours it doesn’t take much motion to get it moving and for an interested party to dump hard and fast."
03/24/2021,stocks,I set up most of my trades in the evening because it would be distracting to be staring at the market while I'm at work. Is that not a common scenario for retail investors?
03/24/2021,stocks,Some of after market hours trading are execution of old selling price agreement. It works almost like option. Big institution can agree to sell $13.5 to institution B by this date. It’s 2 companies agreement and not presented in the option market
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s probably big investors getting ready for the next day
03/24/2021,stocks,"That's exactly what I think it is. You see the lowest offer is whatever amount, and convince yourself that the price really has risen. IDK, sometimes AH is great for getting a little discount, but some absolutely ridiculous stuff happens nearly every day."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The return on this one would be pretty amazing for day traders, and I totally understand that side. It's the people actually buying in that confuse me. The particular one I'm talking about today lost support with every single movement. There was one time where it almost seemed like it might break out of this trend, but that ended up not being the case. The stock lost more than 15% just today. Now, normally when I see these things I really want to jump in with some stock at least, so I don't blame them for paying a little over the closing price, but I saw sales happen at 13.80 after a close of 13.22 or so. I think it's absolutely crazy, but maybe they know something that I don't."
03/24/2021,stocks,This is the top voted reply of previous similar post. I have no idea how to verify this claim
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes it’s more than likely these are transactions in relation to forwards which are not executed on traditional exchanges. Forwards are typically agreed upon contracts between two large institutions but act similarly to futures in many cases.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think I  just notice it so much because I watch multiple meme stocks. I think it's more likely bad decision making, but sometimes it seems the post/pre market actually influences the the day... Just really weird to buy one persons 100 shares at a markup when only minutes before you could have bought ten times as many for far cheaper."
03/24/2021,stocks,The SKT one a few weeks ago was wild. Saw a few articles and sure as shit took off and crashed 30% within a 30 minute stretch. I do wonder who gets on board with those plays.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Oh. Well that's interesting, and I think it seems completely plausible."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I gave this some thought, and it seems this would be a risky transaction to try and complete. It's sort of like an individual trying to transfer assets at ridiculous prices to another account; sure, low volume might provide a chance to do this, but if the transaction ends up with another counterparty you will have no recourse.

&#x200B;

Edit: on second thought, large institutions probably have access to much more direct routing methods than individuals."

03/24/2021,stocks,The stock shot up from $25 to $50 when Cathie Wood announced ARKX (space etf) a few months ago. Anything that shoots up for basically no reason can crash down for basically no reason.

03/24/2021,stocks,No sail until Nov 1st.
03/24/2021,stocks,I don’t even think I want to pay attention to the stock market this week. Something is wrong somewhere.
03/24/2021,stocks,"&#x200B;

these stocks have run up a lot the last few months, and gotta lock in profits before the paper tendies disappear again"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Just follow some news man.. 

CDC keeps restrictions up"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because prices and valuations got ahead of actual tangible recovery. Optimism fueled the rally and now people have doubts as to how fast things will actually recover. This means that the share prices, based on expectations, can quickly correct. All you need to do to see that this is the case is pull up the amount of debt major airlines and cruise lines took on to survive covid and look at how the share prices performed since the vaccine news first hit in November. That debt will require servicing, and as rates rise that becomes a bigger problem."
03/24/2021,stocks,Well cruise lines are up to their eyeballs in debt so theres that. Maybe people dont think the profits are going to be that high. I don’t hold either right now.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Stocking going down is a good thing for people looking to buy stock. Airlines, oil/gas, cruises aren’t going anywhere. I say, ‘Good keep going down.’ And if you already have stock in these then buy more."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's going to be years, maybe a decade, until travel is back to where it was in 2019. Some people can't wait that long for profits."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tbh, they are easy buying dips, airlines and cruises will go up eventually, vaccinations are still going fast.

Tech is more uncertain whether its a dip or its actually going to go on"
03/24/2021,stocks,Maybe vaccine passports are going to be more real than we were going to give them credit for...
03/24/2021,stocks,"Like Buffett said last year when he sold off the rest of his airline stocks, they’re unpredictable. For example, UAL broke up $20 in two days. Seemed to have support, dumped another $10. Then this morning was up almost 6%, but still closed red. Airlines are even unpredictable in normal times. They’ll bounce though.

It’s just a bearish market because of a few rough weeks. Tech dump, retraction to $370 SPY, and the bond hike spooked people out of the markets since they’re not returning 10% every month and SPY calls aren’t instant win lottery tickets. Rate of buying calls is way down so we might see things speed up once the bears are safe on their $395-400 offerings."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yup just came out this afternoon
03/24/2021,stocks,"I genuinely don’t get it. So much positive has happened since Biden has taken over. We are way ahead of the vaccination schedule and optimism everywhere seems to be steadily improving. Yet stocks are dropping almost daily even as positive news continues to come out... why?

It’s not even relating to bond yields, those are in check and even when they go down, the market seems to suffer. None of this makes sense."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Cruises I can understand more so than airlines. Travel has steadily been improving and up until about a week and a half ago, the stock prices were reflecting that. Then, out of nowhere they just started tanking.

???????

Logic > everyone is getting vaccinated even sooner than we thought and people are now realistically being able to make travel plans sooner than we thought > oh yes let’s panic sell all airlines because reasons

?????"
03/24/2021,stocks,Nobody is saying the industry as a whole is going to be where it was at pre Covid by anytime soon. I’m talking about what has changed over the past 2 weeks to cause the entire industry to tank. There’s just nothing to support it.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Got a link?

Edit: Ah this is for cruises not airlines. Makes much more sense."
03/24/2021,stocks,Positivity is subjective. The market is forward looking and most likely reacting to the potential for higher taxes and increasing the corporate tax  rate in the near future.
03/24/2021,stocks,CDC kept restrictions until Nov.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yup read this article from Forbes magazine you understand why the market might be tanking  with Joe Biden[Forbes magazine article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2021/03/23/biden-administration-urges-supreme-court-to-let-cops-enter-homes-and-seize-guns-without-a-warrant/)
03/24/2021,stocks,People create theories as to why markets do what they do. To be honest the actual answer to why X happens to Y stock is likely “because it did”. Everyone else is giving their opinion as to the cause. Nothing has to make sense just because we want it to. Look at the price to earnings multiples based on FY 2022 and that may give you an idea of how stretched multiples were.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have this conspiracy theory that airlines are tanking because big sharks want to stock up on them cheaper, but that's just my crazy theory"
03/24/2021,stocks,"There's a general decline in share prices going on at the moment. Everything is dropping with few exceptions. As one industry drops, they pull the others down with them. It's about relative valuation. It gets more obvious in a bear market."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Is it though? When airlines say future bookings are at their highest point in a year and daily airline travel is continuing to steady trend upwards each week, is it subjective to say people are itching to travel more?

I don’t think so. 

Also when airlines say they are projecting to stop bleeding cash, which they have been doing so for over a year, within the next few months, is that me being subjective in saying good things are around the corner?

I don’t think so.."
03/24/2021,stocks,I have said for months they would crash if you think they are a good bet then you have not researched the industry thoroughly.
03/24/2021,stocks,I was referring to the overall market more than just airline and cruise stocks. But I do believe positivity is subjective in this case since you could also look at the fact that all of these companies will be burning cash for months to come and could take longer to recover than was previously anticipated.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Your guess is as good as mine. 

First it was the yields, then it was inflation. Powell gets on the microphone and sneezes and NASDAQ drops 1000 points. Could be fear, could be manipulation. The only thing we can do now is hold or buy more, selling has long passed. Stay strong my friend!"
03/24/2021,stocks,I suppose it's because of the global semiconductor shortage situation that seems to be hard to sort out.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Insanely high tech valuations. That's the easy answer. Stonks don't only go up. Correction comes sooner or later. And now that we might be fully reopening, money is going to be moving to other areas of possible growth. Another reason is fears of inflation; that hits tech stocks way more."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The Internet was a passing fad, the newspaper is making a comeback"
03/24/2021,stocks,Even my tech stock that was considered greatly undervalued is down significantly in the past month. This gives me hope that this is a temporary trend.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yields are rising. Fed said it’s a good sign for the economy. Stocks will react eventually.
03/24/2021,stocks,What age range holds the most money in the market and that should tell you everything you need to know.
03/24/2021,stocks,My guess is because of the upcoming Congressional hearing with the big Tech companies
03/24/2021,stocks,No idea. Yields have been going down today so your guess is as good as mine lol
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because they are over valued and their growth for the next ten years has already been priced in.

It's important to realize that just because a company is solid doesn't mean its stock will perform after *you* buy it, since most likely, you'll be buying when it's already too high."
03/24/2021,stocks,Anyone who can't figure out what is going on in the markets recently needs to stop trading. There is more pain as more accounts go upside down.   Tech is sold to cover other losses. Stay long and keep some cash to buy the lows.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Almost nobody beats S&P 500 long term. All of those triple-leveraged, actively managed, super fancy and expensive funds... they all underperform S&P 500 because of positive skew that S&P exhibits. Long term that positive skew will make it very difficult to beat S&P. 

Positive skew means that mean is higher than median. So for any given stock in S&P 500, probability of being better than the half of all stocks is .5. But probability of doing better than the average return of all stocks is less than .5. 

Also, since S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, as prices of some companies increase, they move up in the ranking/weighting of S&P. As others decrease, they move down. 

So long term S&P will beat almost any other investment. 

You will have periods where tqqq will blow S&P out of water though. So please don’t come after me with how much better tqqq did last year. Of course it did. But for a buy and hold investor...S&P is pretty much as good as it gets. And that’s not even taking emotional/irrational decision making and fees into consideration"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because their fundamentally over valued and the market is forward looking to where bond yields would rise ? That's just a guess. No one really knows why stocks pump and dumb , just assume market activity is being done by a crazy person and use that as an opportunity to buy at good prices."
03/24/2021,stocks,"My thoughts have been the same. Heavily leaning towards manipulation. The media narrative just isn't adding up. Yeilds rise, stocks go down. Yeilds drop, stocks go down. Good covid news, stocks go down, bad covod news? Stocks go down. Etc etc. It's like the media is just fishing for excuses to cause further panic so those hedgies can buy the massive dip whenever they feel the time is ripe.

Edit: perfect example is when the media preaching how stimmy was epic for stocks in early 2021, and the market listened and stocks sky rocketed. But now stimmy is bad according to the media, and they preach panic. Ugh"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think that with tech valuations so high, the market for them is just really twitchy. A lot of it is just sector rotation IMO."
03/24/2021,stocks,Manipulation is my bet. Its amazing to see how the media can manipulate the rise and fall of GME. Same story here imo
03/24/2021,stocks,"But why are semi stocks tanking? Shouldnt supply and demand be boosting them? Or even the notion that it wont be like this forever should have them trading sideways.

TSMC tanks... why? They supply all these big tech companies and those companies are only going to need more in the future."
03/24/2021,stocks,Hahhah
03/24/2021,stocks,Which stock is that friend?
03/24/2021,stocks,"A week ago Tdameriturd has $FUTU as a number 10 outperform super buy at $140, i bought, even with 800% yea you read that right 800% growth over the past year and 200-300% expected growth this year its now at $104 with no bottom in sight. Lol even with the drop its still a number 10 outperform super buy. Thanks TD."
03/24/2021,stocks,Any day now
03/24/2021,stocks,"Problem is, all value stocks are overvalued, too"
03/24/2021,stocks,Would you mind expanding on your reasoning?
03/24/2021,stocks,"S&P 500 top holdings are still tech stocks, though, so there's that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Its not manipulation, nobody has that much money, the explanation is so simple that nobody seems to want to accept it. We've had a year of insane bull run in the middle of a pandemic where half the world stopped working, the markets are inflated and higher interest rates will eventually have to come along with all the quantitative easing governments instituted at the beginning of the pandemic to give the economy training wheels."
03/24/2021,stocks,This. The media narrative trying to explain the market actions of the past month or so have become comical. They’re actually beginning to sound foolish at this point because they’re now contradicting themselves and/or coming up with fresh rationalizations attempting to explain a pretty significant market bleed in certain sectors.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, it feels like a rebalancing of portfolios. Market is going down, but the amount getting purchased by institutional holders is going up like crazy. Sure we might see another 10-15% pullback, but before we know it there’s a new iPhone release and product lines and tech is back.

Personally I’ll keep buying the dip the whole way down. Happy this month I could finally up on NVDA, AAPL, and AMD."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Or...could it just be the wild run up all of last year had to slow down eventually? No, that would make too much sense."
03/24/2021,stocks,There’s a LOT of tech that needed a reset and their values ran too far off over the past year or too.
03/24/2021,stocks,Probably CRSR.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Normally you will get trashed on rational views but why not. What are factors facing markets right bow pressuring some really good stock. These will not be in any order. 
1. Yields lower valuations 
2. Blown out portfolios of yolo trades blowing up all at once.  Forced selling. 
3. Influx of a boatload of new ipo and blank check listing saturating the markets. 

Today's main driver for this move would be #2. People who may not have fully understood the trades they got involved in and by high sell low or buy really high and get forced to sell or accounts frozen sold off can ripple across markets."
03/24/2021,stocks,And as you can see I am voted down for being rational. That thought process is called a shill. But markets are showing us what's going on.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes!  But if they start tanking, their % will start getting reduced automatically. And other winners will emerge."
03/24/2021,stocks,Tempted to buy more of them...
03/24/2021,stocks,It was positive for some of today at least 😌
03/24/2021,stocks,You’re being downvoted bc your response was very surface level and non impressive relative to your confidence in your original post. “Stop trading if you can’t figure this out.” Followed up with reasoning that reads like you ripped it straight from some bs cnbc article at the top of google
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks for answering anyways, I appreciate it"
03/24/2021,stocks,I don't watch cnbc. I watch markets on a terminal. I honestly hate to see so many people getting hurt. I've posted in detail previously the insides of the trade and how it would end. Honestly even I thought the trade would last a little longer than it did. I was also in the trade. Today to me there was a market direction with the exception of a handful off really hard hit stocks. I saw many people on these very boards asking for help. It's to obvious to ignore.
03/24/2021,stocks,No problem. If your in big tech at good entry points close your eyes and wait for you target prices to add. The best money is made after corrections. Today clearly was not a ten year issue. If you look at many account posting today people asking for help on locked or sell only accounts. It was only a matter of time before this spilled into other stocks. There are a lot of people who are getting really hurt right now and that's never good. But to blindly follow others into a trade without understanding it. I guess is on the user.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Commodities *tend* to be safer during bear markets, but it’s modest returns and even those can go south. I personally would hold steady until we get a real confirmation either end of the week or into next week. Posturing or rebalancing now could be a bad idea. If there’s a strong retraction most everything minus VIX will lose value so getting in early might be futile. Same goes for the other side pulling out of solid positions could hurt too.

Often it’s better to stage your buying and set price points on companies you’ve wanted to enter and take downside bearish estimates with some credibility (those far downsides can be superbly profitable if you’re not overspent). Don’t rush in early since there very well could be a bigger blow coming. I’m going to continue to buy more reserved and speed up as the market drops. 

Sure this is obvious, but don’t touch options when volatility is this high. You can often even lose money when you’re right if things go too south.

Overall, just be patient. There are still bullish indicators out there and real support levels haven’t faltered yet. Bears have been feeding well over the last month too so some real resistance is necessary to break the cycle. Everyone just seems uneasy because the reality is that nobody know whether we’re going to continue growth, dead cat bounce, correct, collapse, or anything in between. Just present moment the market isn’t really moving which is what everyone seems to be waiting for."
03/24/2021,stocks,What are examples of commodities?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Gold, silver, carbon, gas, water, electric. Firmer physical assets. ATT is another solid company for rougher markets, large government contract holding, huge amount of IP ownership through their media subsidiaries, HBO Max has a lot of promise, and they pay massive dividends to the tune of almost 7% annually."
03/24/2021,stocks,Should buying stocks on margin be illegal? You're just borrowing money to buy a stock in that scenario instead of borrowing the shares themselves.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Shortselling is really important because it usually prevents bubbles. And you have to look at it this way: When you don't own any shares, there is one option to be long (buy shares) and one to be short (shortsell shares). If short selling would be illegal, there would be no option for somebody to bet against a stock without having to own the stock in the first place (forget options for a moment)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Shorts are very risky to pull off, but why would they be illegal? In the end it's just like an options contract. You agree to return someone's shares eventually and until then you pay them interest. It's not like someone's putting a gun to your head"
03/24/2021,stocks,I mean I dont like Shorting stocks and never did it but I dont see how it should be illegal? If people want to do  it let them do it.
03/24/2021,stocks,"You have to buy back what you have shorted anyways, so you are even."
03/24/2021,stocks,"By your logic, there are also two ways to affect the market going up... buy a share, buy to cover a short position."
03/24/2021,stocks,From what I understand shorts can be healthy for the market. Naked shorts on the other hand are complete bullshit and should be illegal.
03/24/2021,stocks,"A lot of the time hedge funds short a stock it isn't because they think it will go down, it's a way to isolate a specific bet.  

Example,  I own shares of CHKP which has a high amount of shares sold short for a large stable company making huge amounts of money,  doesn't make sense right?  

Well the reason is that they think a different Cyber security company will grow faster and gain market share.  Now if the entire market drops for unrelated reason they lose money on the growing company and make money on CHKP, or vice versa.   Either way they are even.  

 The only way they make or lose money is the bet that the growing company will do better relative to CHKP.  It's not that they think CHKP is bad, it's big and stable and they can borrow shares cheap so it's a good stand in for the general cyber security sector."
03/24/2021,stocks,I don't like the practice at all and won't do it myself. That said I don't see any reason to make it illegal.
03/24/2021,stocks,"There are two ways to ""buy"" and two ways to ""sell""

When you short a stock you have to ""buy"" it to exit your position, and this is the type of ""buy"" you missed out"
03/24/2021,stocks,There is a place for shorts to ensure businesses are legit and it acts as checks/balances.  I do however think shorting synthetic shares or specifically shorting to drive the price down in order to manipulate the stock should be stopped.  The retail investor is at a huge disadvantage when comparing to the institutional investor.
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s not really about changing the price yourself. Or anyone else for that matter. You cannot make any impact yourself at all because of the sheer size of the market. Short selling is really just a hedge for your bets if you think there’s gonna be a downturn. It’s not a tool to drive down the price yourself at all.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m no fan of shorting, but most who do have balls of steel and stand by their convictions. You can pretty much lose an infinite amount of money if you get squoze!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If buying stocks on margin would be illegal, we would have less severe crashes and a healthier system. Buying stocks with debt is insanely dangerous."
03/24/2021,stocks,You are right... i did not think about it!
03/24/2021,stocks,Another question: what would be the counterpart of short selling? Buying a share?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Hahaha good point .

Anyway maybe i was not accurate explaining myself(english not my native language) , but i am talking about methods to influence the stock positively or negatively."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes but when u cover a short position u have selled 2 shares at the end, and just bought one..."
03/24/2021,stocks,I am assuming that bcz counting the methods to affect the market we got 2 vs 1 situation. We got more chance to earn money shortselling instead buying a share . Its a 66% vs 33% situation
03/24/2021,stocks,"My point was in both scenarios you are borrowing in order to either buy or sell. But people ususally only have a problem with short selling and not buying on margin.

Obviously it is dangerous to buy stocks with debt/margin. But you could also just go take out a loan to buy with that debt instead of margin if it was made illegal."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes. You can either have a positive or negative amount of shares.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Shorting is a way of hedging against loss's in your longs. Let's say you are long a solid company, it might be a good idea to short garbage at the same time. Hopefully in a rational world, the garbage will go down much faster and you'd make money while your long losses only a little."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Two ways to buy --> Buy the shares, cover the shares you shorted

Two ways to sell --> Sell the share, short the shares you borrowed. 

&#x200B;

Or another way of looking at it. You can enter and exit a position (long or short) in two ways

1. Buy 10 shares of YYZ, sell 10 shares of YYZ
2. Sell short 10 shares of YYZ, buy to cover 10 shares of YYZ

Not sure what you mean by ""selled 2 shares at the end"". When you buy to cover you don't have to sell those shares again."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but it would be wayyyy less convenient if you have to do it this way 😅"
03/24/2021,stocks,"So, summing up, if i sell, the stock go down, if i go short, the price go down, but if i buy a share the price go up. We got 2 vs 1. mathematically i have more chanche to earn shorting then buying shares. Its 66% vs 33% 
What am i missing?

Ps. I know that a single person does not matter at all, just talking on limits"
03/24/2021,stocks,Ok now its very clear to me. Thanks a lot! 🙏🏻
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but if you are short you can cover your position and buy the share. So you can actually buy and sell in every situation. But you have to start with the situation where you have no shares at all: you can short the stock and have a negative amount of shares or you can buy the stock and have a positive amount of shares. If you already have the stock, you can again sell or buy it. And if you have a negative position in a stock, you can sell and buy as well."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Its 2:2, not 2:1

Buy on margin

Buy with cash

Sell stock you own

Sell stock you dont own (shorting)

Also, if you look at an index, it is much more likely you make money in the long run by going long instead of short. So no, mathematically you are not more likely to make money by shorting just because of that alone."
03/24/2021,stocks,"No, this is rotation.  Look at the charts of the broader indices: the damage has been mainly contained to the Nasdaq and Russell.  And even within those indices there are still lots of stocks holding up well.  The percentages of stocks above their 200 DMA and 50 DMA are still quite high, which suggests the carnage is limited to a select group of stocks."
03/24/2021,stocks,If the reverse h&s in Nasdaq is invalidated tomorrow i m selling at a loss and buying lower
03/24/2021,stocks,I hear the same screaming too. I bought some nice opportunities today. Pretty hard to predict if tomorrow opportunity will be better. But one thing is for sure: with market so red selling would be a big mistake. Time for patience in holding
03/24/2021,stocks,I just keep buying VTI and I'm happy.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's a little bit of both to me:

**Rotation**: some sectors have been doing well: industrials, materials, real estate

**Sell off**: S&P 500 p/e ratio is at 39. That's an insane number. That's the highest since before the dot com bust. So the market was due for a correction, if not an actual crash (let's hope not)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The biggest differential I have ever seen between the Nasdaq and Dow, around 2%.  Thankful the spillover is not too badly on value stocks yet."
03/24/2021,stocks,Anti-hype forces strong against stocks that have shot up. Some big bubbles bursting now doubt will have most facing collateral damage.
03/24/2021,stocks,Charts flashing red is a buy signal. The sell signal is green.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Lol. Your strategy didn’t include rising rates. Which have been going down for years. Until about a month ago. 

That’s not a sell signal, just a rotation signal."
03/24/2021,stocks,"seems like noise from institutions and new investors who don't know what they're doing.. The long term (and even the near-term post-covid rebound) outlook for US Stocks is up and to the right, by a lot.

Gonna keep buying."
03/24/2021,stocks," The fear is high, I buy"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Why would you ever sell? Assuming it would be for profits, than OK. Otherwise, why?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don’t know, I like steel, it’s needed and at ATH prices and the stocks are undervalued, dividends are coming for some too."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Dude, the S&P is like 1% below it's All Time High.   The market is doing great.  It's been going up nicely and if history is a guide it's going to keep bouncing slightly in a continued upward trajectory.   When the charts have a death cross,  then you should start worrying."
03/24/2021,stocks,No sell. Only buy.
03/24/2021,stocks,"On the contrary, buy and Waite. When you sell, somebody else will get rich!"
03/24/2021,stocks,It's called manipulation. Stock Market is manipulated. Invest in companies based off of valuations and you will do well. Trade based off stock movements and you are playing their game. You will likely lose.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it’s Big Money throwing their weight around.  My theory is that they are preventing a quick recovery.  They are controlling the price and slowing it down, sucking as much money out of stimulus and new retail as possible.  Somebody prove I’m wrong!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"a 2% drop and all I see is whining

jfc even last march we were getting 10+% red days week after week"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Your strategy you used for years?  WTF?  My strategy changes on an almost daily basis, sometimes intra-day.  The markets don't care about your strategy."
03/24/2021,stocks," Anyone who watched Yellen yesterday would dump everything and hold cash. She could barely contain her panic. The entire US market is a zombie market of companies with valuations from 2-100X their actual worth that's been allowed to lurch forward due to free debt for 13 years and investors pumping their money into them because they have nowhere else to put it. The mere whisper of a .25% increase in interest causes a massive selloff. There will be a 20-30% correction this year, mark my words."
03/24/2021,stocks,sold everything  this past week  my  cash  is parked in my  fidelity account.
03/24/2021,stocks,XBI has been absolutely slaughtered.

03/24/2021,stocks,We are seeing the beginning of a historic market crash that will really kick off in June
03/24/2021,stocks,What are we rotating to?
03/24/2021,stocks,"this is one of the MAJOR red flags. some also call it reverse cup n handle, w pattern, many names but this is huge and on many of the high growth sectors.

i hope i'm wrong."
03/24/2021,stocks,I think the rest of March will trade sideways like this and then start of April will be green green green then slow down at the end of April. Still an upward trend.
03/24/2021,stocks,"This. I am a bit of a moron myself so I bought a couple of calls today, but overall a lot of nice opportunities"
03/24/2021,stocks,I am a huge believer in VOO/VTI. Tried my luck with few stocks these few months (while keeping majority in VOO).  Ahead about $3k... just sold all idiot stocks and will stick with VOO again going forward.
03/24/2021,stocks,"> The biggest differential I have ever seen between the Nasdaq and Dow, around 2%.

03/24/2021,stocks,5% = slaughtered? is this a joke
03/24/2021,stocks,"The S&P 500 alone went down 184M today. That is more then the swing in GME. Then add the Russel, the rest of the US market, Canadian market, commodities which are also down mostly, the market probably dropped more then the entire value of GME. Despite what a certain sub wants to believe, GME doesn't have that much sway on the market. 99% of investors don't even know how it moves. The only time it .at have had an impact was that 1 day that was a shit Show, but not because of GME, more because clearing houses and brokers were actually worried of their potential losses. One broker going bankrupt would be more damaging for the market than GME going to 1,000

Also GME was down. If they were covering, wasnt the whole theory that it would shoot up?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Us apes bought more gme today. It went on sale.

Well, my high div ETNs are paying out."
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m already all in.

03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve been getting fucking destroyed too
03/24/2021,stocks,I feel exactly the same. Get even more frustrated when I read that the S&P and Dow are still close to their all time highes and Nasdaq only lost 7% compared to the top in Februari. Meanwhile mine portfolio is down 21%.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Definitely not just you. This month was rough. Up and down, buy dip, small up, bigger down, buy dip. Down down down. 

Down the same 20% too. Have a pretty diverse portfolio, had some pretty nice wins on meme stocks. But all my long term hold are killing me. Hang in there!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same. It’s depressing. I’ll get crushed in one sector one day, then that sector will slightly rebound the next day and I’ll get crushed in another. I tried recalibrating my portfolio and reduced my tech exposure and increased my oil/travel names and still got hit pretty hard. I’m not sure what to do at this point to stop the bleeding.

I can just buy top tier ETFs that everyone says are rock solid.

It makes zero difference. Everything just goes down. Everything turns red. 

It's not just you."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep, same boat.  Really happy to have jumped into the ARK ETFs, EXPI, and PLTR in January (sarcasm).  Personally, the bulk of my portfolio is in an S&P 500 ETF, so I’m fine but yea it sucks to watch this correction.  

How long have you been investing?"

I’ll have a bad red day, then the next it’ll appear as though I’m going to break even or make a slight profit. Like an idiot I hold, and then boom. Drops even lower than the last day.

Sure, depending on how long you've been in the market you are most likely positive overall, but the whole market is down today. Trust your investments. This is what the market is all about. It's up and it's down. Close your apps, turn off your computer, and check your accounts in 6 months.

03/24/2021,stocks,Even my few stocks to have survived the last market dips are now also plummeting as of this week. My “best performers” are now just stocks that didn’t fall as badly as the others because none are green anymore. Haha
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yup. And there seems to be no real reason. At first it the rotation, but other sectors are getting hit hard. Then it was the bond yields. Then it was Powell's statements. Now none of that is an issue and everything is falling."

03/24/2021,stocks,"sell some covered calls and use the proceed and cash to buy the dip... for someone who has been holding TSLA for 4 years, these recent movements feel routine and nothing special."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Won’t be able to buy my mansion now....  :,(

It ain’t fair."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know you don't want to hear this, but VTI is up 3.14% in the last 30 days.   VOO/IVV/SPY is up +1.20.   I guess you probably knew this since you said the indexes aren't dropping.

The advantage of something live VTI is that you own \*ALL\* of the stocks.  So if tech is down a lot, but others are up, you're generally up. 

The problem with picking individual stocks is that they are not guaranteed in any way, shape, or form to follow the index.   Just because the market goes up, doesn't mean your stock picks are going to go up.   The only way to guarantee this is to buy a stock which tracks the index.

I personally try to have 95% of my holdings in a three-fund portfolio consisting of VTI+VXUS+BND(with a bit of BNDX).  The other 5% I can dabble with the high volatility stocks and ETFs, which are biting everyone's rear right now.   And the downturn right now is a good example of why.   Over the last 30 days, I'm up, even though I do hold things like ARK funds and TSLA in my 5%.   

I will say that once I realized how difficult it was for even a professional stock picker to beat the market on an long-term basis, investing in the 3 fund portfolio became a no brainer.   I really do enjoy trying to beat the market, which is why the 5% is reserved for this purpose."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You're not the only one, I'm seriously so close to to throwing in the towel, I've lost close to 40% of what my portfolio was before this. I'll have a somewhat decent week and lock in some gains, next week those sectors will tank, so I rotate over to a sector that's performing better and that sector tanks as soon as I get into it. I can't win and I'm getting so discouraged."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Similar situation here, but I am a bit more tech heavy than you, also like 20% in clean energy.  Compared to my mid Feb high, I went down at some point about 25% down (first week of March), then recovered almost half of it in the tech rally after that, and one more day like today, and I will be back to that level again (despite buying some dips). 

But one thing I learned from last year crash is sometimes no action is the best action you can take when the market is so volatile (If I have not panicked and sold some stocks like amazon, apple, msft, google last year on the crash, I would have gained so much)

Also it gives me peace to know that what I have ""lost"" is unrealized gains and not the money I put in (still up at least 40% in total, but that is over a 5 year period), and do not need the money in the near future so I will keep holding for a year or two...."
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve stopped looking. I’m confident in my portfolio. Fuck it.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah last couple mo the have been bad. At first it was like ""opportunity calls buy the dip."" Then it kept dipping. The nasdaq bloodbath led me to start rebalancing and invest in consumer goods instead of speculative tech. Dudnt help. Even s&p 500 funds feel like they trade sideways."
03/24/2021,stocks,This is why i like dividend investing mixed with index fund investing. When the prices drop i buy index fund but when the s&p is high up i (try to) buy some  high dividend paying stonks that are undervalued this way i have some cashflow and the uppside of the S&P. But don't take my word this is just what works for me.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Industrials, materials, and real estate have been the most positive sectors over the last month. And it doesn't look like you have anything there."
03/24/2021,stocks,That’s kind of what happens when you buy at the top
03/24/2021,stocks,"Just my humble opinion but I think your exposures to tech and to a lesser extent travel/consumer discretionary are too high right now. The tech growth sector is coming off of rapid and massive growth after the pandemic dive and I think a lot of that has been mania induced. Many of those businesses just recently hit ATH's that are sky high relative to their pricing history (even relative to the last 2 years), and at some point a bull market has gotta end. The bull market (especially for tech) following March '20 has been incredible and, like they say, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Remember that [unemployment in the US alone reached and continues to be at dismal levels](https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm) unseen since the financial crash in '08. It's hard to accept that many companies should be reaching such incredible ATH's in such an uneasy period when many people are scared in general. 

On the travel/reopening, I would just point out that I hope you intend to hang on for the long term. I also made moves on reopening and continue to hold, but my time horizon on those positions (I also have UAL) is *years*. Seeing the rocketing in price over the last month prior to the steep falls this week, I was like, ""Should I just dump this now?"" because I personally thought it was too manic. And of course, I didn't, but I would've made a good amount of money if I did. 

Anyway, that's my bearish 2 cents."
03/24/2021,stocks,i get the feeling more and more that the MM have their algorithms set to track and punish reddit traders for the GME fiasco...
03/24/2021,stocks,"Meh. This is to be expected.

We're in a recession. Just hold. Prepare for two years of problems.

It's magical thinking to expect the market not to have problems after the absolute bullshit of last year. You chose to invest, so I think it's wise to stay invested.

Let your dividends buy the dip. Excellent opportunity.

Stop worrying."

Probably crazy thoughts but I thought it so I said it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I rather like my old slow AT&T that I buy on dips, sell when topping (to lock in profit), and sell covered calls against it that either expire worthless or buy to close for profit. And all the while earning a 7% dividend.

03/24/2021,stocks,"A 20% loss will have a considerable impact on your 5 year outlook in most cases. It’s not just you. I’m a bit more leveraged into growth assets, but am also relatively well diversified. Down 25% since beginning of feb. The time to sell has come and gone. Hold or lean into it. Except TSLA, PLTR and ABNB. All 3  way over valued still. I’d dump those on any significant strength. Look at $BAND if you want growth oriented tech that has a healthy balance sheet, good fundamentals and a great valuation"
03/24/2021,stocks,Same. Total destruction. I have a similarly diversified portfolio and my total loses are about as bad. Basically lost my gains for the year over the last month
03/24/2021,stocks,"Down 15 percent from ath, stings but patience is the key here"
03/24/2021,stocks,The last 3 days killed 3 weeks of gains for me. This week has been brutal

03/24/2021,stocks,"The whole planet has been in a year-long lockdown. Economies shrink, political situation is rather unstable regions wide, some sectors almost burned.

And a lot of companies have their valuation today times more than before pandemic while their real-world results haven't improved even close to that.

It's been a wild year with some enormous shift towards ""believes"". Investors believe Tesla is worth more than 10 biggest auto makers and will grow three times more. Investors believe Nvidia will dominate whole GPU market. And AMD will. And AMD will dominate CPU market as well. And ARM will dominate CPU market, of course. And all of that will somehow happen simultaneously.

It's happening in other sectors as well - companies got huge market caps on expectations only.

Current correction is finally something healthy. I'm not sure it's enough, though, I genuinely hope it will continue for a while."
03/24/2021,stocks,Just hang on. It’s because interest rates and inflation are going up. It’s a correction so just hold onto strong stocks with good fundamentals and you’ll bounce back.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I sometimes look back at my peak in late January, up 124% from my initial investment. I will never see that return again though I’m trying to focus on “if I was bullish at $40, why wouldn’t I be more bullish at the dips when I can buy more?” Though it’s difficult not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and wondering if that eventual light is a train."
03/24/2021,stocks,I dont know when you bought but when you only have winners even from worse sectors they are bound to do worse at some point.

These are my long term stocks but the hits are brutal. My short term portfolio is looking a lot better (Jan. 2020) but has dropped 15% since the beginning of March.
03/24/2021,stocks,"same, i made a reopening pie on M1 last summer and am not seeing the gains one would expect in said ""rotation"", real estate and aerospace holdings - trash/trading sideways, retail down, tech down...just melting down all over 🤷🏽‍♀️"
03/24/2021,stocks,"My portfolio's value topped out around mid-February at an invisible ceiling. My portfolio rises to that ceiling then immediately turns the other direction for the next few days. It bottoms out then rises to that ceiling again where the process repeats.

Been trying to buy in lower with the dips though. So when everything goes back green, the gains should be nice."
03/24/2021,stocks,Buy that dip. Remember....eventually everything will go up
03/24/2021,stocks,Nope up 12%
03/24/2021,stocks,We all in this bro hang in there. I got 50% of my portfolio in tesla so every 1-2% up or down im clenching my balls. If you believe in your investments just hold and spend som time on other things you like.

I have about a third of my portfolio in high-risk growth stocks like PLTR, NIO, TSLA and such. 

I was literally taking screenshots of my portfolio about a month and a half ago since it was getting super high and I was so excited. I guess this is just the opposite of that. 

I know it sucks, but I’m sure within a month or two things will rebound and will be looking very pretty like before. Maybe not but I’m sure they will cover eventually sooner than later."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The market is acting weird right now in that it is trading around interest rates. If rates go up, growth, no matter how much cash they may have on hand, gets destroyed, and if rates trop, growth soars. 

What's funny is that these value companies are trading at nearly the same ridiculous valuations as many tech stocks, yet they have no growth or are shrinking. It's a good time to begin adding to tech if you have cash. The Nasdaq is back near correction territory."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think you guys should take it a bit easy. There is still one bigger sized correction pending this year which I hope you guys will not have too much of a mental breakdown seeing Nasdaq at 11k, but rather as an opportunity to invest more on good stocks."

03/24/2021,stocks,"What I don’t understand is this. 

Everyone is bitching about how bad the stock market is. But when you look at the SPY graph there was a MUCH bigger dip just a few months ago and many many big dips in the past year. I only started investing in January. Does everyone get this whiny each time a dip happens?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I was up 20% in 2021 up until this week. The past 3 days I’m done like 10% across the board. I’ve been slowly averaging down 2-3 times a day and the dip keeps dipping. Figure I’ll be happy in a couple months if I keep slowly buying as it dips.

You should already know price points to enter new stocks or avg down when the times comes. I was down about 300k a year ago due to covid and thankfully I followed my rules of having %20 cash min in my account. This is where you grab your nuts and buy when everyone else is selling.

Only been trading since last July and just found out the importance of diversifying across all sectors 🤣 Also realised I am not a genius and I got extremely lucky this past year and cant wait for my positions to rebound a bit so I can rebuild my port mainly in Blue Chips, couples ETFs and about 10% max in high growth speculative plays"

most of the shit you see on the internet is bs, except for yields putting pressure on stocks (because it does make borrowing and corporate debt more expensive and growth stocks rely on debt), and sector rotation (you can track that on simple excel sheets and you will see that actually happens on large scales).

Btw, nasdaq is also 2% down, not sure what you mean by ""stable"""

I’m in ARKG, BP, and SPDR Value ETF just to name a few that have also bled me lately. I think BP upsets me the most as it’s there both for energy sector exposure and a cyclical reopening play, and both of which are supposed to be where the money is rotating if you ask the news (as well as bond markets)."

03/24/2021,stocks,"That's what the market does, just chill and don't look so much for the next week or two. We're in pretty volatile times but as long as you have good conviction in your stock picks you should be all good, just hold and chill."
03/24/2021,stocks,"OK

I took a position last month as safe as can be (total world market index 40% home country 30% USA 30% international) and am down... a tiny bit, as of today. I am not worried, because I will get dividends, and recovery later. Yesterday I was up.

If you are 20% down it's possible your picks lag the index. This is a normal discovery. If you find your picks can't beat the index after fees and time invested, move to index investing. The problem is it may take you a very long time to learn say five years that you lag the index... so you have to make a decision do you really think you have knowledge and skills that can beat insider knowledge and beat priced in? Or is it all gambling and luck?

Cash out on the next rise and you won't lose"

I think it is the whales getting rid of the retail traders myself... they're down huge... especially on options and you know those folks are almost all in tech.

03/24/2021,stocks,So you’re telling me that I can buy things other than tech/growth stocks?
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you’re 100% in equities you’re not diversified...

Also you own several stocks that are direct competitors..."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Lol same. I survived the first dip after being down around 20 percent climbed back up into positive range, then even got superlucky with one of my stocks which nearly tripled and was up about 15 percent in total beginning last week. I kept buying as it went lower since i felt like the major correction was over and just today I plummeted into negative territory again now being down around 5 percent on the year. Oh well. 

The market seems difficult right now with no clear winners. Im being careful with throwing in additional funds now but will be holding my stocks since nothing has fundamentally changed with the companies. Guess we just have to be patient."
03/24/2021,stocks,"MDCN life boat hold don’t get in if you can’t hold it’s at the bottom .0008 what you got to lose is 5000 going make you or break you .... only thing is you gotta hold  they don’t make real estate anymore 

Hold is the key word in MDCN"
03/24/2021,stocks,SQQQ call is my only hope. SMH
03/24/2021,stocks,Down 20% here too
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know this is a stocks sub but over in cr*pto land experiencing the same shit, just emphasizing the point that it’s every sector . It’ll bounce and bounce proper , but feeling bored rn ."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not just you, I have a lot of the same tech stocks as you lol. Seeing as I’m 28 these companies have been successful most my life. They’re down right now haha, it’s okay it will go up, that’s just how it works. I’m learning this also. I almost pulled out my investments but I gotta remember it’s for the long term, this dip right now is short term!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, if you are down 20% in this type of month you should probably just get into VTSAX especially if you are already trying to be so diversified into like 20+ names. Would also be curious on when you got into these names because my financials have been killing it.

Growth stocks have definitely gotten hit and retail / cyclical rebound stocks are always going to be choppy. You're making risky bets. Expect risky results.

Edit: Also one of the three major indexes, the Nasdaq, was down 2% today. Don't know how you can't see that isn't aligned with how much of your portfolio is tech-aligned."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm up about 2.5% YTD.  The last couple of days have been pretty hard.  About 50% of my portfolio is in a target retirement fund.  The other 50% includes some tech and renewable energy which has cost me but hasn't cost me too much.  The real savior, it seems, has been 25+% in tobacco stocks.  Every single one of my tobacco stocks in in the green this year.  Some are just hovering above the line, but MO and BTI have performed wonderfully.  PM hasn't been bad either.  I have about 15-20% of my portfolio in these 3 companies.

I thought I was just being a rascal because I used to smoke and I feel like I'm still psychologically semi-addicted.  Something about owning tobacco companies gave me a little rush, lol.  But I actually did the DD and really liked what I saw.  I imagined these stocks would outperform when the market slows down.  So far I've been right.  

Of course, the last 2 days some of these gains have been erased.  But they're still my strongest performers by far.  Not huge gains, but when everything else is red, green looks good.  Let's see if this trend continues."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it’s same as everyone, I was down another 26k today"
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes. I’ve been red for quite a while now
03/24/2021,stocks,"I thought the stimulus checks would give the market a boost, but seemed to have opposite effect"
03/24/2021,stocks,"You keep buying.... as the trends shift between sectors...you end up ok... 

Id recommend btc also"
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s pretty obvious. Trading is for the Uber rich. When you see profit sell. That’s why there are laws of having 25k in to day trade. Otherwise you can’t. Markets are manipulated lol. I’m going to start taking my own advice. AAPL only went from $22 to $120 lol we could all afford riding that.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m fully in tech but just with more leverages names and spacs. Down 40% overall and 70% from highs. If you truly believe in the companies you hold, then the price is irrelevant. Unless you hold options, I’d hold

Also, pltr 🚀🚀🚀"
03/24/2021,stocks,"My stocks are all killing it lately. It’s a sea of green for me! Just kidding, just woke up from that fantasy and came back to my reality of red everyday!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"No it's not just you, I'm adding to my holdings, I try to always make sure I have enough money  set aside outside from  my trading  platform so I can transfer money only when it  dips , I was not always sticking to this plan of just buying the dips waiting at least 2 or 3 days from the first dip, , so now I just separate the funds that I may add later to my holdings, It works for me."
03/24/2021,stocks,"March has definitely been a wake up, check holdings, go back to sleep. Looking forward to next week so we can tie a bow on this shit pile."
03/24/2021,stocks,"People were literally saying ""new paradigm"" in feb, like straight out of that meme chart. If you didn't liquidate at least 50% for cash when that was going on I don't know what to tell you."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You own PLTR, TSLA, AMD, and BABA, along with the travel sector that is not going to recover as quick as people think because Europe can not get control of the virus. Maybe realize that a lot has to go right for these companies that are about to have stiff competition from competitors with massive cash flow thus leading to their valuations are coming back down to earth a little bit. I’d continue to hold, but my largest position in my portfolio are FB and LMT. Roughly 50% of my portfolio is in just those two stocks."
03/24/2021,stocks,Index ETF
03/24/2021,stocks,Everything is taking a beating. Which means it's probably a good time to buy. Except it may continue taking a beating so it could be a good time to wait... Either way kinda sucks for those you already bought thinking they were low.
03/24/2021,stocks,It's surprising how much the GME saga is affecting the market as a whole
03/24/2021,stocks,"My Dividend ETF, HD, and BRK-B are doing just fine. Rest of the portfolio has had a rough 7 weeks."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Possibly from shorts who are literally shorting the entire market to drive GME down. 
Between that and fear of a crash, reset and recession. 
Market manipulation is likely the largest factor. Due to the fear in the market. The hedge funds can steal from every sector."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I sold the 2 that were crushing me today and yesterday. Hoping it dimiishes the slide and I can rebound tomorrow, Friday or next week. I'm in it for the long haul but one stock has lost 225.00 of it's value in a few weeks. I couldn't take it anymore and dumped it at a loss. It hurt to do but I couldn't continue to watch the slide."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yup, sucks"
03/24/2021,stocks,Don’t get down everyone is taking it in the shorts. Just hold. There will be a regression to the mean in time. If you can it’s a great time to buy. Once most of the population gets vaccinated the money will return.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I was doing great for a bit, but I’ve lost around 40% in the last two weeks. Granted, this is my “fun money” portfolio where I take on much more risk than my “normal” portfolio or my IRA, but still, it’s depressing. Now I’m to the point where I don’t want to pull anything out, but I’m nervous to hold."
03/24/2021,stocks,">Somehow I've lost about 20% of my portfolio with these names in the last month

How much did you gain since the start of 2021 before it went down? I'm down a bit over 20% YTD but am still at December 2020 levels. It's easy to look at some bad weeks/months and think you lost a lot more than really have. It would have been great to sell in mid February but I have yet to find a good crystal ball."
03/24/2021,stocks,Can anybody tell me why the market has been dumping literally the last hour of trading ?
03/24/2021,stocks,Yep.  It's exactly why I haven't really participated lately beyond goofing off with GME and AMC. Those are the only plays that have paid off.
03/24/2021,stocks,"No sir it is not just you. Today at market close I asked my friend this: 

""Hey, how was the market for you today? Because for me, I got fucked in the ass with no lube. Bitch didn't even take me out to dinner, just took me home and shoved it up my anus"""
03/24/2021,stocks,"It will be ok. Don't panic. Don't worry. We're all eating sh!t right now and it's not just you. 

If you need someone to lean on, inbox is always open brother. Chin up!"
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s not just you my swings have been red for a while and the index’s are near the top. Index’s move up a little and my swings go sideways index’s fall and my swings dive like a brick in a vacuum. Then heaven forbid one swings comes to break even and I tell myself don’t sell for break even and let it rocket up and boom hits my average I hold and it tanks.
03/24/2021,stocks,People pulling their gains after a year from covid crash? We are now 1 year past the beginnings of gains after Covid-19 crash.
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve lost 3.5% in the last 8days. You are not alone. We hold different stocks I sold all Uber last week mgm at 40 financials and tech are going to have. A rough ride. Maybe look into infrastructure the only green I have today is mining infrastructure and real estate as a whole some comms n such but I too feel your pain.
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is what people were saying about “traders” who would show off their big gains online and claim their a “guru” during the biggest bull market.

03/24/2021,stocks,9% down from feb
03/24/2021,stocks,Samesies here
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s not just you. Since January it has been a blood bath. It’s fuqing depressing. I still really like my stock picks...Well diversified and they are all solid picks for growth. But...me thinks there is more to the market than just buying good stocks. There is clearly an oppressive hand dictating what stock prices are allowed to be.
03/24/2021,stocks,"My holdings are: VYM, VWO, VEA, VUG, IDV, NOBL,BLOK, MOON, XBI, O, XLF, JNJ, AZN, POAHY, VWAGY, GM, F, TM, KO, ACI, KR, AGTC, AX and while I haven’t lost my principle investment, I’ve lost most of my gains from the last 5 weeks or so. I’m down 4.24% this week alone."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep man I’m also down bad I was up like 30% and decided to hold and now I’m up .03%

Markets just down bad I guess"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Friends, should I start dollar cost averaging into Tech stocks or arkk or nasdeq ETF?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah fuck this market right now!!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Looks like you're heavy on Tech which is coming down from being a bit overinflated, and most everything else has traded sideways for the last month.  If you bought all of this a month ago yeah that's not good, but if you have been holding for 6 months they were 6 very good months."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's all about perspective. If you have cash at hand, you could see your portfolio that is ""absolutely being crushed"" as all these great stocks on sale, so you buy the dip. Or you could use it as a chance to rebalance your portfolio by selling stocks that are outperforming your expectations and you think will plateau, and buying the ones that are deeply in the red that you believe in, in the long-term."
03/24/2021,stocks,Anyone know best way to predict if a stock is going to fucking go up or go down in order to buy calls or puts? Any tips welcomed!
03/24/2021,stocks,No it’s not. There was some green days for me around the second week of March but other than that everyday since Feb has been red
03/24/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/24/2021,stocks,You probably have 5 stocks i would own and diversification does not protect against systematic risk.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tesla, PLTR, AMD etc are high beta stocks. So if the index (ie QQQ) drops 1% these are likely to drop significantly. I'm bullish on (value) tech right now even though even one is being fearful as nothing fundamental has changed with the large caps in fact things should get better when the reopening happens. Right now the reflation trade in my opinion is mostly done - there is a bit more juice to be squeezed out but realistically you should have been buying financials/energy/cyclicals back in October/November when everyone no one was talking about them. For example, NCLH was was up like 3% today then it dumped all the way down to like -4% at close. Right now the contrarian trade is tech and seasonally tech does well into late Q2 and Q3. Stick to companies will solid balance sheets and cash flow (so they can resist rising inflation) and buy the dip. Good luck and happy investing!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Down 200k. Feels amazing. /s
03/24/2021,stocks,Same... this is the way
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is what I meant by indexes being mostly stable (some people have been questioning me on it).  But if you go back 30 days, when most of these losses have happened at least for me, the Nasdaq is only down 1.2%, the down and S&P are still near highs yet it seems like everything I'm holding in those indexes individually  is getting crushed."
03/24/2021,stocks,"And so you've learned the wisdom of buying and holding the index.

Remember: most people who actively trade don't beat the index."
03/24/2021,stocks,Would be the other way around on a green day

03/24/2021,stocks,"I keep reading headlines ""tech sells off as investors turn to cyclical reopening trades"" and I'm sitting over here holding a pretty good amount of those trades like ""what are you talking about???""  All travel rebound stocks have been plummeting also UAL was at $64 last week and now its back at $54, OXY was at $33 and now it's at $26.  Rebound trades are getting hammered just as bad as tech right now.  I'm guessing due to the new lockdowns but then you would think okay financials should be up given the interest rates and the yields......nope those are falling too.  Well consumer goods maybe with all those stimulus checks?? Nope down.  Just every sector it seems like."
03/24/2021,stocks,If I’m reading Finviz correctly 75% of stocks are under their 200d SMA.

03/24/2021,stocks,"This is the downside of diversifying that no one mentions. Money doesn't tend to disappear from the market, it moves from one sector to another. So it makes sense that if you're well diversified it'll flow out of one part of your portfolio and into another.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately right now we're seeing the contradiction to what I said above, people seem to be pulling out until the Fed rates are fully decided and settled on, which means a ton of selloffs."
03/24/2021,stocks,I suspect it's hedge funds selling off stocks so they can report higher gains for the quarter. It makes me pretty angry their entire business model is built on screwing other investors and leaving everybody else holding the bag.
03/24/2021,stocks,Buy SPY
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is what the market has always been like except for the past 4 years.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Investing since \~2012, I really started getting involved after the crash last year.  So actively investing/trading a little over a year. My first investment way back in the day was TSLA, sold it for a small gain in 2015.....that was a mistake!  So just like that investment I know I'll be fine long term but man 20% hurts."
03/24/2021,stocks,Nothing wrong with jumping in at that time. Alternative investments are also down from that time... ARK funds are 3-5 year holds...
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah I focus way too much on the etfs and individual stocks that comprise like.....5% of my portfolio. When between different s&p etfs and mutual funds make up like 40% of my portfolio.

03/24/2021,stocks,"If you genuinly want an answer, its no single thing. The overall issue is equities are inflated and we have been on a bull run without a big correction for really long. As things open up and go back to normal within this year, interest rates will have to go up, banks will have to keep more cash on hand and that means pulling some money out of equities, inflation and deflation are both possibilities at this point because nobody knows what might happen. Rates going up means profits a year from now are less valuable on top of there already being concerns about certain sectors being inflated. Not to mention the shitshow that will happen once the eviction freeze is over in America and various other countries.

The issue is you are expecting things to go back to normal like they were for the past 3 or 4 months of insane gains and it simply will not go back to that."
03/24/2021,stocks,People are being more cautious since anything can literally happen at this point the profit to risk ratios are not looking to good
03/24/2021,stocks,its those pesky people over at r/WallStreetBets. probably.

03/24/2021,stocks,"The S&P is 2.14% from all-time highs... 

What this shows me is that lots of people bought pure hype, with no regard (or most likely: knowledge) to the cash flows of the companies vs the price you paid. 

Well now you're seeing the value of your investment as the hype has slowly worn off.

Let it be a valuable lesson to those who look at a stock graph that goes up and right and make an investment. 

For people looking at red: INVESTING HAS TWO COMPONENTS: THE PRICE IN WHICH YOU PAY AND THE EXPECTED RETURN OF FREE CASH FLOW. THAT'S IT. IF YOU CAN'T GIVE A VALID HYPOTHESIS WITH THAT INCORPORATED YOU SHOULD BUY AN S&P FUND!

I am also curious if I should buy right now."

03/24/2021,stocks,Question now is when does it stop?
03/24/2021,stocks,Ha. I remember that post very well. Its why I didnt buy the dip but instead just held to what I already bought and been waiting till this whole thing blows over. Only change I did was shovel cash into VTI per schedule.
03/24/2021,stocks,Even my index funds are seeing red lately. Or going sideways on a good day.
03/24/2021,stocks,People here do it to themselves. I’m up 3% since January because I mostly hold a retirement date fund. There’s a reason these exist.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Maybe i missunderstand something but i get the feeling that many people at least on Reddit go in way unprepared with the wrong expectation. Like most people put more research into their phone or car than they so with their stocks.

I haven`t bought anything other that classic index funds yet but before i invest even 100 bucks i'll read a few books for example by B Graham, learn about discounted cashflow, read annual reports and forecasts and even then pick up mainly proven companies like j&j oder Coca Cola assuming they fit my criteria. Also gonna keep a decent amount in etfs anyway. The rest goes into what might be ""the next Amazon"" but probably wont. I also think that most stocks have to be held at least 2-3 years to show their true value. Probably longer. Unless u do small caps or day trade ofc. Which the average person seems to suck at.

Maybe i overcomplicate shit but my thought is that if it was easy, more people would suceed harder."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> Lost 7% portfolio value today. It sucks, but that's part of the game

Which is mental because I've seen many people say something to the effect of ""If you're really really good at this you can expect to see maybe a five or 7% gain in a year""

So being down 7% in one day... Ugh... Excuse me while I take an entire year of my life to make back that one day of losses just to break even..."
03/24/2021,stocks,Same here... although $GME was ~4% of that so I fully own doing this to myself

I still have cash on hand but the bleeding has made me think twice about buying these dips further.  20% definitely hurts and is probably going to take some significant time to rebuild."

They’ve had there ups and downs over the past couple months but most are still near ATH and the nasdaq is only down less than 2% going back 30 days. Yet somehow my portfolio is down much much more than that. So I felt like I was missing something, and was questioning if it was just me.

With it in headlines all over, chance are I'd be too late to reap the benefits by the time I tried. Furthermore I know nothing about most of those companies so I wouldn't have as much faith in them, and if the recent fad is to zoom into that crud, then it stands to reason that stuff will fall out of favor eventually too.

This goes ten fold for new investors. You will see red for a while as your new portfolio swings with the market. As long as you are invested in fundamentally sound businesses you don't have to worry. Your investments will build and your portfolio will handle corrections better. Hopefully, getting to a point where you don't even blink because you understand this is normal. 

On the surface it sounds like you have done your homework and made educated decisions on where you want to put your money. You haven't dived headfirst into all meme stocks like others have mentioned. The market is a marathon, not a sprint. 

Do yourself a favor and go back and look at the S&P over the last couple decades. You'll see it down and take a year to come back up to its previous high, but eventually it beats that and sets a new high, leading to a higher low and on and on."
03/24/2021,stocks,"While generally true within the last decade, the decade before that - not so much. If you purchased S&P 500 ETF in 1999, you still would've lost money come 2009. It's due to the back to back crashes but the point still stands that there are times in history where even an entire decade isn't enough to get net positive. 

The difference is that if you consistently DCA in positions following the Dot Com bubble, you probably would've made out pretty well (as long as you also didn't dump a ton into investments right before the GFC)"

Will buy back in when the next dip happens. Should be around $28.50-$29 range."
03/24/2021,stocks,"7% is the average index return after inflation over a long enough time span. But someone holding that index may have many -5 %to -7% days. Which are offset by +5% and +7% days. 

More typically though what you see is a 2% year, followed by a 20% year, then a 12% year, then a 6% year. Or something like that. It is lumpy but averages out over time to 7% if you’re in the right index.

03/24/2021,stocks,Even the low valuation stocks I'm holding are dipping hard.

03/24/2021,stocks,Pretty much all of the tech/growth stuff you have is up triple digits in the past year. When the market has a red day those stocks are going to get beaten down more than the market. RKT is more of a legit stock than Tsla and Pltr. Tsla and Pltr are overvalued af.

I like to go against the grain, thinking I'm somehow getting in on something good early only to realize there's a reason no one else is making this play right now.  It take volume to move stocks, without that you're at the mercy of MM"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same. I’d rather invest in what I know than keep chasing the next sector in companies I don’t care about. I feel no one knows what’s going on anyway. One week it’s interest rates, the next it’s sector rotation, then it’s a stimulus package."
03/24/2021,stocks,"it makes total sense.

But who the hell knows anything anymore. The world is completely upside down these days."
03/24/2021,stocks,And to my luck this is where I entered the market. I'm going to be quite salty if I happened to pick the very end of a tech bull run as my entry point.

I'm thinking of shifting to 25% cash here shortly. Minimum. Also shifting more into index funds instead of individual stocks so that big institutions rotating their money don't kill my gains."

03/24/2021,stocks,I was gonna say lol this ain’t inflation. I think it’s investors scared of inflation and then transferring those fears to their investments. 10yr treasury yields increasing got people worried.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Congrats, you don't understand inflation."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That’s what people forget when looking at charts. Sure if you invest a lump sum and it takes you 10 years to break even it sucks. But if you DCA during the down time then your investments during the crash work double time for you on the recovery. So by the time you hit the break even point again, you are sitting on a nice gain. Your initial investment may have made 0% in a decade while your DCA investments maybe make 30% or so. This mitigates the harm. 

Investors have a tendency to assume their investments now will stay stagnant at the mercy of the market but you should always be investing every month of every year if you want to come out ahead."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, this is an important point.

If you've got a bunch of meme stocks, well, they might regain what they've lost, and they might crater and never recover.  Probably worth at least keeping an eye on them."
03/24/2021,stocks,There is a difference between low P/E and value. HEAR is a pretty shit company.
03/24/2021,stocks,So their PE is even better now!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Do people buy Amazon because it's well valued at current price or because everyone here is saying that Amazon is good buy at any price, i.e. yes it's a meme"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep, thank god I planned for a long term here. I also looked at September incident that happened. It took I think month or two to come back. Although right now is a different market from half a year ago. We'll see."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Actually, when people say ""if you BELIEVE"", what do they actually mean? Do everybody here actually do their full DD? I would say it is hard to believe. There are around 50 companies in ARKK I think. That's too much work. And there are lots of people who want hands off approach including me.

I do believe in Tesla long term. But I did no tech or any other company analysis."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Been buying index funds for a year, and so I'm green overall but the ones I bought a month ago are destroyed."
03/24/2021,stocks,Cool. Telecom sector looking good right now IMO. Large infrastructure push is coming and the economy is recovering

03/24/2021,stocks,"Ohh okay, so we're using technicals for fundamental analysis now. Cool."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think even most low valuation stocks are still higher than they typically run. Hard to pick examples indicative of the big market but my first thoughts were these companies. Comparisons are of eyeball 'normal' PE ratios to todays

Proctor and Gamble - PE ratio is 25, slightly higher than 'normal' of 20 and traded sideways today. 

Walmart - PE ratio about twice as high as 'normal'. Down 0.63 today

Coca Cola - PE ratio normally between 15-20, now at 28. Up 0.25 today

JnJ - normally around 19, now around 30. Could be in part because of vaccine but up 1% today

JPM - normally around 10, currently around 16. Up 0.75%"
03/24/2021,stocks,Damn I think you're right.
03/24/2021,stocks,The only way?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Interesting. My mind has been defaulting in the opposite direction lately. Same scenario; foresight tells me get in on X before Y happens. Investment goes red, I conclude that everybody had the same line of thinking as me, and the smart people were a step ahead, causing me to buy at the top, and the smart people to sell after I jacked the price up.

Reminds me of the iocaine powder/battle of wits/“which cup has the poison?” scene from The Princess Bride, and I am the dead bald guy. It is, indeed, inconceivable."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you’re gonna be a contrarian, it should be *against* whoever the hedge funds are sizing up. Evidence shows the ball is always in their court."
03/24/2021,stocks,As if.  We didn't even really lock down the first time around
03/24/2021,stocks,"europe is way behind us in vaccine distribution, very much doubt we'll be on the same trajectories. even if we were, americans won't put up with another lockdown, aint gonna happen"
03/24/2021,stocks,Honestly it's a blessing in disguise. You won't be like other amateurs who presume stonks will always go up.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Dude, same. Well I had a minor amount invested for a long time now but I just dumped a good amount of real estate proceeds into the market last week. Wish I would have spread out my investments and did a bit of little-by-little, but we have no way of telling what the future holds. If I zigged then the market would have zagged!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Then just Google “what to do at the end of a bull market”. Problem solved.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Why? Because I bought the hype? I actually did, what I thought, homework."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ahhh I should’ve been more clear. If it was just me owning the underlying I wouldn’t be too upset, but my calls are killing me. I wish I would’ve just seen this coming and put a shit ton of puts on it. I hope it does as you say, and jumps back up a pretty healthy amount before theta kills me or the contract expires. I guess we shall see in the next week or two."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Still, it's akin to political suicide. If donors help the republicans win a house/senate majority in the midterms, which they might if a serious tax hike fucks them, the dems can say goodbye to doing anything for 2 years at least."
03/24/2021,stocks,But treasury yields increasing means people are selling them. It seems just about everyone but this sub decided to go cash gang.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I said, “Not to mention technicals”. Indicating that it was sort of an aside. Lol ppl get so touchy about fucking palantir. Regardless of sp performance, imo it’s an evil ass company and karp is a scumbag"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah a lot of ""value"" stocks aren't exactly good value these days. My low valuation stocks are actually tech-related such as:

SNE - PE ratio 12.6, down -2.6% today

JD - PE ratio 17.5, down -5% today

HEAR - PE ratio 12, down -7.8% today

LOGI - PE ratio 19.4, down -3.3% today"
03/24/2021,stocks,https://youtu.be/k6KfhOpq2n8 That’s just the way it is
03/24/2021,stocks,Cher?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Exactly. I started learning how to trade during one of the more volatile periods of the market (Greece default, Swissy crash, U.S. futs flash crash, etc). It helps to have that experience frontloaded in my brain when we enter shit periods like this one. Not everyone can stomach this stuff."
03/24/2021,stocks,"“Buy bonds”

... Well fuck."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Step 1: Try not to cry.

Step 2: Cry."
03/24/2021,stocks,I thought I did homework as well. I'm sure it'll all be fine and dandy in 5 years.
03/24/2021,stocks,If you did your homework you wouldn’t have bought lol
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah puts are the play unfortunately on GME...I dont like betting against stocks...I hope it Moons brother. These hedge funds doing a bunch of illegal shit
03/24/2021,stocks,"TIL Me saying ""Pltr is not overvalued at $20."" Is getting so ""touchy"""
03/24/2021,stocks,Oh yeah I actually picked up a logi today. I had a few Logi pre-February dip but pre-emptively bailed on a lot of tech expecting the valuations to come back down and Logi doesn't seem too bad. Not familiar with the other tickers but I'll look into them
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know, for me it is pain of being new investor :) Bad timing. I do believe that as new investor and no advice there is so much you could have done."
03/24/2021,stocks,Exactly. ARK is a long play.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not true. I don't think it was obvious neither I think that it was easy for a new investor to predict market. In other words, if you knew that this dip was coming, then you could be millionaire by now. So, how are you doing? :D

Edit: grammar"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m doing pretty well since I closed 90% of my ARK positions in Jan lol. I don’t think you’ll lose money if you hold though. I believe theres still some steam left in the tank, so I hope you didn’t use money you can’t afford to leave sitting for a bit :)."
03/24/2021,stocks,">I’m doing pretty well since I closed 90% of my ARK positions in Jan lol.

That was damn smart move. If not a secret, how did you arrive to this decision? For future reference. Btw, I found [openinsider.com](https://openinsider.com) yesterday. And looks like a lot of smart people bought the dip last march and started selling for the past 3 month. What do these people know that we all don't?

>I hope you didn’t use money you can’t afford to leave sitting for a bit :).

Thank god I was not planning to touch what I invested till I retire. So, this is at least one thing I did right here.

P.S. Actually, I am planning to invest more into the dip right now, Those money will be long term as well. But would be nice to know where the bottom is lol"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have no idea, but you should be able to look at other companies that have gotten the approval and see what typically happens.   I don't play in this area so I don't know where exactly,  but there should be somewhere you can find FDA approval history,  and make sure to look at some rejections too, just so you know what could happen."

03/24/2021,stocks,Oh shit!  This was one of the first stocks I looked at and never pulled the trigger and was very disappointed when I saw it at 70.  What happened?  Why are they being sued?
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can sign onto the lawsuits, it doesn't cost you anything.   You aren't going to get much of anything out of in, maybe a coupon for a subway sandwich,  but you will help make a lawyer rich. 

Companies always get sued when their stock crashes,  the lawyers bring a class action suit and the companies settle for something like $6 per shareholder and the lawyer takes a third since they did all the work,  and send you $4.  Since plug has close to 600M shares at $2 each the lawyer makes an honest days wage.   Of course that's a significant cost to the company so it will show up as a loss making the shares worth even less."
03/24/2021,stocks,First of wall most of the time investments under X amount are not counted into the class action lawsuit. Amounts are ranging from 50k to 150k minimum which seems you didn't invest that much. Whatever comes you are probably not included.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Errors in accounting reports during earnings I believe. It doesn’t sounds like anyone was being sly, just errors in how they reported certain expenses. I was happy to trade it in and out up to 70 and made great money, but then on the correct down to 66, I got back into it, only to suffer all the way down to today."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Damn.  I really hope it was an honest mistake as I really like this company but it is a bit worrysome.  I'm sure we have all heard the ""accounting mistakes"" excuse before."
03/24/2021,stocks,"There are NO honest errors in accounting.   That's not a thing.   Accounting rules are very well known.   Maybe for a lemonade stand size business using quicken, sure,  honest mistake,  but once you hire an accounting department the only way to have errors is dishonesty. 

I'm serious,  I know a company accountant,  the rules are so rigid that they are required to synchronize the clocks in the shipping and receiving bay so a shipment can't be recorded as arriving or departing in the wrong quarterly report by a minute.   Yes, companies used to do that to show more inventory (parts received) on hand and more delivery out.   See the story of Crazy Eddie's , it's good reading."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah no kidding. Gives me the shivers. I think they have good intention and a great plan, but a lot of things are taking the hit on the market for energy and tec. Seems like plug is getting it extra tough."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Don't make such strong statements on things you don't know shit about. I've studied accounting and it can become extremely complex in some cases. For example, a CPA who studied for like 8 years doesn't even necessarily know a lot about tax law, that's what you need tax accountants for. There are various valuation methods for assets, like one of these methods is based on future cashflows, which is for some part just guessing because no one can predict the future. The only thing in accounting that can be objectively measured is cash, profit is an opinion.

How do you even think this works? If there was literally no way to make errors at all in accounting there would be no accountants. There would only be some sort of fraud investigators because every single error would be fraud."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Agreed.  I will definitely be keeping my eyes on this one going forward.  Like I said, I really believe in this one even if I missed the last run.  If this all irons out ok def will buy in."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Sure it's complex, never meant to imply otherwise.   That's why professional business accountants in a companies accounting department make good money.   They know all the rules and how to apply them.  They don't make the type of errors that require restating."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is a 100 dollar stock easily . I been in this thing since 35, took profits and still got some stock riding. I will look to add more to my position but you completly rigut . Once New York and Florida pass their bill eventually, it will keep building steam"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm all with you but DKNG is hurting today, which is why I bought more lol"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I love DKNG and it's one of my largest holdings, but you could argue it's relatively overvalued to any of its peers, a lot of future growth and assumptions are already priced in. You state their total rev target for 2021 is 1 Billion dollars as if it justifies the 87 price target being low, look at it's market cap compared to Flutter for example. What it has going for it is it's the only true OSB, I-Gaming pure play for the US market and doesn't have the legacy overheads of a traditional bookie or casino tethered business. I really believe in Jason Robbins and their execution plan so think the stock will easily perform well over the next 5 years or so but be prepared for some ups and downs."
03/24/2021,stocks,I don't even look at my DKNG holding. I just throw in low limit buys and get excited when I get the notification my order went through. Easy hold for me until at least 2025.
03/24/2021,stocks,its a long term stock but it will get there.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Love it, BETZ and BJK too"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Well, I like Draftkings too but the stock is up 500% this year. I think there is a lot of talk that we are paying tomorrow’s prices today on everything. It’s the Tesla effect."
03/24/2021,stocks,Hodling 500 and selling covered calls !
03/24/2021,stocks,noticed how DKNG was bleeding today and I'm really considering buy some shares tomorrow!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Man im in at 49 and want to buy more but im really waiting for this stock to dip to load up. It’s the only stock keeping my portfolio green so I’m in limbo. On one hand I want my portfolio somewhat in green, on the other, this is my favorite stock in my portfolio and want to add more. Decisions decisions"
03/24/2021,stocks,What do you think about GNOG? It’s pretty cheap now.
03/24/2021,stocks,It is literally the only green stock in my portfolio right now. This week has killed me everywhere else. I got lucky enough to get in at a great price point. But as it only makes up 20% of my portfolio I’m not exactly killing it right now
03/24/2021,stocks,How do you feel about the BETZ ETF? The huge negative PE is scary but I guess it's a bet on online sports gambling being the future.
03/24/2021,stocks,How much you lose if buyer exercise 1 contract? Is it worth it to risk reward ?
03/24/2021,stocks,I cut my losses on a pretty large stake in NOK to put into DKNG. If the price goes over 75 I’ll make my losses back
03/24/2021,stocks,If you like DKNG check out BFT. It’s a SPAC merging with PaySafe. Great to pair w dkng imo!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yknow what, if it’s still in the red tomorrow, fuck it i’m buying!!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"To be fair, I’m also playing a pretty decent amount in BETZ ETF"
03/24/2021,stocks,Own betz and dkng. This is the way
03/24/2021,stocks,Wasn’t even aware of this. Expense ratio is a bit high for my liking but I might consider. Thanks!
03/24/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/24/2021,stocks,F for your focus. At 23 you should be looking for aggressive growth. Unless you are going to retire at 30.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Seems like a lot to me.  I’m at work and should be on here or else I’d add more, but I think it’s too much for the amount of money you have.  Good job getting in early though."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Think I see a lot of comments about your capital being spread thin. I tend to agree because you can’t contribute unlimited money into a Roth; only the 6k legal limit for this year and last. That’s a small position per each company, maybe even a fraction of a share in some cases. I use my Roth purely as a place for my REITs, and for REITs I’d recommend hedging against inflation a bit by buying some residential. They tend to be hedges because leases are short and as rates and rent in the area rises, they can quickly adjust. Something like ESS, EQR, AVB. Otherwise, manufactured home like SUI can be great for stability and share price appreciation but MH tends to be rate-sensitive."
03/24/2021,stocks,Please get in touch with a financial advisor
03/24/2021,stocks,"You seem to be spreaded A LOT for only 4300$. You might want to reconsider some of your smaller position.

Also, Growth > Dividend. You could live your whole life building a growth portfolio and then change your whole position to a dividend focus portfolio when you'll approach retirement"
03/24/2021,stocks,I enjoy it.
03/24/2021,stocks,Never said I didn’t have a growth account. Just asking for thoughts on the stocks held and looking for options. This is my retirement account and I’m jot going to fuck around with higher risk growth stocks in it. I want stable income rolling in and compounding over time.
03/24/2021,stocks,Not asking for comments about its size. I’m aiming to hit above 50 stocks. I know what I’m getting into.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks I’ll look into those! And I understand the concern about spreading myself thin but between DRIP, and still being able to put in 6k a year, I’m still able to buy full shares. I haven’t bought a single fractional share yet actually."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Why? I know what I’m doing in this regards. I’m picking companies that are safe reliable and long term holds. I’m not asking about its size, just the holdings themselves."
03/24/2021,stocks,Dividend growth outperforms pure growth 98% of the time. I’m sticking with what’s safe for my retirement. It’s stretched thin now but that’s the plan. Cover all sectors and get about 5 stocks in each sector and then start adding to them over time and allowing drip to compound tax free.
03/24/2021,stocks,You look like your spreading your 4K a little thin diversity is important but not everything I try to stay around 4-8 stocks because that’s all I can really follow I do work full time tho.
03/24/2021,stocks,Again F.
03/24/2021,stocks,Your title says rate it.  That’s my rating.  I think you have too much for the amount of money. Don’t get butt hurt. You have too many stocks. Period.  Especially for the amount of money you’re investing.  Why do you need 50 stocks?  If you’re choosing quality stocks/ETFs there is no need for that many. Especially with only 4300.  Thanks for the downvote.  Don’t ask if you don’t want the truth.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Best of luck either way. If you expand to 50 full positions, 6k is more like 120 per name if you did it equal-weighted. Some names would then be partial at that point but I can’t really disagree with the names you have/are targeting."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m picking stocks that I can pick and forget about for 5-10 years and only have to worry about major disruptions which would be widely reported on because of how big the companies in investing in are. Once I do the research on them and convince myself they are solid, which isn’t an easy thing to do, I buy a few shares, set it to drip, and leave it and just monitor the daily stories that Schwab gives me on my investments as they come up. Not that much work when you pick boring companies that have been around and paying dividends for 30+ years"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Dude you’re a 55 day old account. Why tf am I even bothering with you? And why is someone who joined Reddit off of GME hype giving stock advice like they know anything. Dividend growth is a growth investment strategy, just because it isn’t a yolo into tech stocks with P/E ratios over 1k doesn’t mean it isn’t an actual growth strategy. Compounding tax free will always win out over growth every time because pure growth is stock appreciation and that’s it, dividend growth is both stock appreciation and raw payouts that increase over time giving you free money that you can invest back into the company to earn more for the next payout. With the exception of maybe Google, Amazon, and maybe Facebook, a $10k investment into KO with drip on, would beat any growth stock over 10 years, unless i time the market perfectly and find the next big company, which is almost impossible to do and not worth the risk."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree , you doing a little to much honestly .. I would sit everything in a mutual fund and let it sit . You can’t take it out until 59.5 anyways tbh. Then use my brokerage to host your 50-100 stocks... but for the little money you have , you do have way to much going on there- as far as stock, I only got apple , vale , T, and ET and my mutual fund , that’s all you really need tbh in my Roth IRA - also I’m 25"
03/24/2021,stocks,"The amount of money doesn’t matter at all, it’s a start. That’s all, percentages are what matter to me, I’m diversified, that’s what matters. And 50 stocks would mean I’m picking only about 4-5 stocks per sector. That’s not crazy IMO."
03/24/2021,stocks,"My eventual goal is to get up to 5ish stocks per sector, then start buying each stock until I hit about 5 shares each buying when they are having a red day (another advantage of having so many stocks, some will be red each day, which is fine and how the market works, so I will usually have readily available buying opportunities whenever I have funds) and just let it drip. If I need to save up for a full share I might turn off drip for a month, collect those funds, and redistribute them to another share, but that’s about it. That’s how I’m eventually planning to buy some of the more expensive stocks I’m wanting to buy like GOOGL, MLM, COST, maybe NVDA."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ah I see I like it looks like you’ve got a good strategy I prefer to make money through premium as opposed to dividends so I have to be a bit more active.

Finance id recommend you look at some of the Canadian banks."
03/24/2021,stocks,F
03/24/2021,stocks,"I enjoy what I’m doing though, read the post. And I’m not interested in putting it in a mutual fund as this is like a hobby to me. I also believe I’ll put preform that mutual fund because I won’t have to deal with the bottom 25% of stocks that are in broad market funds thus bringing down their overall performance."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I use to be just like you - it’s going to eat up to much of your type watching and worrying about the stock market I guarantee you. I do wish you the best friend but from someone who been there , watching and studying daily on end , it’s not worth it ... you seem like you know what you doing and your picks are solid since I own some of those as well.. I hope you rigut in the end"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Heard, only response to that is I’m picking stocks that I don’t have to watch or worry about unless I’m buying more of them, and the good thing about holding a broad selection over all the markets is when it is time to add, I can add to the ones that are red for the day while still testing easily knowing they are solid companies. It would also be major news if one of these picks fucks up and I need to sell so I’m not having to stay on top of them too much. Sure it takes some time researching new picks but I enjoy that aspect and once I hit 5-10 picks per sector I won’t be looking for new acquisitions anymore and just building upon my foundation."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Fellow MP investor here - The shares are tanking for three reasons:

1)  There appears to be a general rebalancing going on in the market with growth stocks, MP included.  So firms are moving away from the high growth into more conservative investments as Europe shows signs of a pull back due to Covid

2) The recent earnings were really good, but Wallstreet loves to tank stocks after earnings.  They suck.

3)  Your point, the additional offering.   Though this is a private offering to be more precise - it is a dilution of share value, though not a huge one given it is about 10% of their market cap.

The purpose is to generate revenue to grow the business.  Companies that are growing need money, and can get it through IPO (already done), taking out bonds, or offering shares.  This is really good in the long run because it allows them flexibility to build new infrastructure and grow in a healthy way - it just sucks a bit in the short run."
03/24/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/24/2021,stocks,"A share offering should be a neutral non-event, the shareholders have diluted shares in a company with an equivalent value of more cash (i.e. the company is worth previous company + new cash).  

If the shareholders thought the company would make good use of the cash, the shares should trade higher (ROE), the only reason for the shares to trade lower is the shareholders think the company will use the cash unwisely, getting less value than simple depreciating dollar bills.

Why do the shareholders believe management will essentially put some or all of that cash into a shredder?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because it will take time for that cash to generate revenue.  Their models account for the projected growth, and while that will help accelerate growth there is a time value to money.   So growth farther out is worth less than growth now.  Short term pull back is all"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Alright,  sincerely,  good luck."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Saw a post or comment that had an anecdotal reference in common. 

I can't remember it verbatim, but the gist of it was this:

If you do proper DD, then your losses shouldn't be all that bad. They should be sort of middling and able to be withstood by your other holdings.

Edit: fixed typo"
03/24/2021,stocks,"My personal experience (and this is strictly facetious,  but damn if it isn't testable lol)...

DD, fundamentals, research.... none of it has anything NEAR the sheer power of me simply purchasing a stock. 

I can guarantee a 20% loss in minutes just by my mere action of buying. 

Best DD I can give you? Invert every thing I do.  You'll be a millionaire in a day. 

(Sarcasm of course but it's seriously like a magic trick I can do. )

Anyway,  GL!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't know. IME, DD doesn't really amount to much in terms of PE, overvalued, undervalued, etc.  Stocks on good companies can go down for years and stocks on bad companies can go up for years. There's really no way to know, given the manipulation and 1000 other reasons to sell stock. People need money now or just want to put it in something else. Earnings were stellar but ""analysts"" said they'd be mindbogglingly unfathomably fanfuckingtastic so the stock tanks and loses 30% overnight only to be back at new highs three years later.

Sure, you want to make sure that the management isn't fucking up too badly, or worse, it's an all out scam, but other than that, it's all just a best guess about whether the product will continue to sell, whether they'll be able to continue making profits as much as before or better, etc. But who knows. AAPL almost went bust and needed a bailout by MSFT of all companies and now look at them.

If you want to (almost) guarantee a win, buy an index and wait 20-30 years. Picking stocks is likely to underperform and trading in and out is almost guaranteed to underperform or end up net negative.

Very few people can make money consistently (despite all the gain porn you can find on the net) and 2/3 of that is luck too."
03/24/2021,stocks,"In my opinion, you shouldn’t care about short/mid-term stock movement if your DD is good. 

Unless there is some sort of tangible/likely impact on their financial statements/projections, with proper DD, you should simply view movements down as a discount or buying opportunity. 

A good litmus test I’ve seen before is: if the stock dropped 30% the day after you bought it, with no news or change in financials, would you sell, hold, or buy more? Unless your answer is buy more, I don’t think you’re confident enough in your DD. 

Just my two cents."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good DD can take years to realize. ENPH was a good company ($10 per share) back in 2015 (when I invested); it fell down to less than 50 cents by 2017. Heavy price manipulation. Afterwards, the price exploded.

In other words, a truly good company will eventually do well--but you have to have the patience to wear out the price manipulation. Big money knows how to press the emotional button with algorithmic trading to get retail investors to sell at discount prices."
03/24/2021,stocks,Better than not doing it 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/24/2021,stocks,"Due diligence can mean many things. For some people, it means reading 10-Ks, listening to conference calls, reading reviews, etc. Some people will convince you that you MUST do those things if you want to purchase stocks. For other people, like me, due diligence involves analyzing what analysts say. I pay a service to do my due diligence for me. The only time I spend more than 90 seconds analyzing whether I want to make a stock transaction is if that stock is becoming a significant portion of my portfolio. 

There are two major considerations here. First, know your skill level. If you are not someone who can go toe-to-toe with Wall Street's finest, then maybe you are better off listening to analysts than you are reading 10-ks. Second, portfolio management is more important than DD and is more difficult to master. Nibble your way in, and nibble your way out. Add to your winners, don't double down on your losers thinking you are buying them at a discount (with the rare exception being when there is a broad market correction)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good equity analysis is hard to do and hard to come by. One problem is that if you want to invest, you want to find reasons to buy the stock. But in good equity analysis you should be looking for reasons not to buy the stock. I myself try to concentrate on current numbers and not to guess too much about future. It is especially easy to be over-optimistic about future scenarios.

I prefer term equity analysis to DD. To me DD means Reddit equity analysis, i.e. bad equity analysis."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’ve actually had a surprisingly good run of results on the back off stocks I’ve brought after thorough DD. I’d say about 75% have climbed after my entry, a couple significantly so. One of the stocks that hasn’t is a huge position I have in  PLTR but I can’t worry about that in the short term.

If I look at my portfolio my ‘failure’ rate is unsurprisingly far higher for stocks I’ve brought whimsically on the back of either somebody else’s DD that I didn’t verify, or because I felt like gambling on something I knew little about. 

I’ve recently identified the value of my own DD and am doubling down on discipline and patience. Now I’d rather not open a new position for 3 months than settle for a stock I’m not sure of."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Really good.   Like finding out that VOD owned half of Verizon wireless in 2010, or QCOM with court troubles and AAPL troubles in 2015 through 2019.  Realizing what a massive moat pipeline companies like WMB or bank custodian/clearinghouse like BK have.  

Unfortunately giant bargains are rare,  or I'm not good at finding them so most of the time the DD is just to find normal cheap stocks with a margin of error."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think doing DD is good. Its not a for sure but it definitely limits your losses, I feel. At least do enough DD to know whats going on with the company, why prices dropped, if fundamentals have changed, if they actually make a profit. A lot of people simply just choose something they know or like. I think valuebinvesting is a good philosophy and it beats out the tea lead reading aspect of technical analyses."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not everyone is as gifted at spotting things, therefore at DDs. There's a small ranking here but it's mostly for penny stock people [https://www.markovchained.com/](https://www.markovchained.com/)"

03/24/2021,stocks,"75-80% of the time for me. Some years I beat the S&P and some years I don’t. Goal is to not take the 40-50% draw down in my portfolio though. While growing at an average of 10% per year. I’ll be honest I want all the smoke equities offer though, I don’t think I will ever own bonds, I really enjoy doing research."
03/24/2021,stocks,"100 per cent of time, it works sometimes."
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm glad I'm not the only one. you'd think that if there were enough of us out there we'd eventually get lucky at least.
03/24/2021,stocks,What are your stock picks?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Put options on this guys whole portfolio,"
03/24/2021,stocks,That's what I thought too with doing DD's; way too many factors that could change! I'm doing something like \~50% of my portfolio in index.
03/24/2021,stocks,That's a cool thought test! Thanks! (what's litmus btw?)
03/24/2021,stocks,"This must have happened with Tesla and Amazon then, right? They were really low priced a few years back and now they are booming because they have good stats. So if someone did a DD on these two a few years ago, that would be a similar scenario right?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I second this btw, I did DD on a bunch of companies, believed in them and then forgot about them. I didn’t check them and when I eventually returned about a year and a half later most were up 40-60%.
Ridiculous gains, overall portfolio was 28% (some companies hadn’t been realised at that point IMO)"
03/24/2021,stocks,True! I'm going to learn how to do DD's soon!
03/24/2021,stocks,">But in good equity analysis you should be looking for reasons not to buy the stock.

Exactly. Moreover true opportunities tend to be surprisingly rare, since it's hard to find a good company that is seriously undervalued."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Go even more imo, like a 90/10"
03/24/2021,stocks,If you hold the S&P 500 for 10 years there is a 90% chance you didn’t lose money.
03/24/2021,stocks,“Litmus test” is just a phrase for a sort of thought experiment. Not even sure if I used it quite right lol.
03/24/2021,stocks,"a litmus paper is used to test whether a liquid is acidic or basic.  the paper changes color based on the pH of the solution.  in common parlance, a litmus test is a definitive test of something"

03/24/2021,stocks,"If they were forward thinking enough, theoretically yes. Like when EV was first becoming a thing and everyone laughed & provided a DD as to why it won’t work, if you were able to do your own DD and then rightfully predict global movements AND then pick the right company to lead the way yeah, you’d be bang on. It’s just quite hard to do that is all 😛"
03/24/2021,stocks,"But let’s be real, how many of us would have bought Amazon when they were still an online bookstore?"
03/24/2021,stocks,You can look up AMZN price during the dot com bubble and see it went from roughly $90 to $9.
03/24/2021,stocks,"No.  Those were just lucky.   No one who researched thought that an online bookstore would be one of the few internet companies to survive the dot com crash and become a successful operator of internet web hosting services. 

The next big thing companies are a dime a dozen and almost all of them fail. No one who researched came to the conclusion that this car company was different than all the others that failed. 

I wish I could find it, and it must be true since I read it on the internet, but it was something like 40% of the companies that have ever gotten big enough to be added to the Russell 3000 have crashed (>70% loss)  and never recovered."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Since I'll be a long term investor, I guess doing DD's will be worth it for me"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Much better explanation, thanks."
03/24/2021,stocks,If only we could all predict global movements... Thanks for the info!

I.e. do we have enough lithium for all the EV activities? Is there a competitor to EV? Etc."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good idea, thanks!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"TSLA is the top holding in all three of ARKK, ARKQ and ARKW and it consistently has been. The line is blurred between actively managing and pumping"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I mean who sets a Bear case at 2x the price, im sorry but that is a bull case, I've never taken ark seriously but how do people after this ridiculous pump."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think their ""bear case"" is more like a bull case with bear tinted goggles. You can't expect them to say their top holding is going to drop 80+% which is the reasonable ""bear case."" They're salesmen, they're going to try to shill their product. Funny how people just trust these guys, remember, they are 100% about making themselves money at the end of the day. You cannot seriously expect a fund manager to be honest about their perspectives."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tesla had sales of roughly $31.5B in 2020. If they increased sales by 50% every year for 5 years, that would put revenue at $239B in 2025. 2020 Cash flow was $2.7B, if you increased FCF at 50% per year you would be at $20.5B. 

3x current market cap would put it at $1.8Trillion valuation. That would be 7.5x sales and 87x current FCF in 2025. 

50% annual growth is near impossible to keep up for 5 years when you are a software company, let alone something as capital-intensive as building cars (and solar panels). 

I don't get it, I just don't get it. You are hoping for the impossible (50% annual growth over long-term, also maintaining an absurd valuation throughout, also with a high chance that interest rates start to increase over that time - which theoretically will reduce the multiple as well).  A great company without a doubt (up until this point), but a lousy investment at these levels. 

Investing is about finding the BEST COMPANY AT THE BEST PRICE, not just the BEST COMPANY AT ANY PRICE."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Will there be in future a separation between car hardware and software makers? The same way as with PCs and later with mobile phones? Maybe then Tesla could become Apple of car industry. The only one doing both sw and hw by itself. The traditional car makers would team up using a common car operating system, Cardroid, if you will. All Cardroid cars could use the same autonomous driving software. Platform would be open for competition. Tesla would have it's own closed ecosystem. Possibly also a charging connector not compatible with other cars.

About Ark Invest Tesla target prices, I also think they are ridiculously high."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Of course that’s all you going to see . Tesla this and that. I do the damn opposite . They going to try and drive the price down so they can load up . Again, the price of the share matters little if the underlying business doesn’t change ( warren buffet). It’s well below 30% off it’s high and I would jump in it personally ... if all you seeing is bear news then ask yourself why. Did the company not post Y/Y earnings . Company  filings is all the noise you need to listen too on sec.gov"
03/24/2021,stocks,“remind me 5 years” Tesla is a solid company and yeah by 2027 I’d bet there stock is a few k
03/24/2021,stocks,"Also interested: in the bull case, they assume Tesla will make $327 billion in revenue from an autonomous ride sharing service in 2025. That's about 25 times the revenue of UBER right now. How can you justify something like that? It's irresponsible and misleading, nothing more."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I no longer own TSLA shares, but the price target ARK set is for the year 2025, not today.

There are many companies that have doubled or tripled their price over the course of several years.

Do I think the price target is reasonable?  Not at their current production levels.  Could it be reasonable in 2025? Possibly."
03/24/2021,stocks,lolz
03/24/2021,stocks,Truth. Ark funds are major pump/hype etfs. Most of the stuff all of their etfs hold are crazy overvalued stocks.
03/24/2021,stocks,Tesla should put an animation of a dna molecule as a screensaver on their cars large screen. So ARK can add it to ARKG as well.
03/24/2021,stocks,"OP said ""literally x3"", which is a hyperbole. Bear case is 1500 a share, and it was published 5 days when the price was almost at 700. Even going by today's price, it ain't x3."
03/24/2021,stocks,FSD will be the key to Tesla living up to its high PT expectations. It’s hard to imagine what it could look like and you can’t model it in traditional ways. It’s why PTs are all over the place.
03/24/2021,stocks,Totally agree.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yea, it seems insane to me.

Even if their product is exponentially better than Uber, will there really be that much more demand for ride share?  I mean, people still going to be able to use their own cars and public transit in 2025, right?

Anyway, I don't think FSD will be good enough by 2025 for an autonomous network.  I expect FSD to be a lot better by 2025, but Tesla's will still need human baby sitters for the 1% edge cases.  I can't see a fully autonomous ride hail network until maybe 2030."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The cost per mile will be dramatically lower in their scenario, which would spur much higher demand."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah but that’s still a very bullish take on TSLA considering they’re already worth 615 billion. NVDA has gone up 5x in 4 years but their market cap is still half of what TSLA is worth right now

&#x200B;

for TSLA to be worth 1.8 trillion by 2025 that whole “more than a car company” narrative better be a proven thing not just speculation"
03/24/2021,stocks,Sorry yea 2x still ridiculous
03/24/2021,stocks,"alright, it's 2,5x then. Does that minor difference really matter? Usually, the bear case should be LOWER than it is right now. ARK seemingly ignores some bad news for Tesla."
03/24/2021,stocks,Exactly so you are buying hype and expectations - nothing based on reality
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah exactly! FSD will eventually be Level 3, but not more in the near future. Not with this hardware"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but they won‘t have a fully operational FSD robotaxifleet in 2025, thats the point. It would be more revenue than apple and amazon make. Those two needed 20 years to scale up to that number. It is totally impossible."
03/24/2021,stocks,Welcome to growth stocks.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Stocks are forward looking. Even if it’s not done in 2025, if it’s reasonable it could be done by 2027, 2025 price will reflect that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Watching YouTube FSD Beta testing, I think reliable FSD will happen before 2025. Anything could happen."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That word gets thrown around here so much - growth stocks just means you are buying a company that is growing fast and expected to grow fast. There are plenty of companies that fit that description that you don't have to pay insane prices for. Tesla could grow their sales at 50% per year, and if the multiple drifts down to somewhere around 40X cash flow by 2025 that would put their market cap somewhere around $820B. That is a 5-year total return of 36%. 

I would love a Tesla bull give me the fundamental case of why this is a good investment at these valuations - using real projections and cash flow."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, but it is not sure when this will happen, if Tesla is the first one to do that (or Waymo, or GM, or Daimler, Apple etc) and if it matters who gets there first. It is just so damn uncertain and that should be reflected in the stock price."
03/24/2021,stocks,Do you mean LEVEL 4/5 autonomy with FSD?
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you are only modeling car sales, then yeah, it’s way overpriced. Not gonna argue there. Most Tesla bulls are interested in the potential of FSD, Robotaxis, energy, etc. A lot of that stuff has never been done before, so how can you model it with any sense of certainty?

If you’re not confident Tesla can deliver on these things, then don’t invest. Because the price is absurd if you only look at it as an auto manufacturer."
03/24/2021,stocks,"“Should” yes. But this market is nuts. At least if you’re gonna overpay for a growth company, I’d much rather choose Tesla over others"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes. Once wide rollout of “FSD” that requires fairly frequent driver intervention, the system will improve rapidly. The sheer amount of data available for digestion will be staggering."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Buying Tesla at 200$ would be overpay, Tesla at the current price is just nuts. The current price reflects total domination of the car market and Robotaxistuff. And at least the first point is already undeniably gone."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think a Level 4/5 system which relies just on cameras won‘t be legal. Because there does not has to be a steering wheel in the car, it has to drive perfectly, even if a part of the system has problems. I assume that such systems have to consist of several redundant systems for safety reasons. Like maps, lidar, cameras and 5G all together. I doubt that a system using the current FSD hardware will be legal."
03/24/2021,stocks,Anyone buying now is reasonably sure what you said will happen. It wouldn’t make sense otherwise. So it’s really just “betting” on Elon delivering. And a lot of people apparently consider it a safe “bet”.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It’ll be legal if there is sufficient evidence to verify it is safer than human drivers and saves lives. The timeframe on becoming legal will vary widely from place to place. 

Of course if the system is not as safe as human drivers, then it will for sure be outlawed. That’s why tsla is a risky investment."
03/24/2021,stocks,Alright fair enough. Many people really don't value the stock as a part of an enterprise but rather a part of Elon. I think it is just dangerous to bet on someone to achieve something impossible just because he has done great until now. Greed is dangerous
03/24/2021,stocks,"No it will not be legal just because it is a bit safer than a human driver. It has to be WAY safer than a human driver. Very few people are willing to give up control of their car for the same safety. And no, just because of evidence, it will not be legal. It has to work under any condition, even with some minor technical defaults. And for that you need redundancy. I know, Elon says that cameras are enough. But not in the real world. It is way to risky to rely just on one option, there have to be at least 2-3 diffenent and independet systems as backup."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I disagree. People ride in ubers that have human level danger risk. I think once FSD cars are several times more reliable than the average driver, societies will demand them. Vision is the optimal solution, it never blinks, gets distracted, can see 360 degrees around the car, and can process information about 1 million times faster than the human brain. The vehicles will likely pull to the side of the road and stop in the event something is creating a potential dangerous driving situation, the same thing human drivers do. I could be wrong, but I like the odds enough to have a bet in Tesla’s favor. Shorter term I think tsla shares could be susceptible to a very serious price correction."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I get what you mean, but I just cant see it happening without a backup system. Our world gets safer and safer every day, there is so much governance and safety stuff we care about. I cant imagine relying on one system. But whats the big deal with that? Why shouldn‘t tesla install lidar, use maps, use 5G or anything different. Even if it is just to comply with safety standards."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You mean like buy a stock when the price is low, then sell it at a higher price? very interesting idea..."
03/24/2021,stocks,"What if there are 3 red days -10% each, and then 15 green days of +1% each. That’s a lot green days. 

How would you ever time this? The reality is that we can’t..."
03/24/2021,stocks,There's zero chance that your strategy has any edge over buy and hold.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m buying and holding tech, but that’s due to conviction, and probably bad financial advice"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If your not in already, Id wait I guess. Its pretty volatile atm and I see it continuing until all this talk about all the talk bond yields slows down. Who knows though, find something good and jump in if you think its a good buy in."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I mean, if you think you can time things right and constantly find new tickers in order to avoid wash sales, then yeah - not a terrible strategy."
03/24/2021,stocks,What is a wash sale and why do you want to avoid it?
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you sell a stock at a loss and buy it again within 30 days, you cannot use the losses for tax purposes"
03/24/2021,stocks,Disclaimer: You can claim those losses once you sell the stock you rebought - the losses are just added into the stocks cost basis until you sell.
03/24/2021,stocks,"So if I do a wash sale, but then sell the stock I rebought within 30 days again, and don’t buy it back for 30 days (or ever), then the rule doesn’t necessarily apply anymore?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"It basically stops being relevant once you sell off the stock at any point. 

If you had $100 of losses and rebought the stock at $500, the wash sale just says the cost of that stock for tax purposes was $600 (the stock price + your loss). 

If you sold the stock at any point, you’d be able to claim the loss again. 

Or if the stock price moves to $600 and you sell, for a $100 profit, you don’t owe any taxes as the $100 gain and the $100 washed loss cancel out."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The only time it really effects you is if you hold a stock that you repurchased w/in 30 days (washed sale) into the next tax year and sell. 

Then you’d only be able to claim the loss in the year you sold the stock."

Not to mention that a roblox game is still fundamentally a roblox game with a different skin. Sure, maybe they'll end up the most popular kids game in the world, but those little shits tend to loose interest in stuff in the matter of months.

It's not that it's a bad company (although with so many years of research they kind of fail to deliver anything), it's the fact that theor plane is suborbital, cannot deliver payload to orbit (they spined off branch that actually deals with satellite delivery) and most importantly, why would you buy SPCE when rocketlabs are about to be traded company? They created both launch dehicles and satellites, developed 3D printed engines and are developinf their own medium-class launch vehicle. They are all-round better company, far younger than SPCE yet they have multiple successes."

GME. Way overvalued. There is close to zero chance the company will be viable 5+ years from now. The only value they may have is what can be squeezed out of their declining assets and market share.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Basically:

* China will selectively allow US companies that benefit them into their market, but will push out the rest. Since this is a largely political decision that most people have no inside access to, it'll materialize in the form of volatility in China exposed stocks.

* The US will ban and remove many Chinese companies from US exchanges. This will lead to general capital flight from Chinese companies, which can actually make them higher value since it'll decrease their valuation. However, your access to these stocks will be more and more limited due to US government restrictions.

* Since China has been the primary engine of growth for the world for the last two decades, an economic Cold War between the West and China will cause both economies to slow, so expect more flat and bear markets. This will last until a new engine of growth is found - whether that's India, Africa, Southeast Asia, or whatever.

Many people are high on India being the next China but the Indians have historically been very protectionist. That may change or it may not change, but I wouldn't be surprised if foreigners get similarly screwed in India so I'd see India as a swing trade."

03/24/2021,stocks,What's up for the last month and a half
03/24/2021,stocks,I think it's time to shift away from Tech.. I'm tired of these HUGE drops every other week in the NASDAQ for no apparent reason.
03/24/2021,stocks,I have a hunch it’s big money selling off.
03/24/2021,stocks,This sucks ass.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Valuation, man. If you bought Intel in the dot com boom, you'd be massively in the red for decades, even while the company was wildly successful by literally any measure.

Prices matter. These tech companies may someday be successful (maybe), but that alone DEFINITELY doesn't make them good investments.

People had been investing at very high valuations, and many professional managers recently remembered not to gamble on 30x 5-year revenue projections when you could sit on profitable companies at 15x earnings or PEG under 1.5. The value rotation is very real.

Plus, even with the 10 year bond stabilizing, expectations in the bond markets are pointing to long term inflation, favoring value for the foreseeable future. The technical charts are ugly, especially for tech.

If you buy the dip, there's still a good chance you'll be ""right"", but not necessarily in this decade.

Plus, the ""high flyers"" from covid are (as of this week) 1 year off their lows. That means investors have meaningful long term capital gains. Plenty of people would rather sell now with low taxes than sell last month with high taxes, especially during that typical Q1 rebalance for pros.

If you're talking about companies that did well in covid, they might have really tough comparisons coming up when they report, especially if they can't maintain the same growth during opening.

I'm not buying the dip. The dollar is crashing anyway, man. Buy the multinationals that will exceed expectations when their foreign sales turn into lots of sweet sweet American dollars. They don't even need growth to beat the numbers, and you get paid to wait. Take the free money, man.

Not financial advice. Don't sue me and stuff.

Edit: To be clear, I'm NOT anti tech at all! I've been there plenty until Jan/Feb, still in cyber security and chips today, and I'll be back in there more broadly at different valuations - love it!

Edit2: wow, downvotes. I didn't see that coming. I'd love for someone to offer feedback or counterpoints, rather than downvotes for a legitimate answer that focuses on the question. I do understand why some will hope I'm wrong though."

03/24/2021,stocks,It’s possible there was a surge in tech due to Covid and now portfolios are being rebalanced into other industries.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yep. Guess the institutions ran out of bad news so they're just selling. Kinda like what happened last September. No real news good or bad and everything took a nosedive. Actually this correction feels a lot like the one in September. Hopefully this is the last of the dips!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Only under the Democrats tho. Its like boomers are mad they lost the election so they will/are doing anything they can to disrupt the economy, government, covid safety whatever.  Boomers, institutions and hedge funds are mad about liberals in office, equal rights and higher taxes for the wealthy and they will tank the market with a smile on their faces. Watch and see.

I didn't want this to get political but it truly is, there's no other rhyme or reason to these recent drops.

Let the downvotes proceed, idgaf."

Earnings? Revenue? Cashflow? Book value? My understanding is that even current valuations remain higher than typical.

I'm curious to learn more about your firesale thesis. What companies are you buying on the dip?"
03/24/2021,stocks,In a month maybe
03/24/2021,stocks,But them gains be so sweet and tender when it's all green again!

03/24/2021,stocks,"Lol, you guys want huge gains. Which is upwards volatility but panic when the volatility is downwards aswell.

2020 special run really made people believe stocks only go one direction and are otherwise trash if they don't."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not to nitpick but its not ""no apparent reason"" thats how you end up not learning or anticipating anything. We are going to have to deal with inflation along with interest rates going up eventually, on top of the measures governments implemented to babysit the economies and markets to keep them afloat for a year being eased and pulled back. All this means money is going to exit the market and stocks to some degree and big money is starting to anticipate it. Tech stocks rely on profits that are coming in the future, if inflation is up, then those profits are inherently less valuable. Also if you are big into tech you should know that its the most liquid and volatile sector and is often overbought and bloated."
03/24/2021,stocks,JPow won’t talk for a while so I think you would be good just holding your tech - at least to earn back short term (March -mid April)
03/24/2021,stocks,WOW. You're saying you don't think Tech will reach new highs for another decade?!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Great write up.
Well I’ve got a conviction, I’m sticking to it. Tech is where the growth will come from, I’m not interested in buying cyclical or value and dividends."

03/24/2021,stocks,"> Buy the multinationals that will exceed expectations when their foreign sales turn into lots of sweet sweet American dollars. 

Can you expand on this a little bit? What stocks (or ideally ETFs) are good for pursuing this strategy?

>If you buy the dip, there's still a good chance you'll be ""right"", but not necessarily in this decade.

Do you think it will take a decade for the tech stocks to rebound? What is your best estimate?"
03/24/2021,stocks," If you are a day trader, this is not for you. Nobody has gotten rich by buying when the market is up.  Like anything else, you should buy the lowest possible and then just wait. When I bought  my Tesla shares at $210, people were saying it’s too high!  What is happening to NASDAQ stocks recently is needed so you and I can buy those stocks that we hoped to have. What we need to do is to stop listening to the news that is manipulated by the same forces that we are competing with.  There is no recession and economy is in reasonably good shape.  If they don’t scare you of A big crash, you won’t not be tempted to sell those valuable stocks. Diversify, and buy the stocks you always wanted to have.  Don’t forget to do lots of research on the fundamentals of those companies.  Then take a brake for few days or weeks and see how the stock market will rebound. Good luck!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Or just hold and ride it through
03/24/2021,stocks,Or maybe everything is really overvalued and everyone is in denial.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes it's the hedge funds and rich people doing this to us! Nothing to do with us buying unprofitable hyped up companies valued for the next 30 years. It's those hedge funds I'm telling ya 🤡

I'm saying there are clear examples where consistently successful companies haven't taken out their highs for over a decade. Not all dips should be bought. You should only buy the dip if you believe that it is priced below your calculated intrinsic value."
03/24/2021,stocks,Cool thanks man. Lots of ways to win!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Perhaps marginally, yes. However, US stocks generally have low exposure to cyclical European spending (high exposure to staples though). So while you could see individual stocks impacted, I doubt the effect will meaningfully drive huge rotations in US stocks - especially because those effects are transient. In other words, the ""third wave"" will predictably affect the next few months, but we know vaccines work and we know there's pent up demand in Europe, so we know things WILL improve, just maybe a bit later.

Also, European luxury brands (a large component) are mostly driven by Chinese spending now, so hiccups in European opening are unlikely to throw markets off their large trends."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks. It's positive now though, so I feel like a jerk for whining, but it's dishonest to remove the edit. I did put some work into the comment though, so I'm now quite glad people find it useful."
03/24/2021,stocks,"On currency :

American companies report their numbers in US dollars, even when they do parts of their business in other currencies. I'm going to use FAKE numbers/company in an example:

Company XYZ sells a widget for 10 euros, which I'll say is worth $10 also. When XYZ reports, they will report a $10 gain from that transaction.

But - if the dollar goes down 20% on inflation fears (after the transaction), company XYZ will then report $12 of profit from the €10 transaction.

These numbers are exaggerated and fake, but a marginally weaker US dollar marginally helps international companies have marginally larger earnings when they convert for reporting. It also helps them pay dividends (in dollars).

Not investment advice, but companies like McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, GE, Kimberly Clark/PG, car companies, some luxury brands, and international banks are likely to have significant international earnings.

As for the timing of tech recovery - I don't know how long it will take. Markets have a mind of their own, and they might make new highs tomorrow. Or a year. Our a decade. I know that Intel took over a decade despite clear success, and that started at a time when investors were valuing companies on ""possible future revenue projections"", rather than proven business metrics. Lots of ""bad"" things could happen. Competition, supply chain, bad PR, misunderstanding of the product, regulations, or inflation (which makes current dollars spent higher in value than distant dollars earned)."

03/24/2021,stocks,What about a Health ETF? (Like EXV4)
03/24/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep, good run and I expect more negative news from those shots as time goes on. The negative news is there if you look for it and don’t just read the headlines. The media just isn’t concentrating on it but I’ve seen a few reporters asking the right questions."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Big Pharmaceutical is alright,  I don't think there is a reason for the entire sector to go up, but I  did just buy a little MRK for the stability and dividend and a little NVO because the FDA asked for more info on semiglutide, which isn't definitely bad, but the stock dropped a bunch. I  think it may get approved and will go back up.

I was light any Pharm stock so I wanted to get a little.   I owned MRK before,  but I sold it at the beginning of the year to get money to buy XOM.

If you're interested in these stocks,  a nice blog is Derek Lowe ""in the pipeline ""."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you're in for a long term investment, big pharma is probably a good target. Population is aging in western countries, China, Japan an south-east Asia. The coming generation of retirees is wealthier than any previous. A lot of demand for medicine and enough buying power to get it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That’s what I’m doing too.

Started a position in WHEA.L (MSCI World Healthcare ETF)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"OP said big pharma, surely they aren’t speculative, but the complete opposite."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I would suggest not taking a course you have to pay for and instead:

-YouTube videos and trial and error.

-Start small and don't over invest.

-Keep some money back for down days and averaging down your positions. 

-Don't get caught up in memestocks. 

-Invest in what you believe in. 

-And most of all, adhere to this tenet. ""the stock market is a tool for transferring money from the impatient to the patient"""
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you're interested in learning about investing I would suggest reading the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Morningstar has a free investing classroom series. Mostly geared towards value and fundamental analysis. I think when you finish it all you get a free 3 month subscription or something.

morningstar.com/start-investing/classroom

imo they're a little too heavily tilted towards value and their price targets are eternally outdated, but there are some gems in their classroom series. I'd take it as only one resource in an ocean of resources, but a good place to start nonetheless. After that you'll feel more confident filling in any knowledge gaps you have.

There are also plenty of good books out there. I'd say pick up whatever interests you and just start reading."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Aswath Damordan, Jimmy on Learn to Invest both are on YouTube."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah do invest long term, but if I invest in a company I still want to know why and what their plans for the future are. I still have majority of my portfolio in index funds, but have holdings in some blue chip stocks aswell.

03/24/2021,stocks,Thank you kind internet stranger.
03/24/2021,stocks,Proud of you!
03/24/2021,stocks,"I would use a little money to speculate and dive into plays you think may have considerable upsides. It allows you to continue to explore new sectors, companies, and get a feel how the market moves. Either that or just paper play some stocks youre unsure of."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’ve been wanting to expand into riskier, stocks with more potential growth, but I still need to know what I’m doing. I don’t feel comfortable throwing money at a stock that someone on YouTube or Reddit say will go to the moon. But I have been trying to find some growth stocks. One holding that I feel proud of is MG they supply many parts to the ev sector. I did my DD and they’re receiving contracts from all the automotive makers, so as long as the industry will go up (which it will) they should also go up."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Understand that there is nothing wrong with waiting. Just keep looking until you find the right moment to jump on a play. Patience will usually allow ypubto grt the entey point you want. If not, then know that there will always be other opportunities in a year."

03/24/2021,stocks,"My portfolio imitates ARKG based on those I’m most bullish on: PACB, BEAM, CRSP, etc"
03/24/2021,stocks,Bought 6 more shares yesterday so I have 41 total now.
03/24/2021,stocks,The future doesn't mean the present. You have to hold for the future. Check back in 10 years and don't worry about the day to day movement.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Was a big fan of this fund up until recently when they starting adding a bunch of TDOC, which now makes up over 7% of the fund. Don't really see what TDOC has to do with Genomics which was the sector I was looking to invest in."
03/24/2021,stocks,I wouldn’t do it because I bought it. So you’re now guaranteed to lose. 😀👍
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m leaving my ARK shares as soon as I break even
03/24/2021,stocks,My largest bag of 2021.  Welcome.
03/24/2021,stocks,Check out MOON
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'd rather pick and choose the companies I like, ARKG is filled with a bunch of fluff/filler/nobody companies that have no growth potential. And the allocation, not a fan of it. Why are TelaDoc and PacBio the top two holdings? Why are there 55 holdings in total? No thanks, too much overdiversification.  They do have some really great picks though, like ILMN, ABBV, HIMS, NVTA.

Even just picking the 10 best ARKG stocks for your own little minifund IMO would be better than ARKG."
03/24/2021,stocks,ARK is the way.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Its just my opinion, but Ive been steering clear of ARK. Im not a big fan of cult figures in the finance industry, with the exception of maybe Buffet its never gone well. After the whole Tesla valuation fiasco, along with the religious reasons behind Cathie starting the ARK fund, Ive lost quite a bit of confidence in their long term stability. Im not saying that ARK is going to crash or anything, but the ARK managers seem to be blind to any possible bear case. Its almost like their biggest holding is hope lol."
03/24/2021,stocks,Wait some more. And then yes buy. This is one to hold for 30 years.
03/24/2021,stocks,It only sounds good there will be a couple small companies that do well 90% will fail and the successful ones will be bought out. I'm currently holding IEIH it is a mixture of both so a little more stable.
03/24/2021,stocks,Just average in slowly
03/24/2021,stocks,Look into $CRSP & $NTLA. Specifically Gene-editing. I have some youtube videos if you're curious.
03/24/2021,stocks,"""it'll be up bigly in 2030"" is legit the whole philosophy behind why i invest in ark"
03/24/2021,stocks,Your going to hold an actively managed fund for 10 years lmao
03/24/2021,stocks,"So you're the one.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

jk. It's losing now but I want to shove more into into it soon."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Funny, I started investing in TDOC before I knew the ARK fund even existed. Makes sense it's their #1 holding. I've been interested in Teledoc for a few years now and they've barely scratched the surface of capturing TAM. The Livongo merger added direct physical access to those needing disease management. They're international and in a highly sticky market due to contracts and HIPAA regulations. Plus they have the market cornered as far as data and AI. I've loaded up over the recent dip. 

Wife is a telehealth nurse practitioner so I have what I believe is unique insight into how this market is evolving (doesn't work for Teledoc). That said, this is a long term hold and isn't for the impatient or short term trader (similar to ARKG)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm not a fan of TelaDoc and PacBio being the two biggest holdings.  I like Illumina much more than PacBio in the sequencing space for the main reason that Illumina is much, much more affordable to industry customers and researchers. Also I'm not sure why she has CRSP but not EDIT or NTLA, especially considering it's a (too diversified) ETF and the CRSPR space is *completely* wide open right now and 99% speculation in terms of who the winner is.


I'm thinking of starting a little mini portfolio where I try to outperform ARKG over 6, 12, and 24 months and see how I do. Obviously a little play money of mine is not comparable to a multi-billion dollar ETF, but I think it will be fun. Honestly I think many people could even make a personal fund that outperforms ARKG just by cutting out a lot of the fat and rebalancing the allocations to what I feel bullish about."
03/24/2021,stocks,We all check out moon 🌚 ever night.
03/24/2021,stocks,100%. I'm moving most of my pocket change investments there.
03/24/2021,stocks,? Why not?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm not necessary saying I don't like TDOC, it just seems misplaced in a Genomics themed ETF. Makes more sense for their ARKW ETF, which actually already holds 4%+ of TDOC."
03/24/2021,stocks,99% of actively managed fund fail over a 15 year period. ARK will be no different. Stop chasing performance if you want to make any money
03/24/2021,stocks,"The description of ARKG 

>Why invest in ARKG: Exposure to CRISPR, gene editing, therapeutics, agricultural biology and **health care innovation**.

It is the equivalent of Tesla when it comes to data accumulation. They're building international networks. I understand your point with genomics, but personally believe it fits in perfectly."

03/24/2021,stocks,Imagine if the SEC went this hard on weeding out stock manipulators and restoring faith into the markets.
03/24/2021,stocks,Oh God. There goes my Chinese EVs. :(
03/24/2021,stocks,"Hold on, timeout! Please, let's all read past the headline. This clearly states that they are delisting companies that A) are not inline with American financial auditing standards B) companies that can't prove they are not owned in any way by a government entity (sorry nio) and not affiliated with the Chinese communist party. 

This tells me if you are invested in a Chinese company that passes these restrictions you may be seeing a good opportunity to add to your position.  

I really think OP should include this in the post, not every Chinese company is being delisted. The headline does not make this distinction."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is for Chinese companies commiting fraud and they will have 32 months to delist, so this is just a scare IMO."
03/24/2021,stocks,Ive held NIO strong for 8 months now but these last few days have really tempted me to consider selling
03/24/2021,stocks,"> if they do not comply with U.S. auditing standards, and require them to disclose any governmental affiliations.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I have some Chinese stocks but this has always been my biggest fear with Chinese stocks (even in companies I believe in). The US doesn't like the idea of China being powerful and I'm sure as the Cold War type relationship intensifies, we will only see more interference."

03/24/2021,stocks,"This is the problem with governments thinking they are in competition with each other, rather than working towards global goals: my stocks go down."
03/24/2021,stocks,consider how much American money is in these Americans would be fucked over if they do delist those stocks.
03/24/2021,stocks,My thoughts too. Institutions cutting back on China big time. Heading for the exits.
03/24/2021,stocks,"They should start with Apple and Walmart . Those are top 2 Chinese firms, tell me Im wrong"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good. Reminder:

As a foreign investor, Chinese law restricts you from outright owning a share or stake in a Chinese company (many of which are state-owned). Enter the VIE structure: a Chinese company establishes a wholly-owned subsidiary (often in the Cayman Islands), which then is the company that is listed on a foreign exchange, allowing foreigners to invest. Foreign investors are not buying a stake in the Chinese company; instead, they are buying a contractual promise that the Chinese company will share its earnings and profits with the Cayman subsidiary, which then will be passed on to the investor.

Now let’s say NIO gets pumped; a lot of foreign money flows into it. The CCP then turns around and says, “Great, NIO has a lot of foreign money, pull the plug on the VIE and nullify the contracts.” Now the Chinese company has all your money, and you likely have no judicial recourse or remedy like you’d have here with a pump-and-dump in the States.

And if you don’t think the CCP would do such a thing, remember, in 1997, they signed a treaty to honor the Hong Kong system until the 2047. They went into Hong Kong via the National Security Law anyway, in breach of the treaty.

Watch ""The China Hustle"" documentary to get an idea of how far corruption goes in China. You'd be surprised."
03/24/2021,stocks,"So what will the US companies do that have part or full ownership by a China based company? Unless I am wrong, I am aware of several that have China interest."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The only chinese stock I own is Nio, are they safe?"
03/24/2021,stocks,A lot complaining about this because the SEC doesnt crackdown as hard on the US scam companies. While I would agree but this is still a good move on the SEC. Alot of you cant be mad at this because you had to of known the risk when buying Chinese companies and thats all on you.
03/24/2021,stocks,Lets fucking go.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I only have 1 share of nio so not much skin in the game, but what would happen in the event they got delisted? Would I just lose my money? Would my share be automatically sold at the time of delisting?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I want to believe you guys' optimism regarding NIO, but that's not what my gut feeling is telling me. It clearly states that for a stock to comply with the rules, they cant be owned or controlled by a foreign entity/government or if they have board members who are CCP officials. How is that not breaking the rules? I'll be getting the heck out of there when the stock jumps back up."
03/24/2021,stocks,Good move. They should all follow the same auditing standards. I think they have two or three years to comply so there is no excuse.
03/24/2021,stocks,"holding my xpeng through this and bought the dip.  it gives firms three years to comply, EV is a 2023 play.  i hope to profit off the FUD but am prepared for anything.  this was another rough day for all tech, not just Chinese EV"

03/24/2021,stocks,Time to switch to an American EV like Canoo.
03/24/2021,stocks,"The SEC requires annual audits for all public companies listed in the US except for Chinese firms. The CCP ruled that all Chinese company audit reports are state secrets, and disclosing them without CCP permission is illegal. All other companies listed on US stock exchanges are required, whether US based or not, to submit these annual audit reports. Up to this point, the SEC has been letting Chinese companies slide. I’m shocked this has been tolerated this long. This is just normalizing things."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Never a bad idea to reduce your exposure to volatile stocks. That said, compared to other Chinese companies, NIO does a fairly good job of complying to auditing regulations."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I've definitely considered it, but it's had huge random jumps up too. I'm willing to wait and see what happens over a longer span of time before I jump off at a loss."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’ve held a lot for over a year, sold bits here and there. I have no original shares left. It’s too volatile."
03/24/2021,stocks,"NIO is a bad investment on value proposition alone. This just makes more of a case for dumping it. Anyone that knows Chinese sentiment towards luxury products knows they don't value Chinese products. Anyone in China in the market for a luxury EV is concerned with their social status. To maintain their social status, they seek out foreign products like Tesla or Audi. No one outside China is going to want a luxury Chinese product either. The customers for this product simply aren't there."
03/24/2021,stocks,Dude... sell dat bitch like yesterday. It won't reach 60 again.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same, I think its definitely a step in the right direction."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, but it'll also ensure US *retail* investors have no practical means to invest in Chinese companies outside of certain mutual funds.

Of course, the 1% still have their overseas vehicles for investing in China and can go directly to the Chinese exchange.

The down side is really that the average American won't be able to benefit from Chinese growth any more since institutional funds are required to get out of these stocks; the up side is no more Chinese scams."
03/24/2021,stocks,"US auditing is a joke lol.  I'm sure they'll crack down on some chinese companies I guess, but big 4 couldn't audit their way out of a fucking bag.

Also a main selling point is the cameras and that's one thing they purposely break the settings for. Example of this how they removed the stereo/mono setting meaning most Iphones before gen 10 will have severe audio bounce. Parts of video are nearly muted and other parts are way too loud because there is no way to set which mic records and the phone will bounce between the front mic and the bottom mic.  


I had this issue and looked it up. Oh nice theres a fix! Go to the settings to fix it and the settings not there. Google it and find out the setting was removed. And the fact they fight against the right to repair your own electronics is just bullshit. Breaking them on purpose is outright fraud."

03/24/2021,stocks,"It's a problem, the world thought China could be compatible with it and simply be a shiny new cog that fits into things as normal  


Problem is China's authoritarian government believes the world needs to reshape to fit what it wants. This is the big part of why I don't think China will ever really be a world power in the way the US is/was. They'll have lots of money, sure, but culturally they'll just repeatedly isolate themselves because the government lacks the patience to gently change cultures to fit its own, they make loud demands of a country /company to put on a show for their population and it just makes natives angrier in response. It's a market that may very well end up isolating itself in a big way.   


I personally think India is probably a safer bet because of that, assuming they can pull out of the authoritarian spiral. I suspect that India will end up developing a relationship with with China in the same sort of way as Canada with the US where they develop a nationalistic set of policies and behaviors that are set on being the opposite of their partner country."

Go buy Samsung but if you don't wanna deal with it but I think this is where the whole industry is headed.

The difference is that China is self sufficient and we aren't, we simply can't do as much damage to them. That means we need to be fair if we want to do business. Need to stop spreading rumors and trash talking. If we continue to attempt to take advantage of them or suppress them, and they retaliate, then we gotta accept the consequences. Prepare to develop our own economy so they can't force our hand anymore.

It's our government's fault we are in this situation honestly, people blaming China fail to hold our government accountable. This is what happens when you rely too heavily on foreign nations for decades, they have power over us now. Can't undo that."

First human shared a book that they recently read and they found it interesting. They also shared a brief tid bit of what they were interested by. This form of public sharing is a non verbal cue that a human is open to having a dialogue. In this case regarding the book. The Second human was intrigued so they complied by asking who the author is. 

The WHY (you said how which is more obnoxious than itch you can’t reach; how? They used their fingers to type or voice and dictation software) sorry had to get that off my chest, the WHY is because humans enjoy connecting with each other it is quite literally encoded in our DNA.

03/24/2021,stocks,Obvisiouly they werent delisted you can still trade them today but they did get fined by the SEC and also got sued by investor institutions. There is a website called stockanalysis.com/actions/delisted/ and it gives you a list of stocks that got delisted in the market.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'll agree to that. By confidence, I meant them guessing with a high percentage that the stock will go up again. I said guessing since that's what it seems like sometimes. We can never anticipate how the market acts as a whole."

I googled him and hes some random German evangelical. You think hes relevant in the Americas? I guarantee almost no one on this side of the pond knows who the fuck that dude is or even wants to, for good reason.

Its crazy too instead of refuting actual claims its all ad hoc bullshit. Personally I dont know what the fuck you're even talking about. Maybe some specific evidence that massive Chinese censorship and internment camps are fake? What exactly are you getting at?"

Its like a catch 22 if you will."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Exactly my point, why didn't they get delisted? What makes them so special (or conversely, Chinese companies so bad?). I thought you said they were treated equally?

And no the whole world is not against China. Only NATO countries are, whom apparently hate all muslims except Chinese muslims. Nice meme bro"
03/24/2021,stocks,You clearly have a problem with reading and thinking or else you wouldnt be asking this question. Companies only get delisted when they don’t meet the NYSE guidelines. For example some Chinese companies like what this article is about. Companies like Citigroup regardless if they commit fraud don’t get delisted. This is because some companies are not following the guidelines that the NYSE set. What happened was they got sued by the SEC and had to pay a fine as well as got sued by institutional investors and had to pay them as well and this hurts them financially. Companies don’t get delisted for fraud instead they get sued. Also don’t cry that the US doesnt delist companies committing fraud. You know that there is always that risk when going into the Stock Market period. The point of all of this is that you knew or should have known the risk when buying Chinese stocks. If Chinese companies do not comply with the rules set by the NYSE than they have every right to delist them. So instead of crying on reddit about how bad the US government is because they are bringing down your Chinese stocks because some Chinese companies don’t want to follow the rules set by the NYSE. Instead how about you learn to do proper DD and access risk in the market.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Very smart. I should be learning from you.

But as of right this moment China is committing genocide as well as preparing to invade Taiwan in the next decade. They are infringing on sovereign states in the South China Sea, and they are enslaving Africa with debt. They monitor their citizens and allocate them within a social class based on their loyalty to the CCP.. it’s scary shit dude I don’t want to see that spread in the world."

If USA think they can survive without china, they dead wrong.. almost everything they have is made in china even their fucking iphones.

Invading taiwan is not happening, taiwan itself has a military defense so i doubt war happening. If you talking about HK, i wouldn't get to that, cause HK belongs to China, so usa shouldn't talk about it. If you know history, hk was part of china but british stole it."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes many countries did terrible things in the past. Just because it was done doesn’t mean any country now has a free pass to commit the same crimes.

03/24/2021,stocks,$100 is not enough to day trade. Day trading usually consists of scooping 2-5% movements -- you aren't going to be happy with $2-5 profits each day. It is absolutely not worth the time investment with that little money.

This is true, but what they don't tell you is that the $25k rule applies to accounts that have borrowed margin. 

If you have not borrowed margin, you can day trade as many times as you like, so long as you have enough cash settled.

>Should I avoid penny stocks?

Yes, unless you're comfortable taking a significant amount of risk."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you’re on Robinhood, the $25,000 minimum is referring to unlimited day trading, not day trading in general. Under $25,000, you get 3 day trades per week I believe. 

Generally, it’s probably best to stay away from very small companies (it’s more an issues of market capitalization, or the total value of the company, than it is the share price), as they’re typically riskier. 

As a new investor it’s good, in my opinion, to play around with whatever you please to learn. My first account I blew up from $250 to $100 in a couple days trading a pharmaceutical penny stock. But it taught me some important lessons.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Microsoft lost a lot of developer mindshare in the 2010s.

Meaning that the people who write software have long ago switched from the Microsoft platform, developer tools and stacks.

Most modern software development (at scale) is being done with Java and Javascript.  AWS is pretty dominant in cloud hosting.  

A lot of micro services architectures leveraging Docker and open source stacks running on linux.

A lot of the workstations used by developers are latest and greatest Apple MacBook Pro machines.

This is just my “man on the ground” perspective.

I’m sure Microsoft has a lot of “cash cow” products that they continue to charge for but I don’t really see it as a “growth” company that can innovate.  

Once developers have switched their workstation platforms and have gone full open source as far as the platform they deploy their software to, you’ve lost innovation and control of the future.  Like it or not, Microsoft Windows is not going to be the operating system that powers cloud platforms of the future.  

It’s not really about Apple versus Microsoft. It’s about open-source versus licensed platforms and developer mindshare.  

Through extremely disingenuous business practices, Microsoft has managed to alienate a huge share of the developer population. They will never use Microsoft platforms or tools again.  They treat any mention of Microsoft tools, stacks or platforms with suspicion.  They know that with Microsoft there is always a catch. 

A huge problem that Microsoft has is that of licensing software at scale.  You need to license every running instance of Microsoft software.  This makes it impossible to scale up because every computing unit that you add you have to pay a license for to Microsoft.  Modern software has to scale up and out.  This just becomes impossible from a licensing perspective with Microsoft. It’s much better to go with a free open source stack.

Microsoft has licensing terms built into their developer tools that can rob you blind.  They also force you to keep using their platform by locking you into their ecosystem from the time you have a MVP. (Minimum Viable Product)  This is built-in to the software lifecycle when you use Microsoft development tools.  Microsoft also creates artificial problems and gaps for which you need to buy another Microsoft product.  

They do this purposely in order to get more of your money.  It is though they have perfected the art of capturing your money.  The more needs you have and the more problems you need to solve, the more money you have to pay Microsoft.

This has driven many developers over a tipping point where they never want to have anything to do with any Microsoft product or platform in the future.  Ever again.

That’s a terrible reputation to have as a business with your core audience.  

Ultimately a successful software business (SaaS, platform, tools) is built on developer mind share.  Ensuring that developers use your offerings to build new software. 

That is not happening with Microsoft. There is a lot of old software that was built using Microsoft tools but nothing new.

I’d say long-term bet against Microsoft.  

Bet on amazon AWS.  Bet on Atlassian.  Bet on IntelliJ.  Bet on Mirantis / Docker.  

Bet on companies offering IaaS to open source software scalable stacks and software architectures.  Like amazon AWS.  

Don’t bet on companies whose whole business model is capturing licensing revenue from every part of the software lifecycle.  

Don’t bet on Oracle or Microsoft.  They are thinking about software in terms of nickel and diming you for every little thing.  License costs for every component of your architecture.

Developers are moving to a free open source model where the software they write will run on architectures that are made up of open source software components.  

This way, it might cost money to develop (the tools cost money, your Apple laptop costs money) but to run the end product you won’t need to pay any licensing cost.  You will still pay for IaaS costs, but nothing else to run the software that you write."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I hold Apple. No Microsoft. Microsoft has only ever bought and suffocated the technology into pure crap. 

They may have a stranglehold right now, but the next gen of devs aren’t going to deal with their shit. 

Apple products are expensive, but a lot of the software is free and generally, it’s decently written and just works. 

VMware, azure, and others like this won’t be around forever. I’d choose VMware over azure, but I’d also choose neither of them other other more open platforms, that I can actually own and take control of. 

As for the office tools. Those will die out as soon as the next gen of IT takes over the dinosaurs in place currently who were taught it’s a Microsoft world only. 

Open source licensing is the future despite what both Microsoft and apple would have you believe."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Microsoft buys innovation. But frankly from an in house innovation perspective besides maybe azure they pale in comparison to apple. As a company it has a more mature workforce and ppl consider it to be a good job to rest and vest. The Microsoft brand is also iconic but not exactly alluring. 

Apple has vertically integrated products. They have much a better brand. They haven't been buying as many companies as microsoft but are sitting on A LOT of cash. Every product they seem to release either becomes a sensation, an eventual revenue source or ppl forget that it failed. From an engineering perspective the company is a lot more focused on innovation, internal R&D, has more 'innovative' teams and is the go to destination for engineers in the hardware space compared to microsoft. From a business perspective their future products will all probably have some sort of subscription model which is great cash flow and people love the brand enough to get into it , see Apple Card.

This was purely me saying stories tho. Msft seems to be a better buy right now marginally but apples brand is too strong to count it out."
03/24/2021,stocks,I think IoT is going to be a space for Apple to make its way into. It’s in infancy and there aren’t any huge players yet. Not saying it’s better than MSFT necessarily

But Cokes brand is so powerful they dont need to diversify as far to be competitive, their branding changed the color of Santa Claus's coat in the public mind from green to red.

03/24/2021,stocks,"> Like it or not, Microsoft Windows is not going to be the operating system that powers cloud platforms of the future.

MS realizes this and that's why they've invested so heavily to support Linux infrastructure for Azure. I remember reading something like half of all Azure VMs are linux based.

Regarding developers, the hot startup crowd might be moving away from MS based solutions. But most enterprise is heavily reliant on MS products. And there's a good reason for that. They're the best when it comes to backwards compatibility. I don't see that changing anytime soon.

As for developers:

- C# is still in the top 5 programming languages as per the TIOBE index

- Visual Studio is the most popular IDE

- VS Code was recently ranked the most popular dev environment tool according to a Stack Overflow Survey

- Windows is still by far the most popular OS for devs

And with their recent acquisition of Github, they're pretty well entrenched in the development ecosystem

I think you're too optimistic about free open source software taking over the world. Enterprises aren't willing to do that because they need immediate support to fix issues, and that's what they pay top dollar for."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This just isn’t correct. 

You don’t pay anything more or less when developing in C#, .Net and run it on Azure(or wherever you would like) vs doing it in Java, Kotlin, Go, Rust, Python or any other language and running it on GCP or AWS. And Docker has nothing to do with the discussion either. 

And Oracle owns Java btw.

It’s not a baseless assumption... I’m sure 95%+ of Fortune 1000 companies use Microsoft Office products. There’s no competition for Word Excel and PowerPoint. Google sheets suck.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Most Java projects that matter are porting over to Amazon Corretto.  Oracle is not a responsible steward of Java and JEE.  Oracle is actively restricting licensing and will start charging money on the Java software lifecycle.  This is happening with the upgrade to Java 8 I think. 

FWIW, companies whose business model is based on licensing money traps will have a hard time keeping developer mindshare.  There is active developer flight from those companies and their ecosystems.

The leftover developers are by and large  working in legacy projects.  Also that developer population is aging or offshore.  The young grads who matter when it comes to innovation are all on the open source Java and JS stacks.

A lot of the corporate enterprise MS software projects will go the way of government COBOL projects.  They just won’t be relevant anymore.  They’ll be in the same tiny niche 25-50 years from now, running in a corporate data center on some old hardware.  Which is totally ok.

They will still be used and minimally maintained but no one will really look forward to working on them or maintaining them.

Also hiring managers will have a hard time finding developers with that skillset to fill in positions that open up due to retirements and death. They usually go offshore for those skill sets. Which is OK. But most innovation doesn’t happen offshore. It happens in the United States.

I’m looking at future innovation trends, not cash cow legacy systems.  

The absolute requirements are developer mindshare, scalability and zero runtime licensing cost. 

Open source component architectures deliver on all three requirements.  

I’ve never heard of massively scalable system architectures running on Microsoft infrastructure.  For example, having one component of the architecture as windows Docker instances instead of linux.

Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Google you name it.  

There was a time when Google was actively “scrubbing” their internal software architecture of any Microsoft technology “pollution”.  Meaning they were going through every component and replacing it with an open source equivalent or porting it over to an open source stack.  

I honestly don’t see a future for Microsoft if the young developer mindshare and talent is alienated from the Microsoft ecosystem...

Microsoft is going to be the next IBM. Legacy enterprise systems in maintenance mode with an aging developer population with no-one who matters interested in taking over that maintenance.  Yes they will still be used.  

But the people working on them will be more like aging depressed janitors (or the offshore 4K / year consultant) and less like the innovative young grads working on their JS stacks on shiny new Apple MacBook Pros."
03/24/2021,stocks,Charging to too much is a massive drawback since it prevents scalability and redirects a massive budget share that could be used on new features and fixing defects toward paying for licenses.  It’s a death spiral for software projects.
03/24/2021,stocks,">  I’m sure 95%+ of Fortune 1000 companies use Microsoft Office products.

There’s a reason ms is buying discord and potentially clubhouse and it’s not because they like the product but they they want to keep it from eating away at their existing cash cows, so they’ll either buy it an make it great or buy it and make it useless and force existing customers into one of their existing products.

I don’t think we know what the next generation of communication devices will look like. It’s too early but I don’t know if Apple will make the leap. In the meantime they’ll put out fantastic smartphones.

The gluttony for instant gratification in American society is now on full display in the stock market with the flood of retail investors wanting to get rich quick. We can't all be u/deepfuckingvalue"
03/24/2021,stocks,I feel every week we have a Motley Fool post that consists of people either hating on the MF or people who paid for their stock advisor service and actually made money.
03/24/2021,stocks,"The Motley Fool Stock Advisor is actually really valuable. The marketing articles are purely for SEO, but the actual services are amazing and have consistently beaten the market for 30 years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Use the paid service, do some DD based on their premium recommendations. Nothing worthwhile is free."
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve only ever listened to MF podcasts to learn about companies that I hadn’t heard of. I’m new to investing so it’s definitely been helpful for me.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Every Montley Fool Article summarized:

Why this X stock is going up/down

Short summary of the stock and what it’s currently doing with a cliff hanger and question: Should you invest $1,000 right now in X stock? Sign up for our newsletter to get exclusive tips from the ones who predicted Amazon & Netflix BEFORE they were big!

🙄"
03/24/2021,stocks,I use them to tell me what to sell and what to buy long puts for...... the fact of the matter is that the best time to buy a stock is not when someone tells you to buy it but before “they” tell you to buy it because they are selling it to you to secure profits while leaving you with the bags.... fact of life really... make a decision on your own and live with the consequences...rather then basing it on what others tell you.....there are ZERO exceptions to this rule in my opinion..
03/24/2021,stocks,Motley Fool is just simply 95% garbage!  and the other 5% is only good if you just so happen to stumble on a ticker that they mentioned in the headline of one of their piece of shit articles that is worth checking into. Other than that they are just a bunch of paid off yuppies that need to be kicked in the sack or teeth every day for the rest of their lives.
03/24/2021,stocks,The way I see it is that if they were so good at reading the market they wouldn't be journalists writing for the motley fool. They would instead be making money in the stock market.
03/24/2021,stocks,Oh yes the weekly Motley Fool thread...
03/24/2021,stocks,"I disagree with this, I’ve been in motley fool for 5 years and all their plays except for a handful have paid off handsomely. Granted the market has been way too generous the past 5 years (excluding the covid drop) but I wouldn’t say the motley fool has bad takes. 

Their like any business. Sure they want you to click the ads so they can make some $$$ but that doesn’t mean their content is shabby. There’s a reason they have a big following"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’ve hated Motley fool, their picks have been crap and most of their stuff is “click here so you can pay us and find out our picks.”  It’s always clickbait"
03/24/2021,stocks,I mean the name “Motley Fool” tells ya right there
03/24/2021,stocks,"Remember: if these guys knew how to pick stocks, they would be living in a mansion day trading when they weren’t on vacation, not writing click bait analysis on spec for motley fool."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I paid for a year of motley fool what a fucking waste of money,  I would have  even better off blindly investing the money I spent on them in the stock market"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m extremely new to stocks, and even I don’t know why people would take Motly Fools’ “advice” seriously. (My Amex card offered a free membership, so I decided to take a look before signing up). Literally their entire site reads like a cheesy, more annoying AS SEEN ON TV advertisement. “Oh wait! There’s more!” 
Call me crazy...but just seems unlikely to me that people giving real, serious, professional advice on something like stocks wouldn’t require stooping down to such tacky tactics to get a customers’ attention."
03/24/2021,stocks,Such an underrated post! You verbalized exactly what I was thinking.
03/24/2021,stocks,Pretty much every “review” based website is. This is what happened when google dissallowed bunk SEO blogs to work in the background.
03/24/2021,stocks,You are the product.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah the motley fool is just huge bs. All their articles are basically the same as if they are being generated by some sort of bot. And in the end ""we have a stock which performs much better than the mentioned stock sign up now"". Awful site."
03/24/2021,stocks,"In the long run, there is more to gain from retail investors piling onto the same strong stocks with good fundamentals than it is feeding short-seller funds some kind of intel. And articles these days, I think you just have to skim between the good writers, the bad writers and what I'd agree could be hot-air SEO plays or advertisement.

But just because the S&P undergoes more volatility than usual due to a volatile economy and climate, and one of their tips from 1 month ago hasn't panned out in 30 days, I wouldn't say MF and the others are all hack websites. Definitely can't google a stock and buy based on the  search results, though."
03/24/2021,stocks,So then what are we supposed to use?
03/24/2021,stocks,Then what's good?
03/24/2021,stocks,Shocker!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Can't name your website that and then think you deserve to be respected, right?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm pretty new at this but it seems like financial news tends to be reactionary.  Like how police cannot investigate a crime until after it has been committed usually.  Not advice, just something I have been noticing."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you are judging the MF based on its free daily articles then you are sorely mislead

It is all about long term investing for its paid subscribers"
03/24/2021,stocks,"As someone who is young and new to investing, I have my Roth filled with ETFs recommended for steady growth that I will max each year. I also have a brokerage account, however, and have found myself on Motley fool often, but I rarely take their advice because I figure if everyone is being served this article there may be some ulterior motive by the publisher. My question is, then, how do you discover companies that aren’t making the news? Tesla and Facebook etc get a lot of coverage but I don’t understand where people or funds go to find companies that have up and comer potential? OP says statements and industry news. Where do you go for sources in this stuff?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ironically, I've noticed stories popping up from the Motley Fool about investing. I read a little bit and bounced. I just don't trust it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep, if you google pretty much any stock you'll get an autoformat article from them

""This stock is terrible, you should buy this stock (that we hid behind an expensive paywall)"""
03/24/2021,stocks,People always bash the free articles at The Motley Fool but honestly their podcasts are some of the best out there. I’ve gotten many good ideas about some pretty obscure companies from their shows that I ended up investing in and doing well with
03/24/2021,stocks,Motley fool hooked me up with iRobot that’s about it
03/24/2021,stocks,I swear since I've been openly shit talking them this week I've gotten twice as many junk emails from them.
03/24/2021,stocks,Is this a “duh” moment? I feel like this is a “duh” moment.
03/24/2021,stocks,What is a seo play?
03/24/2021,stocks,Can you/anyone elaborate on “financial statements and sector/industry news”?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have invested in about 4 or 5 stocks purely from motley fool's articles. And I will say, they've all done well."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Do we really need a ""Motley Fool is crap"" post every day? I have seen at least 5 over the past week."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You just described 95% of the Internet. I miss those days of the early Internet, yeah things were slow but most people created content for the hell of it instead of just blindly chasing money."
03/24/2021,stocks,Aaaand motley fool is somehow excluded from this?
03/24/2021,stocks,I can confirm this (have programmed websites from scratch)
03/24/2021,stocks,"They get paid by inst and hedge funds to short sell report. It’s a joke. 
Aimee Chancellors dad raped a kid eh?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes sir. Forget the outlets, check the Press Agencies directly."
03/24/2021,stocks,"yes but sometimes you can glean some good ideas by reading the bottom, where they declare if they own a stock; not a consistently winning play per se, but even if they're pedaling BS, they're putting their money where their mouth is. And furthermore, there is often an army of sheep following. If something has an effect on the broader psychology of the market, we shouldn't ignore it."
03/24/2021,stocks,This is true
03/24/2021,stocks,"new are quite literally never news. they are olds, and always priced in.

hft algos read reuters, ap and bloomberg feeds, and god knows what else.

when the MF hack finally gets around to copy paste the press release, added their nonsense take and formatted and published it, the algo has already done about a million trades."
03/24/2021,stocks,Already deleted motley fool from my suggested google News feed
03/24/2021,stocks,"we are getting played hard on stocks, these guys run articles on opposite of what you should be doing to play into hands of people that fund them."
03/24/2021,stocks,no fucking shit
03/24/2021,stocks,"SEO is attempting to rank better in Google's search results

You just described how online publications make money (advertising)

These things are not related"
03/24/2021,stocks,Also to give half bad advice to keep wealth in balance. Balance means that the 99 stay below
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think of those sites similarly to how I view Wikipedia when writing a research paper: they're where you start, and then you follow through with the real sources.

Motley Fool isn't s substitute for doing your own DD, but it can give you an idea on some potential growth opportunities, and then you do the DD on those companies you wouldn't have otherwise heard of.

The Motley Fool Investment Guide I've found to be an invaluable resource in picking stocks. Using the advice in it during this past year (my first year actively managing any investments) my portfolio has doubled the S&P's performance. (Though Covid was slightly cheating, as I took a few positions early last March that are not in keeping the MF's philosophy because I was counting on governmental intervention protecting the travel industry. It paid off big.)"
03/24/2021,stocks,Did you guys just realize this? Really?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I find the Fool more as an educational source events using news as examples rather than actual reporting or opinions on the news.  Over the years, I have learned things such as different metrics per industry, some things to keep an eye on during calls, laymen descriptions of businesses, and so on.

Now not every article is a winner obviously and you have to use your brain to avoid click bait (which there is a ton of).  Overall though, I like the good content they put out and that outweighs the annoying click bait, IMO."
03/24/2021,stocks,Are you going to tell me that this is an inaccurate article: [https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/investing-strategies-small-cap-investing.aspx](https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/investing-strategies-small-cap-investing.aspx)?
03/24/2021,stocks,I've been trading for 4 weeks and I already avoid this site like the plague.
03/24/2021,stocks,They definitely live up to being a fool.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I feel like tracking stocks and divergence from its competitors directly related in its sector, is huge. Then researching what happened at those times, wether it’s MF or nasdaq news or whatever you want to use but use many sites, take all that info with a grain of salt, piece the puzzles together and invest when you feel it’s at the right price. 

Looking at things like financial reports, p/e, Greeks, patterns, etc. Then adding in financial news with all that and you’re good IMO"
03/24/2021,stocks,Its obvious reading them.
03/24/2021,stocks,I hope this is blatantly obvious to everyone investing though. Especially Motley Fool. It is essentially a satire website.
03/24/2021,stocks,Anybody who writes articles is full of shit. You can’t trust a single person at all
03/24/2021,stocks,yea agreed. i got a sub for free to motley fool through an amex blue card promotion and I didn't find much value in their content.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I actually work in SEO/Content and noticed they're hiring an editor position. 

Before you can even apply, they ask you to submit a full length article about very specific investing topics. Hmm...

Most companies I interviewed with at least have a 15-min discovery call with the recruiter before they even give you a writing exercise."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Well, if you pay for the subscription you might feel raped. Read the tiny letters, their information is public dominion. You can find most of their information for free.
I am very skittish, especially if my savings are going somewhere I don't know very well."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I just smash a stock into the reddit search bar, read the first DD that confirms my bias, and buy."
03/24/2021,stocks,this. crawl them to collect tickers so you dont have to put them in by hand. that is literally all they are good for
03/24/2021,stocks,They're also really good if you're sourcing puts. I just started dabbling in puts and their picks for calls and buys are printing wonderfully.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yea that pretty much sums up what I do.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I can tell you for a fact, that they are indeed generated automatically :) lots of stock pages have something like that in place"
03/24/2021,stocks,same

I’m in New York City"
03/24/2021,stocks,Idaho’s dope!
03/24/2021,stocks,"> Having said that their picks this are doing abysmally this year and much worse than any index

This is because they mostly recommend aggressively growing tech companies, a sector which money has rotated out of in the last month in favor of value stocks.  The recent poor performance reflects less on quality of the companies they recommend and is more due to broader market trends.


Similarly, their success in 2020 was boosted by the sector rotation into growth stocks."
03/24/2021,stocks,I use motley fool I dislike all the extra words but when you get down to the Brass Tacs David Gardner has made me money and I think educated me on why he chooses what he chooses.  Example he bets on the CEO and the vision they have.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I subscribe to their Rule Breakers service which recommends 2 stocks every month. I don’t buy every recommendation as I put a few additional screens of my own on their recommendations. Over the past 3 years that I’ve been a subscriber I’ve made an absolute killing. Two of their recommendations I was up over 1000% on until the recent tech sell off, and I’ve had no losers since putting in my additional screens."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I allocated 5% of my portfolio is motley fool Stock Advisor and Rule Breakers tickers in early February.... I'm down worse than any other part of my portfolio.   


Same as you though, it's hard to blame the fools because the picks do seem like reasonable tickers... just really really bad timing. Not selling though because none of them are junk brands."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I also subscribe to Stock Advisor and, like it did for you, it's definitely paid off way way way more than the subscription fee.

But I am right there with everybody who's ever complained about sitting through their hour-long video presentations about their other paid services without even getting a single stock tip at the end. We used to be able to count on getting at least one recommendation with a presentation but now it's sporadic. When we get a stock tip, that hour is well spent and I'm a happy and grateful customer; without one, it's like going to a time-share presentation without even a dinner in return for my time and I'm grumpy about it.

However, I'll just say again that I have never regretted subscribing to Stock Advisor and for people who are not investment-savvy (I'm so not), it's a user-friendly service for sure."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is true unless you bought into their picks a month ago   


(crying in shame)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Anyone can sound smart in a bull run. I’ll wait to see these youtube and reddit “geniuses” during a downturn before I consider them actual good sources.

But, I do agree it’s better than the Motley Fool."
03/24/2021,stocks,"There is no such thing as a ""trustworthy YouTuber"", they don't make money from good trades or solid analysing...they make money from fun constant confirming your bias, so you keep watching. It's a puppet show, not the truth...



And same applies to reddit. Stocks are pumped here daily, DDs are made up on speculation and lies and still get showered in awards. Accounts are bought and sold, reddit is *ripe* with manipulation. 



That's just how it is, *no one will ever give you good free advice*. No one wants to make you rich, on the contrary. A YouTube influencer, a motley fool writer or a reddit DD pumper want only one thing *your money in their pocket*. ""A fool and his money are easily parted"" and its twice as easy nowadays thanks to the Internet."
03/24/2021,stocks,/s?
03/24/2021,stocks,"The ads are stupid and the emails drive me up the wall. But motley fool has made me some good money in the 1.5 years I've paid for the stock advisor service.
Plus, I work long hours everyday. If paying $105 to get stocks picked for me with a breakdown of why, how, who etc than that saves me a ton of time. The podcast (Rule breakers) was also a huge stepping stone into me even buying stocks at all.

They deserve the hate for the ads and spam, but the service itself is worth it I'd say."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I am a MF subscriber. I think the service is fantastic. Overall, I have made great returns researching and investing in their recommendations. They do recommend balancing your individual equity investments with an index fund because their picks tend to be growth/tech/volatile.  I did a fool Zoom customer feedback call a month ago and told them that their advertising on the internet is terrible. It does a poor job of representing the value of their services. They come across as a fraud. I do not recall how I came to subscribe, but the actual membership service is great. They need a new PR team...badly!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Agreed. It’s a value proposition balancing act.

It is Motley Fool’s job to make the user feel like they are coming out of the provider-user transaction with a net gain.

We agree to pay the time and patience tax to avoid subscription fees. We agree to navigate an aesthetically-dogshit website to mine for quality content. At this point the user feels like they’re breaking even, ASSUMING they are finding quality content. Insult the user’s intelligence with even one clickbait ad headline that might as well be “Let’s See if You’re a Big Enough Sucker to Click This Ad”, and I’m out. Net loss at that point.

The best way to get someone to opt out is to make them feel like you’re taking advantage of them."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Sucks because Montley Fool used to be legit. 

That was one of the first investing advice institutions my dad introduced me to way back in the day. 

Now it's just clickbait."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I use it because I like how they organize information about a company. It's complementary to using Yahoo Finance.

But I also use it to search for a ticket and read the company's data. I don't use Simply for anything else other than maybe combining some stocks in my own portfolio to see what data is could tell me about it."
03/24/2021,stocks,Quite an amazing tool! The fact that they even give you what they do for free is pretty cool. Really gets you itching to pay for more analysis (have to force myself to not do it though)
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yup, there are MANY other examples of this from the past couple of years alone-FVRR at $100 maybe, CRWD at well lower than $100, SHOP at a couple hundred, HUBS, ASML and TTD are other examples that have gone up a ridiculous amount in a short time since recommended."
03/24/2021,stocks,"May I ask how long you’ve had SA? I’ve had it for less than a year, but I rarely see recommendations with prices that low.  They recently recommended Match to me and it was in the hundreds."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Even a blind hen can find a seed, and in a bullrun everyone's a genius. Their paid service isn't magical, of they *knew* they'd invest themselves and make bank. But they don't, because they get their money from *your subscription* not their accuracy.




Eventually you'll resize they don't outperform the market and stop paying. But it doesn't matter, by then a new generation of green investors listen to their picks and see some actually take off (due to luck, chance) and keep paying. A monkey throwing darts on a newspaper best the market...a monkey best their service."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have SA and used it a lot for the first few months of investing, but then I just got sick of them pushing the same overvalued stocks (often too late) again and again. There’s only so many times I’m going to buy Pinterest or Crowdstrike, and they recommended them at the peak here.

Then they push SKLZ when it was at $32 and and sold some puts on those and barely got out with a profit before it crashed down to $20. What’s funny is that I’ll probably still end up buying 100 shares of SKLZ and watch it crash to the teens..."
03/24/2021,stocks,Buying a lot of those high dividend yielding IPOs?
03/24/2021,stocks,What's some high dividend stocks you bought recently?
03/24/2021,stocks,It's because the individual writers say what they want as their opinion
03/24/2021,stocks,"As people on reddit said before, MF is not a hive mind with a single sentiment on stocks. It's individual writers posting their opinions."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The key is to subscribe to one that tends to be on the early end of that curve, then sell the Motley Bump."
03/24/2021,stocks,These are not mutually exclusive

Huh.  You'd think a place purporting to give (and asking you to buy) financial advice would be able to spot a broad market trend."
03/24/2021,stocks,Exactly. Since February a lot of picks are getting slammed but (at least) the ones I chose were also 15%+ YTD at the time. Still way above the S&P and on par with the Nasdaq. Can't be sad with those returns.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep.  These were just two of my biggest gains.  They’re trying to say a $66k gain (that’s just MTCH!) for $150/year isn’t worth it.  Uh, ok.

That guy below saying he lost all his money on the paid service has to be lying or an idiot."

if you buy 1 share of a stock that is worth a $1000 and 100 of one at $10 a 10% increase gets you the same amount of money"

and

My father in law has done well with them as well, so I guess only time will tell.  I’m not doing well at all right now but it’s tech.  Hopefully they will pick back up at some point."

Yes they have a lot of content (esp the free stuff) that tries to sell paid services, which I get used to ignoring. The free stuff is also kinda superficial. Stock Advisor seems pretty good for me. Pretty easy to read recommendations, and the selling/ads is usually limited and towards the end."

They recommended TSLA from 2011 to 2013 but gave a new full recommendation early last year. There were - and still are - some best buy now recommendations and I don't think it's at all crazy. Some analists have them being a multi-bagger in 5 years time."

03/24/2021,stocks,I let my rule breakers expire. Stock advisor is cheaper has a better record and better for my small investing surplus. That said when I signed up Redfin was the recommendation at $18/share. 🤷‍♂️
03/24/2021,stocks,Thank for helping me not poopoo my partial shares while I’m working through growing my capital.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I can sit on it.  My only goal in investing is too beat inflation, so I’m not sure why my questions are upsetting people.  Perhaps I’m unclear, but I was just wondering when the PP bought Match.  Obviously he would make a bigger gain buying Match at 18 than I would at 180."
03/24/2021,stocks,Who cares about 6 months? Sounds like a good time to buy
03/24/2021,stocks,"FWIW, TTD was down over 60% when the first recommended too. If you can't see a long term strategy, then you shouldn't be in the stock in the first place"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I just recently started using them. Does that mean that with your strategy you buy every bi-monthly recommendation and then sell at a 10% loss from that day?  Have you had any regrets so far in those 5 years with your 10% sell rule? Some of their recommendations this year are bleeding like crazy...LMND, SKLZ. I'm starting to see a pattern with Tom's recommendations."
03/24/2021,stocks,I do use many of the SA picks for selling options against. I figure that strong stocks will be easier to emotionally carry if I get assigned.
03/24/2021,stocks,Except this would be dangerous in a large code base and harder to maintain. Setting the index in scope is useful instead of hoping you remember to reset this variable before each loop. Seems like a weird thing to do with no benefit and added risk.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Keep reading runaway assessment on TSLA for up to $3k. Maybe it will happen, haven’t held TSLA since 2016. Won’t bet on or against them unless they were to drop back well below $400-450."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Sorry man. I am just seeing allot of folks being negative. 

I am just thinking positive. Right now the market is trending down due to nonsense. My opinion is big money is part of the reason for this drop. They see a massive opportunity to make a ton of cash in the days ahead. 

Allot of folks don’t realize that. I kinda wished I waited till today to buy, but I bought into my new portfolio last friday.I’m down like 2%... my projections show a 20-30% increase when this economy comes back to full optimism."
03/24/2021,stocks,What a boomer response.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I only buy the Buy now stocks.  If it drops 10% from where I bought it I sell, pretty much always.  That’s my hard rule.  No one stock is going to damage to my portfolio.

LMND is funny.  I bought at $78.16 on their rec.  My other, less firm rule is sell on a 20% pullback.  So I sold at $115.00.  Then I randomly bought 1/2 again at $105.18, if it doesn’t go up tomorrow, I’ll probably sell.

I never regret a sell or even take the time to look back.  What’s the point?  I bought at the wrong time.  I accept it and move on.  You’ll NEVER time every single trade absolutely perfectly.  The sooner you get out of your own way, the better investor you’ll be.  You read all these “shoulda, woulda, coulda” posts.  They aren’t learning anything other than investing is easy if you have hindsight.  You don’t.  Get over it.

Edit:  Whew- that was a ramble!  Sorry!"
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve never been good at options. Ever.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, but I’m need to this so my opinion might not matter much.  I hope we are right."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know, facts suck, right?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Great response. Thank you. I was lacking some direction on when to sell and this is a great approach. 

I'm guessing that once we hit a true bear market the 10% sell rule will need some nuance."
03/24/2021,stocks,Why do you automatically sell at a 10% loss? I’m not criticizing just trying to understand.  I’m new to this. I have a couple stocks that are down 25% right now.  I don’t plan on selling.  I believe in the companies - just think I bought too high.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it’s MORE of a hard sell.  Raise cash for a lower market.

Added-  It’s only 10% from the purchase price, so my main holdings like AAPL and AMZN wouldn’t be effected."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because I lived through the dot.com bust, where my portfolio was DESTROYED.  

Luckily I was young, so I could recover.  A 10% loss is easily recovered.  A 50% loss, not so much- the company may come back, but the time it takes to do so will kill you.  A 99% loss is punch in the gut.  Why take that risk?"

2021-03-24 19:43:33,stocks,"House downpayment stored in VTI index fund? So far I've got about $20,000 in a savings account that I'm building up over the next year for a downpayment on a house. I have my other financial bases covered (no debt, fully funded emergency fund). Currently, I'm just tossing money each month into the savings account for the future downpayment -- but I'd like to see if I can get some kind of better return from the market instead.

Is it too risky to put it all in VTI or other index funds? Is it not risky enough to warrant decent growth? I'm looking to cash it all out in about a year or so, so I'm interested in some measure of risk to possibly gain some nice rewards as I continually fund it throughout the year. I imagine I can probably save $60-80k on my own over the next year, but hoping maybe the market can add something significant to that along the way.

Or since it's important life money (not exactly ""play"" money), should I just use a high yield savings account instead and keep risk as low as possible?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you're buying a house in a year or two, then bad idea. Five or ten years? Probably okay."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The current market (or really, anytime) is too risky to park money into for a ""short term"" (such as one to two years).  I agree with the above response.  IF you were looking at a 5 to 10 year time frame, than putting it into a broad-market index fund like VTI or VOO or even VOOG might be worthwhile. But if you really need it back for a house in a year or two, I'd leave it in a bank savings account."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Put only what you can afford to lose. The fund can lose value like any other exchange traded asset. It's a lower risk than some other asset classes, but a risk nonetheless. That said, if you're continuing to fund the savings account and 20k is an acceptable number now, if you move 5k into vti, how long until you've built savings back to 20?  If it's plausible based on your expendable income and wouldn't change your life to lose the 5k, then go for it. 

Doesn't have to be an all or nothing play."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I was in your shoes, but I wouldn't do this. I tried this for a very small amount at the start of the year. Luckily I only have <$2500 in the account. I've stopped looking at the market and instead I am looking at just putting my money into a savings account while I'm growing my downpayment. I couldn't stomach volatility of the recent market relative to what I planned to use the cash for. It's just not worth it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I would not put it in the market if you need it soon and it’s set aside for something specifically, like others have said, if you were wanting to use it in 5-10 years you would have some more risk tolerance. If you want to put a tiny amount in the market, like $1,000 just to see if you can grow it and it would not set you back to lose it, that wouldn’t be bad IMO but otherwise I’d leave it somewhere safe like a high yield savings or CD.

There isn’t much you can do that is super safe and has much immediate growth to it unfortunately.  I’ve moved my down payment money around to a different bank or two when they have an offer for like $300-$400 to open an account and maintain a high balance or something like that but that’s about all you can do that has no risk to it."
03/24/2021,stocks,Good to know. Even index funds would be too volatile for a year to make the risk worth it?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah that's my feeling too. It's tempting to get aggressive when you see just how long it takes save for a down payment -- BUT that tough road to save is the reason to NOT take risks with it, I suppose. If I saved $50k cash and lost even 40% of it on a market downturn, I'd be devastated."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If market crashes and your down payment goes away, what then? I’ve always been told any money you will need in next 2 years, put in high yield savings account. Won’t get you inflation rates, but better then losing it. Can also look into some CDs that are timed to when you’ll need the money."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I think honestly around 40 or so, they don’t have any big players yet to my knowledge using their tooling (which is fancy looking ML/AI IDE). There are a lot of other tools libraries out there a lot of which are free to use TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, and plenty of free cheap IDE for all languages. Then to add most major clouds offer “easier to use” ML and AI options built into their offering too. 

Basically- I haven’t seen anything that wows me from what this company has. Working in the industry and with plenty of major competitors IBM, Oracle, RedHat, etc.. anything that touts “no code” and business user friendly usually is a great sales pitch and that’s where it ends."

03/24/2021,stocks,Deja vu is hitting hard right now. I feel like this question gets asked every year and the answer has always been yes. So buy buy buy
03/24/2021,stocks,"Bought some more today to average down. Holding 25 now @ 123.13 average 

It's not much buts its honest work"
03/24/2021,stocks,If you’re buying for the long term. Apple will always be a set and forget stock.
03/24/2021,stocks,Personally I hold quite a bit of Apple shares. I do like the stock with  a very low cost basis. It’s a stock that you can buy and hold for the next 10+ years. If Apple happened to dip further down to the $110.00 level I would buy as many shares as I could. I do believe before the end of 2021 Apple will be trading about $150. It’s a core purchase to hold.
03/24/2021,stocks,Time in the market beats timing the market. It's always a good idea to buy Apple.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Apple is a wonderful company. It has a brand that is very hard to replicate. This builds a very strong moat which is always wanted for an investment. Their service segment has really stepped up its game which improves Apple’s margins.

Their recent quarter report was a record breaking quarter. They are pushing new products all the time which can’t do any harm to the revenue or bottom line really. Tim Cook is a brilliant CEO who has lead Apple very efficiently and provided great shareholder value.

Their balance sheet is good. Especially their cash holdings. They hold a ton cash and other current assets that they can use in making the company even bigger. The ability to liquidate swiftly is a very important ability and Apple has that.

They’ve gone down with the market, but they will eventually bounce back. Buy and hold."
03/24/2021,stocks,I hope it goes down to $115 so I can load up more
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it will go down to $117-118 before it rallies, but that's not a given. Apple will rally any day now regardless."
03/24/2021,stocks,"A number of brokers have raised targets on Apple. It is currently trading well below most target prices.  In my opinion, it's always a good time to buy Apple if you are looking for a long term investment. Currently, professional analysts agree."
03/24/2021,stocks,"With a company like Apple, forget about trying to catch the bottom of the pullbacks, a vast majority of people can’t do that. just look back at the ATH. If you aren’t buying near the ATH, you’re good. It’s really that simple with a stock like AAPL, it’s so solid you could even buy the ATH and be ok over time (though that’s far from ideal of course)

So yeah. Has it pulled back? Yes? Ok buy some"
03/24/2021,stocks,I wouldn't be surprised if it dips lower. But honestly even now it's a good price. 15% from the ATH is a pretty good discount
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Apple is one of the best companies in the world to own and the price does not seem to high. If you want to buy apple some day, right now is not to bad I guess."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's def a good buy. In a few years, when they make an electric car, it'll skyrocket"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you think they should trade at their average PE over the last 10 years they should be trading in the 70’s. Or if you can explain what magical event happened in 2018 that warranted them to permanently trade in the PE 30 range go for it. I don’t see their expected growth over the next 2-3 years justifying their current valuation.

Edit: Hey OP, you have 20 comments on here and nobody is talking about valuation fundamentals, balance sheet, earnings, growth projections etc. the things you should be looking  at before buying a stock. Suggest you learn as much as you can before buying, even if spending 2-3 hours, you’ll save a lot in the long run. I’m certainly no expert and you can tell that by my half assed comment on PE’s."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Apple is always a buy. It’s a buy at 150. It’s a buy at 200. It’s a buy at 500. Because it isn’t about the price. It’s about the fact that they are better than everyone else. If they’re no longer the best, then yeah sure take price into account."
03/24/2021,stocks,Be patient tech has more room to drop and I would wait until at least 115 .
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s consolidating sideways between 119 and 127 so not a time to invest but a time to trade those price levels.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah go for it. The world isnt short of morons who prefer products that dont allow a 3rd party to service it nor is there a shortage of Apple brand whores. This thing will only go up forever.
03/24/2021,stocks,No one here knows. It could definitely go that low or lower but I think the company will continue to succeed and over time would be a good investment so depends on your time horizon.
03/24/2021,stocks,Absolutely just keep in mind that this is money you’ll be waiting for a while before it produces any real growth. You’d be growing with the company. As an investor you’d have a vested interest in using and promoting their products as well.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I've got a feeling like apple will be sub 100. That's when I intend to sell a put or two. I'm not super interested in doing anything now. Just a feeling, no facts."
03/24/2021,stocks,What do you do with the other half if it doesnt dip?
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is great advice, thanks!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Long term? This bitch will be +$130 again in one week lmao
03/24/2021,stocks,Long way off still....

03/24/2021,stocks,Same lol
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes looking for long term and this feels like the one
03/24/2021,stocks,And i thought I am the only in here boomer enough to care about Valuation. If I didn't own Apple already I'd probably begin building a position if it drops back to about a 20 PE.
03/24/2021,stocks,maybe it’s because their products are far superior to the alternative. when there’s an obvious trend and you dismiss it as “everyone but me is a moron” youre going to end up with some pretty off base assessments
03/24/2021,stocks,Haha

03/24/2021,stocks,"Put it another stock, diversify. Spotify seems to be on a dip right now, lots of other good blue chippers you could put your money in, invest in things you believe in and stocks that aren't overvalued"
03/24/2021,stocks, Buy anyway. Unless you think it’s a good idea to sell the first half at that point or something else looks better
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm excited too. I've been releasing tension in the spring of my chair for a few months now to keep up with the chart.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Haha, yeah, I just went back in and did an edit to flag the importance of valuation. Will probably be ignored. Agree with the sub-20 PE. I think their PEG was floating around that level."
03/24/2021,stocks,🤫
03/24/2021,stocks,For the love of God DO NOT put it into Boeing.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I look at AAPL as a prime choice for an automatic recurring investment, so “buy half” seems like strange advice (but I guess everyone’s got their strategies)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think Apple is a very interesting stock in terms of valuation. Despite the 10-Year average PE being 15, I would probably be ok with paying a slightly higher multiple. But only if they can at least keep ROA(\~16%), ROIC(\~25%) and Earnings Growth(\~10%) at the same levels. Hopefully it will not get ignored, but I think the main problem with grasping stock valuation is that it doesn't matter in the short term. It only becomes a factor for longer term returns (>3-5 years)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Slightly higher I’d take as the PE 20ish range, right now it is closer to the PE 30ish range. I think this one will come back to earth eventually."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, especially since growth forecast for after 2021 don't support a 30 multiple.

03/24/2021,stocks,Vanguard is owned by the people who own Vanguard funds.
03/24/2021,stocks,They don’t own anywhere near every stock on the market. And they’re not corporations. They’re professional investment funds that manage billions of dollars. It’s their job to invest in well-performing stocks... and they virtually never take controlling positions.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Are you familiar with ETFs? Vanguard and Blackrock happen to run the two largest ETF families, not to mention their mutual funds."
03/24/2021,stocks,Because they got trillions of dollars
03/24/2021,stocks,"They have a lot of ETFs and funds that we can buy. To follow the index they buy the stocks in that index (with the right weight). So since a lot of people buy these etfs Blackrock and Vanguard keep buying all the companies to keep the indexes right. 
So yes they own them but no they can't decide to sell everything they have."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Any of the larget investment managers that have etf or mutual funds will have funds that own every stock. Some ETFs are ""total market index fund"" meaning shares in everything.

03/24/2021,stocks,Vanguard manages 6 trillion. And they have huge voting impact with their positions. They have policies that are somewhat hands-off how the business is run
03/24/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/24/2021,stocks,Can you elaborate?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I didn’t say Vanguard didn’t have influence. But, they, as an institution, never take controlling interests. If you can find a 13D they’ve filed recently, please forward. The fact is, Vanguard doesn’t acquire companies, they certainly don’t control the entire market, like OP was concerned about. They sit back and vote along with whatever the proxy advisory firms recommend."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The Vanguard Group, Inc. is an American registered investment advisor based in Malvern, Pennsylvania with about $6.2 trillion in global assets under management, as of January 31, 2020.[4] It is the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.[5] In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services. Several mutual funds managed by Vanguard are ranked at the top of the list of US mutual funds by assets under management.[6] Along with BlackRock and State Street, Vanguard is considered one of the Big Three index funds that dominate corporate America.[7]:2[8]:721

Hedge fund / mutual fund. Same difference"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I will give you a very brief explanation, there are many texts in modern portfolio theory that explain these topics very well. Basically there is this curve, that maps the volatilities of assets to their expected return. By increasing the weights of the stocks, you can lower the volatility of the portfolio while increasing the expected return. The tangency portfolio is an optimal portfolio where part of the capital is put into a non-risky asset and the rest in risky ones. So, following this theory (for which Sharpe and Markowitz later won the Nobel prize) it would be best to invest in a lot of stocks. For this reason it would make a lot of sense then to have Mutual Funds: they can do this with a lower cost than you would have as a singular investor (also the management of the stocks would require a lot of effort if done by singular investors)"
03/24/2021,stocks,I worked at vanguard for 10 years. Pretty familiar with them 😂

But OP certainly isn't and your reply was weird and off point (except for astutely correcting billions to trillions), especially for someone who says they worked there. You were implying that what I said in my original post was incorrect, and that's just wrong. What I said holds. Passive funds that generally stay lower than 15% ownership in any particular company don't control companies, let alone entire markets."
03/24/2021,stocks,I never said they control companies but they do have huge voting impact based upon their percent of ownership. They also dont just do what proxy advisory boards tell them. But what do I know 😂
03/24/2021,stocks,"Sweet. I've been a corporate finance attorney for 15 years, specializing among other things in shareholder activism. But, what do I know? 😂

I never said they didn't have a solid voting impact. They do. They're just not controlling companies the way OP was saying or you're implying. 10% passive ownership doesn't swing overall matters in the amount you're saying. Recently, they've become more engaged, but historically, they absolutely tended to vote in lockstep with ISS or Glass Lewis."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ive never once said they control companies. All ive said is they have large holdings and they vote. Not sure why you’re implying that means they’re controlling anything. They 100% have guidelines for how they vote. It’s generally not to interfere but they also do their due diligence and vote based upon that. Feel free to look up their policies on corporate governance and how they approach it. 

And for the official record they do not control companies nor am I implying it. I’m outright telling you they have large holdings and they vote to represent the individual investor, not to control but to represent their shareholders."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Then why did you even reply to my comment? I never said they didn't have voting power commensurate with their holdings, that they didn't do due diligence, or anything of the sort. This entire post was about OP thinking that Blackrock and Vanguard somehow control the markets, by virtue of the fact they own a significant amount of companies. They do not. You decided to jump in and state the obvious: that they have voting power. Awesome.

I don't need to read their corporate governance policies again. I'm fully aware of them... and have been, to the extent they were available, for more than a decade. I'm also fully aware of their voting record, which tracks advisory recommendations incredibly closely (like virtually all passive investors)."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it depends what your goal is: long term, or short term. Short term, you’ll probably want to set and calculate strike prices and average in. But if you’re doing long term, then I think the best time to buy was yesterday. I do mostly long term investing cause I’m also younger. I buy stocks that I think have a lot of growth over the next 8-10 years with solid foundations and essentially forget about them. I keep up with the news on those companies to make sure they aren’t fucking up, but I don’t check my portfolio daily. Ex, I (luckily) bought some Tesla in 2017, and just forgot about it. I checked back in on it in late 2019 to a great surprise. Right now I think we’re coming out of a market correction—not complete crash, so I think now is a wonderful time to buy and ride it out. But that’s just me"
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is when technical signals come in handy.  Look for targets like major support areas and moving averages because those can give you lower risk entry points.

I've contacted TDA and they said its a common issue with RH.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't have any personal experience with this, but I've seen a lot of people with this complaint and a lot of people saying you have to enter your cost basis manually (apparently RH doesn't provide it during a transfer like you would expect)"

Fidelity sent 2 requests which went unanswered so I messaged RH (be nice to their reps it’s not their fault RH is in this situation). Their contact us section is a labyrinth, I eventually hit some random option when choosing what kind of help I needed. A nice rep got back to me in 2 days, he told me they were running behind but that it would eventually transfer and the info finally transferred over after 2 more days.

This was for a full account transfer btw (the initial transfer only took 3 days)"

03/24/2021,stocks,Happened to me too. I live chatted with a rep who told me to send in a message via the Message Center and provide an excel sheet with all your cost basis info and they'll update it for you. Just sent it in recently so not sure on turnaround timing yet.

03/24/2021,stocks,Nothing yet. Hoping they eventually come over. If they still haven’t come over in a couple months I guess I’ll have to contact Schwab and/or Robinhood about it. Or go into robinhood and make note of my cost basis for everything
03/24/2021,stocks,"The rep also told me they received a notification from RH recently that RH is working on clearing this up on their end. So it may sort itself out eventually. I'm impatient though, so I still sent in my cost basis info to TD to have them manually update it."

03/24/2021,stocks,But $.01 wouldn’t be your true cost basis... if anything you would want your fake cost basis to be higher than the true cost basis so that on paper you have lower gains which would translate to lower taxable gains. Not suggesting anyone does something stupid like this though.

You pay $10/share, transfer it, make your cost basis .01, sell at $11. Fake gain = $10.99, 30% tax = $3.30

Total loss = $2.30

TuSimple is taking the traditional path to going public, a departure from the recent trend — particularly among electric and autonomous vehicle startups — to merge with a special purpose acquisition companies.

The number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed offering have not yet been determined, according to the regulatory filing. TuSimple intends to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “TSP.” Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters for the proposed offering.

According to the company’s S-1, which was filed Tuesday, TuSimple has primarily financed its operations through the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and loans from stockholders. The company’s principal sources of liquidity were $310.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, exclusive of restricted cash of $1.5 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks as well as certificates of deposit.

The S-1 shows that TuSimple had a loss from operations of $177.9 million in 2020, more than double loss of $84.8 million incurred in the previous year. The company said it had net losses from operations of $45 million in 2018. Its accumulated deficit was $405.2 million as of December 31, 2020.

Net loss attributable to common stockholders sat at $198.8 million in 2020, up from a loss of $145 million a year earlier.

The company’s revenue did rise to $1.8 million in 2020, up from $710,000 the previous year.

TuSimple, which was founded in 2015,  was one of the first autonomous trucking startups to emerge in what has become a small, yet bustling industry that now includes Aurora, Embark, Kodiak and Waymo. While TuSimple’s founding team and its earliest backers Sina and Composite Capital are from China, a chunk of its operations are in the United States, including its global headquarters in San Diego. TuSimple also operates an engineering center and truck depot in Tucson and more recently set up a facility in Texas to support its autonomous trips —always with a human safety operator behind the wheel. TuSimple also has operations in Beijing and Shanghai.

Despite its U.S. operations and U.S. partners, its shares are largely held by Chinese investors, the S-1 prospectus shows. The company’s principal stockholders of Class A shares are Sun Dream Inc with 20%, Composite Capital Master Fund with 7.28% and Navistar with 6%. Navistar is now owned by Volkswagen Group’s The Traton Group. TuSimple’s co-founders Mo Chen and Xiaodi Hou hold 9.1% and 8.5%, respectively in Class A shares. The two each hold 50% of the Class B shares.

The Sun Dream is ultimately controlled by Charles Chao, who is a board member, but perhaps best known as the chairman of Sina, which owns Weibo.

03/24/2021,stocks,"In the truck industry and haven't heard of these guys, but would definitely be very very wary.

Just looking at their total revenue for last year- your average truck dealership can make that kind of money off of one deal, selling to one fleet or municipality. Your average new semi can run between $100k and $250k USD, and electric vehicles cost even more. A few million dollars revenue is small in this industry. If that revenue was from truck orders, that could be just 6 or 7 trucks. That's microscopic in this industry.

With any commercial truck, an extremely important factor is the parts and service network. Manufacturers like freightliner and mack have parts and service networks with trained technicians in every city and town in the country. It doesn't matter where your truck breaks down, you can tow it 50 miles and get it fixed. With a brand new manufacturer, especially with custom technology, that gets wayyyy harder. The shops won't have trained techs, and won't have parts in stock to take care of you. Giants like Tesla face this hurdle, I have no idea how TuSimple will tackle it.

Additionally, important components like microchips are super limited right now. A self driving truck is going to have more electrical component and chip needs than most, and they won't have the buying power and supply chains of huge companies like Daimler, and Daimler is still having supply chain issues.

If TuSimple is just making software for existing trucks, great. If it's making its own trucks, I don't see how it can possibly compete in the US. Maybe in Europe where the market is much more segmented, but in the US it's a small handful of monoliths.

If you want to invest in automated trucking, invest in Daimler. They own freightliner and western star, controlling the lion's share of the US trucking industry, and they were automating trucking before even Tesla.

Edit: this is not investing advice; I am not an investment advisor."
03/24/2021,stocks,"is this a press release? 

based on Workhorse, Nikola, etc, I won't want anything to do with an EV truck IPO."
03/24/2021,stocks,"These guys look to just make the technology for trucks. There's a coalition now of autonomous trucking technology companies that they joined including the one you mentioned. I also posted about PLUS, who has a order of 10,000 autonomous units for 2022, last week. PLUS also went public this month. I'm just letting people know the options for self driving trucks is starting to become available because in a lot of other transportation related discussions people wanted to invest in them. 

https://www.tusimple.com/faq/"
03/24/2021,stocks,50 miles is 80.47 km
03/24/2021,stocks,Hmmm interesting hmmmm point. I’d still take my chances with arrival
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the link, and yeah it's definitely an interesting market to look at closely from an investment perspective. 

As for TuSimple, it helps a lot that they are developing tools and not entire trucks, but they have quite a ways to go before being market viable based on the FAQ. Question: are the trucks driverless? Answer: there is both a driver and a safety engineer...

If every truck using their systems requires two people in the cab, that makes operating the vehicle way more expensive, not less. Understandable for running trials, but nowhere near commercially viable for fleets. Is TuSimple providing those safety engineers? Training them? What do the fleet drivers think of having this new person essentially live them with them as they are on the road? Is there a timeline for advancing past that need for an engineer? 

Automated trucks probably still won't be driverless, more likely similar to airplanes- automated for most of the trip except departure and arrival. This will help close the gap between supply and demand for drivers in the industry, as less training is needed and the job becomes more appealing. If TuSimple is first to that point, great!"
2021-03-24 18:23:34,stocks,"Teradyne, $TER - Worth buying at $116 I bought $TER today at $116 this morning.

Teradyne ,$TER tests nearly 50% of all semiconductors worldwide.

The semi-conductor industry should grow well over the next three years, led by demand for 5G phones, Data Centers, AI and Auto. Besides, the current chip shortage has created pent up demand which should be fulfilled in 2021-2022.

$TER was particularly adept in managing COVID-19, and had an exceptional 2020, growing revenues 36% and Net Income 68%. $TER's strength is in managing complexity and this should enable it increase market share.

From their earnings call. ""Another complexity driver is 5G. And these high tier phones are early adopters of the extra silicon needed to enable these features. Less than 250 million phones are expected to be 5G-enabled in 2020 and only a fraction of those will support millimeter wave communication. **So despite the bump in 2020, we are still in the very early stages of 5G adoption.""**

$TER has a robotics division, which is much smaller but was growing much faster than the company, before COVID ground everything to a standstill. I believe robotics will lead growth in the years ahead.

CEO Jagiela has an optimistic outlook for the unit saying, ""Among other things, AutoGuide adoption by key logistics, e-commerce, retail, and automotive customers in 2021 will set the stage for multiple years of double-digit growth.""

**Investment -** Longer term, I plan to hold onto my shares in the retirement account. $TER grew revenues at an average of 9% and income about 11% in the last 10 years, but going forward, I expect more growth to kick in from robotics and expect revenues to grow about 11% and Earnings about 14%. $TER should earn about $7.50 in 2023. At a PE of 24 that’s $180 , returning 16% per year.

**Trading** \- There is a trading opportunity here. After peaking at 148 in February, $TER dropped a whopping 45 points before finding support at 103, around its 200DMA (March 8th). Since then, it’s been steadily moving upwards with supports at 107-108, and 111-112. I think the tech carnage is finding a floor and there will be genuine support, for what I believe is now an oversold stock. I am going to trade this to 130-132, where it met resistance in the last up move."

2021-03-24 18:22:29,stocks,"According to you, what is a sign that you should sell a stock that you were previously confident in?  

I'm making this post because of a recent investment I made. I was incredibly confident that a stock was going to bounce back after the latest correction, but after I looked into the situation thoroughly I decided that it was safer to park my money elsewhere. (I bought established companies like ASML and Nintendo)

As someone who's relatively new to investing I feel like I should have a better sense for when things will go down south. 

In hindsight I should have known that a lot of growth stocks are fragile, but that is not always clear in the first place. I don't feel bad after taking the loss of only 15%, as I've seen worse on subs like WSB.

So as the title says, what is a sign that you should sell a stock that you were previously confident in?"

03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm not good at deciding when to sell if something goes down.   I try to buy things that have a margin of safety,  and are already value stocks so if it goes down more than 5% i was likely wrong and should sell.  Although there are exceptions,  like a sudden crash due to a plague,  then i just buy more every payday."
03/24/2021,stocks,When you lose confidence in it
03/24/2021,stocks,"I feel like that's probably a very good sign indeed. That's the reason I sold the stock I was holding onto. I was denying the bearish signs and tried to put myself in an echo chamber. It's hard to admit that you're wrong but it's even harder to lose more money if you don't admit that you are. It's possible that the stock comes back, but if other stocks could give you stronger returns overall, you should buy those stocks."
03/24/2021,stocks,There’s always a reason for a move like that. If you don’t know about it you shouldn’t be investing in it.

technical analysis is about analyzing the movement of a stock's price on a chart. most professional investors don't use technical analysis as a major part of their strategy. there's simply not a lot of data showing it's a reliable way to gather good info about a stock. 

fundamental analysis is about analyzing the financial status of the company. you might know but EPS is 'earnings per share' -- how much profit or loss the company has per share of stock. fundamental analysis is far more important to professional investors.

Excerpt:

> A gap or spread has opened up between the price of Volkswagen AG’s ordinary shares (VOW), now at €299—equivalent to around $354—and its preference shares (VOW3), at €225. The latter aren’t conventional, debtlike preference shares; they are identical to the ordinary shares except that they don’t carry voting rights. In the U.S., there would be two different share classes.

> Infamously, the spread last ballooned in 2008, when Porsche SE tried to take over VW. That saga, by way of a short squeeze that briefly made VW the world’s most valuable company, ended with VW taking over Porsche’s car-making operation, Porsche AG, leaving behind an investment company, Porsche SE (PAH3), with roughly 53% of VW’s ordinary shares and lots of lawsuits. Since that drama, VW’s ordinary and preference shares have rarely traded out of line.

> Porsche SE isn’t a suspect this time round. The company says its stake in VW hasn’t changed in recent weeks, and it is hard to see why it would risk more legal challenges.

> Instead, brokers are pointing the finger at inexperienced U.S. investors. They appear to be buying VW ordinary shares without realizing the confusingly named preference shares offer the same for less. Trading volumes of American depositary receipts that track VW’s ordinary shares (VWAGY) have surged, as have Google search volumes for the VWAGY ticker.

Don't forget POAHY, the ADR ticker that tracks PAH3."
03/24/2021,stocks,So what is the ticker for VW preference shares if I shouldn’t invest in VWAGY? In America btw
03/24/2021,stocks,"Porsche Holdings SE own 37% of the shares and control 53% of the voting rights. Between them and the state of saxony, they have majority control. I believe the other biggest holder is the labour union."
03/24/2021,stocks,"i think it is VWAPY. 

> The crazy thing about U.S. investors’ interest in the ordinary shares is that ADRs tracking the cheaper, more liquid preference shares (VWAPY) also exist. There may be good reasons to hold Volkswagen, but there aren’t good reasons to hold its ordinary shares or the associated ADRs."
03/24/2021,stocks,"but it doesn't really explain *why* it's better to hold one over the other. I assume because it's a lower cost for the same dividend??

VWAGY has seen much bigger moves than VWAPY lately though...

Is there something I'm missing?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"So, I am no expert, but here is what I understood. In ideal scenario, these 2 shares should be at similar prices (with minor differences). This is because both of them represent the same thing - as they track the performance of same company (assuming everyone buys stock 100% based on a company's fundamentals ) - the only difference being voting rights. Look at the first graph in the article and see how similar the two prices are historically.

That said, the prices can differ occasionally:-

* in 2008 when Porsche tried  to buy the ""voting shares"" as they wanted to  ""tried to take over VW""
*  This time the main reason for the difference appears to be as per the article - ""inexperienced U.S. investors. They appear to be buying VW ordinary shares without realizing the confusingly named preference shares offer the same for less""

So, summarizing the article: while both stock prices will increase, eventually gap between the prices will decrease ( based on the fact that same company, same fundamentals), you are better off buying VWAPY as it is cheaper and will increase more.

(Correct me if I am mistaken)"

If you'd think that time in the market ALWAYS beats timing, you should've invested into VW on 01/10/2008 @61 and 13 years later you would be on 2021 still red @33.62 ...

Yikes, they're my go-to when pointing out media cooperation with large corporations and how media can claim to be unbiased while pushing material to intentionally shift the market. A fine example is how Bill Ackman personally tanked the stocks of dozens of hotels that he was shorting claiming they may fall to ""0"" because of the pandemic. After he collected his short position money he proceeded to buy the stocks he tanked through panic selling and turn almost $1Bn in profit - with CNBC's direct help....

But what I'm trying to say is that a trend-optimized time in the market beats time in the market. For example, my 2020 portfolio was focused on tech (with some diversification), so I was like 300% up just in 2020. Now in 2021 my portfolio is mostly focused into energy. So I'm like 30% up YTD.

Oh, it's to stop them from driving it down to near 0 to create a bankrupt company? What happens when longs run out of money or get tired of fighting infinite money? Oh, and SSR doesn't apply in premarket and after hours. The game is rigged. What I've noticed in many cases shorters would not trigger the SSR. They would get right up to the 10% limit and then back off. This allows them to drop the stock nearly 10% each day. This causes major problems with calls. All it does is slow them down, it does not stop them, since they have infinite money(when they short they get the money immediately which covers any interest if they end up having to hold out, but they can just keep shorting more and more). That market is broken. Buyers cannot flood the stock with buy orders because they end up jacking up the price on themselves, but shorters can flood the stock with sells. That asymmetry has destroy many good companies and fleeced humanity by the trillions. 

&#x200B;

When they drop the stock by near 10% artificially it means the longs have to not only recover that(and pay for it) but then work to gain momentum. There is a net bias towards winning by shorting. Hence the game is rigged."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The game is rigged. 

What was it about borrowing someone's shares without them knowing, selling the shares a few at a time to ever-lower bids to drive the price down and buying them back when the stop-losses are tripped, made you think it might not be rigged?

03/24/2021,stocks,"Shorts justify their existence by saying it's a natural counterpoint to buying shares and pushing the price up.  It's false.  The counterpoint to buying shares is selling them, and everyone else who simply doesn't buy.

2021-03-24 17:47:41,stocks,"What stocks should I buy with my Stimulus check? Twenty year old wanting to grow value Hey y'all, 

I'm currently a twenty year old who's been in the stock market for almost a year now. I just got my stimulus check today and already put half of the $1,400 into savings. I want to put the rest into stocks, and I've been looking at a few. Those few I've been looking at are $WMT, $MA, $SQ, and $LMT. 

I hate shopping at Walmart, but if there is someone to fight Amazon at the moment, it's them. Mastercard is just a money printing machine, I don't see them going away or being hurt at all anytime soon. Square is someone I seen used all the time, Cash app is huge, and I think they got so much potential. When I used to be Computer Science major I wanted to work for Lockheed Martin, they're a great defense play and a strong company in my opinion.

My main goal is to find, good safe companies that will hold value while going up in the long-term, I don't plan on selling anytime in the next five years. If you have any more recommendations, please let me know, but I don't want very risky recommendations where I'll probably loss all my money like certain stocks like $G$M$E or $A$M$C.

03/24/2021,stocks,Why not increase your positions in the stocks you have & make sure choose dividend reinvestment
03/24/2021,stocks,"IMO you should buy a fund/ETF with broad exposure to the market. increase that VTI percentage, for example. VTI is a total market index ... it has every stock listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq. 

single stocks can be OK as part of your investment portfolio. but single stocks are also much more risky and volatile, they go WAY up and WAY down in price. a low-fee fund/ETF with hundreds or thousands of stocks is a lot safer and more stable, it smooths out all the big price swings."
03/24/2021,stocks,Honestly if your going to own a bunch of stocks you might as well use m1 finance. In my opinion you should invest in only a few stocks and study alot to find out which ones they should be. I remember Warren buffet asking if you were only able to buy 10 stocks in your whole life which ones will they be. I take that to heart and don't buy shares of stocks that are already established but the ones that have a lot of room to grow. I recommend you look into what senseonics and nanodimension have going on and tale that as a example of what you should invest in. Those 2 are the ones i really like and plan on investing in them and holding for around 5 years or longer

2021-03-24 17:46:55,stocks,"Capital Gains, Deductions and Exit Strategies Which would be the better exit strategy:

Quickly close out positions for a small profit (5-15%) with a stop limit set right at or right above my buy in price so that no money is actually lost. (buying in at the start of an ascent after looking at charts) 

OR

Set a stop loss right below my buy in price so that if I do lose money it is a very small fraction of my investment. I could then add those losses to my deductions for the next year. As you can write off up to $3k in stock losses, it would seem like a decent approach to take provided you haven't yet lost $3K. 

In the end I would also rather come away with a profit even if it's a small one that would result in short capital gains tax of about 15% of that gain. Afterall, I could always buy back in with a profit whereas if I take a loss and want to buy back in soon after I would encounter a wash sale on my account. However, I am still very new to the stock market, so maybe both of these options are the wrong way to go about things. Thoughts?"

Because I'm still up overall for the year at $7K, there would be nothing to deduct for next year, correct?  You only begin to deduct the loss after you have $0 capital gains...? So, had my one and only trade this year been at a loss for $3K, that could be counted as a realized capital loss for taxes in 2022 assuming no other trades occur? 

Assuming that's correct, but just looking for confirmation."

2021-03-24 17:24:14,stocks,"DigitalOcean Goes Public Today ($DOCN) Cloud Computing Looks like they go public today at $5B valuation.  Price is starting at $47.  It's a cloud computing company that is trying to appeal to newer developers (I haven't personally used the product but I've heard this from developers).    


If anyone has read their S-1 filing in detail (I just skimmed it) or can share any competitive advantages you think the stock has, comment down below.  I'm not gonna buy in on IPO day, would rather wait for  1st earnings report or 2nd earnings report."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I can only chip in from the perspective of a small business/IT startup. DigitalOcean was my first choice for prototyping our platform, the pricing is very attractive and the management interface very user friendly.

We then chose to employ a managed relational database; mainly due to the more inexpensive pricing of Amazon RDS compared to DO's managed DB offering, we've rolled out our production at AWS. AWS has a vast amount of features but the user interface is a real pain in the beginning.

As other already said the cloud space is very competitive. DO has a good offer that is painless to set up first, the company makes a good overall appearance as a friendly business partner, compared to behemoth/incumbent AWS, and the pricing is attractive.

Something else to consider: we've applied for the Amazon founder's program, where they give startups free credit (depending on the tier, either a lot of credits for 12 months or a smaller amount for 24 months). So for the first year AWS hasn't cost us a penny. I guess this is also a disadvantage of DO, as AWS locks in new companies this way.

Still we are using DO for internal development, as we don't want to rely on just one cloud, and if there is any catastrophic event on the side of AWS we'd be prepared to switch production to DO instantly.

From an investor's perspective I'd have a hard time judging the valuation of DO. Probably revenue and earnings growth over the last years are something to look at. DO has been around for a while, but if it's a big growth case and the $ 5B valuation is reasonable, I don't know."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Really competitive space, I don't think any actual big company would build their shit on DigitalOcean. More focused towards small/medium Internet startups and indie developers. They don't have any real advantadge, I personally prefer Vultr. If I had to bet I'd say it won't dominate cloud computing in the future, but it has a niche (as I mentioned) and it could do well in that niche. Will probably grow as much as Cloud Computing does"
03/24/2021,stocks,"We did a huge evaluation of cloud providers for vms, and they were the cheapest and best, but we still went with AWS EC2 to reduce risk.  Azure was the worst since they were the slowest and most expensive, plus they lost almost a dozen vm disks.  Their support Mindtree didn't have enough access to tell what happened.  If you're going to hire a third party to do support, they need enough access to tell what is the problem."
03/24/2021,stocks,"From someone who actually works at one of the big cloud providers, DO has their shit together. I would absolutely use them for larger workloads."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Using their competitors have left a bad taste in my mouth

Rented a $8/month 1GB RAM box from VULTR in 2015, hooked it up to paypal to autodeposit amount owing, rounded up to the nearest $5 ($15 or $20 every other month); then one day they decided to change their policies to auto deposit [*$275* to cover a *$5.94* balance](https://i.imgur.com/e2V9vaY.png). There were no announcements emailed ahead of time about a change in the amount they plan to autodeposit to cover balances. In between me asking their support to unlink all my payment methods, a server spun up out of the blue and incurred another $1.33; I wrote in to report this to their support, no response was given for what triggered that server to get spun up, no apology was given for changing the auto deposit from ""covering amount owing to the nearest $5"" to ""covering the amount you would incur for the next 3 years""

Separately with CloudatCost, I bought some lifetime boxes that they then started to charge maintenance fees for. Figures, but still felt a bit burned  

DO isn't the cheapest option in cloud VPS, but they do seem to be the cheapest provider that has their shit together"
03/24/2021,stocks,I remember reading that they are trying to appeal to small businesses because all the large companies are on AWS or Azure.  Basically counting on small businesses with teams who are not very technical.
03/24/2021,stocks,Why wouldn't an actual big company use DigitalOcean?  What does Vultr do better?
03/24/2021,stocks,I don't understand why DO is perceived of as being not worthy of larger companies workloads.  I'm a solo dev and DO has been really good for me.  I don't have good insight into large corporate reasoning.  But I figure it must be faith/trust in brand recognition from CEO's.  Are there technical benefits that make vendor lock worth it?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I never said they didn't have their shit together. I said I find it hard for them to outgrow the industry, which is the only reason why you'd jump in this IPO"
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah that's basically it. Problem with that niche is that there are soooo many competitors and the only way to stand out is Pricing/Marketing/Customer Support and DigitalOcean don't excel in neither
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because hiring an actual sysadmin would be cheaper, more secure and overall give them more control over their network.

In my experience with both, Vultr is less prone to error, launching a server with Vultr is really easy, their guides are updated and the pricing is relatively the same. Plus they have more datacenters if I remember correctly"
03/24/2021,stocks,"""It's not enterprise"" but really DO isn't any worse for most workloads. If you need very specific certifications like fedramp then maybe not, at least not yet, but compliance also doesn't inherently make a given provider more secure. I run my personal server on DO, I would run critical infra on it no problems. It's cheap, but more importantly, it's simple. They just don't have a huge menu like Amazon does, but if you watch any of the kitchen nightmares types shows, you know that a big menu != quality. Added complexity (especially from a vender) is inherently a business risk.

But while I don't know about stock price, I do see DO growing quite a bit over 10 years."

What is your time horizon? In the long run, the currency impact may be negligible due to reversion to the mean.

Isn't there an ETF on US stocks in GBP that is currency hedged? Check the sites of SPDR, iShares, Vanguard etc."

Now obviously the market is up since then and I’ve been doing pretty decent but everything is at higher numbers than it was 2 months ago.

Should I remain patient and use limit buys or be ok with averaging up as I might not see those prices again for a while? I have cash on the sidelines because I don’t know what to get. do I trust the ones I feel the best about? Or do I just look at an index based etf to activate that cash while I make Up my mind?"

03/24/2021,stocks,"I up voted him, it was a valuable comment and a common idea, I have a different investment philosophy.   The first stock i ever bought was 10 shares of PFE for $16.30 in 2009, and I still own it.   Yes, some things have done better than 110% gain +5%/year dividends,  but a whole lot of things have done a lot worse.   I've held VOD and VZ for over 10 years, I've held AFL for eight years and more than doubled my initial cost (but I've added more over the years).  Anyway, I believe in holding good stocks for a long time,  unless I'm wrong and they go down for a reason. 

Why jump out after 30% gain instead of holding onto good investments?"

03/24/2021,stocks,"Please forgive me then, I didn't pick up on that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I guess if everything you buy is a winner and you don't have any other option,  or if you want to go double size or more on a sure thing,  then yeah, do it.  I've been there,  sold MRK at the beginning of the year to buy XOM and I'm just now buying back the MRK shares.   

The comment I was responding to made it sound like a general rule to sell after a small gain and buy something else.   As a generalization,  things going up keep going up for quite a while (good business,  good management,  etc) and things going down keep going down until it's so obviously undervalued and everyone that can sell has.

Small fluctuations and broad market movements don't count,  i wouldn't sell my AFL just because the entire market nosedive due to a...oh, I don't know,  something."
03/24/2021,stocks,"No reason to apologize, I'm sorry if I came off aggressively. My annoyance wasn't with you, but with the downvotes he'd gotten at the time in general."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-intel-gamestop-viacomcbs-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to bounce after Tuesday’s broad sell-off

> * U.S. stock futures bounced Wednesday, especially Nasdaq futures, one day after a broad sell-off sent Wall Street lower. Investors grew concerned about Covid reopening plans as cases ticked higher in many U.S. states despite vaccinations. Germany and France are among the European nations tightening restrictions again as a new wave of infections sweeps a continent that’s seen a sluggish vaccine rollout. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield on Wednesday continued to back off last week’s 14-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 on Tuesday each lost nearly 1%, while the Nasdaq lost more than 1%.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell set for Day 2 of economic testimony

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell are set to deliver a second day of economic testimony to lawmakers as required quarterly by the March 2020 Covid relief act. They will appear remotely before the Senate Banking Committee at 10 a.m. ET. On Tuesday, they told the House Financial Services Committee that elevated asset valuations in pockets of the markets are not reasons for alarm yet. Yellen and Powell also said they’re confident in the stability of the financial sector as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

*****

> # 3. GameStop sinks after acknowledgement of possible share sale

> * GameStop shares fell 12% in Wednesday’s premarket after the company acknowledged in a filing that it’s considering selling additional equity shares. The stock soared more than 2,400% in January’s Reddit-fueled trading frenzy before crashing. It mounted a comeback in late February and earlier this month on hopes for a digital transformation. However, shares in recent days moved lower. After the closing bell Tuesday, GameStop missed on the top and bottom lines with quarterly results. But it did see e-commerce sales jump 175% for the quarter. The company also named former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

*****

> # 4. Intel to build new chip plants; Amazon names new cloud chief

> * Dow stock Intel rose about 4% in premarket trading after the company said late Tuesday it will spend $20 billion to build two new semiconductor factories in Arizona. The announcement, coinciding with new CEO Pat Gelsinger’s first public remarks since taking over the job, signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing during industry shifts that have led competitors to increasingly separate chip design and chip fabrication.

> * Incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, head of the company’s cloud business for the past 15 years, revealed his Amazon Web Services successor in a memo to employees. Adam Selipsky, a former Amazon executive and currently CEO of Salesforce-owned data-visualization software maker Tableau, was chosen to run the AWS division.

*****

> # 5. Elon Musk says people can now buy a Tesla with b/itcoin

> * Elon Musk announced late Tuesday that it’s now possible to buy Tesla vehicles in the U.S. with b/itcoin. “You can now buy a Tesla with B/itcoin,” tweeted CEO Musk, who was also officially made the “Technoking of Tesla” this month. People outside the U.S. will be able to buy a Tesla with b/itcoin “later this year,” Musk said, without specifying which countries. The electric auto maker in February revealed it bought $1.5 billion worth of b/itcoin. At the time, Tesla said it would soon start accepting the world’s biggest and most popular c/ryptocurrency as a form of payment.

03/24/2021,stocks,Haha. Thanks a TON for this /u/JRshoe1997! Really greatly appreciate you big time! :)
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thank you so much for saying that /u/trogdors_arm! I reeeeally do appreciate this much! :)

Funny you should mention that subreddit idea to house all of my posts. I do actually have that, as recent as just the other month in fact. As I know this was an idea that was suggested to me by a few people in the past as well. I would love to share this subreddit with you guys too, but admittedly I have been a bit reluctant to share that publicly in here, in fear that it may be deemed as ""spam"" by the staff team or something. I just really do not want to be banned from this great community here that I have been apart of for so long now.

I'm not sure if you guys are able to find my subreddit simply by clicking in on my username profile here on Reddit? I won't directly link that up in this thread, but if you're having trouble finding, I'll just go as far as saying that my subreddit is called **StockMarketChat** but won't link it directly in here.

Thank for that idea though, and for your awesome words there!

I think the reason why my posts may not largely get the upvotes, or thanks as you say, is because my content is admittedly not ""original content"" if you will. But rather, mostly just a cut 'n paste of news articles that I find, and compile that into one thread on Reddit.

Thus, I think most people might think that my posts are just simply some automated thing from a ""bot"" posting it in here every morning, and not an actual real human doing that, which admittedly could not be further from the truth! lol.

Truth be told here, but I do actually create these posts literally by hand every morning! I only just don't write it all myself. But, the actual formatting of these posts, and getting all the new content for each day is indeed done manually by hand here.

If only I knew of a way to automate some of this stuff every morning would have admittedly been pretty amazing and much less time consuming for me lol.

Still, I do enjoy creating these morning market movers and news threads in here each day.

Thank YOU again for your awesome words here!! Really means a lot to me. :)"

I have typically made wise investment decisions since getting into the game March of last year (great time to hop in that's for sure). Although I jumped into the NIO train with insufficient research back in mid-February and have averaged -27% as of today.

I know the golden rule is to ""buy low, sell high""....but is NIO just a dying fish that I should dump at this point or do you guys actually think it is worth holding onto other than for the sake of ""holding to the moon""?

I watch the news and see the potential behind it, but I've never had a stock stay so low and keep dipping lower, and unfortunately this one has a bit of my money in it currently.

Thoughts?"

I have shares in a long term account I got in under $20 and questioning if I should sell now and take the 2x or should I wait and get 3x  I could of got at the highs when NIO was at $60 or maybe even 4-6x in the future.

Also have alot of shares I'm holding that are in the negative in another account I use for day/swing trades.

tough situation as many NIO holders are in the red and they will unload when stock price reaches the levels of $50+,  It will take some time for the stock to recover.  It will need two recovery, one from this bullshit market correction we are in that IMO is caused by the big money fucking around taking profit on stocks they aquired on the cheap and now shifting away and trying to fuck around some more with this short lived recovery stocks play that is already loosing alot of steam.  They will go back into growth and tech and try to repeat this cycle.  As a retail trader we all are just trying to play catchup on where the big money is moving.   Second is a short recovery from all the NIO holders that are bagholding and already set limit sell orders at their break even.   All this is based on if and when NIO will get back to recovery.

Hate to spread FUD but Euro brands that are popular amongst the wealthier Chinese population are releasing EV models.   There are many more bear cases for NIO and I cannot just be a raging bull that goes one way up, but I don't have alot of time to write either. 

Is it me ore has there been zero to no PR from NIO.  Last was the NIO & Sinopec meeting on Chinese new year and haven't had any follow up to what they plan to do together"
03/24/2021,stocks,"China’s government knows they have pollution and smog problems and are trying to remedy that situation, and one sure way is to move further into EV and are backing both the manufacturing and consumer in moving towards a larger % of EV’s in use. If NIO goes down, it’s because it’s following the market as a whole. I’m keeping NIO for at least 3 years and maybe even 5 years"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't know NIO too well, but I think the products are very impressive and the growth is also encouraging. I would rather ask myself whether I want to invest in a Chinese company. In principle, the party stands behind its companies and creates unfair competitive conditions for them, but in the recent past it looked a bit different. The cancelled IPO of ant group, the disappearance of Jack Ma. It all reminded me of the story of Icarus, who came too close to the sun. It seems to me that the height of the sun is set by the CCP. I could not sleep well if I am unsure of how the CCP is thinking about my company right now. Besides, the stock market in China has something of a casino. The incredible growth of China is hardly reflected in the long term performance of the indices."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It seems to be in much the same boat as other EV stocks. I do think China has a bigger existing EV market and the government is willing to put a lot of political will behind widespread adoption. Just in my consumer opinion I like their lifestyle focus, and think it would be very appealing outside of China."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I feel this is a long term play with huge growth potential. I got in pretty high also but been buying the dips to lower my cost per share. (yes I know, there's a lot of dips) But i feel in a few years time I'll be sitting back and smiling at this stock.  It's a hold for me."

03/24/2021,stocks,If you noticed the option activity on alot of ev and tech stocks weighed heavily towards calls. Its pretty obvious that the sectors are being manipulated to siphon wealth from stimulus investors. If you want to play it safe only do 1+month calls. Its just a hunch but im fairly certain after friday itll bounce...climb until wed or thur and then repeat the same. Just watch the sell charts. Blatant mm sells intended to drive prices down. Its quite disgusting the level of manipulation we have been witnessing here lately and nothing ever hets done about it.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Long on NIO. Average share is 400 shares at 55 and I will load up more if it goes below 35. Although some hype trains forecast it as the next Tesla I think a target of high 60s this year is realistic and as swap out stations get better defined it can go even higher. 

The biggest risk in my mind is China partial ownership into the stock from previous bailouts and with the political atmosphere there is a general risk of owning Chinese based companies."
03/24/2021,stocks,I really don't like their battery swapping instead of charging the battery. I am not sure how the Chinese market will react to it.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Nio has a few ventures. Building an industrial city in Heifei, and moving to start selling in Europe (probably would lose out to VW but their infrastructure of battery swapping makes it so much better in urban areas where charging might be difficult), but they're definitely expanding."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Just keep holding NIO. It's a popular stock among amateur investors which causes greater volatility, especially in market-wide downs like this. But it's not really indicative of much in the long run.

My only worries for NIO stock come in 1-3 years seeing how battery charging has improved and their niche of battswapping is challenged. But that's about it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Until the past two weeks, I thought that Nio, Li Auto, and Xpeng would blossom in China.

03/24/2021,stocks,">Well China is gonna exempt the purchase tax on new energy vehicles (NEVs) for this year and 2022. So i strongly believe that it will “go to the moon” sooner than we’ll expect...

Yeah, I know everyone hates on China but they do some things well. While I can't say I know their motivation behind it, I'm hoping they just want to be a leader in cleaner air.. that would  be a nice change amongst the populated cities of Asia.

&#x200B;

I'm a big fan of NIO's program to swap batteries at stations, making the idea of ""sitting and charging my car for a few hours"" while on a trip obsolete. I don't mind a car that charges overnight, but doing a quick swap which is about the same time as pumping a full tank of gas sounds really enticing. NIO definitely has a lot of promise for consumers, and the CEO seems pretty level headed. I'm long on NIO, and even if I'm down 15%, I'm buying more and more casually with each red day."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Question is whether VW and Tesla will eat their lunch. Both companies have huge moves in China and the CEOs are double down on the country despite Western tensions. Elon Musk has probably declared his love for China more times than his love for bit coin, and Germany’s China focus is one of the reasons the EU refuses to join the US on containing China.

China usually favors local companies especially over those that they deem US aligned, but in these cases they might make an exception because they need the EU to counter balance the US and Elon Musk is very careful never to criticize China. This would be bad for Chinese electric car makers and the market is pricing this in."
03/24/2021,stocks,Plus if you watch their last event it's very impressive.  Easily Tesla caliber and in a few respects even better.  They are not vaporware.  And China fucking get's EV's.

U.S. companies are less likely to see stock prices decline because of government regulation, but also aren’t as locked in as some companies are in China propped up by the government. 

In China, you can see declines due to tight regulatory crackdown, but if a company avoids that it’s pretty stable due to having such strong support from the government.

For example, you confirmed your belief in a stock last March by looking at these ratings and voila the stock did indeed reach the average/high price.

2021-03-24 16:20:45,stocks,"ZWB and ZWK (good safe roation) Hello everyone,  


Today I wanted to talk about my plans of rotating my portfolio when I am 15 years to retirement. ZWB is an etf of only the 6 biggest Canadian banks that sell covered calls on them. They give you back the premium as dividen. It is a pricy etf at 0.71 basis points. but with 6.17 dividen you get 5.46% actual dividen annually. I like the idea of not having to do the covered calls myself and its already deversified so its a bit safer than just doing it with one stock.  


ZWK is the same thing but with american banks. Dividens are about 1% higher (around 6.46%). However, american banks are usually a bit more volatile (which is probably why they get a nicer a premium).  


What do you guys think about having my portfolio around 30% of zwb and 10% of zwk when I turn 50?  
and  
40 % zwb and 20% zwk when im 65.  
What are does your retirement portfolio look like? I would love to hear other ideas"

2021-03-24 16:13:01,stocks,"Wouldn't selling cars in exchange for bitcoin be a quick way to skip tax implications of the sale? I'm not really familiar with taxing on sales in the US as I live abroad, but in my country, a Value add tax is put with the price of any goods bought. If you sell a car for bitcoin, and then hold that bitcoin for a year, wouldn't that allow you to basically skip any taxes that would be taken from the sale of a car and instead take the long-term gains tax, or would short-terms gain tax be even less than what they lose when selling a car? If so, this could prove very lucrative for Tesla in the future, provided Bitcoin stagnates or continues to grow"
03/24/2021,stocks,I think you are confusing sales tax with value added tax. Each state in the US has a different sales tax on goods.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tesla is still required to collect the sales tax at point-of-sale. In my state to register a car, you have to show proof of sale, including amount of taxes paid."

03/24/2021,stocks,"""will at the very least give you like 10% yearly returns in your investments"" - This is false. The market for the last decade isn't representative of the market's future. After inflation and trading fees, a return of 5-7% is more realistic."

Investing > Savings account. Assuming you don touch it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Your basic premise that index funds are a good long-term investment is an accurate one. Obviously, you now know that expecting QQQ to give you an 80% return every year is unrealistic. 

That said, funds like QQQ, VOO, VGT, VOOG, VTI, IWM, etc., make good, safe long term investments. They will give you a better return most of the time than putting your money into a bank savings account and they are unlikely to have the volatility of a portfolio of individual stocks. 

In my opinion, someone who does research and pays a lot of attention to the market can beat most index funds with individual stock picks, but it's certainly more risky and it takes a lot of time and effort to manage your portfolio that way.  If you want to put money into the market and not worry about it, an index fund (or a group of ETFs) is the way to go.

What you might want to consider is a couple of funds:  One broad market fund like VOO to put about half of your portfolio into, then a couple of sector funds that you think might outperform the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ.  You could consider the following approach:

40% of your investment in QQQM - NASDAQ 100 Index fund

40% of your investment in VOO - S&P 500 Index Fund

10% of your investment in ARKW - Managed growth fund investing in ""disruptive technologies""

03/24/2021,stocks,I did the same after understanding why its 76% up
03/24/2021,stocks,"He's saying the NASDAQ 76% return is because you are measuring it from the drop dead bottom of a market crash to one of the most bullish recoveries in history. Most years you are looking at 10% in the last decade, so the last year is a bad metric for comparison."
03/24/2021,stocks,"An indexed ETF can't be ""cheap."" It trades for the value of the underlying stocks it represents. That said, It's a solid ETF and should do fine.  I doubt it will significantly outperform VOO because most of the companies at the top of the list in the portfolio are large companies and are part of the VOO, so there would be a lot of crossover. But it might slightly outperform VOO."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I believe going into the tech heavy NASDAQ is risky af rn. 11 times the nasdaq100 as gone up 40% two years in the row and 10 times it was negative the next year, I believe this bull run is over"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I see your point, thank you. I like healthcare since it doesn’t seem as flooded with attention as say the tech sector. Which is why I thought the pricing may be more fair compared to say technology sector."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can't really think of it this way. What you have to decide is which sector is likely to outperform the market and other sectors.  Or, perhaps your goal is reduced volatility; then you ask what sector protects your money the best.  I think the health care sector is an under-appreciated sector.  I have a little money in a Health Care ETF, myself.  

I think VHT will provide a decent return. In fact, since you asked, I studied this a little more and found that VHT does, in fact, outperform VOO most years, however it does not typically outperform the NASDAQ.  That may change this year, as the NASDAQ is likely to underperform a bit.  Also, VHT does pay a 1.2% dividend yield, which is more than most ETFs.

So, bottom line, it looks to me like VHT would be a good place to park your money if you are looking for a sector ETF that is likely to outperform the S&P 500. Looking forward, I wouldn't be surprised if you are right and if the Health Care sector as a whole does a little better than they have in the past, and it may well perform nearly as well as the tech sector or maybe even better, while providing less volatility."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is music to my ears :)) I am quite the novice in investing and I tried my best to find a good fit for myself. Indeed low volatility good returns with a decent amount of dividends are exactly what I am looking for. I really appreciate your insight, thank you"

They need a lot of irons in the fire and for a few of them to be favorable to get out of that hole.  Doesn't help that this morning JP Morgan cut the rating.

My understanding is that to be successful you would buy a bunch of differentstocks (like 100), expect 98 to fail and make 30x to 100x on the ones that don't.

03/24/2021,stocks,"It's my understanding that these companies are working on multitudes of applications.  That's why when a single drug shows favorable results that fact moves the stock.  If it's a common problem, it's possible this new drug moves to the best practice and gets prescribed as soon as it's produced.  Take the Alzheimer drug announcement recently moved the drug maker's stock price.  MRNA for example is using their technology to cure or mitigate many ailments.  Here's a list of their pipeline.  Then along came Covid and they dropped everything to take their 10 years of lab work (with $0 revenue) and apply it to this virus.  They came up with a solution remarkably quickly and now they have revenue.  If a booster is involved which I think is part of the game plan, that is a revenue stream for them.  They extrapoluate what that revenue can be.  The stock moves to that pricing based on that and then adjusts based on actaul sales.  [https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline)

Simply put, they have many irons in the fire and need 1 favorable result to cover other failures.  Take a company like Pfizer.  Their stock price barely moves on vaccine news because they have so many drugs being prescribed as it is.  BioNtech though does move because Covid is a larger % of their revenue than it is for Pfizer.

The holding you've mentioned is working on a depression drug.  It looks like the stock was downgraded in Dec.  Then it was hit with some more anaylist downgrades in Jan & Feb.  That might move the stock down if it had a run up.  And based on new info did the price shoot up and resulting in an overweight position.  Some of these things need to be very long holds.  Like 10 years.  You'll look back and feel you picked a good company working on some good technologies to cure things that ail people around the world.  I hold BioNTech, Pfizer, JnJ, and Mrna.  In addition I own an EFT with a bucket of 64 stocks and it's not one of them. I sold some of the Mrna I think a month ago.  It's fallen off that high but I'm waiting for their results to square up the stock and take the revenue mystery out of play because they'll have to report it, but I'm a hold for the rest.  I don't need to sell any of it for 8-10 years.  If they get a prostate or breast cancer drug going that'll be a good holding for me.

Will say this, in a quick look, #Schwab gives your pick a B rating but what I also look at is enterprise value vs market cap.  The Market Cap is $4.3 Billion and the enterprise value is $2.2 billion.  I like when a business is valued more than by Wall St.  This has a very long way to grow into that market cap.  Short interest 8.9%, not overly terrible but anything above 5% IMP, isn't that great.  Edge 2nd opinion rates it a Avoid.  They report 5/6."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can use some arbitrary calcucations, as to what they could be worth given they take a % of the market, and divide it by the LOA. However, the stock price is more often than not driven by news hype and general LOA. There are some key indicators however, that increases the likelihood of success imo.

I'm heavily invested into two ""small"" Norwegian phase-2 biotech companies focusing on cancer treatments. My reasoning? Crazy strong **data**, **fast-track** for multiple indications, **orphan drug designation**, funded **partner** trials. From my experience, they often rally on days of positive news, but due to low volume on the small exchange, the stock price will see a steady and slow decline. You always run the risk that something negative can happen, or that there simply is no interest in the product from BP."
03/24/2021,stocks,Thank you so much. Both of these replies have been incredibly helpful. Exactly what I was looking to learn
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good point on the buy out, I didn't include that.  I do see a lot of partnerships maybe combing the R&D with the capicity to produce the product.  I own IBB in addition to XLV.  IBB is biotechs and XLV is more drugs, biotech and healthcare."

03/24/2021,stocks,Why leave your money in a shitty savings account earning 0.04% APY when you can put that money to work in the market and earn -10% APY
03/24/2021,stocks,“Invest your money” they say.  “Don’t leave your money in a shitty savings account they say.”  That 0.4% from a savings account sounding real spicy right about now compared to the -20% my portfolio has provided me this week 😎

03/24/2021,stocks,Lol I find it quite warming coming here and seeing everyone discuss their losses. I bought at ATHs back in Feb and held through this crap but honestly if it wasn’t for this sub and these daily discussion threads I’d have had a much harder time.
03/24/2021,stocks,I swear at this point if J Powell ordered a ceasar salad without croutons the market would freak.
03/24/2021,stocks,I thought GME dying would save the market.  I was wrong.

Stock Market: if he dies, he dies."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it’s safe to assume nobody has any answers on why the stock market is doing this.  It does seem odd, correct?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Hasn’t been a bottom on any mid/small cap tech stocks for roughly 5-6 weeks.  Certainly agree some were way overpriced but this is kind of ridiculous.  It’s been consistent 5-10% losses on basically any growth company during this while the major indexes stay relatively the same.  I keep averaging down but what the hell? A bunch are down 50-60% on monthly chart.
03/24/2021,stocks,Jokes on you I hate money anyway

03/24/2021,stocks,Remember when there was a semiconductor shortage and demand was skyrocketing? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm no fan of Cramer, but something he said the other day is very important for new investors to understand. Market saturation. Lots of new IPOs have been rushed out to feed consumer interest in tech. Now we have a lot of supply at a time when they are not a favoured asset. When you have more supply than demand it depresses prices. You need to anticipate this and rotate out of riskier names. Profitable companies will continue to exist, but there may be a multiple contraction so look at valuation. Get out of companies that don't have profits or positive cash flow from operations."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Oh look, another shitty blood red day. Getting old real fast."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ah yes, another day with a red portfolio and green watchlist"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have been paying intense attention to the stock market this month because of my daily predictions experiment.

I check every market event. I watch every Powell testimony. I read every article. I do technical analysis every day. Things look bearish to me right now. It's clear, to me, that sentiment is negative and that the NASDAQ downswing is not over.

*But I don't understand why.*

I've read every explanation and every single one sounds ridiculous to me.

I can't understand caring about bond yields being slightly higher than the lowest ever in history.

I can't understand freaking out about inflation rising to the point of *average*.

I can't understand why the nation reopening would make you think tech stocks are worthless now and Coca-Cola is suddenly going to become a rocket to the moon.

I can't understand why COVID rates going up a little bit while millions of Americans are getting vaccinated every day would get you worried about a disease that we ignored so heavily that, when it actually was killing people, the market doubled.

I'm getting to the point where I can do an ok job at predicting this stuff, but this sell-off is almost as stupid as the boom we have during COVID.

It would be a lot easier to predict the market if the people investing were sensible."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Can they end this damn testimony already? Is it done?

**Edit:** OMG it is in a ""short recess"". Let the pain end..."

03/24/2021,stocks,"My active portfolio is close to the March 8 low, goal is to defend at this level for now."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Most questions are: should I buy now?  I mean, the market is sinking, so everything is “on sale” or “overpriced”, depending on who you ask.  Who the hell knows, man?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I opened my app yesterday and immediately shut it. We'll see how today goes.

03/24/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Weather Forecast**

There's a lot of risk in the market today.

**J. Pow and the Feds are testifying again.**

They'll be saying literally the exact same thing they did yesterday. Will the market react differently this time? *Absolutely yes.*

Historically, it's very common for the second day of J. Powell making the exact same testimony to have wildly different results.

**Awful market data keeps pouring out.**

[Durable good sales are down](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/surging-u-s-manufacturers-take-temporary-step-back-in-february-as-durable-goods-orders-post-first-drop-in-10-months-11616590376?mod=bnbh_mwarticle). Analysts expected them to be up, and they're down to the worst scores in about a year.

**We're probably going to end green anyway.**

Everything's looking really bad -- but I don't think it matters enough to take us lower that we are. Right now, we're more impacted by technicals than fundamentals. If you look at a chart of the NASDAQ with a 20-day and 50-day moving average on it, you'll see that we've literally just been bouncing between those two lines all week.

For today, we're probably just going to keep bouncing between those two lines.

I'm forecasting a very bouncy **green day** with a **high of 13,434** and a **low of 13,200**.

If I’m looking at the order book for a low volume stock abc trading at $50 and I see mostly orders in the double digits with a few triple digit orders, but then I see a gigantic bid for 42,431 or something at $45, can’t I just figure that this gigantic order will prevent the price from dropping below $45 by the end of the day and then use this info for some trades (like writing a 0DTE put option with strike price $45)?

That just sounds too stupid and easy so I’m guessing the answer is no, but I just want to know WHY the answer is no."

Likely sees the area that it broke out of early in March soon, where it will be decision time. More confident that this index can defend, as it's an easier read than the mess with small caps (it hasn't just been straight up since November, it slowed down at 30k, 31k, 32k intraday, and now 33k), but I'm very, very concerned the Russell is sounding an early alarm that it is curtains on this trend."

Ive looked into Norberts Gambit were you do something similar to avoid some currency exchange fees and im hoping to do the same with this stock. The reason I want to do it is because I can sell CC's of MUX but not [MUX.TO](https://MUX.TO) for whatever reason, I dont want to sell it and buy the NYSE stock just to sell CC's, I want to avoid the fees if possible.

03/24/2021,stocks,10% down this month. fml.
03/24/2021,stocks,Green days are coming. Be patient. Stop looking at the portfolio.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure how anyone can consider that near 6% S&P move from the March 4th low as anything other than a nice move and rally. It’s just that we’ve entered an annoying pattern where after the monthly VIX expiration and options expiration, it’s very volatile and something can easily trigger a market sell off. 

Having said that, we haven’t even pulled back like we did in mid February or late January yet outside of IWM.

The options buying is actually apparently calming down though, so maybe this kind of pattern can calm itself.

ETA: And that’s another reason why that tech move on the first week of March sucked so badly. That was a potential rally week for everything and yet because tech was in a correction, it heaved that week in the garbage and burned that garbage can."

03/24/2021,stocks," 

let's just say I'm brand new to trading my question is:

If you have the 25K account that gets you past PDT and you buy 24K of ABC stock and then sell that stock the same day is your buying power now only 1K ? I see people trading on you tube making tons of trades in and out of stocks fast, Do they just have such huge accounts that their buying power never runs out?"

""The point of mockery is the true potential point of the stock price, as its the point where the hypists (cough WSB) could never imagine the price dropping to, due to their limited experience and tunnel vision, they mock it because it's the point where nightmares are made, where one could never imagine things dropping too, where people exit the  market in droves, extract their money at a loss and delete their apps. this is when you buy.

So many nice ideas,  but not much is obviously cheap right now,  then again I have to keep reminding myself that last year wasn't normal so the usual metrics don't work and it's hard to try and do 2019 comparisons."

Let's not act like there's only 1 or 2 companies that someone really believes in. There are plenty of alternatives out there to shop around for. Never buy a stock when it's at an ATH unless it's still undervalued according to its P/E, market cap, and growth projections."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Seriously, every day with this shit on such little news. Down 24% in a week."
03/24/2021,stocks,Exactly lol. When is a dip no longer considered a dip?
03/24/2021,stocks,I don’t buy dips anymore. I’d rather just wait to see where the bottom is. I’d rather miss the rally by a little than catch falling knives.
03/24/2021,stocks,You guys have gains?
03/24/2021,stocks,Yup lost the same amount since I started late December. Everything went downhill mid February. I should’ve sold when my stocks was 3X
03/24/2021,stocks,This is how I feel about my pharmaceutical stocks.
03/24/2021,stocks,Imagine people buying ICLN the last few months because of 'Biden'... as if that wasn't already priced in.

03/24/2021,stocks,"A lot of tech stocks have cash, profitability, or future profitability.  While a lot of more ""less risky"" companies lack clear paths to profitability and are accumulating debt. 

I agree that there is too much demand. Look at EVs, it seems like there is a new IPO or old automaker transitioning daily."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think we need a couple more green days to convince people that the bull run hasn't changed. I feel like there's a lot of people who've sold, and are sitting out right now just to see which way the market goes. I think after 3 consecutive green days, we'll see a lot of the growth stocks make a big comeback"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Keep in mind one thing: If the market was predictable and logical, everyone could easily predict it and make a killing with swing trading. The fact that its so stupid and unpredictable is why swing trading is so difficult to pull off."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'd guess it's probably mostly because tech had a very strong run up since March, that kind of growth becomes interpreted as overvaluation against a mean reversion and many investors are taking those profits while many wait for it to correct back a bit before buying.

Maybe a small ripple effect of 1-year long-term tax reduced profit taking coinciding with last year's crash is making it a bit worse since many invested in biotech and other tech stocks as a Covid play."
03/24/2021,stocks,A lot of volatility is from tax hike worries.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's crazy to me. Okay maybe a drop from ATH's but WTF. I understand rate and inflation worries but come on, this is getting out of hand and shouldn't only be affecting ""tech"". Most companies with any value are considered ""tech"" at this point and reopening will have no affect on them. Even Zoom is a part of life at this point. Many businesses are never going back to physical spaces and I don't see 20 people in a small meeting room happening ever again"

03/24/2021,stocks,It’s much better not to stare at it every day.
03/24/2021,stocks,"5% loss today, on a pretty well diversified portfolio."
03/24/2021,stocks,Crushed to the point that I'm locked in all positions. Bears were too successful and forced me into a do-or-die situation across the board. My best strategy is to just forget I own any stock for a year or two.
03/24/2021,stocks,Month? This week has hurt bad.
03/24/2021,stocks,"PLTR killing me. I add more, it dips more."

03/24/2021,stocks,Just give a few minutes to turn red
03/24/2021,stocks,"25.11%.  Not really sure what to do besides wait it out.  They'll go back up eventually, right?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I don’t even want to look at it but somewhere around 28%
03/24/2021,stocks,About 10% since I only started like a month ago. Sorry guys.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Today or for the year, or what?  I'm down 1.9% for today, which is a lot for me."
03/24/2021,stocks,"11% down since starting in Feb, at the urging of my wife to invest what was sitting in our saving accounts. I wish I had delayed on answering to her requests like I usually do with declogging a drain or signing up for kids' summer camps."
03/24/2021,stocks,So the previous dips o was down close to 17%. Then got back to within 0.30% down. Now I'm sitting at 10.47%. everytime I refreshed my finance app I lost 1% today.
03/24/2021,stocks,Down 5.19% overall. First started investing mid-Feb right before drop.
03/24/2021,stocks,1.6% down
03/24/2021,stocks,-4.76% today. -6.05% for the month.
03/24/2021,stocks,How is that even possible? What do you own? Only tech stocks?
03/24/2021,stocks,Down over 40%. Yeah I don’t trade options anymore
03/24/2021,stocks,"On the same boat here, my friend. Do not sell if you do not need the money and you do not have some crazy speculative stocks like S P A C s that have not found a company yet (in the latter case, maybe getting out with some loss could be considered).  All the solid companies that are making products/money will come back to Jan/Feb level at some point. Whether it will take few weeks or several months for that, God only knows."
03/24/2021,stocks,Good man. Hasn't been down to $100 for over 4 months.
03/24/2021,stocks,Crazy. I think anything under 110 is a solid buy.
03/24/2021,stocks,Down 20% bought at the peak 2/16...shitty timing lol
03/24/2021,stocks,Just in time for the cold November rain.
03/24/2021,stocks,AH begins! Futures start in 2.5 hours.

03/24/2021,stocks,Down 8.6% 🏂
03/24/2021,stocks,down 4.38% today
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm down 8%
03/24/2021,stocks,"Down 6.9% from 2/16 onward. Up 1.4% YTD, I guess I had a big enough cushion, but not for long lol."
03/24/2021,stocks,2.1% today 0.28% overall
03/24/2021,stocks,"up 27% realised YTD, 7.11% realised MTD, 0.7% realised WTD unrealised is -12%,"
03/24/2021,stocks,I set up a paper trading account to buy value stocks and I can confirm that once I used it to buy all the value stocks they all tanked immediately. lol.
03/24/2021,stocks,Let's get mentally prepared again for QQQ to see 300 and ARKK to see 109 again. Oh well.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Nope, just a bunch of paperhands selling their shares thinking the worlds coming to an end."
03/24/2021,stocks,I would've had more fun burning my money. At least then I get some warmth out of it. What do I get losing $1k on the stock market? A bunch of upvotes on WSB if I'm lucky
03/24/2021,stocks,AH is such a scam.
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s a long term play. I’ve been buying the dips as well. Just keep holding and buying the dips
03/24/2021,stocks,so sideways to 125?
03/24/2021,stocks,Don't. You will regret it massively.
03/24/2021,stocks,Are you investing or trading?

03/24/2021,stocks,"I think buying a bit each week is the right call today was the day I spent $350. Next week, another $300. Buy some dip. Then some more."

03/24/2021,stocks,My dip buying has gone from 100 shares down to 40 now maybe 6 shares
03/24/2021,stocks,Not crazy at all. I wouldn’t have bought anything today if I didn’t forget about a buy limit I had for AMD that got triggered just a bit ago. At least it was small.
03/24/2021,stocks,"You obviously don't own PLL lol

Stock was a beast through the ups and downs of last year, so of course they just sold 1.75 million dollars worth of shares at 70 bucks per share (while priced 81). I'm not allowed to have just one good thing.

I'm -6.47 today"

Clearly it was not the bottom."
03/24/2021,stocks,As usual we'll find out later.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah it'll be green, about 0.02% up across the board. Enjoy!!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Look on the bright side - every day that passes means losing another 3% is a smaller dollar amount lost
03/24/2021,stocks,It's so mentally hard to hold something especially when you get other people's opinions involved.
03/24/2021,stocks,I sold.
03/24/2021,stocks,That sounds risky. Good luck lol
03/24/2021,stocks,At this point i'd just go VOO or VTI and stop trying to figure out what's going to work. Markets too illogical lol
03/24/2021,stocks,"Id average down on any long term tech that you have high conviction on, otherwise throw the rest in safer stocks or indexes, thats just what i am doing at least"

03/24/2021,stocks,Well when you're on the floor bleeding out your ass....it's reasonable you might lift your hand up for help in the morning.
03/24/2021,stocks,Exactly. I picked up some PayPal today. It’s 30% off ATH 😏
03/24/2021,stocks,you’re right. but only because this dip will seem like nothing compared to how bad it is a few months from now
03/24/2021,stocks,"For the inverse, why should I subject myself to these drops if I can wait another month or 2 or etc. when I feel there’s a sense of stability to open my position vs accepting it may just be an inopportune time and hold through. Currently I don’t feel comfortable making that leap."
03/24/2021,stocks,BUY THE DIP
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m going to keep my expectations low and deep down hope I’m pleasantly surprised by the day.
03/24/2021,stocks,Except for GME lol. Might be bloodshed for GME holders tomorrow.
03/24/2021,stocks,30 minutes in and the low already broken. The market is on a roll.
03/24/2021,stocks,I do this for a good 15 mins and then look again. Mostly because I keep thinking I should buy but I've been doing that enough I should probably just hold onto my remaining cash and wait this out. I've made enough buys already. Time to shut it down for the week.
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m just waiting until ARKX is released then I’m deleting all my apps
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm going to do this too....for 2 days as soon until there is any upswing. Maybe I can hold out longer this time, can't take this anymore lol"

03/24/2021,stocks,I bought a little bit...so usually that means do the opposite.
03/24/2021,stocks,Personally I’d wait. This selling is probably related to big funds rebalancing at quarter end into bonds after their yields rose. The selling in stocks that had strong gains is going to pick up.
03/24/2021,stocks,For some reasons Nasdaq is barely down but my tech is down a lot more. Seems like small tech is getting hit but not big tech.

Rocket chose to set up shop in Detroit with a goal of rescuing a once great city that had died.  They create fanastic opportunities for people who would otherwise be overlooked and disrespected by Wall Street.  They've changed lives of the employees and the communities in which they live and operate.

And by giving the best possible service they have the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, while growing to also have number one market share.  They're working a plan right now to take that best-in-class 10% market share up to 25%, and one of the ways they're doing that is by trying to duplicate their Detroit miracle in Ohio.  They'll be the biggest job creator in Ohio month.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I have PTON, and think it will recover nicely if tech market does. They just bought 3 more tech companies, and have plenty of cash to burn on getting the next big thing out. I'm not holding out for 150 anytime soon but also don't think 50 will happen."
03/24/2021,stocks,Hot garbage stock
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like Beachbody better, PTON multiples are too rich imo"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah. Absolutely love it, but I can’t figure out what a good entry point would be. I have a higher cost basis from where it is now, and was considering adding, but I was thinking I may as well wait a week and see."
03/24/2021,stocks,I think it’s a buy now
03/24/2021,stocks,Stocks require a lot of patience bro. Otherwise there will always be too much stress
03/24/2021,stocks,That is when it is best time to invest. When everyone is running away from an entire sector. As long as nothing changed with them fundamentally.
03/24/2021,stocks,Global chip shortage is affecting everything tech. They will rebound once the chip shortage is resolved.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Nah.. if tou have AAPL, Nvidia, AMD, Ms, google, Disney etc are not going away anytime soon. If you focus on today you’d feel down, but give it time."
03/24/2021,stocks,Looks like a great time to start
03/24/2021,stocks,"Value's been pretty nice for me so far tbh. -0.4% which is a bit of a bummer considering I started the day +0.5%, but enjoying it nonetheless and the dividends are fun to look forward to

03/24/2021,stocks,JNJ and Target have been doing very well

03/24/2021,stocks,"Dude it is about time in the market not timing the market if you are talking long positions here.  Granted, a month or two is nothing but I have always felt time is on my side as I plan to invest for the next 30 years or so."
03/24/2021,stocks,Just wait it could last a year.
03/24/2021,stocks,Correction? Not even close. We’re you not in the market in Dec 2018 or March 2020?
03/24/2021,stocks,"You buy stocks with the thought process, will this be worth more in ten years? If the answer is yes, you buy it. If you’re unsure you don’t. You will never remember any of this market manipulation in ten years. Options, that’s a different story! Good luck!"
03/24/2021,stocks,If you truly believe in those 2 stocks will a dip matter in a month?
03/24/2021,stocks,Pre market my ARKG is up 1%.... but i expect it will keep struggling until we go back to a legit bull run.
03/24/2021,stocks,Personally I like ARKF and Q. K is the riskiest but biggest “discount”. I love what the F and Q have. Both down about 12% from this fake news fake tech sell off. Sell off. Pffft. Like any retail investor is buying something like Amazon. Let alone selling it. It’s all so fake.
03/24/2021,stocks,ETFs
03/24/2021,stocks,"I recommend VTI. Or if you really think big tech will shine, VUG is a decent buy too imo."
03/24/2021,stocks,"-30% lmao, not even GME is down that much"

03/24/2021,stocks,"1) Unless you have few hundreds billions to play with, you’ll end with holding half a penny of hundreds/thousands of companies 

2) You’ll have to continuously monitor and manage your holdings of these half pennies"
03/24/2021,stocks,can't reasonably ever hope to allocate a portfolio like an ETF does since I cannot buy fractional shares. They also update their holdings from time to time and that's not something I can do without buying/selling stocks which incurs some tax penalties
03/24/2021,stocks,"That'd be insane if we're talking about VT or something lol, put like a penny in each company"
03/24/2021,stocks,Why would you ask that now of all times? There's more diversification and obviously less volatility. You don't have to drop 8% just because a particular stock is doing terribly.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I've seen this happen yesterday with some other stocks.  They skyrocket, then they fall like -30% the next day.  A normal investor can't benefit from it if they can't buy and sell the stock on the same day, so I would just observe it, and not buy anything."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree, but the problem is.... I kind of need them to turn green by April 16th and no later than June 18th."
03/24/2021,stocks,The problem is for every one green day three red day follows and it’s hard to get any gains. March been brutal
03/24/2021,stocks,"Pre market seems to be really positive so far, i think people will be happy of today :D"
03/24/2021,stocks,I would love to and do think we will see a rally like we did first week of march. Im just not sure if itll actually stick or not. Kind think might be a other dead cat bounce. Either way i need a 3-5% gain on a few positions today so i can close them out
03/24/2021,stocks,No taxation without representation boy. No politicians are working in my interest. Therefore I shouldn't have to pay taxes.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Eliminating the Trump tax give to the mega wealthy is an important goal. Tax hikes (really, restoring tax rate) for 400k+ earners is important and I hope it passes."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It’s all fake bud. Every single bit of it. They’ll tell you the stocks down because of a massive sell off! Hell they tell you that before the market is even open pre market hours. Take Amazon for instance. $3,000 a share. Who the F besides the money makers themselves (Fidelity, Schwab etc) are buying Amazon? Nobody that’s who. There’s also nobody selling it either. It’s all just complete fake bullshit. Imagine owning a business and your accounts payable is 1 million dollars. With a click of a button you can launch negative news stories and create fear and suddenly the 1 million due is now 700,000. They do this all day everyday. Bond rates, unemployment, you name it, they have another reason to slash the amount they owe in a second."
03/24/2021,stocks,"sir, do you want to add more stress to the already stressful life we have looking at our portfolios every minute??"
03/24/2021,stocks,Waiting for more cash to invest with 😢. The dip has lasted so long that I already invested everything I could like 2+ weeks ago lol.
03/24/2021,stocks,Reopening plays are mostly overvalued
03/24/2021,stocks,Can you name a few?
03/24/2021,stocks,Specifically what fundamental market changes have occurred?
03/24/2021,stocks,False equivalency...
03/24/2021,stocks,"I also took a huge shit since it began going red. Must've been the shit, even though it had nothing to do with the stock.

That is your flawless logic."
03/24/2021,stocks,actually agree lmao
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's a leveraged (multiplied) inverse volatility instrument.  

In theory, it's supposed to move 3x up or down in the opposite direction of volatility.  In practice, it doesn't always do that.  

It's something you'd buy if you (a) don't have access to options and (b) think the market will crash in the next few days.  

Because of the way it's constructed, it costs money to run and thus loses a little value every day by default.  But on a day when the market crashes, it should (theoretically) shoot up a lot.  

Don't buy it today for a market crash in 6 months.  It will bleed more while you're waiting than you'll make.  But if you're convinced there's a crash imminent, it can act as insurance.  

Since the value drops daily by default, you may be wondering what happens when it gets to zero?  It never does, because when it gets low, they do a reverse split to set the price up high again and continue."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The answer is margin, brokers will generally allow you to continue trading with unsettled funds if you have magin enabled"
03/24/2021,stocks,"they’re being lent money while their settlements clear. it’s a form of margin but shouldn’t be confused with actual borrowing margin which enhances your gain/losses

the inverse of that is known as a cash account. you don’t have access to any unsettled funds, but you also have no day trading limits"
03/24/2021,stocks,HAHAHA I love this
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know right.. it’s not like a lot of these tech company fundamentals have changed. A lot are still seeing very good revenue and growth. 

A lot of this seems to be all market sentiment. Just look how bullshit the 10-year story was

What is hard is to double down my stocks during this red and buy more.. instead of just waiting it out"
03/24/2021,stocks,"My thoughts as well. It sucks seeing all that red in my portfolio, but I ignore my daily/weekly/monthly performance during down times like this, and instead focus on how I can best take advantage of dips in stocks I like. I'll also do a lot of repositioning, rotating money out of broken stocks into others that I like better, while they're still on discount."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Since election day the Dow is up 5k, Nasdaq up 1800 and S&P up 500. 

Not that Biden, nor the President before him, or any before them, generally deserves any accolades or blame for the rise and fall of the markets."
03/24/2021,stocks,Can we stop with these political comments? The stock market has historically gone up regardless of which party occupies the White House. Suggesting otherwise is false information.
03/24/2021,stocks,Weird what happens when you stop artificially propping up the market.
03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks FUD Master 3000
03/24/2021,stocks,Why are you being such a weirdo about your predictions? Good lord this is cringe inducing.
03/24/2021,stocks,LOL yea sure bud
03/24/2021,stocks,I am not an apple bull but that would require apple to go back to july levels... this will only happen if a wide correction happens. Would be surprising imo.
03/24/2021,stocks,Begging for this.
03/24/2021,stocks,Why load up on cash when you could buy puts on those if you think that will happen
03/24/2021,stocks,I think we've already seen the lows for this recent period. I think we're just normalizing. Doubt we see these prices

03/24/2021,stocks,"Just google “best swing trading patterns” should bring up videos on how to use filters in Finviz.  I usually only use 4 filters:  price, channel up/wedge up patterns, volume over 100k, and then filter by price.  But there are lots of helpful videos on how to use Finviz.  I like it because it’s free.  I haven’t had any success at all this year but not because of the charts, they’re very useful for swing trading.  EDIT:  and I’m sure there are way more in depth ways to use it than i do,  I just like to keep it simple."

03/24/2021,stocks,Except for those damn bull traps...
03/24/2021,stocks,Why?
03/24/2021,stocks,"The overall market recovers, but not necessarily individual stocks. Some stocks that saw a crazy run in 2020 might not recover to it's ATHs ever. Keep that in mind."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Depends on your timeline !!! I started buying stocks about three years ago  - as a beginner I got the advise: Do not sell if the stocks go down ... the first year was quite good , then some stocks went down and I hoped to recover the few losses ... but then Corona came and three of my old strategy not selling loosing  stocks stay still with big losses in my portfolio : Bayer  Deutsche Bank and Fresenius... One, BMW , recovered now to +/- 0 ( for me without justification just due to the market switch to value !) After three years !!!
Today I sell everything with loss of around 3 to max 10% depending on the amount loosing .., 
I think it’s better to reinvest the free money in hopefully good gaining new stocks !"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Do you only buy when prices are surging higher?  If you're investing long term, down trends are some of the best times to buy (assuming you actually have cash available)."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Agreed. The difficulty as mentioned with the ones that do have cash and good profits is that they have been very expensive. I've seen people saying Adobe is a screaming buy at 40x trailing earnings. They could meet this eventually, but we're looking at possibly 5 years in the future, and this is underappreciated."

03/24/2021,stocks,Nope lol
03/24/2021,stocks,"I keep feeling that way, but there seems like there is no bottom for stocks like FSLY, LMND, AI to name a few, all have lost over half of their value in a couple months."

03/24/2021,stocks,I became a long term investor very quickly hahaha
03/24/2021,stocks,Too conservative an estimate. I'm very confident we'll see sales of at least double that.

03/24/2021,stocks,yep same thing. First deep was the worst.... so far...

03/24/2021,stocks,Damn that’s high tech!

03/24/2021,stocks,It's massacre today too. Already down 15%.

03/24/2021,stocks,You really think you will see that soon?  With expanding the streaming service to more countries and the parks opening back up?

03/24/2021,stocks,"I honestly think this next week will be crucial for finding some fantastic buys. Will be looking at ETSY and a whole lot of other tech stocks here, very glad the cash is stored up and ready for this. Think it’s about to get quite a lot worse than today."

03/24/2021,stocks,I was wondering why actc spac was taking a dump.
03/24/2021,stocks,"The only article I found on it said there was actually a small bit of good news. It's too late for me to sell anyways, I'm just gonna hold, it's got a 50 billion dollar market cap. Only a matter of time before whales jump in."
03/24/2021,stocks,I think Tesla would be doing the same if it wasn't for the ARK report causing a lot of hype. Buys from that may be cancelling out the current EV sell off.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah the Dems are twirling their mustaches as they laugh and press the down button on your energy stocks.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I put about 1/3 of my index allocation into SLY, which had done quite a bit better than VTI up until a few days ago. Now it's dumping with all my single tickers"

03/24/2021,stocks,Or if you are 50% tech. Dow gain cancels out tech loss. I've been essentially flat over the last 2-3 weeks.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yea dude is fucking annoying. Just STFU
03/24/2021,stocks,That's your definition of bleeding? I guess I must've bled out 2 weeks ago then

03/24/2021,stocks,"No but I’m not regularly an options player, it was just an obvious sale so I went for it. I’m just trying to understand when to sell my contract as it relates to when the option expires. E.g. do I keep holding and if so what happens to the value of my contract"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Eh, I don’t agree. Things are looking very oversold now, and 2 months more of this would be ridiculous. But hey, I could easily be wrong about that."
03/24/2021,stocks,went from 12422 up to 13586. I'd say that was a pretty decent breakout.

Once Q2 rolls around, and hopefully a good earnings seasons with it, I think we're going to see a rapid reversal of this massacre. I'm thinking mid-April is when things really get back on track."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Because the future should be that they're going to pass Netflix in users in just three years and fly by them with their streaming and content.

But if they go back to dividend I don't see how that doesn't tank the price of the stock, and they're pretty clearly being treated as a reopening stock whose shortterm time has already passed."
03/24/2021,stocks,I don’t disagree just trying to help her but the stuff she wants at a decent price.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same here. Lots of people will be wanting the more affordable version of a peloton, and in the meantime, they have cash flow from the other side of the business. Currently close to par value."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don’t have a good grasp on crayon analysis but I’m feeling low 300s for my next (small) add, otherwise happy to see what happens from here."
03/24/2021,stocks,Fundamentally they were overvalued
03/24/2021,stocks,AMD is making me cry though:(
03/24/2021,stocks,"I do as well, I’m just not comfortable with my initial decision to lump sum it all in at this time. I’d rather mitigate risk and reevaluate in a month or 2 time with my taxable account vs my current fomo approach."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If that's the case, then I'll see it as a year of opportunity to consolidate my holdings in some great companies."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ofc, it could. I hope not"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tech had a correction

S&P didn't. At least not yet"
03/24/2021,stocks,Is this a missed the train type of thing or are they long term viable?
03/24/2021,stocks,I agree with ETFs. I would put in VTI or SPY
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah super retarded of me. I kept averaging up 🙄
03/24/2021,stocks,"Don’t you cap your upside though? You would miss out on stock splits, mergers and voting rights."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same here, also like to add that some etfs have access to certain stocks my broker doesnt offer like nintendo or disney"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes Mr. Broker, I shall take one of everything sir"
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm already stoked for today. Waiting for the next move up.
03/24/2021,stocks,enjoy your denial downvotes but agreed. a huge taxit movement is in our future
03/24/2021,stocks,"Lol, you're here aren't you :P"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tech isn’t? Tech is way worse. And re opening plays make since right now.

Obviously we have some tech heavy sensitive people in here"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Any cruises 
Any airlines that haven’t recovered
Food services that haven’t recovered - although most have 
Banks 
Reality/hotels that haven’t recovered"
03/24/2021,stocks,"UAL and CCL are buoying up my portfolio. Also Cinemark just had a steep dip in the last few days, imo it's an opportunity to buy."
03/24/2021,stocks,Specifically what fundamental market changes have occurred?
03/24/2021,stocks,Oh this helps a lot thank you!
03/24/2021,stocks,I think you should just DCA. I’ve been doing that lately and haven’t regretted it a bit considering I bought the tops of so many other positions
03/24/2021,stocks,"That's not what's going on, the NY Fed has still been very active, but they're not going to do anything about names such as Tesla, Lemonade, etc, getting hammered, in fact, if we're going to prop up Trump, his admin might have popped the first Bitcoin bubble on purpose, and it would not be surprising if the Fed/treasury couldn't give two ****'s about a Tesla being -28.4% from the January highs, because they think that it'd be better if the speculation calmed down.

A lot of high growth tech names are completely and totally broken at this point. IF those indices rally, it's going to be with the ""fun names"" basing for quite a while and different names taking over, which is actually quite possible."
03/24/2021,stocks,corrections are always surprising before they happen.
03/24/2021,stocks,buying opportunity of a lifetime if it does happen
03/24/2021,stocks,anger phase
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know,  I had about $2K for a year and a half,  but I sold it at the beginning of the year to buy more XOM. I'd like to get back in at some point.   Solid company,  good dividend."
03/24/2021,stocks,Once I make a purchase I don’t ever plan to sell. Call me old fashion
03/24/2021,stocks,It's a recovery play tied to the movie theater industry for sure
03/24/2021,stocks,"idk, imagine selling green energy after it dropped 50% off it's high like it's never going up again.

It will be back. look at March 9 for reference, very little has changed between now and then, heck several solar stocks were up 7% as recently as  Monday."
03/24/2021,stocks,"No. I only invest money that I don't need. I don't have investment money now, therefore, I wont invest."
03/24/2021,stocks,I bought yesterday and then everything I bought went down more today. Bought a bit more today and tomorrow will probably go down again.
03/24/2021,stocks,I dumped a lot in already early today so i’m probably gonna sit back and watch the rest of the day play out. But i’ll definitely continue buying dips in the coming day if it comes to it. Would be lying if i said this isnt starting to get discouraging though lol
03/24/2021,stocks,"I believe you, I invest in Honda, Toyota, NIO, Tesla, and Nissan. These are companies I think will do great and will be able to transition or be big in the future . What's your opinion since you're in EVs as well?
I got into Tesla in the early years because at the time it was a spec play.
With NIO I think they're going to win Chinas market in time.
Honda and Toyota were safer plays, I believe that they will successfully transition from hybrid to EV.
Nissan has 500,000 leaf sales. I think Nissan stepping away from Renault allowed me to buy more. I personally think Asian stocks tend to be less over valued than U.S over valued stocks. What's your opinion?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I am in my mid 20s with a fresh career and time. For me it's worthwhile investing in stocks that promise profitability and innovation. At this point it's almost as if what's an investors time horizon. Stocks are priced in accordance to what the market dictates they should be over time.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Sorry to hear that, man. I am down 5% overall on my portfolio. I have 75% VTI and 22% of ARKK."
03/24/2021,stocks,"What’s your plan for ARKF? I know ARKK is kinda risky, but I think out of all the ARKs, F has the best long term potential"
03/24/2021,stocks,Just seems dumb that all stocks would return to 2018 levels. I'm not seeing why that would ever happen.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Today was a bloodbath. I think we're through the worst of it, shit seemed to calm down over the last hour, but only time will tell"
03/24/2021,stocks,Just bought a company that mines corn.  I understand the process is called cornholing
03/24/2021,stocks,Lmao this market is ridiculous.
03/24/2021,stocks,":/ 

You’ll eat soon enough"
03/24/2021,stocks,Wendy's is pretty good but I get bad migraines eating their food (along with most other fast food chains) which sucks.
03/24/2021,stocks,"APPL, BEAM, QQQJ, and a few indices for me today."
03/24/2021,stocks,My average is $125 and I have no more to put in. Just gonna zoom my time horizon out and I still feel good about it.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I hear you. I started investing in early January. Just small amounts of money to start, figuring out what i was doing. Finally decided that all the money i made from the past 4 years of my fulltime job needed to stop wasting away in a savings account so i dumped a ton of my money into the market in.... you guessed it... mid February.

Right there with ya man. We’ll get through it and i’m confident that *eventually* we’ll be rewarded for buying all these dips."
03/24/2021,stocks,Fine by me. More pharma and tech buys.
03/24/2021,stocks,"God I can’t wait. I’m so sick of GME. Everyone will get stuck holding the bag as usual. If he’s still in I’m still in! Never sell! $1000 is not a meme! VW chart...we are here! Like PT Barnum said, there’s a sucker born every minute."
03/24/2021,stocks,Because the last ER was literally the catalyst that put us where we are right now.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'll mock you once we go below 13,100."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Mocking time. What a scrub, can't even predict where the market goes..."
03/24/2021,stocks,Space exploration
03/24/2021,stocks,No its a semiconductor  stock
03/24/2021,stocks,I have my own personal rules when it comes to investing. I think 165 is a reasonable entry point.
03/24/2021,stocks,Good bot.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree completely. I've been nibbling here and there at some stocks I like, but am saving the majority of my dry powder for that one last *whoosh* selloff that brings us back down, or at least close, to that prior bottom from earlier in March. And we're not there yet."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Bonkers day. I wonder how much we'll fall before April and Q2 hopefully saves us. ETSY got as low as $180 during the previous bottom. I bought the fuck out of it there. I doubt we'll see that again, but mid $180s is absolutely in play now."
03/24/2021,stocks,Are we seeing the same market? 2nd half of day was pretty red.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah I'm 16-19% down on all of them even with the averaging lol. I'm holding through it even as it recovers though. I take solace in the fact that despite them dropping much more aggressively than the overall market, they've still been rising and falling with the overall market for the most part (specifically the NASDAQ). I think once this period of volatility wavers and we start really recovering they will bounce back hard."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Good for you, I’m tapped out atm, just hoping to cut losses and park it in VTI"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I've actually just commented about that below. I think the ARK report is helping Tesla avoid the drop. It's like a tug-of-war between the EV slump and new hype wave atm, so it's remaining stable.

I'm not certain that's **the** reason but I definitely think it's a factor causing a lot of downward pressure. I was reading about it yesterday now there's a disproportionate sell off, so it could be."
03/24/2021,stocks,"nah, they’re just leading their base of illiterate mutants on as they always do"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yup, I don't see why that's 'infuriating'. Is op expecting 5% gains weekly?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Well combined with the 2% of yesterday its not the best.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yea the problem is how it adds up. Some people here are like ""LOL 1% THAT'S NOTHING"" but when its been 2 months it drops 1% most days it hurts :P"
03/24/2021,stocks,It's a great company/media empire but question is will it keep growing.  Kinda cheap compared to NFLX at $535
03/24/2021,stocks,Maybe he only has 70 dollars?
03/24/2021,stocks,Always a good option. I just like AS and all that cuz it’s literally the founding of capitalism being “born”.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I've been in and out of INTC over the years.  Right here and now it seems like it's priced for perfection already, but momentum will probably carry it higher anyway."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The value of the option goes down by thetha each day, assuming the stock does nothing."
03/24/2021,stocks,I just think that Nasdaq has been running way too hot over the last 18 months compared to the S&P 500.
03/24/2021,stocks,He needs to shut the fuck up and limit his public speaking.
03/24/2021,stocks,Why would anyone advertise to those demos tho?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Haha all fair points. In particular the ads, which have gotta be a cash cow. I have a grudge. It annoys me they're always trying to show me Kardashian culture shit. The app just makes me feel dirty. I guess there's always going to be a trashy segment of the population - premium snapchats will never die completely. (No disrespect to premium Snapchatters - you do great work.)"
03/24/2021,stocks,Nah I'm just not so emotionally attached to tech stocks that I feel the need to cry about how boomers ruined the party by not only making trading decisions purely based on momentum
03/24/2021,stocks,🤣🤣🤣
03/24/2021,stocks,"I see, I misunderstood your comment because I'm really tired of seeing people whining about how the tech sector's money printers turned off after an entire year of incredible gains"
03/24/2021,stocks,"What is a GenX stock - Taco Bell, Compaq, or Atari ?"
03/24/2021,stocks,Nobody asked
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s all time high is 68 ish it’s going for 63 it’s 10% down
03/24/2021,stocks,I have a very small position that I intend on holding (10 shares @ 150) woof!
03/24/2021,stocks,That would be nice for sure.
03/24/2021,stocks,I have 500 ARKK at $140ish and 500 ARKG at $100ish.  Hit it big with GME and put a lot of the profits into those. Couldn't be less worried.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think it will hover above 100 for a while but hard to see it spiking up to the 150s again. Might not be able to get in much lower than 100 until summer

Lots of downside and little upside imo"
03/24/2021,stocks,Like the company long term as well. Haven’t determined a buy point yet as my other buy limits are close to triggering. Will do some research tomorrow.
03/24/2021,stocks,Only because covid has cut every normal person's income down a fuck ton. Most people can only afford the bare minimum right now. Give a couple months leeway after people get back to work before judging their valuations.
03/24/2021,stocks,Some like tsla still are. Some like aapl might be a little pricey considering it's size and historical p/e. And some like amzn are fully justified in their valuation.
03/24/2021,stocks,"In my opinion its a good long term play, but its a more risky option than just going for index funds. I am 10% in it and i wouldn't go much more above that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Loooooong term. Think 10 years. You okay paying a .75 ER over 10 years to ensure broad coverage in genomics? If so, this is your stock. For me, I’m heavy into ARKF, but for genomics, I’m in just a single company (BEAM) for the long term."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> Don’t you cap your upside though?

Sure you cap your upside of a single stock. However, you're also capturing the upside on a ton of stocks you wouldn't have otherwise.

> You would miss out on stock splits, mergers and voting rights.

I don't quite understand how stock splits and mergers would affect you differently in an ETF, can you elaborate?

I haven't personally used voting rights but yeah that could be an issue if you're big on that. 

TBH I've been investing for almost a decade, the longer I do it the more money I put into my ETFs. Stock picking, options, daytrading are all fun but I won't delude myself into thinking I'm better than the pros. All new investors-- please do yourself a favor and visit /r/Bogleheads for the best way to make bank safely"
03/24/2021,stocks,"you asked why would one  buy an ETF. I gave the reason ""to buy"" an ETF.

this 2nd statement of yours is about the actual equity and not the ETF."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, make that 0.000001% count."
03/24/2021,stocks,Of course... when am I not here?
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is absolutely false.

Airlines and cruises are grossly overvalued."
03/24/2021,stocks,Reopening plays happened months ago
03/24/2021,stocks,"True. However companies will always buy technology to improve their earnings, lower their staff, crank up profits, etc.  That's something they'll do this year, next, year, every year.  ""Re-opening"" is a (more or less) one time thing."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Let's be real for a moment. Tech was way overvalued at its peak but the gains realized last year aren't going to completely disappear. Tech has been bleeding for over a month now and it is going to come back in a big way. Obviously we don't know when it will be, but if people can average down they stand to make a lot of money. If you're extremely lucky I suppose you could time the market when it heads back to tech."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thats bullshit, due to share dilation most of your stocks are now worth more than before the covid crash"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes. Unfortunately I put a large chunk into a few things half way during this downturn. 

With the rest of my dry powder wondering if I should DCA in more and stick to the plan with tech or use it for something like value vanguard"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ugh, same. I used all of it to buy high apparently. By the time I have more I’m sure the market will have gone back up."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Well if you got into tesla early I dont know why you're talking to me when you should be on your private jet.  

I'm going to move into toyota and honda eventually too. NIO is what I'm in purely in the hope of it being the Chinese tesla. But with china I just have to accept it can vanish anytime. I cant make head or tails with Nissan. Theyve made some truly horrible manufacturer decisions in the past. This is coming from a Nissan fan boy. I think Honda and toyota are better in most every way. Idk because auto always makes me nervous"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Actually...I wouldn't mind if the market tanked some more.

If it does I might just have the excuse I need to ditch my REDEEMER RETARDED Apple stock at a mild loss finally but then put it into something that I KNOW will do better."
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm holding my nose and waiting. Hopefully the large numbers of AAPL options for April 16 are a sign that thimgs will get better soon
03/24/2021,stocks,maybe you’re allergic to deliciousness
03/24/2021,stocks,Yes also doesn’t TSM have a mega factory in AZ under construction?
03/24/2021,stocks,For real lol. Cant stand these mofos anymore.
03/24/2021,stocks,It was worth like $5 at that time. Huge difference
03/24/2021,stocks,"Nooooooo

I was way off today."
03/24/2021,stocks,"What are you looking at if I may ask? 

I closed a lot of my positions yesterday (thank god) im about to buy back in at lower prices.. maybe next Monday/Tuesday. So far all others I've been watching have dropped significantly...and I don't have enough cash to buy them all so I'm looking to narrow it down. 

What are you looking out for?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I didn’t realize it bottomed there last time. May look at changing my buy limit for it. I think we retest the bottom again for sure.
03/24/2021,stocks,"S&P was down like 0.8% yesterday. On avg stocks were down but not by a ton, except for certain companies. Not many people are gonna scramble to take advantage of a 0.8% discount"
03/24/2021,stocks,"There's no sale for people that want slow and steady

Plenty on sale for people that think tech is undervalued"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, they’re the ones responsible for the sorry state of your portfolio."
03/24/2021,stocks,No it's just that lately the Nasdaq and Dow are opposites of each other.
03/24/2021,stocks,"yep they sure af add up, i’m 15% down all time. i remember back when i was having second thoughts when i was only $200 down. wish i trusted my gut and pulled out right there. too deep in now"
03/24/2021,stocks,Definitely! But you’re right I don’t expect it to make anything/much  at that price but I figured to was cool for the grands to have.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Priced for perfection? PE 13. PS 3.3. And my favorite measure:
Enterprise Value/EBITDA 7.50
Compare that to AMD or other semis. INTC should be $100 and that would still be way below the S&P500 PE of 30 and INTC now has a better LT growth profile with its new investments."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks. So if I want to bet that the stock will continue to go up, how do I calculate the benefit from that vs theta decay? Or in simpler terms how I do I calculate how much it will go down each day if the stock stayed at its current level"
03/24/2021,stocks,Because there’s a big difference in the nature of the two indexes. Your point being?
03/24/2021,stocks,I wouldn't recommend you use it. But it seems to have abnormally larger sell off than peers so I snagged some
03/24/2021,stocks,Ok boomer
03/24/2021,stocks,Backwards hats and cigarettes mostly
03/24/2021,stocks,Yea because the stock price tells you everything you need to know about a company. lol go pick up a book.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It was $68 this morning.  Technically the ATH is something like $70, but that was 20 years ago."
03/24/2021,stocks,Oof. I am in 15 @ 95.84 today lol. I feel you though. I held on to TIGR when it dropped from 37 to 22
03/24/2021,stocks,I’m recommending she buy at least two shares at $52/share the rest she can overpay for.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think AAPL is at a great price tbh. The past few days, they've maintained ground at every dip, which is a pretty darn good sign lol."
03/24/2021,stocks,Ok thanks. Between these guys and my other picks I should be fine with tech. Like everyone else on this sub I'm probably too high on tech anyways.
03/24/2021,stocks,Is that a high ER?
03/24/2021,stocks,"RE: Stock splits and mergers. With an ETF you’re either in or you’re out. Your value is based on the performance not the number of shares the ETF holds.

In the case of the recent TSLA split, shareholders multiplied their shares 5X and then saw a run up on the split shares. So in essence the could have just sold an equal number of shares that they owned before the split and still have 4 times more shares than they did before.

With mergers, again the ETF might see a boost in performance but owning the equities would see a premium paid on the merger and actual ownership in the new company.

Everyone is giving good reasons here I’m just curious if there was some kind of hidden benefit or if I flat out was missing something."
03/24/2021,stocks,Not for all
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree with that. But any company that hasn’t came back from covid because it has been closed in some fashion is going to come back as long as it’s legit. This summer/this whole year, the demand for travel/hospitality industry is already insane. Most vacations are already booked and just waiting for the ok by the cdc. Bet on us reopening and you can’t lose imo. But hey do your thing this is an individual thing"
03/24/2021,stocks,I agree. Just a matter of when
03/24/2021,stocks,"We don't need ""luck"" or magic beans.  Things can be valued.  Numbers can be analyzed.  Sentiment observed.  Patterns recognized.  Trends tracked.  Numbers crunched.  Reports read.

Is Adobe going bankrupt this year?  How many dollars per share is represented in AAPL's cash hoard?  We don't need luck to correctly answer such questions.

Nor do we need to perfectly bottom tick and top tick in order to beat averages and indexes or other much-pushed alternatives."
03/24/2021,stocks,We gon see
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve been putting a lot of money in VTI lately because I wanted more safe stuff but you should consider doing  a 70/30 split from now on between a broad ETF and other stocks
03/24/2021,stocks,Good idea YOLO on GME. What could possibly go wrong?
03/24/2021,stocks,"If the market is going to take another giant dump and everything goes on fire sale, I'm looking at ETSY under $190, MSFT under $230, and FSYL around or below $60. If the value stocks want to join in the party, too, I'd love some more WBA under $48. I timed the last bottom very well and bought a ton of those stocks at those prices, so I'd like to add to those positions.

What are you looking for?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"It hit $180 very briefly on that Friday when we last bottomed. Etsy at that price was the canary in the coal mine for me. I blinked and it was back up to $184. I knew we had hit bottom and it was time to buy heavily, so I did."
03/24/2021,stocks,Nasdaq finished down 1.12% and s&p down 0.76%... however most Stocks I saw finished down 3-4%
03/24/2021,stocks,That would be me 🙌
03/24/2021,stocks,Not always. They often all go up in lock step.
03/24/2021,stocks,"The very first thing I said was about INTC's monumental metrics.  

But another way of stating it than priced for perfection (and your words seem to agree) is that it's priced as if it's 2026 and the two factories just opened successfully and none of the competitors have made progress and they've made good progress poaching smart semi people from other companies.  The share price is starting to do a touchdown dance on the (20, 15, 10, pick a number) yard line.

Further, stocks move in channels, especially big ole blue chips like INTC.  It's gone from $45 to $70 without adding one customer, releasing one product, inventing anything, or solving a single one of their large problems.  They've appointed a CEO and talked about something that's 2026 at the earliest.  

Usually such mega-moves happen on something more substantial and/or financial.  For that reason, one could say the INTC pendulum has swung a lot recently."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If Im not mistaken, delta dictates how the price change will affect the option. If the stock goes down by $1, the option goes down by delta. Same if the stock goes up. Your theta decay is probably pretty low for an option that far out. Unless you think it's going to keep going down, you're probably best off holding for a while"
03/24/2021,stocks,They were only refuting the point that it’s at an all time high. Ironically you’re the one having trouble reading.
03/24/2021,stocks,It was 68 for 30 seconds. It went up 7% after hours and sank down 8% after 30%
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah... I bought nearly everything at ATHs. I finally had some money to throw in to aside from an investment account.

It hurts to see all the red but long term it won't even matter.. will just take a while to see some profit for me!

03/24/2021,stocks,">In the case of the recent TSLA split, shareholders multiplied their shares 5X and then saw a run up on the split shares. So in essence the could have just sold an equal number of shares that they owned before the split and still have 4 times more shares than they did before.

I still am not sure if I understand. TSLA split 5:1 from $2230 to $446. If $MYETF has 1000 shares of TSLA and I have 1 share of TSLA, post split their TSLA value is the same-- $MYETF has 5000 shares at $2230000 and I have 5 shares at $2230. If the etf doesnt rebalance and I don't touch my shares, I'm still not sure why the split is worse for the ETF holders

>With mergers, again the ETF might see a boost in performance but owning the equities would see a premium paid on the merger and actual ownership in the new company.

I actually know nothing about this so I guess I can't reply, thanks for the info though!

And yeah there's nothing complicated about ETFs. I think it always comes back to the final question: do you think you can outpick the indices? If your answer is no just go ETF!"

Think of the PE expansion for AAPL and MSFT, that’s likely where INTC is headed."
03/24/2021,stocks,tesla was at an all time high all of last year and the year before!! why does it matter if a stock is at ath or not?? it can still go higher. lmfao

03/24/2021,stocks,I'm in a slightly better position. All the money I lost are profits but it still hurts barely breaking even this year when on January 22 I was up over 10k
03/24/2021,stocks,So this seems to be an exceptionally high rate. But the premium is for the potential quick gains I presume? Still cant decided if I want to go into it
03/24/2021,stocks,"The Tesla case is all about flexibility. If you own 1 share of the ETF the share price goes up but you still just have 1 share, so you would either have to hold or sell. Where owning the equity you end up with 5 shares which you could sell one by one, meaning you only part with 20% of your original position.

Often times with acquisitions the acquired company’s share holders get a premium to sweeten the deal. Then of course they get rolled into the new company after the merger. So if you owned Solar City years ago you got a premium and then you ended up with Tesla shares."

03/24/2021,stocks,"> The Tesla case is all about flexibility

Oh yes then 100%. Of course you have close to no flexibility with owning ETFs, especially the boglehead ones like VOO/VTI etc. Again I'd like to reiterate that imo ETFs are a no-brainer if you're subscribing to a boglehead strategy, where you pretty much only put money in and dont adjust holdings. In this situation, obviously flexibility isn't a concern. However, if you're pursuing a more active strategy it doesn't really make sense to use ETFs-- if you think you can beat them yes pick your stocks, swing trade, sell some shares if you want to lock in gains (note, ETFs automatically rebalance as well and VOO was selling TSLA shares on its run up). Not sure if we disagree here, just I still don't see any ETF-specific downsides of a company that goes through a stock split.

> Often times with acquisitions...

Ah yes are you talking merger arbitrage? So it's interesting, in a broad ETF, sure you might miss the premium but it's pretty negligible in the scheme of a broad ETF (VOO has 500+ stocks, I assume if a company's getting acquired it's smaller and probably represents a tiny % of VOO). So yeah I'll give this one up for sure, def a possible downside for ETFs but tbh seems negligible if you're doing a long-term broad ETF strategy"
03/24/2021,stocks,I never do. I know how to value a stock and compare it to the market and peers. INTC is a value play likely to see a huge return in next 3 to 5 years based on its cheap relative valuation and it new LT plan of investment and growth in a world increasingly dependent on semi conductors.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It could certainly get even more repriced than it has.  But it will need to actually solve its many problems, not just announce intentions to change.  Still, having better intentions is a big change over 6 months ago when then we're still in denial.  Time for Intel to show us not tell us."

03/24/2021,stocks," **GME Earnings Analysis and What Is Hidden Below Surface of Report -** 

Tried posting this in WSB but couldn't so posting here. My brain is smooth, but managed to livestream the GME call yesterday. Here's my take, not financial advice, and why I remain 💎🖐 (102 shares @ \~280 + 25 buy today @ 145). All figures I show in this can be found directly from GME press release - 

Listened to many earnings calls in my life. Never had an issue with access until today because it was full. CNBC couldn't even get in, and have never seen this before. Tells me many 🦍 like the stock and are doing their own DD on the investment. Wise 🦍.

During a global pandemic that had new cases and deaths rise to new extremes during the reported quarter, GME managed **same store sales increase 6.5%**. I repeat - During a global pandemic that had new cases and deaths rise to new extremes during the reported quarter, GME managed same store sales increase 6.5%. Think back, US alone was posting >200k new cases every day. This caused a loss of over 25% operating days due to forced store closures. To me, a better way to look at this is daily revenue from operations, rather than the whole quarter to adjust for forced shutdowns. In 2019, there were 92 operating days in the quarter. 2019 Rev - $2.194 Billion/92 days = $23.85 Million/operating day. In 2020, assuming 75% operating days, there were 69 days of operation. 2020 Rev - $2.122 Billion/69 days = $30.75 Million/operating day. **Daily same store sales show a 29% increase** looking at it this way. That is stellar growth. Doesn't seem like a dying business to me.

New console purchases were limited due to supply issues from manufacturers, not GME and certainly not because of demand for the consoles. These are sales that will happen, and will be realized in 2021 and beyond.

**E-commerce sales grew 175%**. That is nearly a triple from 2019 levels. This is the future. This is where Ryan Cohen shines. This is where the company is focusing, and why they're bringing in a new COO and CTO. This is amazon level growth a decade ago. This has shorts terrified. Take a look at the articles published on CNBC and other MSM paid for by HF shills after the report. If the report was unbiased, this would be the headline. Instead, it's buried in the middle of each article where it is least likely to get any attention. I posted last week about GME needing to be valued on a revenue multiple like tech companies are, and getting a revenue multiple comparable to RC lead CHWY (\~5.5x TTM revenue) would give GME a $40 billion value, roughly 600/share. 175% grow makes a 5.5x TTM revenue multiple on the stock very realistic. Like I said at the beginning of this post, I have a smooth brain and accidentally deleted that post, but if you're interested in it message me and I'll share. Jefferies today raised GME price target from 15 to 175 based on higher valuation multiple, and I think more upgrades are coming.

**No Q&A**. This is rare, and I've only seen this happen with innovative tech companies, and NEVER with a retailer. Imagine if Macy's decided to not take questions after earnings. This is probably the most important take away I have from the earnings call, as it shows the leadership team has balls and the transformation of GME is well underway. GME should no longer be valued like a retailer as leadership has clearly shifted their mentality away from being a retail stock.

No mention of capital raise. Debt is not an issue (unlike AMC, although they are in a MUCH better position now than the start of the year). Management isn't selling stock at these prices, why would you. There are reports they have an option to potentially sell stock via Jefferies, but again, nothing stated they are planning on issuing more shares.

**Less can be more.** One of the best strategies to use in negotiation can be silence. This call showed me GME leadership is savvy and understands this. At this point in the game, they don't have to rush anything, and the only people demanding answers now at how they are going to achieve the transformation are shorts because the cost to borrow the stock is so high! 🦍 have faith in RC and the GME team. Time is on the side of the 🦍 and after showing off their 💎🖐 have given GME leadership confidence they don't have to show their cards too soon.

TL/DR - Earnings call discussed #'s required by SEC, and very little beyond that. Shorts trying to attack GME on valuation after report as expected. Report was good, but reading between the lines and understanding the importance of what wasn't said makes it great IMHO. Stay strong my fellow 💎🖐🦍. This is not financial advise."

03/24/2021,stocks,"The other gave the ""conspiracy"" version. I'll give a more sensible one. GME was gamma squeeze when it jumped the second time because it started to go up on news about executive staff mix-ups and possible restructuring. 

All the retail investors who downloaded RH in Jan. bought up calls because options are cheap. They bought so much up and continued to do so as the stock rose in price that the guys selling the calls had to, as one does normally, buy shares to make sure they could meet assignment. 

This caused it to squeeze This is why volume on squeeze days was 40 to 70 milly. 

The dumps that took place that halted traded were from guys who still had shares they needed to meet assignment but were never assigned and so naturally, they sold their shares. BUT the buy market isn't large enough to handle their shares, and so it tanked like that. Now theyve had to sell incrementally as time goes on to ensure they can get an order filled. 

It will continue to trickle down until volatility in the options market subsides and premiums go from thousands of dollars for ITM options to hundreds. Then WSB will need to galvanize everyone around a reason to buy calls again and presto-chango there's another gamma. Whether this is able to happen again on the same stock is yet to be known.

It wasnt DD. Just quick brush over. Seemed cheap bought hundreds of shares and woke up to thousands in losses. Hung in There for 3 days and it just got worse.

03/24/2021,stocks,"As a GME bagholder from the first run, seeing the recent gamma squeeze (likely caused by a hedge fund) was something. My guess is that until the stock hits its fundamental price (sub-$20?), people are still going to FOMO into it on the chance it goes up to $200+ again. GME still lives in it's own world for the time being, and people wanna gamble. (Not me, I threw the rest of my shit into index funds)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I am worried for a lot of people. There's this whole narrative around GME, and the 'other' reddits are full of people claiming to be *delighted* at the falls in price so that they can invest more of their apparently unlimited funds, to become even more of a millionaire when the price rockets to 10k.

Meanwhile plenty of others are like ""I don't care if the price falls, I'm in this for the long haul, it's gonna be worth $500 within 2 years just on the fundamentals""

😬

As of yesterday GME's P/E ratio was 10x that of Apple and 5x that of Amazon. This has the potential to fuck a lot of people up, and I don't really want to see that happen 😕"

I mean, that makes sense? The GME situation has literally never happened before. I just don't see it as a secret code that the stock is shorted over 100%. 

Why wouldn't any of the institutions who are long on the stock (which include BlackRock and Fidelity, who are way bigger than any fund shorting it) put out an analysis that the short interest is way higher than official numbers if it were true? Does it really make sense that every analyst is in the pocket of institutions that are shorting GME,?"

Some of your best lessons will come when you do have real money in stocks and you have to see where you screwed up on trades because of your emotional attachment to a company or to fantasies of large profits, but you should be starting with paper trade to understand the fundamentals of trading and how to evaluate a company.

Summary:

\- Most of the article is about VW (maybe sponsored by VW? :-) )

\- VW become the #1 EV maker in EU last year

\----EV cars sales in EU: Dec 2019: TSLA: 110K , VW 46K;  Dec 2020: TSLA: 96K, VW: 174K

\- VW CEO (Diess) using the same strategy as Musk (creating media hype, ""power day"" similar to ""battery day, etc), stock has gone up 80% ytd, meme stock potential

\- This year, VW plans to deliver 1 million plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles, and Diess aims to surpass Tesla in EV sales no later than 2025. Some analysts predict it will happen much sooner.

\- VW can exploit something Tesla doesn’t have much of yet: scale. Dozens of brands that fill every nook and cranny of the auto market—and sales last year of 9.3 million vehicles (compared to TSLA's 0.5 million).

\- By 2025, VW and its partners will have more than 35,000 public chargers around the world, and planning half a dozen battery factories in EU.

\- VW aims to sell 26 million EVs  in the next 10 years

\- Other legacy auto makers following suit (e.g. GM planning to phase out diesel cars by 2035, Hyundai planning almost two dozen new models, Renualt having a super hit in EU with model Zoe, Ford's Mustang Mach-E)

\- Chinese companies rolling out budget EV models

\- Tons of new companies/SPACs (Rivian, Lucid, etc)

\- Just like netflix that paved the way for streaming video is now facing great competition from ""legacy"" companies like disney, HBO, amazon, etc, TSLA will also face the same struggle with the EV market, specially when the giants like Apple, Amazon, Google have EV ambitions of themselves

\- (maybe positive for TSLA) the biggest automaker in the world Toyota, still not fully committed to EV, and some major automakers like BMW do not think ""only EV after year xxxx"" is a good strategy because there are like 160 countries/markets to consider

&#x200B;

Opinion:

\- would have been nice to get some analysis about the software/AI aspect, as that is one of the main thing that TSLA is way ahead of others and legacy car makers seem to be struggling with

\- Chinese companies barely mentioned (and also aspects such as the recent Chinese rule of not using TSLA cars in military sensitive areas due to the cameras, which may give acceleration to LADAR based cars rather than camera based Evs, and I doubt TSLA will shift to that one..)

&#x200B;

What do you think?

I thin the EV pie is very big and there is room for many. TSLA will be dominant for at least the next few years (maybe until 2025) and then maybe others will catch up if they play their cards right and some politics (like China) plays in their favour.

PS: I don't have a position in TSLA (wanted to get in when it dipped but was waiting for sub 550 which didn't happen). I have small position in VW and Nio.

EDIT 1: Just for the heck of it, I just bought a couple of TSLA at 655.

EDIT 2: added 2 more TSLA at 638.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Well I guess VW has massive capacities and experience in manufacturing cars. And they are widely accepted and have a general good reputation. (German here). If they transform to making EVs, they may benefit from the above mentioned factors."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It'll be interesting to see. 

Thing is, Tesla is in a near-impossible phase right now of developing highly innovative manufacturing and assembly plants that are vertically integrated. If they can get to the stage where this is copy & paste, then the exponential growth of their company will be explosive. The vast majority of companies fail at this, but Tesla has everything available to them to make it happen. 

I don't know the specifics, but I know Sandy Munro (who specializes in specifically this) said that new startup EV manufacturers have a better shot at competing than the legacy ICE ones. He referenced having to retrofit factories and completely swap out their entire supply chain as issues that will cause bankruptcies and mergers. Not entirely sure how the worldwide battery shortage would fit into all of this...

I still think this is an apples-to-oranges comparison. There was a recent survey done here in Canada where they found more than 70% of Canadians planned on buying an EV as their next car. And 83% of that 70% wanted specifically a Tesla. People want Tesla's. They don't want VW EVs. The Mach-E is imo the only good competitor on the market rn."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think what everyone misses when talking about competition for Tesla is that the BEV market was only 2.8% of the entire auto market in 2020. It is forecasted to grow 40-50% every year. Because of this growth, competition is not a threat to Tesla because as there are more cars available, the market grows faster. Tesla is estimated to grow unit sales 60-70% in 2021 and bring on 2 additional factories on top of their existing 2, so 2022 might be another year of really high growth. If Tesla is growing 60-70% while the market is growing 40-50%, then Tesla will GAIN market share, despite “increasing competition”

Anyway, today, Tesla has around 23% of the BEV market. I expect this might increase to around 25% or so and then flat-line or decrease slightly overtime. Either way, I see Tesla owning 20%+ of the BEV market 5 years from now, and the BEV market being around 20% of the global auto market (so Tesla has 4% market share of the global auto market in 2025 and growing quickly over time)."

Doesn't matter if in the near future some manufacturers manage to build technically ""better"" EVs the same way it doesn't always matter that Apple competitors make ""better"" phones.

If Tesla places itself as the EV status symbol for the masses and EVs are increasingly perceived as a way of life more than just a piece of tech, they might just keep dominating."

Ark invest had robo taxis as a higher trend for Tesla in its report. See the fact is wether you love or hate Musk you have to agree that he is an innovator. I mean sure the stock is all hyped but he sort of engineered the way for new breakthroughs in cars and rockets 🚀. I remember thinking g about space x and being like yea he is never gonna succeed and well that’s history now. There will be multiple players and winners in the market because Tesla alone may never be able to keep up with the demand but it is still ahead of the others. Just another though about Tesla would be that great companies are always run by great visionaries. For the longest time I remember stock market pundits criticized Amazon for not making a profit etc etc, but man looking back now you can see the giant Bezos created. Musk is of similar caliber from an innovator point of view and with them you never know what is planned for the future. In all honesty I would rather be invested in an innovator who tries to change the world"

03/24/2021,stocks,"when will people begin to realize that Tesla extends far above EV production? Tesla is far ahead in proprietary technology including their charging, batteries, and most important of all, their enormous network of cars training their automated driving AI.

03/24/2021,stocks,"The same type of argument has been used for ages on iPhone. Every time competition makes an announcement, media would jump and say the iPhone Killa is here. 

Just stop. 

It only takes a second of research to understand many of ID3 and ID4 sales were bought by VW dealers to artificially boost the sales number to increase VW's EV credit. This is also why ID3 numbers dropped off the cliff in January and February for no apparent reason. 

The only viable VW EV model is ID3 and ID4. They are better than gas cars but not close to Model 3 and Model Y. 

VW is doing many necessary things to transition and they are on the right track. Of all the major automakers, VW has the best chance to grab a large chunk of EV marketshare. But no, Tesla is not losing market dominance."
03/24/2021,stocks,"full disclosure first, I'm probably a tesla bias, and my portfolio is 50% tsla. TLDR at bottom.

I have zero interest to invest in a car company. Car companies are like many other commodity companies, it always runs on high operating cost and limited profit margin. It takes billions to make a factory, renewing/changing a production line cost tens of millions, the business only works if you are able to sell every car you make right away, as cars will depreciate in value as it just sits there.

I wouldn't invest in airlines or restaurant chains, for the same reason. profits are limited and the risks associated with it are too high for its reward.

So why did I invest in tesla? making cars is not a lucrative business, but **transportation** is. Tesla is a disruptive company that literally got a foot in every transportation sector.

Gas- tesla solar/electricity/gambit energy (cheaper in long run, and electricity is hella cheap already)

Insurance - tesla insurance. At places where people can get tesla insurance is literally cheaper than any other insurance.

Driver- auto pilot  /FSD, still in Beta/limited access. I know, I know. Just give it a bit of time.

As other ones here have pointed out, making an electric car is actually vastly different from making a gas car, even though they look the same on the outside. Tesla is making new factories and they are planning to make very good use of vertical integration.

Here's another way to look at it. When google or facebook want you to become a user, they offer it for free, because they can make X number of dollars off of you, by collecting your data to sell, or use ads, etc. Pretty simple concept, my grandmother may not understand this but everyone here can.

Tesla will let you become a usher for 37K at the cheapest, with them making \~30% margin on it, and they will collect your driving data to further improve their FSD neural network, offer even cheaper tesla insurance, and all to just sell those right back to our fat asses.

Remember that scene in the facebook movie, the social network, when the facebook office cheered when they hit 1 million users? tesla got 1 million cars on the road by end of 2020, will have 2 million cars on the road probably 2022 end of Q1.

A lot of the points I made here is very over simplified, as I dont want to turn this in to an essay, and Im also aware of the risk/obstacles they have as well.

I am definitely a tesla fan boy but Im always open to have a friendly debate and hear from tesla bears. Dont want to have rose colored glasses on all the time.

TLDR:  Other companies make cars to sell it on the spot for instant profit, Tesla's cars will make way more $$ and they have tons of operation going on."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tesla the company will continue to grow, and TSLA the stock is about to get in a big, smoldering wreck.

Somewhere between VW, GM, BMW, Porsche, China EVs, and the new fleet of EV SPACs, TSLA about to get it's lunch eaten and fall down to a more fair valuation. 

These kids really thought BMW, GM, Toyota etc would dominate the automobile industry for over a century in some cases and then just roll over and die for Tesla."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is article is an example of the saying ""figures never lie, but liars always figure"".

A few key things make this a lot less grim looking for Tesla then the author and others here seem to realize.

* Tesla was flat out never going to retain the 80% market share of the EV market in even the best case scenario. Their competitors would literally have had to make zero EV's for them to do that. Even ARK invest doesn't put their market share above 30% with their ultra bullish projections.

* What matters to Tesla and their bottom line **isn't** the share of the EV market, it's their share of the auto market, which is continuing to rapidly grow even as the percentage of their share of the growing EV market shrinks.

* Just because VW sells more EV's **does not** mean VW is growing. VW and other legacy automakers need to cannibalize their still profitable ICE car segment to shift into EV's, and if they don't then Tesla and others will cannibalize it for them. So don't look at VW's EV sale numbers and think they're automatically growing a ton.

* Europeans are heavily loyal to European automakers, much more so then Americans are to American automakers. And VW's sales of their EV's are almost all concentrated in Europe, their easiest market where the government is pushing more heavily for an EV transition. So of course they're selling well there, and yet Tesla is still selling plenty of EV's in Europe against that tough competition and tough brand loyalty. But VW has yet to offer their successful ID3 in the US. Why? Because imo VW knows their sales will likely be extremely disappointing to investors. A lot of moderately successful EV's in Europe have failed miserably in the US, such as the E-Tron. A lot of European EV's haven't been coming to the US after the E-Tron's complete and utter failure in the US markets.

And I'm not even getting into other areas like software, or how Tesla still has to build more factories to pump up millions of cars a year whereas VW already has a bunch of factories they can just retool."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Potentially a silly question: are charging stations compatible with all brands? 

I.E: do the charging stations built by Tesla work for VW and vice versa?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have read other articles about VW's investment into the EV market. This isn't the only author that thinks VW will become the number one EV manufacturer within five years.  And no, this isn't sponsored by VW.  I don't have a strong opinion on whether this author is right or not, but I'm just saying that some experts in the automotive industry are inclined to agree."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like the idea of Tesla having a solid competitor. I think the design and cult following of VW is their biggest advantage. But VW doesn’t have the time to focus on EV and innovation like Tesla does. Elon is trying to reimagine the entire electrical grid and manufacturing process while  VW is just making EV cars and trying to retrofit old technology/factories. I highly doubt that the trajectory of VW as a company is an apples to apples comparison with Tesla. 

When electricity becomes more expensive (demand constantly increasing), Tesla will be there with their full package: car, solar, batteries, insurance, supercharging network, and constant improvements through downloads etc. Plus now I’m saving money on electricity.

If I buy a VW EV I’m just like any other EV searching for working charging stations and spending my times finding 3rd party systems. Plus stealership woes."
03/24/2021,stocks,Who would want to drive a VW 🤮
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's not to say that Tesla won't be around in 20 years and doing well, but it's issues like this that put the current stock price into perspective. The current market cap is for a company with a completely unopposed, risk-free run at the ev space. 

I get that some of you love Tesla and think any of it's stock under $1000 is a bargain, but the future dominance is not guaranteed. You really need to demand a lower price to make the risk worth it. Lower than $500. 

Tesla is not Amazon in 1990s, it's netflix in 2014 with a headstart on the legacy TV industry"
03/24/2021,stocks,"A key selling point of the TSLA isn't just that it's an EV - we have had many EV's prior to TSLA, but the portfolio of features it brings:

* Charging at home, on a 110V results in 2-3 miles/hr
* Charging at home, on a 230V at 30A results in 20-25 miles/hr
* Charging at a Supercharger results in 200-300 miles/hr

Does VW have that sort of infrastructure?  I think the answer is obvious.

How about we look at other features, such as the TACC (Traffic Aware Cruise Control) and even the FSD/Auto-pilot?

* No, no driver convenience features noted in C&D

Then we look at the price, approximately 35K Euros, which at a 1.18 : $1 exchange rate, is about $40,000 or the same as the TSLA Model 3.  

Then we have to look at the size of the vehicle, with the engine placement in the trunk (traditional) there is a bit of space that is lost as well.

So understanding the differences, and what you get starts to matter.  For example, our police in the US typically push Ford cruisers and SUVs.  Getting the motorcycle units to switch from HDs to BMWs was a stretch.  It can be a great many of those purchases went to ""domestic"" (aka Government) buyers who are mandated to buy not the best, but that which is locally sourced."
03/24/2021,stocks,I wonder if VW is going to lie about their EV emissions
03/24/2021,stocks,No because 1. Batteries and 2. Software.
03/24/2021,stocks,"First of all, the dominance of Tesla when it comes to selling EVs will get diluted this year. Volkswagen alone will sell nearly as many EVs as Tesla. The market shares is declining rapidly in all major markets and it does seem that Tesla struggles to grow this quarter. The Berlin factory is delayed (even tough Elon would not admit it): they have HUGE problems finding managers and engineers for the factory (about 2/3 of high quality jobs are still uncovered). They have not started training in the factory, they have not started prototype building in the factory. The chance of start of mass production in the summer is equal to zero.

&#x200B;

Second point is software: FSD is only a driving assistance system and will remain that in the near future according to Tesla themselves. Much of it is just hype and marketing. There are about 7 firms who have serious ambitions of building autonomous vehicles, Tesla is not among them. Tesla has not driven a single mile as Level 3/4/5 system, whereas GM, Waymo, Bosch/Daimler etc do about 500k FULLY autonomous miles per year."
03/24/2021,stocks,"VW group will slaughter Tesla this year when it comes to EV sales, at least in Europe.

In related news, Financial Times published recently a scathing opinion piece on ARK's price targets for Tesla. Some snips:

> ARK forecasts that Tesla’s almost non-existent insurance business could generate revenues of $6bn by 2025, with 40 per cent operating margins, more than three times the margins of auto insurance heavy weight Progressive.
> Somehow, we are led to believe, it might manage to do this without having to meet the regulatory capital requirements that are de facto part of the business. In fact, ARK doesn’t even think the company will need to raise equity at all in the next five years, despite it modelling production of 10.6m cars in 2025 — almost 21 times 2020’s run rate. Then there’s the simple discrepancy that, for some reason, Tesla’s cost of debt in the bull case is 8 per cent, double the cost in its bear case. Oh, and ARK’s 2025 share count is plugged in at 964m, more than 100 million shares below Tesla’s current fully diluted share count of 1.08bn according to its latest 10-K. You might also spot ARK has Tesla’s working capital requirement remaining flat at $12.5bn over the next five years, even as it forecasts its electric vehicle revenues to grow from $26bn to $367bn.

Their overall point was that the analysis is aimed to baiting retail who doesn't know better.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Honestly I think people are still just as clueless as ever on Tesla. Every year for years FUD is being put out there.

2. Every company transitioning to the EV space will do well as long as they have a product that people want.

Singing the doom of a pioneer in an up and coming technology space is so mind numbingly dumb. Tesla has a lot of room to grow, and having established competitors chasing them in the EV space is a good sign for the auto industry in general. 

Increasing competition is a great sign for the EV sector. Barring something catastrophic, Tesla is a net beneficiary of the world and the auto industry moving towards electrification."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Honestly think VW could crush Tesla and Nio etc. if they get their house in order. Years of experience in the car market, they just need to change their approach and they will be in a much better production position than the new EV builders.

The primary issue with Tesla is that the finish and attention to detail on the interior is shoddy at best, you pay a lot of money for something that has parts which scuff / aren't fitted snuggly on the inside. Then you look at VW which have superior interior finishes and years more experience in the industry. 

Yes it will take them time to adapt their approach (as they are huge) but when they do, their production capacity and experience will come into play resulting in the Tesla price nose diving IMO."

Now I understand all these problems I listed apply to ICE cars but god have mercy on the people that buy a electric VW. I'm not a crazy Tesla bull or anything I just think VW should stay in their lane, and their lane is in the dumpster."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Both cars are crap imo. EV are not worth it. They are too expensive for what you get, and even if you take great care the battery doesn't last more than ICE cars. Hybrid or LPG/CNG are better imo. EV are Prius cars without the ICE engine. Tesla FSD is just hype, cameras are not reliable sensors. EV market grew just because of hype and subsidies"
03/24/2021,stocks,Because vw is a conglomerate of 12 companies. They have no autonomous potential. Tesla is leaps and bounds ahead of everyone.
03/24/2021,stocks,I think we are also missing out on how resource allocations can also be a major key in being successful in the ev market.

of course their dominance is going to be less and less since there are a million more players in the game..this isn't bad or anything..their sales will continue to improve year by year.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I think AI tech won’t help Tesla as much as one may think.  Maybe people still enjoy driving, and have no issues with the current sweet of safety features so fancy shmancy AI that costs a butt load isn’t appealing to many. Especially northern markets where winter storms will mess everything up.  

If VW can build an electric Jetta for business people it’ll sell like crazy.  

Fords electric F-150 will definitely be popular as most truck owners don’t want what cybertruck is selling.  

Tesla corners the market now,  and may continue to corner the battery market until new battery tech comes out, but they won’t corner the EV market beyond legacy manufacturers releasing their serious attempts."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Tesla reinvent car manufacturing and they will keep innovating. Unless older firms can copy Tesla or invent something even better they will always have worse margins. True profits matter more than market share. Apple has 20% market share but 80% profits. VW and the likes are welcome to sell 100M EVs at loss.
Software is as important as hardware in EVs. Europeans suck at software, they just do. At least Ford and GM can buy new start ups.
Tesla does not need robotaxi which I personally think is a pipe dream. They only need to make FSD good enough that people will pay for it, and most will. Self driving is the ultimate luxury, not how pretty the stiches are on the interior."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Your Tesla and Netflix comparison has some similarities but also many difference from each other.


Similarities:

- They both started and are leaders in their section. Netflix w/ streaming and Tesla w/ EVs.

But that's where the similarities ends. Tesla in the EV space is the same as the other ""legacy"" companies in the streaming space that you mentioned such as Disney and Amazon.

Why? Because Tesla does NOT only do EVs, unlike Netflix where they seem to ONLY do streaming services.

Tesla is in many other spaces just like Disney and Amazon is as well. They do not only focus in only one space. In the auto business, the ""legacy"" ICE companies only focus on making vehicles just like Netflix only focus on their streaming service.

What other services does Tesla provides that legacy ICE companies might not?

Solar (Solar panels & solar roofs):

- Tesla's solar business slowed down because of the Model 3, they had to get their solar workers to help build Model 3s instead of solar. But now they are starting to focus more on the solar business as well with the solar roof expanding into more regions. Once Tesla solar roofs is in every state, and there are many more roofing companies trained to install them, their price will slowly decrease and be much more appealing compared to installing solar panels over existing roofs. But even then if someone does want to do that, Tesla also has one of the best solar panels as well.

Battery storage:

- Texas showed us why we need solar and battery storage. Many businesses are buying huge Mega packs of batteries from Tesla. Residential homeowners are also buying Tesla powerwalls.

Insurance:

- Tesla has their own insurance now, but so far it seems to be only in California. That means their insirance business still has a huge room for growth as it expands to other states and countries where they sell Teslas.

No dealerships:

- Consumer buys directly from Tesla, no middlemen needed to increase prices so they can make their own profits as well, in which every other legacy companies have to deal with and cut into their margins.

No advertisements:

- Tesla spends $0 on advertising. They know that anyone buying an EV will be people who uses the internet. Basically anyone who uses the internet knows what Tesla is. https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/tesla-spent-0-ad-money-per-vehicle-sold-2019-vs-hyundai-2k-lincoln-1-9k-jaguar-1-5k This link shows that some Legacy auto maker spends $1.5-2k per car on advertising. Advertising, dealerships and probably having to license out software such as self driving from companies like Google will all greatly eat into their margins. When Tesla is making EVs at the same price as them, those extra costs that Legacy automakers have to do will allow for Tesla to have an edge on them for competitive pricing while most likely having larger margins.

Factories designed for EVs:

- Legacy auto makers will have to spend a lot of money to convert their ICE making factories into EV factories. Tesla already has 2 more giga factories being built to increase their production. And it seems that everything Tesla makes is getting sold out, so their problem right now is not enough factories.

EV in every category:

- By 2025 Tesla will most likely have their Semis, pick-up trucks and new roadster available. They might also have their cheap ""hatchback"" $25k model by then as well. So far there isn't any other company that has an EV in as much categories that Tesla does.

Self-driving:

- Yes there are some companies working on self-driving as well, like Google Waymo. But they don't make cars, so big legacy companies that aren't working on self-driving will have to license that from other companies like Google or even from Tesla as well. This will eat into their costs, same as having to deal with dealerships.

Data:

- Tesla has collected tons of data. They have many cars in beta FSD testing collecting even more data for them to keep enhancing their FSD.

Superchargers:

- Tesla is basically selling EVs and also their own ""gas station"" as well with superchargers in many locations and only expanding. Have you ever seen a ""Ford"" or a ""GM"" gas station? Cause I have not. 

Which other Legacy auto maker can say that they are also in all that space such as Tesla?"
03/24/2021,stocks,The VW group is busy making cars with fancy little bullshit parts made out of plastic that utterly fail and cost a fortune. When it comes to competing with Tesla I expect Toyota to kick VW’s ass.

03/24/2021,stocks,">Companies like BMW don't think ""only EV after year 2xxx"" is a good strategy because there are 160 countries to consider.

That's such a stupid mindset though. The only markets where EVs won't be successful are low income and developing countries which either don't have the infrastructure or the money for an EV. BMW doesn't have any affordable/budget models and most of their cars are made for paved roads. Both things mean that these same markets don't buy brand new petrol powered BMWs.

There's literally no market that will reduce BMW's revenue if they switched to EV only, especially if they do it after 2030 like most others as by then people will be even more welcoming of this tech."

03/24/2021,stocks,Not even close by 2025. Once giga Berlin is up they wont be number 1 over there anymore. This post is dumb. They couldnt even source the batteries to keep up with Teslas full EV numbers.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I've been saying this for a long time. Tesla is irrelevant. The move to EVs was coming with or without Tesla. Sure, Tesla can be credited with speeding this process a few years. Eventually Tesla will be bought up by a real car maker such as VW or Toyota and we will get a few models with the brand Toyota Tesla or VW Tesla and that will be their legacy.

Another thing is that EVs are not something ground breaking, it's literally a 100 year old technology. It's not going to change anything about society. It's not even a new market. Just the same old car market just with a different type of engine. So the whole hype around EVs is kind of silly. So now people will sometimes choose a car with an electric motor instead of Internal combustion Engine, so what? It's irrelevant for stocks. The same old car manufacturers will dominate regardless, they don't care if they sell ICE car or EV. Making EVs is a lot easier then ICE. They also require far fewer parts so they will lay off a lot of workers."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Hmm honestly OP based on the comments i think you are under looking Tesla’s tech. 
It’ll take years before other car makers will catch up a little tech wise.

Og course they will catch up, but they will never be able to fully position themselves as a true EV company like Tesla or Lucid Motors. IMO the new pioneer EV's can position themselves favourably over the old school marks and disrupt the auto industry permanently."

03/24/2021,stocks,"FUD against tesla, they promoted a news article about the failure to sew FUD in tesla to make call options over longer periods easier to get into due to the lower band and it gave them the ability to long while shorting it.

03/24/2021,stocks,"This is a signal to buy Tesla. 

Feels like 2016-2019, when every single news article about Tesla was negative.

Back then it was “EVs would never become a thing”.  Now that they *are* a thing, the story is that “Tesla is going to be outcompeted by VW”.  

It’s actually an easier thesis now than then. If you think Tesla can outcompete VW, then just buy their stock. Sure, the VW gang will have their supporters, just like the Android gang has their hard core supporters."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Why does it matter EV car sales numbers? What matters is TOTAL car sales. Tesla and china, even if they under perform expectation, are going to eat a big portion of the market that would had gone to legacy carmakers.

There is a reason VW and others were very stubborn and took this long to transition. EV cars are a worse product to sell for them. Lower margins. Lower cost of service and maintenance.

The stock pumps when they announce 6 new factories. All is see is the billions they will have to spent just to sell a similar product. The only way VW manages to sell more cars than 2019 is if they cannibalize other legacy carmakers. Which might happen. 

Not to mention the ongoing trend of working from home or the looming apocalypse that are robotaxis. But hey, stocks only go up am I right."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Zzzz.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Similar ends between ICE and EV is a car with four wheels.  The motor, battery, and software to drive the system is completely different.  Battery is the primary constraint and VW goal from battery day for 2025 is not ambitious enough.  It takes 15-20 years to develop a mine.   

The less understood disruption is Telsa’s energy business.  As we transition to EV, no one is pivoting towards the demand that is coming for charging stations.  The government incentives are in place for the SWB (solar wind battery) to be deployed in small home and big grid scale.  Imho, 

Tesla is an energy company but they happen to deploy that technology to cars first.  Amazon is logistics company but started selling books and music first."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I disagree with the good reputation as a German. They have good marketing and most of the people are buying a Golf or a Polo because they are familiar with them. But there are more reliable and cheaper manufacturers out there. The reputation is based on the biased opinion - but not based on actual results.

The currently released ID.3 is a car in its beta phase. The developed operating system wasn't functional at release and I think there are missing some features. Think about it: A company as big and experienced as VW needs to release its flag ship for EV in a beta status. The Skoda Enyak is better than the ID.3 in nearly every technological aspect and costs the same. Skoda is a doughter company of VW, but it is not VW itself. Skoda delivered the flag ship.

They are currently running (driving?) behind Teslas ideas. They could have the benefit of manufacturing experience and infrastructure - but they failed to use them in the last five years. Imagine this: You are a German and want to buy a EV. You have 50k to spend. If VW was successful, you would look for a VW (or Skoda, Audi or XYZ) because you are familiar with the brand. But instead most Germans are thinking about a Tesla when the consider buying an EV. Not a Polo. Not a Golf. Tesla. 

And that is the main failure of VW. I wouldn't say it is their downfall (VW is way to big), but it is a missed opportunity. Their current strategy is to close the technology gap and to talk dirt about Tesla."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah ask a mechanic what they think of VW.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Don't know why people were ignoring this for the last half decade - why are we discounting legacy ICE car manufacturers on pivoting to EV? Because VW/GM's didn't pioneer the idea of EVs? 

They've been making cars for over a century, and have figured out how to do so cheaply and efficiently (and they've already spent the capex for the physical assets they'd need to do so and built out the marketing and supply chain networks to cover the intangible assets they'd need to compete with TSLA too). Just because they don't have a huge fandom/following at the CEO-level doesn't make these guys  poor investment opportunity - if anything, it signals that the market is behaving inefficiently and underpricing that notion."
03/24/2021,stocks,These days German auto manufacturers makes some of the most unreliable cars out there that’s why they been placing bottom of the reliability for past few years.

I still think the day that a EV Corolla and EV Civic are announced with mostly the same body/chassis as the existing cars for $15-20k less than a Model 3, Tesla is dead in the water.

People want tesla right now because they are sexy (not where I live in the Bay though, there is actually a ""model 3/S is overplayed"" sentiment growing, since they are as common as Camry's here...). But taking out $20k less on your auto loan for a family with two kids is infintely more sexy than a tesla with a fancy screen and door handles."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> Tesla is in a near-impossible phase right now of developing highly innovative manufacturing and assembly plants that are vertically integrated. If they can get to the stage where this is copy & paste, then the exponential growth of their company will be explosive.

Bingo. The factory is the real product. Auto and battery factories.

Fremont was a prototype and a shit-show. Nevada, a 1.0 battery factory. China, 1.0 auto. Berlin and Austin? 1.1? 2.0? Because they'll have all the lessons learned from the already much more successful Shanghai factory and be producing cells on site."

03/24/2021,stocks,"You're misrepresenting the survey:

[KPMG Survey](https://home.kpmg/ca/en/home/media/press-releases/2021/02/electric-vehicles-to-make-up-majority-of-new-car-purchases.html)

Key points:

* Those in the market for an EV said they plan to buy: Toyota (23 per cent), Tesla (19 per cent); and Honda (9 per cent) -  **not 83% Tesla**
* It's a survey of 2000 people done using an online platform, we can assume this biases towards tech-literate people
* Of those 2000 people, about 1200 plan to buy a new vehicle in the next 5 years
* Of those 1200, 68%/800 are likely to buy a **BEV or Hybrid**; I'll note that hybrid demand is projected to increase much faster than BEV due to range, cost, reliability, cold weather performance and charging infrastructure concerns with BEV (\~20% market share by 2027, 30% by 2032)
* Of those 800, 42% will spend up to $50k on a BEV/hybrid, 20% up to $75k, and 31% want to spend less than $30k; so **roughly 1 in 3 people in the market for a BEV/HEV want a car for a price that isn't realistic**
* Of the 2000 surveyed; 1400 want tax or other incentives to purchase BEV/HEV which were dropped by Ontario so we're not likely to see those again, 1300 have concerns about reliability in cold weather, and 1500 people want a minimum of 400km range on a full battery which again suggests they will be disappointed with the options as this is the upper limit of BEV range in optimal conditions; note that range of a BEV in -20 deg C weather is about 50% of optimal range.

It's a survey, it shows there is strong interest in BEV/HEC vehicles but my opinion is many of these people haven't seriously looked at currently available options and when it comes to the actual purchase, far fewer than 7 in 10 will be able to stomach to $10k+ higher cost of ownership of BEV/HEV."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Exactly, competition grows markets and if well positioned your own market share.

03/24/2021,stocks,The thing is electric cars are making a shift to where even normal gas car owners can consider them so the Model S isn't even in this conversation.

They may make the vehicles, which they are.  They certainly are not at the level of performance that their existing cars are or maybe even what current EVs are from Tesla.

Very few big companies successfully ""fought back"" and won. Most just hang on, slowly lose their dominance, and move into more conservative areas like government and enterprise contracts.

Broad historical statements like this aren't much practical benefit anyway. I'd rather look at the specific companies and industry.

One general lesson, though, is that incumbents suffer the innovator's dilemma. Older companies copying things like Battery Day usually ends in a cringey, confusing, performance. Surface level copycatting without the heart and substance. It simply doesn't gel with their culture and there's resistance throughout the whole company.

I don't doubt VW could do well, but it's an uphill battle that won't be achieved by staying three steps behind Tesla."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Thats the big mistake: Tesla is not far ahead in batteries: and if so, it is not relevant as the range is not that far better as the 5 yEArS AhEAd narrative claims. Tesla buys the cells from the same companies as all others do. An the AI training FSD is a marketing gag. It is just a driving assistance system. There are worlds between Leven 2 and Level 4 (what all other companies do). You can't just collect data and improve until you are at level 4, it will not work that way."

03/24/2021,stocks,This. I don’t see any reasonable person saying that iPhone is a failure because it only has 20ish% market share globally.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep, that's exactly right.

> Just because VW sells more EV's does not mean VW is growing. VW and other legacy automakers need to cannibalize their still profitable ICE car segment to shift into EV's, and if they don't then Tesla and others will cannibalize it for them. So don't look at VW's EV sale numbers and think they're automatically growing a ton.

And even worse than replacing their highly profitable cars for less profitable cars is the fact that EVs are not even profitable yet for most of these automakers AT ALL, and will heavily impact their high margin revenues from service in the long run. They are literally investing heavily to earn less money, just because they'll go bankrupt if they don't (and a lot of them still will)."
03/24/2021,stocks,Tesla’s chargers are only for their cars. Others work for all cars
03/24/2021,stocks,"In short: Yes, but it depends on your charger connection.

Slightly longer answer: Tesla cars can charge everywhere, although outside of Europe they might need an extra cable to do so. Other cars can't use Tesla's network because they don't want to pay Tesla to use them. Tesla is open to allowing other manufacturers to use their chargers and some smaller companies are already doing so, but the large carmakers don't want to pay their competition even more than they already are with the regulatory credits."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not really, Tesla has proprietary adapters that are plug and play. You can buy adapters to work on a Tesla station but it’s a hassle.

03/24/2021,stocks,"This is my issue with the very bullish case on Tesla. The “castles in the sky” theorising is being taken to another level. The fact Tesla has pioneered in the EV space and Musk is a successful innovator is being taken to mean Tesla will not only be first to market in multiple sectors, but then dominate those sectors. 

As noted by the FT, that seems to be the argument, no matter how unrealistic. Self-driving cars might be something Tesla innovate and lead the market in, but it’s being priced in as though that’s definite, and happening in less than 5 years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> VW group will slaughter Tesla this year when it comes to EV sales, at least in Europe.

Lol, not even VW thinks they'll get anywhere close. Their target is roughly half of what Tesla sells. What makes you think they'll sell over a million EVs? (even though I wouldn't even call 1 million vs 800.000-1.000.000 ""slaughter"")"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Part of the problem is that in some countries it's impossible to get a Tesla. Many countries in Eastern Europe  for example have some incentives for EV (10k euro in Romania for example) but the closest Tesla dealership/service is in Vienna. So good luck with that, while if you drive 50 km from anywhere you'll find some sort of VW group dealership (VW, Skoda, Seat etc.)"

03/24/2021,stocks,AI requires data. Which gives Tesla a big advantage over their competition. Where is Google or Microsoft going to gather their driving data from?
03/24/2021,stocks,"They will but developing a self driving AI is going to be neither cheap nor easy. Tesla has had a massive number of beta users for years with a concentration of engineering talent and they aren’t even there yet. 

Short term, geofenced lidar solutions such as Waymo or Cruise(not the one in Cadillacs) are going to be the main competition. Longer term, general solutions are probably going to be at least 2-4 years behind Tesla. Maybe more. 

I think the end game is going to resemble Apple vs. Android...only Apple might actually be the Android depending on how their auto stuff is going."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This. Idk if it'll necessarily be the original ICE OEM's that take over, I think it'll come down to whoever can get new EV's down to a reasonable entry level price point, ""The People's EV"" per se. The lowest cost new EV available at least here in the US is the Mini Cooper SE at $30k, and that's probably without options thrown in. If like Tesla or VW or Toyota can finally crack something out around $20k, watch out."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think for a lot of people the put-off starts with comments like this one. Most people do not talk about companies in this way; and most companies are not talked about in this way because those dark times are usually nothing to bank on.

03/24/2021,stocks,"> Singing the doom of a pioneer in an up and coming technology space is so mind numbingly dumb.

It's not about doom, it's about the possibility that Tesla ends up one of many competitors in the EV space rather than the market leader. At the current price point Tesla needs to become more than that, especially if you're forecasting more price jumps in the future like Cathie Wood does."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Getting their house in order will be the expensive part. I don't think it's about the competition with Tesla and Nio to be successful in the EV space.

""Just changing their approach"" would require this...

Selling EVs will be at the expense of selling their of current ICE vehicles. EVs will be money losers for VW for a couple years, and will be canibalizing their profitable ICE vehicles. Double bad. Now add the cost of buying all new machinery and tooling for EVs, then having to write off assets for their ICE vehicles. Double bad. Now consider the dealership model, which I believe will be the largest hurdle to becomes a successful EV business. Dealerships make money from servicing vehicles, not selling them. EVs have minimal maintenance relative to ICE vehicles. Dealerships will push back hard and wont be incentivized to sell EVs over the equivalent ICE."

His fraudulent claim of private funding saved Tesla from bankruptcy, but I'm not going to praise him just because crime pays. He tried having a safety whistleblower killed.  He's tried ruining journalists. His personal engineering knowledge is sub-high school level, and his rocket science knowledge is even less.  Tesla is being successful because of quiet, educated, competent people behind the scenes, when they can avoid his antics and get work done.  In many ways he's like Zuck, a sociopath figurehead who has been rescued by loads of other people's money being used to hire unknown experts behind the scenes.

He's a showman, but the company runs best when he's off distracted with trying to destroy innocent people's lives or playing with flamethrowers.  He's objectively a bad human, and being made the richest man on earth probably isn't going to improve his personality.  The good news is that Tesla adds more people, his influence will continue to be diluted.  He can be the mascot forever, but he has right managing anything with people or technology.  He can stick to sales, where the bar for truth and integrity is lower."

 A quick googling shows that vehicles amounted to about 35% of the global oil consumption. EV adoption will thus lead to a huge drop in the demand for oil. Several giant companies may disappear unless they real get their acts together very soon. Several countries that are very/completely dependent on oil will be hit hard, etc...

**Impact on electricity generation**

As of Feb 2021, for US, electricty generation  ([https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3#:\~:text=About%2060%25%20of%20this%20electricity,was%20from%20renewable%20energy%20sources](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3#:~:text=About%2060%25%20of%20this%20electricity,was%20from%20renewable%20energy%20sources).)

Coal: 19.3%

Petroleum: 0.4%

Other gases: 0.3%

(Fossil fuel total: 60.3%)

Nuclear: 19.7%

Renewable: 19.  

The same sentiment of sustainability that is driving the EV adoption will also lead to the decrease in using Fossil fuel for electricity generation... so more focus on renewables and nuclear

03/24/2021,stocks,that emissions scandal was so long ago that it has no effects on VW today. Bringing that up is like beating a dead horse.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same with Ford in the US. People love Ford, and have plenty of good reason to, but in the US they have been lagging behind Japanese and European brands in certain market segments for decades to the point where Ford just straight up stopped making sedans, and only sell one model of crossover. Brand loyalty and familiarity only go so far.

And with Giga Berlin scheduled to open by summer, cost and wait times can go down and maybe even match VW. Meanwhile VW and the rest of the market for that matter, is anywhere from 2-5 years behind on battery efficiency, specs, and self driving capabilities. They're doing some amazing catchup and that deserves respect, but Tesla skeptics sound a lot like apple skeptics especially from the mid 2010's and post Jobs, who thought that every year the new iphone or mac will mark the start of the decline of apple."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Well, the pricing here is not actually true.

ID.3 Pro S Tour 4 (jesus), jacked up with additions to the tits is 215k PLN (Polish Zloty), while Enyaq IV 80 with decent configuration is about 250k.

It's still cheaper, but there's roughly 15% between the two, and the latter is a SUV.

Over 50k USD for a glorified Golf is quite a lot. Enyaq is also the most expensive car Skoda has made to date. This won't be the popular family car, because their other models, like the massive Kodiaq with a TSI engine cost half of that and are arguably bigger. 

250k PLN is also a price you can pay for a decent Tesla Model 3. The ID.3 is still cheaper than TM3, but the latter is better equipped, has better performance and is somewhat larger.

My prediction though is that VW will get more proficient with making EVs faster than Tesla will get more proficient with making cars (we're talking anything that is not software/drivetrain). They already had some fitting issues and so on. VW has been at it for decades.

After launching Enyaq, I have no idea where ID.4 should stand. Suprisingly it's cheaper, but Skoda seems to have an upper hand over the parent company with regards to everything else."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Then toyota and honda are to have to figure out how to make batteries at 1/3 the price they can get them for right now. And if everyone wants them, supply and demand says that going to the market for cells is a bad idea. 

You're describing a pipe dream with no plan to get there. Tesla will do it 1st within the next 2-3 years tops. A respectable range, safe, $25k car that will crush the 20k market segment when you factor cost of ownership in and not just the car payment."

I don’t think you guys realize cars and batteries aren’t like software they don’t run on a Moore’s law curve. He has no advantage.

03/24/2021,stocks,">31% want to spend less than $30k

Then they'll be pleased to know the '$25k car' will be here before then.

Also "" stomach to $10k+ higher cost of ownership of BEV""

I think you mean 'purchase of a BEV'. There's a thing called the 'Tesla stretch' where people expand their original budget because overall cost of ownership when you take per mile maintenance and fuel into account leaves more monthly money for that car payment."
03/24/2021,stocks,It is literally the same exact motor. There are 0 differences (so far) between EV's. Even their main brands attempt to have some slight differences with how an engine is built for a specific car.
03/24/2021,stocks,"What I was going for was that a heavy duty pick up can have a v8 or sometimes a v10 in it that is tuned for torque, they are going to be marketing pick ups, sedans, vans, and suvs all on the same motor/battery pack"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I drive my parents Model 3 alot.

You realize how cheaply built the car is on a windy day going 80mph on the highway.

I peeked around the car for a good minute to see if I maybe left a door open or the window.

Nope the loud fucking wind noise is just due to how cheap/poor the weather stripping on the vehicle is. My Nissan Leaf is quieter on the highway."
03/24/2021,stocks,True that does remain to be seen. I think a lot of reasearch suggested that accidents by human error are much higher than autonomous cars. But again there is an element of luck involved. But even with that in mind I believe Tesla also has branding power. Think Apple and the rest. Samsung is still great but Apple demands a higher brand value than the others. So again Tesla wins in that category.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think we’ll see self driving in the big truck/semi world before we see it mainstream on cars. That’s how adaptive cruise control started. The trucking industry is short drivers, and computers don’t show up late, quit, or get tired. 

Once there is an economic advantage we will see it there. The court of public opinion won’t be nearly as big as a hurdle there."

03/24/2021,stocks,Tesla is really really really far away from Level 5.
03/24/2021,stocks,Also I am not sure why they would share this technology with tesla shareholders. Unless the patent is owned by tesla? But if not why wouldn't Elon use a different private company to start this service.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It doesn't really matter whether it'll be mainstream in 2 years or 10 years though, fact of the matter is that Tesla will get it done first and when they do they'll instantly become one of the most profitable companies in the world.

If you have the best search engine (like Google) or social network (like Facebook), then you will quasi-monopolize those markets. The industry in which cars operate is the exact opposite - there are many firms, price segments are exclusive, and choices within segments are largely made by personal preference. Tesla cannot compete for multiple segments at the same time. 

It doesn't really matter if Volkswagen is behind Tesla, since they are not competing for the same segment. If Volkswagen can offer 80% of what Tesla can for half the price, then the 'value' segment will choose VW. And as much as Tesla has the technological advantage, VW has the price/scale advantage."

This isn't only in cars but every single industry. Your supplier can't go sell your designs and product to another company.

surely the Autopilot system is Level 3, restricted to level 2 by legislators. I know people who have driven while asleep and woke up safely in a Tesla, would definitely not recommend, but it will keep you safe in a loss of consciousness. Level 4 is definitely attainable with continuous effort."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Ok let me put it less poetic to appease those people you speak of.

This thread is dumb. Tesla doesnt have market share in Europe because of factors that are not discussed, hence there is no context given and something that is not an issue appears to be. FUD. 

Tesla sells every single car they can produce. They don't have any factories in Europe yet. They need to export their deliveries to Europe which is expensive. Should Tesla deliver more cars in the interim until their factory on the continent is up and running. No they shouldn't. They should do exactly what they are doing. 

Tesla has constraints due to being a first mover and literally creating the market. They are growing their production lines as well as their supply chains and access to resources. As those things grow they will produce and sell more every year. 

When they have a factory up and running in Europe they will be pumping out cars like crazy in Europe. Until then Europe will have to wait. 

I have been invested in and following Tesla for years. There were years of uncertainty, talks of bankruptcy, fires, crashes, every little thing posted every single day with a negative spin to destroy this company and it persevered. 

Now, they have about 20 billion dollars, two massive new factories coming online this year, the most advance autonomous vision based system which is best suited to scale and create an autonomous robo taxi network and subscription based system, they have a massively growing energy segment, they have an insurance segment, and they will be the leaders in manufacturing as well. Its been a long hard road to get to this point for them and stay invested for any of us but how far this company has come is nothing short of remarkable and where it's heading is even more.

The funny thing is people still don't see it or understand. One day you will but just way later than everyone else. You might invest one day for the dividend."

I am a bull on tesla and before I test drove the Model Y I test drove the Mach E. I liked the Mach E. It was a smooth ride good acceleration product felt quality. 

I own ford shares as well and pushing them to succeed. 

Software was abysmal. Changing the heated seats level of temperature was laggy. On top of everything else not feeling smooth in the UI. The front display was bloated with information. Range EPA was laughable. How am I supposed to use the 270mi EPA in the dead of winter? The range will be degraded so far saw videos into the ~200-170 mi per charge range. I can't go anywhere with that. What am I going to do with the fordpass and all the level 2 chargers? Slow charging is a major downside when you have low range per charge. 

Test drove the Model Y and it was far superior in everyway, felt very apple like. Kinda it just works. The minimalist design was easy to get used to. I thought I wouldn't like it. That's why I was looking at getting used model S for the longest time. I wanted stuff up on the dash. The seats were so comfortable it was insane. The center display just felt fluid in everyway and everything felt quality. I'd have to spend more than a half hour to determine build quality vs the ford. The Ford was familiar in build quality that's why I can say so quickly to it's experience. 

All in all I guess it's a matter of opinion. My buddy who came a long with me for both drives agreed that the Tesla was crazy and a whole new experience. Regen braking was better in the Tesla more noticable. My buddy is not a car guy, and maybe that's what Tesla's market is. Who knows.

You're making my point though about improving their factories. They're capable of learning and progressing and trying new things. They're still removing robots, but for different reasons. Approx ~1000 robots on the Model 3 line. ~300 fewer on for each megacasting like the Model Y's mega rear casting. Berlin and Austin will have mega cast front and rear portions cutting the robots per line by ~60%.

And that's just for any kind of vehicle. When it comes to EV no one is doing a structural pack.

Nope, I mean cost of ownership. I purchased two cars last year and looked first at BEV and HEV because like most people, I love the idea of BEV, but it's not quite a practical option yet. Even with gas and maintenance savings, cost of ownership of BEVs was over $10,000 more than a comparable ICE, and that was before costs of installing a charger in my home.

03/24/2021,stocks,"It makes a huge difference if the miles you drive to collect data are driven in LEVEL 2 or LEVEL 4 mode. Tesla drives millions of miles on training wheels, Waymo drives hundreds of thousands without training wheels. Who can ride a bike better? And do you actually know that much about neural nets or do they just parrot close what teslafans tweet? Just because you ride more miles doesn't automatically make it better. It's about the conditions of the miles, the circumstances and the quality of the riding."

The kind of thing you're talking about comes in with sensor technology and AI decision making.  That's not something that comes with giant dumps of traffic meta data but with specific pre-launch programming.

Google has been developing their self-driving technology for 12 years now. The Waymo is far more advanced than anything Tesla makes.  The problem for Google is they don't have a steering wheel and thus they can't sell this until driverless becomes legal."

The most optimistic forecasts put price parity of BEV and ICE as happening in 2023, but that's in Europe where increasing costs of ICE (emissions standards) are rising the cost of ICEs, not entirely because of reduced cost in BEVs. Price parity in North America is expected in the late 2020's. I can not find any source, other than Tesla marketing hype, that suggests a <$30k CAD BEV is forthcoming."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm not the person you're responding to, but generally speaking the more data you have the better your models become. I don't work in computer vision, but i doubt that it matters whether the data is collected when using a level 2 or level 3 system (or a person is driving) as long as your sensors are picking up everything they need to make well informed decisions. LIDAR and regular cameras should both provide enough information to make that decision, however, LIDAR is probably providing more useful information since they're inferring on 3D input rather than 2D. 

That being said, if Tesla really is collecting exponentially more data than the others i wouldn't be too surprised if they did better. HOWEVER, Tesla is not in anyway actually considered a thought leader in AI. Google has 100x the number of publications in top ML/AI conferences than Tesla has.

03/24/2021,stocks,"No. First, the 21 miles is because there are a couple of rocks out past the peninsula. The water behind those is likely plenty deep enough to drive any boat through.

Second, each channel is 2 miles wide *and there's two miles between them.* That's 6 miles. You could fit a hundred Suez Canals through there. And the channels are notional. Much of the rest of the strait is navigable by tankers, they're kept to the channel just to keep things controlled. And at 200 meters deep there room to stack 2 or 3 tankers before anything threatens a floating craft.

You'd be sinking several boats a day for weeks before you would make it even a challenge to get through.

Much better to sink just one and keep your sinking method visible while giving the stink-eye to the rest."

2021-03-24 08:15:23,stocks,"Hear me out... expense ratios dont matter? Okay hear me out here. Real world example lets look at XLI. they are trading around $95 with an expense ratio of 0.12%. Now PAVE trading around $24 with an expense ratio of 0.47%

My question is why does it matter? From what i have read and understand the expense ratio is factored into the NAV which represent a base people buy or sell into. 

So if i bought $1000 of XLI technically my expense ratio would be $1.2 and $1000 of PAVE would be $4.7. However the price is factored into the NAV before i buy it so does it even matter? 

PAVE has outperform XLI but has a higher expense ratio. But since the ETF doesnt physical charge me the expense ratio and i never see it leave my account does it matter? If the end arent i paying whatever the ETF price is only? 

Or am i missing something here?

PART 2 FOLLOW UP. 

Over say a 15 to 20 year period does this ER matter if the holding is performing historically better than the other lower ER holding.

So in this PAVE vs XLI example. PAVE year over year has beat XLI performance wise but as you see PAVE er is 0.47 while XLI is 0.12. Over a 20 year time frame does the higher performance wash out that higher ER. or is it worth being in the lower ER despite a slightly lower performance?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, this is wrong. Fees are factored in NAV but it’s adjusted daily so it’s not only taken out when you buy or sell. 

The reason different funds perform better is because they have different holdings. All things being constant except fees, the lower fee fund will return more than the higher expense fund."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Anything that dilutes your gains, matters.  I guess it would be most apparent between two like ETFs, if performance were the same, you would go for the one with a lower ER.

I personally don’t use ETFs except I have mutual funds in my 401k since I don’t have a choice.  But if I can construct one with the major drivers of an ETF, I’ll just do that and not take a fee for something that a bot manages."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Here's an easy comparison:

Use your favorite broker/research tool.  Almost every one of them have a 'hypothetical growth of $10K' chart or other way to see what 10K invested a certain period ago would have turned into.

Compare SPY with VOO.   Using my tools @ schwab, 10K over 10 years in SPY would now be worth $34,916.  The same amount in VOO would be $35142 or a difference of $226.  

This difference? SPY has an expense ratio of 0.095, vs VOO's of 0.03.   Note that this is only a difference of 0.055%   Imagine if the difference was more like 0.5%.

Let's do a quick over-simplified comparison of some extremes:

Assume that ETF#1 ""ACTIVE"" has an expense ratio of 0.5%.   ETF #2 ""PASSIVE"" has an expense ratio of ""0.05%"".

You put $10000 into each.   Each grows by 5% per year.   However, you have to subtract the expense ratio from the growth.   So ACTIVE really grows by 4.5% and PASSIVE grows by 4.95%.

At the end of year one, ACTIVE is now worth 10450, and PASSIVE is now worth 10495.

Over the next 9 years ACTIVE grows at the same rate, with year-end balances of 10920, 11411, 11925, 12461, 13022, 13608, 14221, 14860, and finally 15529.

Let's do the same for PASSIVE - year end balances for years 2-10 are: 11014, 11559, 12131, 12732, 13362, 14024, 14718, 15446 and finally 16212.

So, over 10 years, even though ACTIVE and PASSIVE's underlying stocks grew at the same rate, PASSIVE outperformed ACTIVE by $683.   Over 20 years the difference would be even more."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I guess my confusion lies in performance than. 

So say XLI and PAVE hold the exact same holdings and the exact same weight of them. The fund takes out there expense ratio off the NAV. However if all the underlying holdings collectively gain 5% for the day effectively driving the market share price of both ETFs equally higher and then the NAV is adjusted with creation units to compensate/ correct it. Then in the end that ER doesnt matter? 

Maybe im way over complicating it. But if the ER is scalped off the NAV and the next day the ETF goes up by 5% each causing both NAVs to correct 5% effectively the higher ER was corrected and both gained equally?

Or would that ER be taken out of the 5% gain when the NAV corrects at 4pm? 

Just trying to wrap my head around this concept since we dont actually ""pay the fee"" like a dividend pays us."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Now that definitely makes sense. 

So essentially an ETF with a higher ER compared to another ETF in that same sector must outperform the lower Expense ratio ETF in order to make it worth it. So basically the risk is whether that ETF will continue to out perform or not. 

This breakdown helped alot. Thank you"
03/24/2021,stocks,"ER is charged as a fixed percentage of value and there's no reliable way to predict which sector or fund manager will outperform long-term, so lower fees are still preferable."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You're way over complicating it and by doing so losing sight of what's actually happening. In the above scenario, all things held constant, the ETF with the higher expense ratio will consequently have a lower NAV relative to the lower expense ratio fund. The key is to examine the two funds ""holding all else constant"" (emphasis on holding all else constant; I recommend just skimming some basic regression or econometric concepts on investopedia to get a better idea of why). And in practice, funds/etfs with higher expense ratios do indeed generate a lower return to their investors over time. The literature and research on this is robust so I assure you...fees do matter."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yea man, you’re overthinking. How would the fund companies get compensated for the expense ratio? If XLI & Pave have the same holding, same rebalance schedule etc, but PAVE is 25 bps more expensive, then PAVE’s net return will be 25 bps less than XLI. 

Even though you don’t see the fee, you’re paying it because you’re not buying gross assets, your buying net assets. And your NAV is adjusted daily."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That's correct.

If you think about the expense ratio as a figure you have to subtract from the performance of the held stocks then it makes a lot more sense.  In reality, what is happening is that the fund's management is reducing the NAV of the fund every day by one day's worth of expense ratio.   So if you had an ETF which ""invested"" in US dollars (which basically means the value of the asset wouldn't ever change), and had an expense ratio of 1%, at the end of the year, you'd only have 99% of your investment and the remaining 1% would now be in the pocket of the fund manager."
03/24/2021,stocks,No i definitely believe you. Like you said i way over complicated it. Now that ive seen some people spell it out to me it makes way more sense
03/24/2021,stocks,"I mean im not shocked im over thinking this haha. 

So follow up question.... over say a 15-20 year goal of hold of a portfolio with a max of Probably 200k in it someday does  higher performance outweigh a higher ER? 

Or is it worth it now to be in the lower ER despite slighltly lower performance knowing imma hold these positions for 15-20 years"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Higher performance is always going to win as that’s all that matter in the end. But if two funds hold the exact same things, the lower expense ratio fund will have better performance as their NAV won’t be adjusted down as far as the other. Picking things that can perform better is an unknown variable which is why people tend to lean towards lower ER funds as expenses are expenses and not variable(unless the fund changes it)"

03/24/2021,stocks,Call up or email their investor relations team https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/contact-information.aspx
03/24/2021,stocks,"Google Microsoft stock ""Transfer Agent."" Go to website and look up forms and usually there's a form to get replacement stock certificates (probably won't issue you paper certification but they'll open an account and hold it for you) Transfer Agent forms usually require Medallion Guaranty stamp.. like a notary stamp on Crack. Sometimes a PITA to find someone who can do a Medallion Guaranty stamp.. but usually your local bank will have someone. 

I've had to request replacement certificates for so many dead grandparents who bought then lost disney stocks certificates... 

Good luck"
03/24/2021,stocks,Don't forget to ask IR check where the dividends were sent.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Another resource to check is the unclaimed property in the state where your grandparents lived. If MSFT lost contact with them, then the shares might be held there."

03/24/2021,stocks,If you decide to sell some  I’d suggest selling it off over the course of years to reduce capital gains
03/24/2021,stocks,Any update?
03/24/2021,stocks,10x whatever they bought them at.
03/24/2021,stocks,I've got ibm stocks from the 80s and it's just a piece of paper
03/24/2021,stocks,The company will have a record of the sale. The receipt and your ID will be enough to get a new (digital) share. Call the investor relations department
03/24/2021,stocks,Uh did they buy it through a broker? They probably did so just ask that company.
03/24/2021,stocks,See if they got sent to a family member by mistake. I just got some old bonds sent to me randomly from a family member that forgot about them.
03/24/2021,stocks,Hope everything goes well! Good luck :)
03/24/2021,stocks,"They came, your parents sold them a bunch of years back to buy that new boat. 😂"

I found their stock receipt but they're broker was lehman brothers back then who has since gone bankrupt. Would anyone have any resources on how to reclaim or track those shares?"
03/24/2021,stocks,This. Start with computer share. Similar situation with my wife and her grandparents buying her AAPL in the 80s.
03/24/2021,stocks,I got Nintendo. A 64 not the stock
03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks! Will do!

03/24/2021,stocks,Can you buy DIS? My calls are dying!!!! Don’t they know about the rule?? On the bright side I was looking to exit Robinhood so I guess this will take care of it. Ouch.

03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks! I’ll give them a call
03/24/2021,stocks,My brother randomly found stock that my dad owned on the states unclaimed property website. Everyone should check these sights out.

03/24/2021,stocks,Back in the 80 IBM was trading between 15-45$. Now its at about 130. Don't forget dividends through all those years.

03/24/2021,stocks,Honestly a good investment if it still works well
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks! As others advised, contact Microsoft and have your documents be prepared! You may need some documents to prove your relationship with your grandparents. They may ask you for your grandparents’ id to verify and yours. 
If they bought 20 it years ago, I think this can be very huge!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"There has only been 1 split in the last 20 years (2003). There was another in 1999. 

So assuming OP is remotely correct, it's worth 4x if it was pre 99. And that would be less than 20k, so nice chunk of change, but def not ""rich"".

If it was after 1999 but before 2003, then it's around 10k, anything after 2003 would just be whstever the shares today are."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Imo buy actual water(well buy a large long term storage system, and fill it with water). Water stock ain’t gonna help you when people go crazy looking for drinkable water. It’s like gold, it’s an investment for when SHTF, stocks can’t save your life."
03/24/2021,stocks,A statue with googly eyes and your tongue hanging out because you bought them stock of a company that doesn't even exist by the time they are old enough to understand economics
03/24/2021,stocks,No they really won't be. Especially not for a long-term investment like that.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't know how people get on a sub about stocks and then make an utterly wrong comment about capital gains tax like that guy did. It's just .....

03/24/2021,stocks,"True about long term capital gains, not true about the tax rate. If single, the first $40,000 in long term capital gains are not taxed at all. (Double that if married filing jointly)"
03/24/2021,stocks,So long as you make less then $430k a year in other incomes then its 15%...for people above that their long term gains rate is 20%

03/24/2021,stocks,My parents bought me a single bond. I gained like $5 in 20 years!
03/24/2021,stocks,I hear the 10 year is really juicy now! I know I’ve lost 50 grand the last month because they jumped up like .15%. Solid gains!!!!!
03/24/2021,stocks,Me too. Worthless now but they look cool I guess.
03/24/2021,stocks,Back in the day treasury bonds had great returns. Keep them until they stop returning interest.
03/24/2021,stocks,~~So the stock has increased about x8-10 since then and they did one 2 for 1 split so about x20 in total?~~

This only applies if you have NO other income.  Its not zero percent tax on 40k on capital gains....its zero percent on any gains so long as your total tax liability including other sources of income are below 40k"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, this is my understanding as well"
03/24/2021,stocks,So glad I dont have to deal with the american tax system for stocks. Overhere I don't even pay taxes unless I would own over 50k€. In that case I would pay 1.2 percent over the amount higher than that 50k€.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yea I got chocolates
03/24/2021,stocks,Right? All I got was some lemonade and mowing an extra lawn for 10 straight summers.

If you are over 430000 in income for that year, including stocks you sell, anything you make after 430000 in capital gains is taxed at 20% not 15%, why on earth would you not want to space out your sales of Microsoft stock if he really is sitting on millions in Microsoft stock?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"You are correct, I was only showing that the 15% statement is wrong and the original comment was correct. For example, if you are single and made $36,000 that year you could sell $4,000 and not get taxed at all on that $4,000. This aligns with the original advise to sell off in several years, and conflicts with the other post stating OP should just burst sell it all and swallow a 15% tax hit."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I might be misreading you, but that sounds like the same situation with different numbers."

03/24/2021,stocks,The difference in situation is that in the described system (Netherlands I presume or if it isn't it's very similar) you pay the 1.2% regardless of what you actually do. So whether you have it sit in a bank account for years with 0.05% interest or you quadrupled it over a week on some penny stock it's 1.2% over your wealth yearly either way.

2021-03-24 07:13:10,stocks,"Tip: Yahoo Finance (App) Is Awesome! Edit: thanks for the awards :)

I swear I’m not being paid to advertise. I have been using the Yahoo Finance website for the last while to keep track of some of my stocks (the ones I can’t get through my main broker because TD’s way of displaying data is needlessly convoluted).

I just decided to download the app on IOS and it blew my mind because it put everything in one place.

It lets you add a list of your favourite tickers so you can see them all on the same page in real time.

After you create a list by adding your favourite stocks you can click on “list details” and there is even a customizable table where you can decide which details you want to see for your stocks (52 week high, day high, day low, volume, avg volume etc).

It also lists upcoming earnings reports for your favourite stocks.

And if you scroll down on any page it lists news articles related to the stocks on your list as well.

Now, instead of doing frequent searches for all the stocks I’m following to get updates I can just sit back and let it all roll in (I’m still going to cross reference for a while because I don’t know how accurate they are).

This is probably a bit random and I’m sure there are more experienced people who will scoff at this but it just made my day."
03/24/2021,stocks,I use it too for its simplicity and to keep track of earning dates.  Only thing I don't recommend is its public conversation/chat feature.. toxic.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not to mention the simple chart looks so beautiful , and at a glance u able to see pre market price beside the tickers"
03/24/2021,stocks,Does this mean I can now stop using my defunct Robinhood app? That’s right - I switched to a new broker but the layouts are so bad I still use Rh w my deactivated account to make sense of stuff and I hate it.
03/24/2021,stocks,The app is great and easy! But the news are as trust worthy as cnbc. Copy pasta
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yahoo Finance is the best app I've found, and I've tried a few. 

It does have a few minor annoyances. The charts are glitchy recently and the trailing returns it calculates are incorrect in some cases. Every so often these sorts of things come up due to an update, but I find they do a pretty good job fixing them on the next update.

But overall, it's a great app. I've used it every day for the last couple of years. It's better than anything else I've found to quickly check positions and watch lists. The notifications I get with it regarding stocks on my watch list are also quite helpful."
03/24/2021,stocks,"There is one thing which I really think it misses. I like to track my portfolio as a whole. Let's say 

Day 1:  
I have bought shares of Company A for 10k  
I have bought shares of Company B for 10k  
My portfolio is worth 20k

Day 2:  
My shares of Company A are now worth 15k (e.g. 50% increase)  
My shares of Company B are worth 10k  
My portfolio is worth 25k (e.g. 25% increase).  
I sell all my Company A shares (e.g. 15k)  
I buy shares of Company C for 15k  
My portfolio is worth 25k but the performance is indicating a (0 % increase).

I understand the logic behind it, I just wish it would keep track of sold shares as well. I read there is some sort of hack you can do, where you can add a custom share representing dollar values etc., but that just seems overly complicated. Anyone else feels this is annoying or just me?"
03/24/2021,stocks,The Yahoo Finance app is my main place to keep track of stocks and research :)
03/24/2021,stocks,It's weird that the only thing that really survived from the yahoo empire is their finance website.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Only thing yahoo finance is missing IMO is the ability to see premarket and postmarket charts.

And saves your like 8-or-so recent searches on a side bar for quick access.  

It's a pretty nice free resource."

03/24/2021,stocks,Noticed that the yahoo app has the ability to tie in directly with my brokerage account.  Does anyone do this and is it secure?
03/24/2021,stocks,Yahoo premium for technicals and tips is pretty great too. I use it for research at least once a day
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yea, it’s my my one stop shop for the most part.  I don’t get on my broker specific apps other than to buy. 

News, research, etc. it’s great. People complain about about not having a good broker app (RH folks), I say it doesn’t matter and you can do what you need to do on yahoo finance."
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s my preferred app
03/24/2021,stocks,I recently started looking at the site and I like  it so far
03/24/2021,stocks,"Funny you mention this, I’m trialing Tradingview and have a sub to Trendspider who doesn’t even have an app yet so I’m thinking to myself why do I need either of those when the yahoo app integrates with my main account at schwab and updates my positions in almost real time? 

I also set up alerts for my watch list so I can see if a stock is nearing my buy point. If the screener was better I would pay for premium in a heartbeat. Overall, I cannot believe Verizon has not taken away more functionality.

So I think my holy grail will be yahoo for mobile charting and tracking during the workday, tc2000 for screening (maybe stock rover) and desktop charting, and IBD for news and ideas."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Does anyone know if a feature is available to show the daily price graph next to the ticker without clicking on it? This is how it is on Stocks for iOS, but this app has less features so it’s not the main one is use. I do really like Yahoo finance, except I wish you didn’t have to sign in for portfolio performance. I used Yahoo when I was in middle school lol."
03/24/2021,stocks,I use the website everyday so I will take the recommendation and try the app.  Thanks man.
03/24/2021,stocks,I have 4 different brokers I use. But I keep track of ALL my stocks on the Yahoo App! It’s awesome
03/24/2021,stocks,It's far from perfect but it's the best out there at least that I can see.
03/24/2021,stocks,Agree. My goto app for stocks
03/24/2021,stocks,Great app. Only complaint is the sum of all my lists is measured in usd while all lists are in cad. Any fixes? Made sure on desktop it’s set to cad and app still shows in usd
03/24/2021,stocks,I love it too aside from it only updating your holdings like once a day.
03/24/2021,stocks,Love the app
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah I love the app, I hate the website"
03/24/2021,stocks,I agree.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know this has become a sort of dirty word in these parts, but the functionality and features which you describe here are mostly all built in to the Robinhood app. I know, I know, everyone hates RH here, but I still utilize it based on UI and ease of use. I will make sure to give Yahoo Finance a whirl, though."
03/24/2021,stocks,i’ve been using this app since i’ve gotten into stocks and it’s great. i use it in combination with fidelity and have had no issues! :)
03/24/2021,stocks,Is the price really real time? Updated every second?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I always visit yahoo finance to check prices but never used the app so far, I’ll try it today. 

I wonder if there’s a feature such as, I want to get all the news, updates about a sector, for example logistics, not limited to my watch list. Is there a such feature in yahoo finance app? Or any other app provides covering whole sector and its companies?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"this. Google finance is also great, can compare graphs etc"
03/24/2021,stocks,"A screenshot or two would be helpful in your post. :)

Yahoo mail is so horrible that I find it interesting that they actually have a quality product."
03/24/2021,stocks,Those are my thoughts untill I used the app of webull (no paid account). They also show volume.
03/24/2021,stocks,100%
03/24/2021,stocks,I prefer trading view
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah would recommend, especially if you use Degiro (like me) as it can be quite hard to graph / picture your gains etc. over time. Hopefully Degiro will add some support along these lines in the future"
03/24/2021,stocks,Has anyone else had issues with the articles? Like the text doesn't load right and sometimes pictures become very long. No other site has this issue for me.
03/24/2021,stocks,I understand why yahoo is still around now
03/24/2021,stocks,"Are you able to input ticker symbols, say today, and will today’s price be saved for you to look at and compare in a few days, weeks, months?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I may have too many tickers on my watch lists, but I have noticed recently that it takes some time to load. Overall though it is the easiest way to quickly look through your watch lists. Then you can always go to message board and see all the post about how unhappy everyone is with the stock whether it is going up or down."
03/24/2021,stocks,The only thing I wish they had is an Apple Watch complication!
03/24/2021,stocks,Way too many ads
03/24/2021,stocks,Oh yeah I really like the app. I was also using the website for some time and switched to the app and was pleasantly surprised.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like TDA's app for when I specifically know what stock/option I'm looking for.  If I want to just overall browse around at stocks that I haven't invested in or added to a specific watch list, TDA is horrendous.  I'll have to check out Yahoo Finance app, thanks"
03/24/2021,stocks,I would recommend Tradingview.
03/24/2021,stocks,Is there a limit on the alerts?
03/24/2021,stocks,"I use it and it's really great, can have widgets to display holdings and quick view prices on my home screen. 
My only complaint is I wish we were able to filter out certain news sources and their clickbaity ""Forget $X, $Y is the best new thing"" articles"
03/24/2021,stocks,You know that meme of the dogs and one looks super swole and one looks like it’s crying? That’s Yahoo Finance compared to the rest of Yahoo.
03/24/2021,stocks,I couldn’t agree more. Plus the TD app ticker is like 5 minutes behind which is literally fucking absurd!
03/24/2021,stocks,webull does the trick for me
03/24/2021,stocks,"Been using their web for the same purpose as well, downloading the app on your recommendation"
03/24/2021,stocks,Love the app
03/24/2021,stocks,Yea best I've seen yet for free stuff.
03/24/2021,stocks,I use their website so I don’t know if this is the same for the app. But I can’t seem to find a way to view candles and volume in extended hours trading?
03/24/2021,stocks,The main feature that I'm looking for is to be able to enter my own cost basis and I've still to find something that supports that. Does this app?
03/24/2021,stocks,You can also connect your accounts in the Yahoo Finance app to bring in your portfolio and see your portfolio at a glance.
03/24/2021,stocks,The app is good but be aware that all their ratings for stocks and the articles that are available are almost entirely manipulation tools to make the market move in their favor
03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks for the insight. I'm going to look into it
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks, I've been looking for something like this."
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s all I’ve ever used!
03/24/2021,stocks,You forgot the best part! After you create your portfolio you can add the number of shares you own and what price you bought them at. Then it shows you a live update of the total gains or losses you made that day.
03/24/2021,stocks,You can also link Yahoo Finance app to your brokerage account. I know that my Fidelity doesn't actually have real time prices so I use Yahoo Finance to get more accurate pricing.
03/24/2021,stocks,Honesty I hate Yahoo page so much and their search engine that I don’t want anything to do with them.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’ve always raved about some of the yahoo tools. They may not be as popular as Google, but they have some really good tools. Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Weather app are 2 of my absolute favorites."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yahoo Finance is definitely one of the best free tools to use in your toolkit, and is often the place I go to when I want a quick overlook of a company. Granted if you want to dig deeper than what they offer for free, I'm not sure how much different it is than some of the brokerages. All I have to compare it to was my brief stay at robinhood, Etrade, and Fidelity."
03/24/2021,stocks,Can you remove the individual charts from the list in the newest update somehow? I feel like its super cluttered now that i see 10 different line charts as soon as i open the app.
03/24/2021,stocks,I swear by it... a month ago everyone was like what yahoo app do you use and I was telling them the alert feature are amazing.
03/24/2021,stocks,Its decent. It does not track brokerage fees or keep track of gains you made with selling shares
03/24/2021,stocks,Absolutely agree
03/24/2021,stocks,"I love yahoo finance too, I use it every day."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The one thing I wish they did better was the layout of the pre and post prices. It's just really messy and somewhat confusing. Other than that, it's the best."
03/24/2021,stocks,Does anyone know how many tickers i can put on watchlist?
03/24/2021,stocks,"How does it compare to the default iOS stocks app? That one uses Yahoo Finance as its source, and lets you add stocks to a list and tap them for related news articles. Is there something additional the YF app does that makes it worth the switch? And are there ads?"
03/24/2021,stocks,yep its the one I use
03/24/2021,stocks,Thats why Google implemented Google Finance. They were missing gains
03/24/2021,stocks,"Only downside - it cannot stay open all day, after a wile it shuts the screen...., at least I haven’t found a way to keep the app open for the whole day without constantly taping on the screen when it dims!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you add things to your ""holdings"" it's also pretty good for tracking your portfolio's performance, especially if you have more than one brokerage accoutn!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Love it. Just don't use it for options. The data is horrid.
03/24/2021,stocks,I had it earlier but removed it. Again installed and now I see that brokerage account can be connected. That's awesome!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah it's my go to app, shame that the stock alerts don't work for me tho"
03/24/2021,stocks,I also like the conversations feature on it so you can see what people are saying about the stock. It’s a good way to know what’s going on
03/24/2021,stocks,"Additionally, if you add the tickers to your list you can get price updates on big movements, I also believe you can add notification if the stock reaches a customer set price."
03/24/2021,stocks,Cscw :)
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like the ROKU yahoo finance channel, free on roku tv. its actually pretty decent during the day time."
03/24/2021,stocks,Its the last best thing about yahoo. The internet tv isnt half bad too
03/24/2021,stocks,"Their PE ratios are sometimes wrong, besides that A+"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yahoo Finance stock msg boards are often over run by shorts,  bashers, and bots which can be very annoying and make it difficult to have meaningful dialogue.

Otherwise decent to track watchlists, but you need to pay for 'premium' to unlock the advanced charting, etc...  no thanks. I'll use ThinkOrSwim.

Edit: typo"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm inspired, i'll download it!"
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve been using it for a while. Prefer it over the paid stock apps.
03/24/2021,stocks,Just remember it is delayed so if you are playing micro stocks that have high volatility you might not know where they are at any given time. I use it along with my TD Dashboard to do some DD and most of my research. Something I noticed is they are pretty good at showing most of the news that TD misses. Definitely one to keep in your toolbox...
03/24/2021,stocks,"I love Yahoo Finance. The only thing that I’m trying to figure out is that for some tickers, I can see the “Holdings” widget on the main ticker page. Whereas, for other tickers, I can’t see that widget(and my holdings) unless I go into “List Details” page."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Totally agree, I have been using Yahoo Finance as my daily check-in tool for years.  I have tried a BUNCH of different tools and nothing has been better.  I have a huge watchlist with the stocks I hold manually positioned to be at the top (a useful feature).  I can quickly see daily change for each stock, and if I need more detail I can just click ""My Holdings"" and it provides more detail.  I even have my own custom view that I use occasionally but generally prefer the default ""Summary"" view.

I then sort the watchlist by ""Chg %"" which shows me the days biggest gainers and losers, then  scan the news at the bottom, which is a nice consolidated news feed for items in my watchlist."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yahoo will throw ads at you for at some point. fk that company
03/24/2021,stocks,"hows their sync with broker, can you track history of your trades and performance for multiple brokers?"
03/24/2021,stocks,One thing I hate is the history of your searches. It seems to always not render a random assortment of my most recent ones
03/24/2021,stocks,this reddit post is sponsored by yahoo finance
03/24/2021,stocks,+1
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yahoo Finance was the biggest app surprise in finance for me.
I also value their free API. If you wanna code with stock data, it's a go-to solution."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Will actually check this out, have always used the standard IPhone stocks app, but it doesn’t show pre-market which is annoying."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Doesn’t work iOS 12, for us stuck with deprecated devices."
03/24/2021,stocks,Has anyone tried the google finance website out? seems much cleaner and way less ads than yahoo
03/24/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/24/2021,stocks,I can confirm. I have Fidelity but I keep track of all my stock on yahoo finance.
03/24/2021,stocks,Agreed.
03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks for the tip! I have TD as well and agree it's too convoluted. I really like the layout of Yahoo finance although lately I'm not too excited about looking at my stocks. 🙂
03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks for the tip friendo
03/24/2021,stocks,Haven’t tried yahoo finance myself but isn’t tradingview just as good?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep; this has been by far the best stock tracking app for me. I’ve all my watchlists in yahoo finance. Wish they had similar feature for options as well ( I meant the free version, haven’t explored the premium yet) . I’ve used trading view, finviz; they’re good in their own way but yahoo finance gets 5 stars for ease of use and  its UI."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I use Yahoo Finance daily, it's my tool of choice.  I have a few other apps I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/mca4yo/my_favorite_finance_apps/) about here that I find helpful for managing finances."
03/24/2021,stocks,Thanks for sharing.  I didn't know of this app so I'm going to use it!
03/24/2021,stocks,I love Yahoo Finance. You can also link your brokerage and read articles about your specific investments.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like this, i downloaded and thank you"
03/24/2021,stocks,And I can't buy shares in Yahoo... WTF? Y U hoarding them tendies Yahoo???
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you like Yahoo, try Webull. And you can repeat yourself how it blew your mind away. Everything at finger tips."
03/24/2021,stocks,My only complaint is I can't figure out how to delete a watchlist.
03/24/2021,stocks,The only problem is lack of notes. I have to use a different app to type out my thoughts on a stock.
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can also add your positions and lots. Thus eliminating the need to check brokerage account frequently(unless you intend to trade).

Also price alerts for stocks is a freaking neat feature."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Can second this! I love the option to add your lots and just track your investments real time. Also, on the mobile version, they have this neat feature wherein if you click on say 1year or 5 years or max in the stock price movement chart, the returns numbers change as well, super well thought out."
03/24/2021,stocks,Trading View?
03/24/2021,stocks,It's amazing but very slow at peak times.
03/24/2021,stocks,I really like WEbull app
03/24/2021,stocks,Webull is better lol
03/24/2021,stocks,If they get rid of the Motley Fool articles it would be perfect.
03/24/2021,stocks,Barchart is a good one aswell. great desktop platform decent charting and tons of helpful info
03/24/2021,stocks,2 week old account definitely isn't a shill for Yahoo.
03/24/2021,stocks,I think sometimes yahoo is faster than Td.
03/24/2021,stocks,Yahoo are big big liars!
03/24/2021,stocks,Yahoo is okay. I prefer MarketWatch
03/24/2021,stocks,Yahoo is garbage. Stop pumping that shit
03/24/2021,stocks,If people don't like Yahoo CNBC is good for these featured too!
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't get all the Motley Fool hate I see on this site. I used them as a reference for my first year or so (really only 5-6 months of active trading) as an investor and I had an awesome return on the stocks I purchased inspired by what I read there. There were a few small misses and like all the other stock advice sites I've seen there are plenty of 'filler' articles that don't offer any compelling advice, but as a beginner I found their general approach very reasonable and effective. I'm not using them now because I decided to have some fun with a semi-YOLO on GME, AMC and Palantir, but jeez, from reading here you'd think they murder baby apes or something."
03/24/2021,stocks,Wait till you see Reddit
03/24/2021,stocks,can you even view the conversation from the app?
03/24/2021,stocks,"The conversation section isn't too terrible. I assume most of the people are trolling or trying to get people to buy/sell for their profit BUT sometimes you come across people who seemingly know what they're talking about with extra info you might not have seen prior. I've bought small positions in stocks mentioned there as well and came away with some profits after checking charts etc. It can be terrible for sure, but it's also entertaining enough, certainly better than YT comments."
03/24/2021,stocks,The pre market and post market is big. Most apps/websites don't make it so easy to view.
03/24/2021,stocks,Love the fututurs on top and premarket
03/24/2021,stocks,How do you see the premarket price beside the ticker? I had to create a new view in my watchlist to do that. I'm using the website btw
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's a shame pre and ah isn't show in non trading hours though, haven't to go to marketwatch for that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"True. I have had to mute this emoji-ridden notifications though- ""British 🇬🇧🇬🇧 stocks bounce on news of positive vaccine 💉💉 trial""."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Love being able to see the pre market price at a glance. Even with all of the expansive space on [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com), you still have to individually click into each symbol to see the pre market price."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I forced myself to use Webull in place of Robinhood for checking things (I invest with Fidelity) and it's so much better. It has financial information, price targets, news, public comments/social sentiment. You can draw on the charts and it will save it, so you can reference a support/resistance line you drew the other day to see if it's holding up. You can also set watchlists and it'll show a lot of info right there without having to click on individual tickers"
03/24/2021,stocks,Robinhood ui is still faster by quite a bit. My main problem with yahoo finance is it is slow.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I do the same too! My transfer should be finished by Monday next week to Fidelity but I'm still using RH to keep a track of amc and the stock data. It sucks but until I find something as easy as RH was, I cant completely get rid of it until thats solved. Looking at Yahoo Finance rn, it looks a little similar to RH but idk. Good luck to us both!"
03/24/2021,stocks,A lot of it is auto-generated.
03/24/2021,stocks,I mean they just repost other news items mostly. And the news is trust worthy. Just with bad arguments often or weird points of view. The actual news (EG company x does x) is true.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Most of the time do the oppisite of what the media tells you. 

Jim cramer is the best i Can Think off. If he recomendes a Stock, short it. If he says sell, buy it. Has worked pretty good for me so far.

But like analyse and DD’s about Company’s future plans, and there current state are great.

But all this stupid stuff like drop Tesla,
 these 2 new car dealerships Will run the market in 3years. 

And stuff like “bitcoin hype fades, as it drops 4%. Meanwhile the Hole market is bleeding at the same time. Like wtf is the point og that"
03/24/2021,stocks,I guess time will tell I haven’t read much of the news on there yet. But if something specific to the company changes I can always check multiple sources.
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's an aggregator, using keywords and other things ""relevant"" to the stock"
03/24/2021,stocks,Do you have any suggestions what websites/ outlets should I use for news on the company I'm willing to invest
03/24/2021,stocks,"One major annoyance that I have with them is that there are so many God damn dumb and contradicting Motley Fool articles ""why you should buy this stock"", ""why you should avoid this stock"", ""why is this stock up 50% this year"". They come off as a trashy gossip news section who are throwing so much shit at the wall and hoping some of it sticks. All these platforms need to cut ties with MF, imo."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Funny thing about Yahoo Finance: It used to be total shit and Google Finance was the go-to site. Then a few years ago Google ""redesigned"" Google Finance and took out everything that made it worth having, and Yahoo immediately upped their game and took over.

It's pretty much a microcosm of everything that's wrong with Google: If a product gets too good or too popular, they kill it. (Even Google *Search* sucks now, because it's entirely geared towards taking me to ecommerce sites instead of actual information.)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’m not annoyed by it. Though having the ability to do it is super useful. 
I’m annoyed we can’t add any options positions. And also portfolio performance graphs would be nice."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can sort of bypass it, by adding a custom ticker. For example ""CASH"", always 1$ a share, and add as many shares as many dollars you sold for and etc. As it doesn't have any market info, it doesn't change, but your cash positions get counted into the total this way as well"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes any app or program that exists today only tracks performance of the current stock you hold. It's not going to calculate your performance of 'trading'. For this reason, in addition to Yahoo Finance, I keep a spradsheet that tracks performance of my trading ever since I started. It's a bit annoying since I have to enter stock purchase and sell data in both Yahoo and my spreadsheet, but now I get to see my returns on some of the short trades I do for fun as well."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I may be wrong because I’ve never actually done it myself but I think I saw that if you want to indicate that you sold shares on Yahoo Finance you add some like you do for buying but just make the number of shares negative, so for example if you sell 10 shares at $10/share you would put that you bought -10 shares at $10/share. Again, never done this myself, so I’m sorry if I’m wrong."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This isn't a portfolio tracking app, it just shows you in real time what your current investments are worth and change (per holding).  It's very useful.  If you want portfolio tracking for free try Wealthica."
03/24/2021,stocks,Hello fantasy football...By far the best platform.
03/24/2021,stocks,Remember yahoo answers? Now quora is the goto site
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not weird, they just simply found and focused on their strengths."
03/24/2021,stocks,Thier email service is pretty good as well. It has all the new features that you will find with outlook and Gmail.
03/24/2021,stocks,I use TradingView for this exact reason. Worth checking out.
03/24/2021,stocks,You can turn on the Extended Hours option when you view a stock's chart in full screen mode.
03/24/2021,stocks,Webull. No need to be a customer to see pre and post live.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Tradingview.com is amazing, even the free tier. Tap ""ext"" on the lower right off the chart for extended hours."
03/24/2021,stocks,Webull .. you won’t use yahoo finance after this
03/24/2021,stocks,"Webull is superior in every way, look at analytics and financials too"
03/24/2021,stocks,There is an option to bring in your broker account I'm Yahoo app. I haven't tried it since I don't trust Yahoo to get access to my broker account.
03/24/2021,stocks,"To second this you can use the webull app without having to log in every time. They only ask for login when you go to trade. 

Also +1 for a great simple interface, per-stock alerts and notes, simulated trading and paper trading."
03/24/2021,stocks,Who does? Im looking for that simple thing. Where i put my buy price and buy date for my portfolio
03/24/2021,stocks,I use personal capital for this and like it
03/24/2021,stocks,I love it too and use it heavily. Wish it had portfolio tracking. I'll give Yahoo finance a try for that. But nothing beats a spreadsheet.
03/24/2021,stocks,And yet you’re on Reddit :P
03/24/2021,stocks,You can create a portfolio in your profile and add them manually.
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can enter sells.

Make a new lot and enter the sold number of shares as a negative value eg. -100. And then enter the price you sold them for"

Edit: maybe not for you mothercanuckers"
03/24/2021,stocks,I've been using Barcharts app. I'll check out Yahoo see which one i like the best.
03/24/2021,stocks,You can edit the currency in portfolios and lists -- its there somewhere.

If you only checked Webull, you could get caught off guard if there is a big price movement because it will just say the last price at close until the new (pre) open, but with RH you can see that change and be better ready to react to it when it opens.

Even tho yahoo does have some great DD at times, they always seem to have an urge to tell you why this stock did dip 4% today.

Let’s take apple as an example, if apple went down 4% they seem to know the (Real reason why) it’s going down.

But it might just simply begin there where more sellers then buyers, or that the hole market is down.

I won’t give any names on stocks or news sadly, as I don’t want to be the reason someone does invest in a stock that these wepsites, or news are pushing. 

One great advice(not a financial advicer and you do listen or not at your own risk)

is find out what your goal is, are you looking for a 10-30years investment to just sit around. Or do you want to find that goldmine, that gives you a huge payment.

What is your risk tolerance like. Look at the market right now, it’s red all around. But if you believe in the company you invested in, you should not worry to much about day to day gain/loss.

I have had stocks and stil do, that had a total value of 250k last week. And is now sitting on a value of 110k. But I believe in my investment, and therefore don’t care if it drops or not. 

Watch YouTube or something that does help you to know what you should be looking at, when doing a DD of a stock you think is worth the investment."

“If Tesla has the ability to determine if the driver isn’t paying attention, it needs to warn the driver in the moment, like other automakers already do,” Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports’ auto test center, said in the report.

Dive Brief:Dollar General is contending with continued high carrier rates and fuel costs, CFO John Garratt said during the company's earnings call Thursday. Increased costs are also stemming from discretionary bonuses for trucking employees, as well as for workers in distribution centers, Garratt said.To help mitigate transport costs, the company plans to further expand its private truck fleet, Garratt said. The private fleet accounted for more than 20% of outbound logistics at the end of last year, COO Jeff Owen said on the call.The retailer said the recent opening of its dry distribution center in Walton, Kentucky, is expected to help it reduce stem miles and, therefore, costs. It also plans to open two DG Fresh facilities this year, including a combination DG Fresh and dry distribution center in Nebraska, which Owen said should reduce stem miles over time.

Dive Insight:

Pandemic-driven volume increases were responsible for a portion of the increases in transportation and distribution costs, Dollar General said. And buyers aren't expected to let up on spending any time soon.

""With another round of stimulus checks being mailed right now, we expect another large boost in consumer spending over the next few months,"" National Retail Federation Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a statement last week.

But high logistics costs can offset gains in sales. In a recent McKinsey survey of CPG companies, 80% said they did not expect transportation costs to decrease this year from 2020's elevated levels.

""We feel great about what we did this year, delivering 77 basis points of gross margin expansion,"" said Garratt. ""But we also, as I mentioned, are seeing in the near term higher distribution and transportation costs. So ... these will weigh in the near term.""

Increased volume, mixed with a shortage of trucks and people to drive them, have pushed up truckload rates. Volatility in the trucking market has prompted shippers to focus on procuring reliable carrier capacity.

For some shippers, that means diversification. For others, it means becoming a shipper of choice and leaning on dedicated services, or signing their fleets over to specialists in a conversion to manage capacity.

Dollar General's fleet-bulking strategy would allow it to more frequently skip the third-party pool. Demand surges have kept spot prices elevated.

The pandemic has also put pressure on efficient distribution, though large retailers have been reexamining their networks since before the coronavirus. Surging e-commerce volumes reinforced the need for more capacity.

United Natural Foods and Williams-Sonoma have invested in distribution expansions, with focuses on automation. Dollar General spent $1 billion in capital expenditures in 2020, including planned investments in distribution and transportation, the CFO said

However, if you manage to pick a company that will continue to grow revenue year over year then market conditions would only delay gains.

Unless you pick a company that was in a bubble when you started.

The real problem is picking a company like that. They don’t come often and by the time it’s obvious it’s usually too late to buy in.

But if you’re reading Morningstar it might be a better idea to ditch that noise and pick up some books.

Or if you’re an expert in a particular field maybe focus on companies you can better understand using your expertise.

Commodities can also be in multi year bear markets that seem never ending. Obviously, no one is a fortune teller to be able to see 20 years down the line and tell you what the trends will be, but based on the current market conditions, you should see which one of your holdings is not part of the future you envision in the next 3-5 years.

Nuclear is currently our only Carbon Free Fuel Source for Baseload Energy. It doesn't compete with wind and solar. It competes with Coal and Natural Gas to provide the power we need when the wind isn't blowing or the moon is in the sky.

The Uranium Market is highly cylical and it has been beaten down for a long time. History shows that when it pops it goes big. The stock is relatively cheap and the upside potential is exponential.

The company has recently branched into the rare earth's market as well. I have been looking gain exposure to this market and they are the best US Play I've found.

Wind has gone up around 5200%, natural gas 150%, while nuclear power generation is only up 5.7%. The pic of the graph uses even Gwh increments of 100k on the Y axis. Most clean energy stats skew the Y axis to make the data look better for investors. This is an honest view.

The problem with nuclear is there is no way to turn it ""off"" to save on costs.

With coal and natural gas, if cheaper renewables like wind and solar are cutting into your profits because there is too much power supply, you just burn less coal or burn less gas, then ramp back up when wind and solar can't meet the demand for whatever reason.

But there is no way to turn nuclear fuel rods ""off"".  You can insert control rods to reduce the power output but that that Nuclear fuel is still ""burning"" at the exact same rate.  That makes nuclear power *very* expensive if it's not needed all the time.

I don't know anything about UUUU but I don't think nuclear is ever going to be replace coal or natural gas as the ""staple"" reliable energy source to fill in when needed unless nuclear fuel somehow gets cheaper than coal and natural gas, and that's never going to happen.  At best Nuclear is going to replace coal and natural gas in areas where solar/wind/hydro are not feasible or not scalable enough to meet demand."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Thank you for this. No argument from me on the data. It looks in line with what I see in the market. I'm trying to sort out where the future of energy is coming from. I my mind it's not so much a swap out to meet current demand but growing the system to meet the future demand which is going be huge if we are all going to be driving evs. Throw the CO2 issues into the mix and there is going to be a push in baseload from somewhere. I have a few chips on that being nuclear, but only time will tell if it comes from this or something else. I stand by my nothing gets turned off. I don't see a future with less power demand.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Also took profits and got back in. Doubled my position today and plan to continue to cost avg down if it keeps dropping.

Remember, nuclear is a contract-sale based fuel. Their production is tied to multiple year price-locked contracts. Many have been in long-term contracts producing excess supply while support for nuclear died off after Fukushima. Now as people are getting back on board with a clean fuel that is safer than they realized and plants that are meltdown safe, demand will start increasing. Personally, I think their lack of supply last year was directly tied to not getting them stuck in any long contracts that would hurt their profits as momentum grows (opinion, not DD). So they took a year off, lowered supply as demand will start to grow and spent the year off closing rare earth metal partnerships that make them that much more attractive for the future of our technological, battery and other needs. Still a long play due to cost of tech advancement, lost time with anti-nuclear sentiment that didn’t fully embrace the sustainable and carbon-free solution staring right at us, but as someone said above: when it pops it should really pop.

Wind and solar are great but they need battery technology that doesn't exist to be baseload.

I never say never, but coal and natural gas are dirty. If we are going to hit climate goals something is going to have to replace them. I do agree that they are not going away soon.

The fact is humans need energy and we are moving towards a future where the total cost of energy will have to accounted for. There are a lot people building nuclear power plants and extending the permits for the lifespan of exiting ones who disagree with your assessment.

I respect your opinion and appreciate the discourse.

Hears to your future success"
03/24/2021,stocks,If you think solar and wind is provide enough electricity to worlds grid you are sadly mistaken. Nuclear is green and safe
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is just looking for problems that doesn't exist, there's ALWAYS power demand on the grid. Look at the size of each energy source in the worlds energy consumtion and tell me that you're gonna substitute all the coal/oil/gas with renewables.
No one is saying we'll need just one energy source but instead multiple working together. Nuclear acts like a form of base energy which is NEEDED in a power system. You can't just replace coal and gas with wind and solar, the stability of the grid would be terrible and there's almost no way of assuring that the energy demand would be met every day for the whole year. A energy mix with Nuclear as a base, with hydro/wind and solar working together is our best choice right now."
03/24/2021,stocks,"It won't, be as big as people hope. There is too much risk that it outweighs the rewards. No company wants to have multiple plants because government regulations would obliterate their profits. Government also doesn't like the idea of having a bunch of targets across the USA that could wipe out entire cities and make them uninhabitable. 

All it takes is one lucky terrorist and issues would be off the charts. So the government will most likely regulate them beyond the possibility of profit to make it seem like they tried, when in reality they don't want them.

There is plenty of real estate for wind turbines and even more for solar power. What people should be looking into is the companies that will be creating the battery technology for these renewables. The main limitation of renewable energy is the storage capabilities for energy produced."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying it's going to be zero load but nuclear is and will continue to be more expensive than solar/wind/hydro.  

Averaging out, solar is maybe $40 per mWH, Wind is maybe $50 per mWH, but nuclear is over $100 per mWH so anytime your nuclear plant isn't outputting its normal power generation because the grid has too much power from other renewables, suddenly running your nuclear plant becomes very expensive.

[Modular Nuclear Reactors](https://youtu.be/cbrT3m89Y3M) are a possible future and could even allow your facility to run completely off-grid, but my point was I don't see nuclear ever being used as a type of power generation to ""fill in"" when solar/wind are offline because you want your nuclear plant running at 100% as much as possible.  Your our fuel rods are being expended at the same rate whether you have more control rods in to reduce power or not."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I was just going to say the same. There are some scary dates of no return sitting out there if you’re looking at / buying into the climate science. That may cause cost to take a back seat until we can hit some of our lofty goals. And nuclear advancement has never been sold as cheap. But I also love the “luckily nobody turns anything off” aspect too. Ha!

And to be clear, I’m not expecting to make money on the outcome of this. Just the forward speculation.

All that said, also respect the cynicism of above commenter."
03/24/2021,stocks,"""Safe"" is the biggest perception issue the industry has. All of the 10 year anniversary coverage of Fukushima, isn't helping that perception right now.

03/24/2021,stocks,">This is just looking for problems that doesn't exist, there's ALWAYS power demand on the grid.

It's already true right now on some places.  I've worked inside some coal power plants in the Midwest and some plants are permanently running at 50% capacity or less.  Renewables are cheaper then coal, so coal gets kicked off the grid first once demand is met.  The coal planets never *permanently* shut down but they reduce their output and thus amount of coal they burn.  Gas plants work the same way. That's what I'm getting at.  Nuclear is permanently ""on"".  The fuel rods have a set life whether the plant is running at 100% or 50%. 

There us certainly room for nuclear power but I'm just saying the idea that it's going to replace coal/gas as a scalable power outputter is wrong.  You're only going to build a nuclear plant in an area where you know you'll be able to run it at max or near-max capacity for the lifetime of the plant.  Anything less and you're losing money and it's a bad thing investment."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Nuclear can have huge returns in the long run. The regulations dont cut profit it actually helps productivity by forcing these companies to be near perfect. ( I work in a plant )

The terrorist stuff is a hot take since there's 58 running plants in the USA right now. You can crash a plane into  reactor building and the plane will crumble. It would have to be a war like attack to do real damage. Also security is mega tight. 

I believe in uranium but I doubt it will get a huge pop just a significant one. I also believe the gains are quite far away. Smr technology is increasing but its still in its infancy. Nothing wrong with holding a small portion while the price is really low though."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You’re all wrong on the play, and the DD doesn’t explain it. Uranium price is going up due demand and non supply. There are many existing nuclear plants that need supply and deminshing. That is what’s gonna drive these companies value up.

The nuclear catching on as a green energy option is what could rocket this play.

And you are completely wrong on the risk/reward on nuclear power. I’m a power engineer that works in natural gas. Nuclear power is the cleanest and best option.

Terrorist attacks is your bear thesis? France and Germany are heavily into nuclear power to supply the country. 

Wind and water energy are great supplement for power but will never be enough to supply world with power especially with electric cars.

Nuclear is safe and cleanest option"

I think this will be an interesting and good discussion while we are in this dip/ correction now is a good time to look at your portfolio and make some purchases for the long term. I have taken this time to rebalance and change my direction i was going. I definitely went way too speculative/ risky and didnt understand exactly what overvalued was till recently. 

For my low risk i truly believe every individual should have DISNEY in their portfolio. I don't see any downside to it. If a pandemic doesnt completely close the Disney parks for good honestly nothing well. They came out of this pandemic way better than they went into it. My only regret is not buying sooner. But i feel confident they are the type of long hold stock that someday my own kids will be buying and selling. 

Medium risk i went with Draftkings. Sports betting is a major industry and states continue to welcome and legalize betting. I chose medium risk cause if states ever decide to not legalize or somehow feds step in the stock absolutely could tank and never recover. But if this continue to open and legalize this really could 2x-4x over the next year or two. 

Square and Paypal in putting as high risk even though i feel they are lower to medium because of their digital money involvement. If the feds ever crackdown on it... it could tank them. However, i dont think they have much downside besides being a tech stock which as we saw tank hard. 

Some positions ive considered adding depending how low they continue to go are NET, TESLA, AMAT and PENN.

Had apple but decided to sell due to my ETF overlap weighting on it."
03/24/2021,stocks,If the hype of SPACs returns there's some huge money to be made after this correction
03/24/2021,stocks,"Im currently in ARK waiting to close my positions. I have a really bad feeling its gonna be a while before im able to close Q and K unfortunately. Surprisingly PRNT, F, Q, and G have all held well and recovered well. Just need one good run and those can be closed. For me id rather be in QQQM/J then ARKs long term"
03/24/2021,stocks,I can see how you say QQQM/J is low risk. Only reason i say high risk is that in 5 years we could easily see another tech correction which really could hurt you
03/24/2021,stocks,Read up on pass through partnerships and Schedule K-1s first.
03/24/2021,stocks,"AMD is on my watchlist. I own SMH cause after days and days of research i couldn't really choose what semi i wanted to invest in and believed in. If AMAT or AMD take a massive hit for absolutely no reason imma jump on them and buy in. Otherwise im stick with SMH. 

Probably wouldn't get the type of drop that would catch my attention enough but we will see. Ill definitely be watching them over the next few years. 

I saw TSM took a major hit today. Be tracking that now too if it drops much more imma grab it"
03/24/2021,stocks,Vaccine companies don’t make much money when it comes to pandemics unfortunately
03/24/2021,stocks,Volatility is not risk if you are holding for many years.
03/24/2021,stocks,I mean any overvalued stock has risk if you’re holding short term
03/24/2021,stocks,"Either way, you’re riding its wave no matter what. That’s all that matters."
03/24/2021,stocks,They’re looking to acquire Discord as well for around $10B USD.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree with you, the snack part was more of a joke. I do believe the green stocks are going to do pretty well in the upcoming years though. Not that I’m gonna put 100% of my portfolio into it."
03/24/2021,stocks,Ok. So why would it becoming a $500B company be out of the question?
03/24/2021,stocks,"The reason I put them under medium risk was the semiconductor materials shortage. They were surefire picks for me before the shortage. I'm out of semis (and most stocks) for now. (I may actually want to use my money in the next 2 years, so not taking the long term time in the market approach currently.)"
03/24/2021,stocks,They have about 10 other vaccines in the pipeline. It said 5-10 years.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I could agree. Which is why im still holding my square/ paypal through this correction. I dont got much invested yet but if it was 10 years down the road and i had X times more invested and it was still as volatile and i was nearing when i wanted to pull put that money i would definitely say volatility means higher risk. 

Its just like why investing in B T C is such a risk. Could go to 100k. Could go to 1k. Could go up and down 5k every week. No one knows. But if you hve 100k in there you were only a year away from withdrawing its too volatile/ risky to hold (at least for me). Id rather gain 2% that year than take a chance of losing 10% even if i COULD have gain 20%"
03/24/2021,stocks,Recently saw that. Stock definitely reacted. Worst part is the day before is when i was considering buying in 🤦‍♂️
03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree, I'm in on YOLO myself. 

&#x200B;

(Though I hate the name. It probably deters serious buyers while attracting meme-ers.)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Maybe in 20 to 30 years, its valuation based on financial metrics is already insanely high and overvalued. Even projecting 50% growth next year its valuation is still really high.  Id definitely expect a return to the mean and for the stock to not move much as it grows into its current share price after it ran up hundreds of percent in the last year-ish time frame. I could be wrong tho. Just my random opinion."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Im long 15-20 years with my portfolio. I feel confident that they will do good over that time. Its another reason i chose SMH over individual stocks. Over time theyll rebalance to add and remove better semis. 

Semis aint going anywhere as technology increases and especially as EV grows more. For me its a good 5% Portfolio position."
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve got quite a few shares in both MJ and YOLO. The ETFS have been showing steady growth.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yup. Who knows. It’s all a guess. 

Them moving into private sector with enterprise software solutions opens a lot of doors."
2021-03-24 05:21:38,stocks,"Wash Sale Question $AAPL - I had over 84 shares and my Cost Basis Per Share was $130 and I sold 74 shares @ $127. I still have 10 shares and the Cost Basis Per Share is $129. If I were to buy more shares at the current price $122.54, Is it still considered a Wash Sale even if I didn’t sell all of the shares at a loss?"
03/24/2021,stocks,It will be if you sold your 74 shares in the past 30 days.
03/24/2021,stocks,Need more info. How much time between sale and potential buy?
03/24/2021,stocks,"[schwab wash sale](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/a-primer-on-wash-sales#:~:text=The%20wash%2Dsale%20rule%20was,or%20after%20the%20sale%20date)

It primarily depends on how long between the sale and re-purchase.

Edit: any shares purchased to replace recently sold ones count under wash sale. wash sale is meant to discourage traders from selling at a loss so they can briefly lower their taxed income."
03/24/2021,stocks,Don’t sell
03/24/2021,stocks,"The way I understand it, and someone please jump in and correct me where I’m wrong: 

Buy 10 shares of ABC for $20 on Feb 1 ($200 investment).

Stock tanks for whatever reason and you sell 5 shares of ABC at $10 on Feb 10 ($50 loss).

You then buy 20 shares of ABC at $5 ($100 investment).

To figure out your cost basis, you would take the  disallowed loss from the wash sale ($50 -because you bought a similar or identical stock within 30 days after selling for a loss) and add it back to your investment then divide by the number of shares you have. 

10 @ $20 : $200
5 @ $10 : $50 disallowed loss
20 @ $5 : $100 + $50 disallowed loss from above = $150

Cost basis becomes 5 shares + 20 shares = 25
shares / $350 (original investment + disallowed loss + latest investment)..... $14 DCA"
03/24/2021,stocks,No profit no problem. You can buy them now sell later at a loss again.
03/24/2021,stocks,"So it doesn’t matter that I didn’t sell all of my underlying shares, since I still sold at a loss I still can’t purchase any shares until 30 days?"
03/24/2021,stocks,They we’re sold on March 12. And the potential buy date let’s say it would’ve been one of these upcoming days.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Might be asking wayyyy to much with this one. If I were to buy the shares and let’s put a scenario that it skyrockets to around $300 per/share. Will it still be worth to buy, or will the taxes screw me way to much?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Doesn’t really answer my question, but I appreciate the advice."
03/24/2021,stocks,What would the $14 DCA mean?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Correct.

But, I mean you CAN buy them, it comes down to if you WANT to and eat the difference."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Wash sale unless you wait 30 days. They way this is calculate on your taxes is what matters. You’re taking a loss. You want that loss to offset gains. On your year end tax statement it will automatically disallow your losses on those 74 shares if buy back 74 more shares at a lower price within 30 days. So you gotta wait till mid April. Remember if you think Apple is going back up more than it needed to cover your taxes before your next sell of apple, then you buy back in and don’t give two fucks about your wash loss sale."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Read that article i linked. Its got a good example.

Its still well worth buying. Wash sale really only gets tricky if you want to deduct losses on your taxes."
03/24/2021,stocks,I believe it means it's your new cost basis per share after Dollar Cost Averaging your new purchase after factoring in the wash sale rule. Correct me if I'm wrong.
03/24/2021,stocks,"As I mentioned in another reply. Let’s say the stock skyrockets (very unlikely) to $300 per share, will it still be worth it or will taxes still screw me way to much money?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I apologize if I keep asking questions, this is super helpful. It’s just that I’m going to give an example to see if I can understand this a bit better. So let’s say, theoretically, that apple will go up to around $200 per share and I purchase around 100 shares before the 30 days. That would obviously mean I’m doing a wash sale, but if my current average is around $129 and I buy the current price $122. That would mean an profit of around $7800. Would that be worth it or would I be losing way to much of that profit in taxes?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I really appreciate your help, I’m recently trying to learn more about the market and any help like this goes a long way for me. Thank you so much."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, DCA is dollar cost average."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I have a question to regarding this, is it possible that someone buys like OP (wash sale) and then sells his entire position a few days later at a very small gain. Say $50. Is it possible then that OP would have to pay taxes more than $50 because of the wash sale or, no matter how many times you buy in wash sale , you will only have to pay a bit higher tax on the final gain  ?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you think aapl is going to 200 a share, it’s not going to happen in 20 more days (look if it does, I’ll be stoked and will continue to hold aapl until I pass the shares onto my kids). So you would wait. But you keep talking like you are going to sell at some certain price. There are so many variables that it’s hard to give you a direct answer, which I can tell you want. How long will you hold the new shares (short vs long term capital gains), your tax rate, plus more."
03/24/2021,stocks,"All else fails, find a good cpa to do your taxes next year and keep excellent records of all sale/purchase dates, prices, etc."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The answer to that entirely depends on the purchase/ sale prices. **If your loss is not allowed by IRS**, the loss amount is added to the second purchase and increases your cost basis.

Example:
Dec 1 - buy 100 shares ABC @ 55/per.
Dec 11 - sell 100 shares ABC @ 45/per. Loss of 1000$. This can be claimed as capital losses on your tax return if you don't purchase a similar product within the waiting period. 

Dec 15 - buy 100 shares ABC @ 50/per. *wash sale has occurred*

Your cost basis for this purchase is actually [(100 x 50$) + 1000$]/100 which = 60/per share (Your new cost basis) 

How exactly this impacts your taxes is dependent on too many variables to get into on here. There's tons of resources out there to help you understand this stuff,  just gotta get to reading 😉 talking to a certified tax pro is also a very good idea."

03/24/2021,stocks,Long term absolutely great. High growth as a mega cap. Its an insane company with way more room to grow
03/24/2021,stocks,Buy and hold.
03/24/2021,stocks,"You have held it for less than 6 months.  All time favorite.  Stock don’t go up everyday or every week.  The price does not always reflect the underlying business, that is where the opportunity is. If you think it is cheap , load up."
03/24/2021,stocks,One of the best companies ever... So
03/24/2021,stocks,Great stock. Buy and hold. Sometimes it just trades sideways for a while.
03/24/2021,stocks,I like the stock. Eventually it will move once 2020’s gains are fully digested and investors start realizing that Amazon is nowhere near finished growing but hey it’s part of the game.
03/24/2021,stocks,">I bought in November, and I’ve seen it do nothing. I plan to hold it for a long time,so the short term action is irrelevant to me.

Then why are you so concerned about its short-term movement, lol"
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s my second biggest holding. Iv it had it for like 4-5 years. I have very high conviction sometimes these things just need to cool off and consolidate it’s for the best imo. I actually added to it for the first time since 2016 when it went under 3k. It’s hard to know what valuation the market will give them going forward but I still see 25%+ eps growth for years to come.
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't think anyone touched on you adding a share to your Roth. I fought with myself when I started buying AMZN... the plan was to buy and hold... forever. I thought about putting it in my Roth but decided ultimately to just buy AMZN in my brokerage account. 

I look at them and all the revenue streams they have. I think they have plenty of room to grow. I kept it to my brokerage so that as the years go by if I ever want to take a little profit I can. 

The only thing I worry about is if the government ever decides to break AMZN up(every time the topic comes up, Bezos and AMZN are always first in line). AMZN will be fine but I wonder what that would look like for the stock."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Wouldn’t surprise me if amazon went sideways for a while longer. Top holding of funds and we’ll see them rotate out of it, was too big of a covid beneficiary. Great long term."
03/24/2021,stocks,"We all might be shopping, eating, filling up gas, watching and doing everything through some business that touches Amazon in the future, if you aren’t already doing this. 

At this point, they will never be dethroned in their vertical.  I plan on holding my Amazon for the next 50 years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Don’t worry about it being flat, but I’d be ready to have cash to shore up a position if it drops.

I bought 1600 and 1800 for my two lots.  It stayed around there for a while, then broke away after last march’s drop.  It could take a while to break past the new barrier, but like any stock, it could be a rocky way on the way up."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I usually use price to free cash flow as a lazy indicator to buy Amazon. Right now they’re a slightly good deal compared to historicals. I think there’s a decent chance they drop when things open up (which may be a good time to buy). I think if you buy this one now in five years you’ll be ahead regardless.

Edit: I can count on one hand the number of growth companies I own. Amazon is one of them."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I am extremely bullish on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I read somewhere half of the internet runs on AWS. Every time you use the internet, you are paying a tiny fee to Amazon. 

Covid only accelerated the pace of adoption of digital transformation technologies. More companies will conduct their businesses online. With Starlink and satellite internet, more people will have access to the internet."
03/24/2021,stocks,"So I'm up about 50% on Amazon, all of these gains happened about 6 months ago, been pretty up and down / flat since then.

&#x200B;

IMO the chance of missing out on a sudden pop is too much of a risk, so although I have a lot of my portfolio in Amazon I'm willing to wait on this one. Only a matter of time before  a rally."
03/24/2021,stocks,I keep going back and forth on if $3k is too much for a stock. Could it really double its size or more? I don’t ever think it will tank though.
03/24/2021,stocks,"As long as e-commerce grows, Amazon grows"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I think Amzn is heading lower. At least $2500. IMO, the EV, SPAC bubble has popped but there is still a lot of liquidity so i think it is a slow popped vs 1999."
03/24/2021,stocks,Completely agree. Just hate seeing it so flat for this long
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know. I think I’m just upset and holding a grudge with it cause I didn’t buy in the 1,000s when I wanted to and I watched it go up. Then I finally buy and it does nothing🤣🤣 but yes, one of my favorites too so I’m gonna add some more"
03/24/2021,stocks,Can’t argue with u there lol
03/24/2021,stocks,Because I’m thinking of adding more. Just wasn’t sure if I missed anything on it. I don’t remember it trading like this in the past but I could be wrong
03/24/2021,stocks,"Great point, I can definitely see that"
03/24/2021,stocks,Yep same here. That’s what my main question was. Add an AMZN to my Roth or go with something like VOO. Since 1 AMZN would be half of the 6k Roth contribution for the year
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'd caution against 50 year promises.  Otherwise you'd be holding your Enron and Worldcom and Lehman and a ton of other $0 stocks right now.  Even Blackberry you'd be down 90%.  

Nothing rules forever."
03/24/2021,stocks,Agree. I guess I’ve payed attention to it more since I’ve bought it and wasn’t sure if I missed something on it. Gonna add more
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ya they haven’t split tho, so I’d look at market cap more so than stock price."
03/24/2021,stocks,What does that have to do with AMZN though?
03/24/2021,stocks,"My average cost is sitting @ roughly the current price... but I've been purchasing for the last six months anywhere between ~2900 & ~3250.  

I can't tell you how tempted I was to cash out at todays price expecting to see it drop back down to close to 3k (maybe even a bit sub) due to the treasury rate volatility, but the risk of it being the 'day it took off' and me missing the boat on the almost sure eventual rise to 5k simply wasn't worth the risk.

As they say - 'a bird in the hand...'.  

It will happen.  The only question is when."
03/24/2021,stocks,Look at 2018-2019. Check out how flat that is
03/24/2021,stocks,Think it will loom for a bit until either union concerns or change if leadership progress further. For such a high value share with no dividends there’s a certain level of uncertainty.
03/24/2021,stocks,...like 5 months?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yea, it's frustrating holding big tech for the last 8 months and seeing it go sideways while EVs have run up significantly"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I mean a company at the top like that has limited growth in a short span, yet massively potential growth over a long period of time.   Perhaps take a look at some companies at the lower half of the S&P, still strong companies, but have more room for growth."
03/24/2021,stocks,True. That component is always what kept me hanging on. Still kicking myself when it was $1k in 2018.
03/24/2021,stocks,Was wondering the same. AMZN has no relation to those
03/24/2021,stocks,Perfectly said. Only a matter of time
03/24/2021,stocks,See that’s why I ask🤣. In all seriousness I guess Amazon has stuck out to me since the rest of my portfolio has performed so well compared to Amazon. Doesn’t change my views on the company tho
03/24/2021,stocks,It’s been like 8. For a growth company like Amazon it just stuck out to me
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same here man. I guess that’s why I’m so hesitant rn. I’ve watched it run up when I didn’t buy and then when I did buy I’ve watched it not move🤣 but I read a lot of great replies on this thread and it gave me some reassurance that I’ll add a little more. 10-20 years from now we will be saying we wished we bought in in the 3,000s"
03/24/2021,stocks,5 years it will be 2x. I can wait
03/24/2021,stocks,The longer it bases the more it’s going to run up when it does move. The best financial decision I ever made was accumulating Amazon shares starting around 2017. Buy and hold and sleep well at night.
03/24/2021,stocks,Much agreed
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep. The bigger the base.... 

And ya I think I’m gonna add"
2021-03-24 04:24:50,stocks,"The market will be fine Today got a lot of people anxious because it was a fairly poor day, for no obvious reasons. Here is the best explanation i found: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/pension-funds-have-to-buy-bonds-to-rebalance-portfolios-and-that-might-be-good-for-stocks.html


In short, it looks like a lot of big pension funds sold a lot of stocks to buy bonds as their quarterly rebalancing. This explains why the Yields actually went down a lot while the rest of the market as a whole was tanking.


But if you noticed, one thing did well: FAANG. Why? because analysts expect the yields going down to help the large cap growth stocks.



But i think once the large funds are done rebalancing, people will buy back into the market for sure with the low yields, and we should see growth doing better.


I think the most important thing is to not panic and hold to our red positions... If the feds was able to save us from a massive covid crash, they can save us from a tiny dip that was caused by literally nothing lol


Note: I expect April could still be volatile, but i really think the summer will good to us, and Q4 even better =)"
03/24/2021,stocks,Don’t have any more chips for this dip.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Short term? Market is going to be fine.

Long term? Market is going to be finesse."
03/24/2021,stocks,Yup I think when its all said and done - we will look back at the end of March as being the best buying opportunity of the year.
03/24/2021,stocks,Thank you. Was looking for a reason for all the red today.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Is it just today? Or is this a week long thing? In other words, should be expect more of the blood bath? Haha"
03/24/2021,stocks,"It feels like everyone got out of the pool and we're just standing around waiting for the lifeguard to tell us it's OK to go back in. I mean, I never got out, but I am anxious to start seeing some green again."
03/24/2021,stocks,"[It's just a itsy bitsy little gully.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgGLgygsqus)

Has it occurred to anyone that buying effectively negative rate bonds is a good way to make sure  pension funds eventually become insolvent?  ...or is the Fed just using them to their own ends?"
03/24/2021,stocks,I am panicking on what to buy lol.
03/24/2021,stocks,"S&P was down 3 quarters of a percent today. If people panicked over this, did they just start investing last week? We'e seen higher red days in just the last month lol."
03/24/2021,stocks,The only people that need to be worried are day & short traders/sellers. We've gotten 2 (personally I think 1.5) market corrections in the last 3 weeks and it's created plenty of averaging/buy in positions for medium to long term holds.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Most of my portfolio I'm not touching (blue chips, growth, value). Even the positions I'm deep in the red (hyper growth, cathie wood stonks) I will continue to HODL. Additionally, I'm going to cash out on select green positions and hold dry powder for when things start to stabilize. Done averaging down when the market keeps tumbling lower and lower. Furthermore, I will continue to ride momentum of meme stonks to the moon. And finally, I will buy options accordingly. Good luck to all."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The most interesting thing about today is IWM selling off, down 3.6%. In the last couple of sell offs IWM stayed relatively strong. I’ve always thought small caps are a preview of market moves, and today’s action shows de-risking. Something to watch as we keep chopping sideways is the relative performance of different sectors."
03/24/2021,stocks,"VIX was TTM low yesterday, and mid/small caps were red today‥doesn't make much sense. The divergence of DOW and NASDAQ signalled rotation, however, both value and growth stocks took hit today."
03/24/2021,stocks,"My TLT shares are very pleased, debating dumping the rest of my cash in. The economy is not recovering like people believe it is and some catalyst is eventually going to come in and sober everyone up. Long term yields are going to 0, and I’m going +80%."
03/24/2021,stocks,Bought 12 AAPL and 5 QQQ today
03/24/2021,stocks,"today was a maddd decent day for lowering my average, looking forward fellers"
03/24/2021,stocks,I was wondering why I've been seeing massive outflow from a number of the companies I've been watching. I figured it had to be ETFs or mutual funds but I wasn't sure why it was occurring. Rebalancing makes sense.
03/24/2021,stocks,Really people do you belive in bonds when ahead is big inflation?
03/24/2021,stocks,"Plzz, the market is going to be fine. People are screwed."

TINA.  There Is No Alternative.

The casino has become the bank.

If your bank said, ""we're taking  .75% of your money today for no good reason"" (above and beyond the effectively negative interest rate most banks provide), would you still keep money in that bank?

...and to answer your seemingly rhetorical question, yes, many of them did just start ""investing"" last week.  They don't have jobs that provide consistent monthly 401(k) inflows to the stock market via index funds.  They have one time stimmy checks."

03/24/2021,stocks,Large amount of money being moved out of stocks and rebalancing into bonds or rotating into other positions. Nothing crazy just a lot of sell side action and buyers are fatigued the past month. Everybody is always on edge nowadays and rush to panic sell. I’m more concerned when a single position goes down 7-8% in a day without reason than when the whole portfolio goes down 3-4% in the day.
03/24/2021,stocks,Tlt ? Really. That security looks horrible at best. Rates arent going up. To many global deflationary pressures. Of course theyve gone up a little recently. But they go up just so there is room to bring them back down.

Usually long bull markets end in crashes and the level of irrational risk taking has been through the roof recently, which is a classical contrarian signal.

Dabbling, I set up a Schwab account and bought a few shares of Tesla and Apple last year, as well as 20 or so shares of Walmart. I also have about $1,100 in crypto. I’m not exactly a baller I’m the investing space.

Cut to the point, I recently came across $25k of totally unexpected cash. I’d like to do SOMETHING with it—preferably turn it into more money if possible. My goal here would probably be more on the short term than long term as I already have a sizable retirement but no day trading—really my goal is to expand more into stocks and away from just 401k. To diversify I suppose.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I used to own those two. T had lot of debt, and they are borrowing money to maintain their div. i didn’t like that idea. 
Also their HBO max was for limited platform, they are selling Direct Tv to get the cash. 
They talked about selling CNN division too. I would rather own VZ. But LUMN is another one on SP500 list. Finviz.com
I personally own TMUS AND LUMN. 
WBA vs CVS, personally CVS is better i think. 
They both pay good div, but WBA is just not changing fast enough. For ex, CVS acquired target pharmacy and have more exposure to multiple locations. Saving rent on the building and employment benefits (one of my friend works in cvs target, and benefits are thru Target not the cvs) 
However, i sold CVS and WBA since i found better company to own,HD
Plus Amazon is entering to the pharmacy business too."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah back then, that was a heck of a market downfall in 08-09 and with those times I was scared. I had asked myself why the mutual funds didn’t protect more of my capital and I was determined not to lose money. But looking back on KSU and other things I realized I was short sighted. I had gotten hurt real real bad later and was holding WLT Walter Energy, they had the worlds best met coal plus some natural gas. I just knew they’d get bought out one day. Years past and I finally opened a Fidelity statement and it said they was bankrupt. So I was paper hands one way but diamond hands to death on the other. Such is life."

I am looking at PLTR and the marijuana sector. But they need to come down more from their recent run ups. Luckily I sold my position in APHA for 200% profit. I'm more focused now on USA mj companies like CURLF, GTBIF and CWBHF. But they need to come down."

I think parking it in a money market savings account for a couple of years is the smartest decision you could make right now, but it's also the hardest. You could watch CNBC and follow the market every day for the next year+ and the market could continue to boom....who really knows? But you're already in the market with what you and your wife currently have. You'll be taking advantage of any continued bull run the market goes on regardless, so you're not really missing out on anything. That 25k just waiting for a big correction so you can scoop up shares on a dip? That's the move, man."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Isn't the thing about VTI that (on long enough timescales) it pretty much always goes up? I understand ATH being a discouraging thing when you want to buy PLTR or AAPL but is it also a problem with something like VTI, S&P or MSCI World?

I mean yeah if there's a correction coming then it's worth waiting, but of course noone knows what'll happen"

2021-03-24 04:21:03,stocks,"Don't be confused about AH trading like I was... On TD Ameritrade, if you look at their advertisements for after-hours trading, it makes it look like you only have a limited selection of securities that can be traded after hours:  [https://imgur.com/nfm0XTa](https://imgur.com/nfm0XTa)

However, the truth is, you can trade almost any non-restricted security after hours on TDA...you just need to know the secret handshake ;)

Back in January, I wanted to trade a certain stock AH, so I made an order for that stock during AH. Since I just wanted the current price, I made it a market order. Except...the order did not execute...not until 9:30 am EST the next day during regular market hours.

The trick is you \*have\* to make your AH order a limit order; if you like the current price of the stock, then just set the limit close to the current price. Next, go to the drop-down below where you select the order type as limit, and change the Time-in-force from the default of 'Day'. Clicking the drop-down here will give several options. The second one down is 'Day+extended hours'. There is also an option for Extended-hours a.m., in case you want your order executed pre-market:

Complete the order, and presto! Your trading AH :)"

03/24/2021,stocks,"Sorry for sounding ignorant on the issue. I have tried to search this up several times and I can't seem to understand it. Just been trying to find a straightforward answer, but then I experience a different situation and I get confused.

Considering $HPR - This stock was halted twice on the way up, once on the way down, until closing  
Let's say, for example, John bought **50 shares** @ **$5** per share at **2:00 PM**.  
It's now **2:45 PM** and the stock is at **$10 per** ─ after the 3rd halt, John decides he wants to sell.  
He is unaware that trading will be halted until the market close.

*Question#1:*  
Should you even place a sell order during the halt?   
Do you place a *sell market* during the halt?   
Do you place a *sell limit* order during the halt?

John decides to place a sell limit order during the halt for 5 cents below the price at the halt; **$9.95**  
If trading resumed during normal trading hours, the order would be filled. However, trading remained halted until the market closed and still is halted now.   
*Question#2:*   
If the sell limit order was set to work after hours, and trading resumed after hours, does the sell limit order @ **$9.95** get filled? If not, what price does it get filled at if you set a sell limit order during normal hours and it doesn't get executed in normal hours but keeps working in after-hours? Should John cancel his sell-limit order right now or just leave it until after hours ends and let it cancel on its now.

thanks! sorry for posting here, I didn't want to make my own post - didnt know if it was worthy of being posted. and I saw you mentioned after hours in your post so I put it here."

2021-03-24 04:11:57,stocks,"$QD Qudian. Deep Value and Growth. As the title suggests I am going to be talking about Qudian and it’s a deep value stock. The company offers short-term loans to the underbanked   Chinese consumer market, their potential customer base is 430 million people. They also own a variety of other ventures including Wanlimu a   luxury consumer brand as well as 30% of Secoo with which they have a strategic partnership. Recently Qudian has invested in an early learning   education company (TAM $700B), as well as nearing completion on its   business park which will be completed this year.

Much like some other stocks was last year Qudian has been beaten to a pulp by the market. As of today (13/03/21) the company has a market cap of \~$490M. It’s shareholder equity? $1.655B. Yes, that’s not a typo this company has a price to asset ratio of 0.33. But now I hear you ask but what   about its earnings? In the three months to September 30 it made 87 million. Yuan? No, DOLLARS. Oh, and did I mention it has $219 million in cash?

The company has been through some tough times the last couple of years, with its regulatory   environment unstable and its earnings shrinking, that and its asset   quality decreased due to the rapid rise in delinquency rates during   COVID. I believe the company is turning the corner on this front,   however when you buy the stock you are not just buying a credit business, the CFO and CEO have stated they want to acquire companies   much in the same vein as Warren Buffet did with Berkshire Hathaway.

However   recently the CCP has stated that the next growth engine for China will not be an increase in factory capacity it will be from domestic consumption. What drives growth in an economy switching from production to consumption? Credit pure and simple. Qudian has outlasted a lot of   it’s competitors by tightening it’s lending policy, whilst this   conservative strategy has impacted it’s short term earnings it is now in   a place it in a position to capitalise on the new direction the government is taking on the economy.

Book value: $6.87 (164% above current price)

Base case: $10

Bull case: $17.5 or fair value (Excess Returns Model, Simply Wall St.)

My question is could a company testing the water through Reg A+ offering be publicly listed on OTC market?

This is because I was reserving some shares on a private company testing the water with Reg A+ offering but I found out later that the company is listed on the OTC market. So I'm really confused."
03/24/2021,stocks,I think it depends on which OTC market. You may want to read this: https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/acsec-071916-otc-zinn-reg-a.pdf even though it’s a bid old.
2021-03-24 03:30:57,stocks,"Intel and AMD I keep seeing all these Intel Vs AMD things. Yes, they are competitors. But both have the opportunity to create their own space in the market and have differentiates products. I think Intel's CEO will have a good turnaround but that doesn't have to come at AMD's peril. I think both companies are a buy currently and people are being silly about these stocks. Would love to hear others opinions, obviously there's much more to this but the main point is I see undue pessimism for both these companies."
03/24/2021,stocks,"At work I regularly interact with supercomputers, and most of the architectures I work on are Intel-based. And they have been for about a decade. I strongly doubt that will be changing anytime soon, and bigger and better supercomputers are always in demand for numerical purposes. With a progressive US leadership (at least relative to the previous administration), I expect a large chunk of funding will go into tech-reliant sciences and research (e.g., climate research, which can require massive computational resources). In my field I've never encountered any supercomputing architecture that utilizes AMD products (pretty much all Intel/Cray), although I am aware that they do exist. To that end and given its pricing history, I view(ed) INTC as relatively undervalued against the hot exuberance of its oft-mentioned tech competitors like AMD and NVDA. My view on the AMD v INTC thing is simple: 

- AMD is smaller and has more potential to grow, but I think it is inherently a riskier investment *right now*. If you're a more value-oriented investor, then you probably want nothing to do with the relatively adrenal AMD right now (or most tech in general, for that matter). Still, AMD is probably the better spot if you are betting on gaming industry growth. And as far as current tech valuations go, I feel there are far more dangerous bets out there.
- INTC is larger and more stable, but it has enjoyed far less growth over the last 1/3/5 years compared to AMD. It has more diverse offerings and probably has better name recognition across all age demographics, likely giving them an edge up on consumers who have no want for gaming-oriented or otherwise tech-advanced systems but still need something to do taxes on (boomers). this is clearly the *safer* bet, but perhaps not as sexy and likely won't end in a luxurious return."
03/24/2021,stocks,The chip shortage means there's a lot of open space for vendors. Why not do both? I'm in on SMH. It holds 6.48% INTC and 4.38% AMD at the moment
03/24/2021,stocks,"I fear people will associate current 11th and future 12th Gen performance with the new CEO. Intel has probably just woken up right now and needs to be given time to implement the cultural changes needed to compete with AMDs CPUs. 

Until then, You can buy an Intel CPU. You can’t buy an AMD CPU. You can have all the great tech you want, it means nothing if you can’t buy it. This is because Intel is a much larger company and owns its own fabs in the US and it’s something a lot of people in this sub don’t consider along with Intel being way more diversified in their overall business.

As an AMD CPU owner, there is a lot of potential value in Intel stock outside of a YouTube tech reviewer benchmark. I saw a quote here once saying “AMD is priced for perfection, Intel is priced for mediocrity”.

I believe AMD has to remain perfect to maintain its current value and all Intel has to do is just 1 thing right and they’ll start to rise again. One can make a better CPU but that doesn’t mean both can’t be great companies in the future. I hope people come to realize that."
03/24/2021,stocks,Intel is so much more than just a chip maker. If you base intel's future success only on its ability to sell CPUs than you are a fool. There stock was a steal at $48 when I bought it and its a steal now.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Agree, I'm in on both. But more heavily towards AMD. I think there is more time to DCA into Intel whereas I'd rather get more of AMD now in the present dip."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I like Intel, their valuation is low based on the assumption AMD will eat their lunch but thus far that hasn't materialized due to increased demand. Intel is doing well. They have new products on the roadmap and I want to see what happens with their GPU and 10nm desktop CPU. Expectations for both are low, so if they flop it's alright. 


AMD is expensive, but I like them because they increased product prices and they don't have any inventory. Short term I think they will do great. But long term I am concerned about Intel, especially now that they have a more aggressive mindset of going after competition instead of earnings."
03/24/2021,stocks,"AMD and Intel do not have a “fair” competition for a long time as Intel always uses performance enhancement drug (Intel’s fab advantage). Thanks TSMC, AMD finally gets its performance enhancement drug from TSMC and can square off with Intel. With TSMC’s lead over Intel, AMD will be having a lead, and cut Intel’s profit margin. For next couple of years, Intel will have a tough time."

03/24/2021,stocks,"They are finally stepping up.  It will trash their bottom line for a year or two but without them taking this big step they were dwindling away.  Short/mid term I'm still betting on AMD however, I am prepared to sell some AMD whenever INTC starts to see the first hint of income from this major expense.  To reiterate, I strongly support the move and will not sell my INTC on the drop in profits and will start to buy more when they start to see a return on their capital.  INTC will now be back in the race within a few years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"AMD has a better manufacturing plan and better engineering at the moment. The longer Intel stays in house for manufacturing without bridging the tech gap they’re going to continue to watch AMD steal their server and consumer market.

AMD is out performing Intel 2:1 on benchmarks at 0.5 of the price. Not to mention AMD is heating up the competition on NVDA for the GPU market. 

In current state the only thing Intel seems to have done to counter is slight AMD in advertisements. Meanwhile they need to span the tech gap, cut manufacturing costs, cut costs, and diversify their markets. The only other Intel signature product are their depth camera which get destroyed by Microsoft Kinect."

Intel announced on Tuesday that it will spend $20 billion to build two major factories in Arizona.

The news comes amid a worldwide chip shortage that is snarling industries from automobiles to electronics and worries the U.S. is falling behind in semiconductor manufacturing.

The announcement signals that Intel will continue to focus on manufacturing.

Intel stock price broke 52 week high after hr, but amd and tsm are down. I am not sure if intel can really solve the manufacturing long term problem by investing this 20 billion. Tomorrow I am going to buy TSM, it is down to $110 and 1 month low. I believe TSM will still outperform intel for the long term."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Guys seriously just go long on the semi conductor capital equipment stocks and ignore short term loss if the SMH continues to get hammered. Not the fabs or the chip stocks. The equipment that supplies the fabs. LAM, ASML, Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials are the obvious big names. But there are small cap winners as well.

They are in such high demand right now. It frankly is why probably the Biden administration will still not let LAM and AMAT supply SMIC (China), before Intel and TSM get built up in the United States. So it may be Tokyo Electron supplying China. I am not sure if the tariffs would still apply or not. But I know Biden still hasn't pulled down the block of AMAT and LAM supplying China that Trump put in... the stocks would be incredibly huge if they were allowed. But frankly... the corporate espionage that China is doing to try and get the tech that they desperately want (AMD, Nvidia). They are paying people from Taiwan Semi 4x what they are making at TSM to come work in China. They still can't build chips that compare. Google the guy from TSM who got caught giving specs to SMIC for huge money. This industry is big enough to start a war, if China were to make a move on Taiwan.

Chips are commodities and are cyclical. China knows this. If they were to build huge fabs, they would flood the market with chips on purpose to bankrupt companies and take control. They do it with so many industries... look at what happened to the specialty materials market. The mine that MP Materials is trying to bring back. I don't see LAM or AMAT being allowed to supply SMIC anytime soon."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This will take what, 3-5 years to build and be fully operational?

03/24/2021,stocks,"Both TSMC and Samsung are building bigger plants in the US, but it will take 2-3 years to build them. I don’t expect Intel’s plant to be constructed faster. This shortage will go on for at least another year."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Intel will still be behind TSMC even if they execute with zero hiccups. There is a lot of catching up to do in order to regain leadership position. As I’ve said before Intels monopoly is long gone and in order to sustain their revenue they will need new revenue streams for the loss of revenue due to Apple, custom silicon by big cloud provider(s) and market share taken by AMD (and will continue to take). This is the reason Intel is offering access to x86 IP for their foundry customers.

Btw, Intel foundry business will be peanuts just targeting $100 million TAM by 2025. Not so bullish i’d say. Partners may be reluctant to use Intel foundries due to poor track record.

I may be biased towards AMD but would love to have a counter argument. Long AMD since 2016

Edit: Intel’s revenue for 2021 is roughly $6 billion less than 2020 along with ~1.5% margin contraction. As far as I know, Intel is the only semiconductor company that has guided down for 2021."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Gelsinger is turning INTC back to its roots. Cheapest semi by far. This investment will propel future growth.

I am speculating they may even enter the video graphics market as well."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Is this a high margin business ?
I am not sure how this helps Intel's revenue. It could strengthen their position in the market from a supply point of view. 
They also seem to be offering up their IP. I guess that could bring in some good $$s.

But lately investors have wanted to see a plan, any plan really. 
So overall a good step I guess ?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Intel used to rely on its foundry to win competition, and got great profit margin. As TSMC is ahead of Intel now, its profit margin is getting smaller and smaller. With AMD’s cpu gets very competitive, CPU is becoming a commodity, like cars. The value to a company would be in software.  And Intel does not show its software capability yet.  Thus It is unclear for Intel’s  long term (over. 5 years)."

But what exactly has changed since one quarter ago when they were in a shambles, losing customers, lagging in semiconductor tech vision, run by a clueless bean counter?  So far they... have a new CEO who hails from software, not semiconductors, and instead of solving the tech deficit, they're paying someone else to make chips and hoping new factories in 2026 will somehow help.  Not that inspiring.  

Meanwhile, AMD is running like a machine and latest products are said to be 2x speed of the competition.  Yet AMD is down 20% while INTC is up 30%.  That divergence seems in need of attenuating."

03/24/2021,stocks,Yeah this still doesn’t make me want to keep intel lmao. They’re shit.
03/24/2021,stocks,"This has boomer hedging vibes all over it.

If you pay attention to the chip news space, AMD left intel in the dust a while ago.

By working with manufacturers like TSM they're able to better work out kinks and design flaws in their chips. As such not only is AMD ahead of them on the next big chip (7nm) but they've also made progress towards 5nm. 

Just because intel makes more chips domestically with new factories wont make their chips better, just more available. Which to me implies they're hedging their business long term on their boomer recognizable brand, and being the less expensive processor that can cater to bulk availability and low cost ( auto manufacturers)"

Listen, I am an AMD fan. I built my current PC all AMD. I have built PCs on AMD for damn near 20 years. 

But you can't ignore what is in front of your eyes, you cannot ignore the business, the investment, the market position and what a company that is ultimately roughly 7-8x the size of it's competitor is able to do and leverage. Intel has twice the amount of cash on hand than AMD has total annual revenue. 

I don't think AMD is necessarily a bad buy at all. I think Intel has been the value though and as an added bonus it is a dividend payer. It will be interesting to see where it settles at. we are popped to 67 AH, I have always felt low 70's was a good target price. Some firms are calling 90 (but then again, some are calling 40...)"

If China catches up to Intel in chip manufacturing before then, they're going to flood the international market.

PE is a stale number the day after it is released. The price is a projection into the future.

Intel is losing money and market share, thus a lower PE. 16% in network sector per their last earning call. AMD is taking their share, and Nvidia too, thus a higher PE.

I get not everyone is going to agree on AMD Vs. Intel, but that doesn't validate the PE argument. Look at $ and market share, that's a more legitimate argument come earning call time."

5,783.0	11,714.5	7,766.0	12,302.9	12,391.4

Intel had a significantly higher cash flow **than AMD had total revenue last year**. They have the time and resources to react to AMD's entry."

Intel is not going anywhere and I believe they can still stay in the game with their financial capability in R&D."

03/24/2021,stocks,"That's not what the term ""regressive"" means in regards to taxes. They pay more than comparable US citizens do in effective tax rates, but they are taxed at a lower rate than higher earners. That's what defines progressive/regressive taxation.

Further, they generally have significantly higher wages (so it's a bit silly to even consider ""comparable"" EU vs US citizens by salary, given that minimum wage in a lot of these countries is well higher than the US minimum), have all of those lovely social programs, and then they actually have their money leftover instead of being forced to waste it on bloated scams, like our insurance industry, auto industry, etc.

The point I'm getting at is that as it stands in the US, the material conditions don't allow for higher taxes on the poor. It's literally not possible- they don't make enough money to pay any extra, and the means-testing ensures that most people are excluded from resources and programs which would better their lives, and thus better society as a whole.

I don't think that in the broader discourse that people literally think that taxation should be primarily used as an equity tool, but it certainly needs to be used as one before we can ever dig ourselves out of the hole we've been put in. Expecting anything from the poor in this country is like burying seeds at the beach and expecting them to grow. The land is fallow, and it's by design."

03/24/2021,stocks,Sure. But based off Intels roadmap there isn’t anything that we don’t know. AMD will be ahead with whatever Intel is going to launch till 2023 worst case. No doubt Intel is going to become more competitive in the consumer space with the Alder Lake but AMD will be miles ahead in the data center space.

03/24/2021,stocks,"You said Intel is loosing market share to competitors. Thats weird cause it doesn't show. Intel's  full-year revenue set an all-time Intel record of $77.9 billion, up 8 percent YoY.

You said Intel is loosing money an yet For the full year, the company generated a record $35.4 billion cash from operations. That's alot of doll hairs!! Also, nice for share holders since they paid dividends of $5.6 billion.

The problem they had was poor leadership. But their new CEO Pat Gelsinger is top notch. At VMWare, Gelsinger oversaw massive growth. VMWare posted $10.8 billion in 2020 revenue, more than double the $4.6 billion it earned in 2012, the year Gelsinger became CEO. Prior to his role at VMWare Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, becoming the company's first-ever chief technology officer and helped establish Intel's position as a market leader. Gelsinger also has a technical background — he architected the original 80486 processor at Intel and has associate's, bachelor's and master's degrees in electrical engineering — which has proven helpful to other Intel leaders in the past, as well as competitors like AMD CEO Lisa Su.

Finally, because intel is a massive company they are diversifying beyond their main product line. Over the years they have invested billions in innovative startups targeting cloud and AI infrastructure, edge, 5G, autonomy, cybersecurity, client & gaming, enterprise applications, silicon design & manufacturing, and a wide range of other disruptive technologies.  Thus, they lost focus on their core, but in 2020 the company invested $13.6 billion in research and development and $14.3 billion in capital expenditures while focusing to strengthen its core CPU business. 

Therefore when you look at all those factors intel is under valued and with there new leadership they are hungry to regain their position as number one. It may not happen over night, but if your looking for %1000 returns over night go to WSB and talk to those apes.;)"

03/24/2021,stocks,"As an AMD investor I'm not overly worried by Intel's 7nm. If they were that confident in it they'd be giving more details IMO.

All they've said that I have seen at least is 2x scaling compared to 10nm which itself may or may not be a bit less dense than their original 10nm specs. TSMC's original 7nm node would be about on par with that, while N6 and/or N7+ are a bit better. Their original 5nm node would already be at 1.75x Intel's 10nm and N5P and/or N4 would be a close match for Intel's 7nm, with 3nm (due around the same time) being significantly better.

Mind you that's only density, but it's as good a proxy for performance as we can easily draw. This stuff is immensely complicated."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The correct answer is ""none."" The movement of the stock is not affected by water.

They have plenty of water in Taiwan and will have plenty in Phoenix.

From 2016:

>TSMC recycles water through techniques such as “electrowinning,” a process borrowed from the mining industry through which copper residue is removed from wastewater, allowing it to be recycled into existing in-house UPW purification systems[x]. Interestingly, the process of purifying recycled wastewater into UPW tends to be more efficient given the company conducting it knows its exact makeup, while imported water could have any number of unknown impurities[xi]. The payback period on recycling plants can be as low as 6-12 months given the aforementioned UPW purification efficiency, avoidance of heavy metals disposal fees, the salable copper recovered as a part of the process, and the lower water input costs[xii] [xiii].  Given these and other initiatives, TSMC’s process water recycling rate is close to 90% in some fabs. This proactive resource management has allowed the company to avoid interruption despite the lowest rainfall in Taiwan since 1947 and tighter government regulations on industrial water usage[xiv].
https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-cos-water-woes/

Recycling reduces their water footprint to about one golf course or 1000 homes. There are over 200 golf courses and a million homes in the Phoenix area.

No strain.

The water issue is total FUD."

It doesn't mean that they tax the poor more than they tax the rich. It means that, compared to the US, the poor pay a closer tax rate to the rich. The tax base is broader.

The EU funds social programs through broad based taxation. The US left claims they can fund those same types of programs by only taxing the rich. They're lying."

This isn't favoritism to a company. They can plan like their competitors and if they execute then $ goes up. None of what you said is laid out plans, just speculation on what the CEO COULD do.

Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us.

Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system.

We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.

Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

Edit: I can answer this though

*How do they plan to take back their market share from AMD?*

Fundamentally, this company has TONS of cash—**7 times** than AMD. They will still generate revenue and free cash flow than AMD to stay in the game by investing heavily in R&D to stay competitive."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree and no I'm not. Im saying a 3 year window to see good returns is not very long and I think Intel deserves  a closer look. They are oversold and more than just a CPU producer. I'm glad you point out how large a company Intel is. Like all companies that grow that big they  have been branching out from their main product CPUs. However, what intel really lacks is the CULT like following. The big valuations that amd, apple, TSLA all have is can't be achieved without the cult. So you might be right cause intel doesn't have that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not really. TSMC was able to make the first iteration of 7nm on DUV. Intel should be able to, if they knew what the fuck they're doing lol.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Did you read it? They're talking much more about Intel's business practices than any perceived or actual technological edge (it is briefly mentioned as a possibility because they have to).

Just about none of that is news to anyone even vaguely familiar with the literally decades-long history of lawsuits between the two revolving around Intel's unethical to illegal business practices.

And you can't just compare R&D budgets like that either. Intel has to fund their own process node improvements and build foundries. AMD doesn't. It's not AMD vs. Intel R&D, it's AMD and TSMC and Samsung and Global Foundries vs. Intel R&D."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't hope they go out of business. I am hoping they get their shit together and actually execute in 7nm, then move on to EUV and actually compete against TSMC and Samsung.

That's not gonna be the case until say 2025. 2023 target for 7nm with DUV most likely, then try EUV after. This is if they don't have any missed dates too.

I'm just saying they're not a market leader anymore and they have to slow down now and lower their $ growth to compete later. They're gonna make less money before they make more money in the short (2-5 year term)"

03/24/2021,stocks,"No new chips? Rocket lake 11th gen CPUs launch in 7 days. 

Their new GPU launches in 3 days. 

$15 minimum wage? Intel's most entry level position already pays that and in, 2020 Intel's gross margin was 10 points higher than AMD. Historically? Intel has been double, AMD is only gaining ground on price increases. 

New tech? that is the thorn for Intel but that is priced in. Intel tanked over the summer on bad tech news... then they fired their CEO installed the guy that invented the x86 architecture for them originally and now they are pricing with the optimism of turning it around."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> no new chips hitting the market, no technology improvements, spend $20 billion on fabs with inferior tech, possible $15/hr minimum wage increasing operating expenses...

As a lifetime professional nerd, Intel tech has sucked as they enjoyed industry dominance.  They got fat and lazy on severely outdated tech and AMD started whooping them a few years ago with the debut of Ryzen.

New CEO. He said it's going to take years to turn it around, which means he's got big plans, and if Intel is going to be competitive again, they're gonna have to do a lot.

New plants opening up means they mean business.  This is a great time to buy and hold for several years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Hmmm... The P/E ratio that Intel is at compared to the industry alone warrants a boost in stock price. Then considering investors are looking for value now and ""tech is over bought"", that should also be a boost. And nevermind intel basically built silicone valley and brings in around 20billion in revenue a year... Don't get me wrong AMD deserves their moment. After years of making garbage they finally came out with a good product, but intel still makes the most powerful chips and they are diversified far beyond CPUs. I think anyone who isn't invested in them now will regret it. How do I set a reminder to say I told you so? ;)"
03/24/2021,stocks,This.  This is just big talk from the new CEO to rally up the troops.  The short blip on the stock price will fade once people realize; they still haven’t solved the 7nm yield problems.  No new chip designs for 7nm.

03/24/2021,stocks,We already knew about those chips. And their margin is more likely than not going to keep decreasing as they rely more on outsourcing to TSM and Samsung (probably temporary but still plays a role). And I agree that they are pricing that in it’s just that it’s too much too soon IMO. The market is basically assuming flawless execution from this point forward. Plus institutional money was using INTC as a hedge to AMD for obvious reasons so that gave them a boost as well. Put all that together along with where AMD stock sits I wouldn’t be surprised to see money flood back into AMD and see a pullback/correction in Intel. Fair point about the wages though.

Their stock was trading like the company was going to go bankrupt it was a definite overreaction. The run down had no fundamental change just as much as the run up. I don’t see your point at all.
03/24/2021,stocks,"They “won’t be able to technologically compete with [their] competitors until 2023”? They are literally still competing. They are flooding the market with discounted chips that compete in price/performance, not to mention the huge amount of brand recognition they have with the average (non-tech savvy) consumer."
03/24/2021,stocks,AAAAAAAMEEEEEEENNNN!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, technologically compete, not based on discounted chips. In their largest revenue stream they lag behind their competitors in terms of performance. Until Intel can actually successfully produce 7nm they will be behind technologically. Now I will agree with you on brand recognition that is important, but even that can always change. But Intel is not technologically superior at the moment unless you are looking at quantum computing."
2021-03-24 02:07:31,stocks,"Bought the crash! FREQ crashed -80% after the hearing loss trial didn’t go as expected but I still feel strong about them !!!This is not financial advice!!!  If you don’t DD you can easily get burned as the stock fell through the floor and keeps dipping lower!!  

Personally I’m following them since about 3 years ago and they’ve come a long way. Sadly it seems they still have a long road in front of them, but the fundamentals are strong.

They are some of the few people tackling  hearing loss and tinnitus and their approach worked remarkably well in vitro, and also the first phase showed promising results.

Their approach, if successful, will be used to treat many other illnesses in parts of the body that can’t naturally regenerate.

I find great value in what they do and wish them a fast and strong recovery from this critical situation, not only for them as a hard working company looking to improve the life of millions, or for their investors but mainly for the future beneficiaries of this much needed therapy.

The company was very transparent in their communication of the test results and they’re currently reviewing their testing and drug delivery methods.

Also what makes me feel bullish is that they’ve doubled down on research expenses this past month, probably due to the preliminary underwhelming results of the clinical trial, to identify and correct course for the next one planned soon.

Once/if they iron out the delivery method and dosage this should bring relief to millions of patients around the world.  

I just bought more of their stock this morning after the news, and will buy more as per my monthly buying schedule.

..an all eggs in one basket situation, and this is clearly reflected by the current drop in share price.

For me what really set their announcement apart and made me double down on my initial investment, was their complete surprise of the results, and how they’ve cut to the chase, no dancing around in communicating this to their investors. 

Maybe they should get their PR person a raise heh

They were really expecting this to work after the first successful trial (albeit moderate, it was still a net positive).

I personally see a lot of real value in what they try to achieve, and how they go about it.

Having a CEO that’s a cancer survivor also helps put things and their motivations into perspective.

So yes like I said in the original post, from a investment perspective it’s high risk, and you can easily get burned.

But at the same time, if they survive this and truly bring this to the market I can see a wonderful future ahead of them, and their target patients."

Sadly that’s just so true of biotech, especially those with new, unproven tech. What many set out to do is so high stakes and audacious that it’s almost all or nothing. 

When I saw my shares drop at -80% my first worry was about the company and their drug. I knew there must have been some underwhelming news to see this crash.

Since my involvement wasn’t purely financially motivated, as I really want this drug to exist, I don’t regret and will never regret any cent I’ve spent on them.

That’s one of the main reasons I’m still on board."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I feel you. The main reasons I’ve bought FREQ stock, is that I know how debilitating tinnitus and hearing loss can be. Personally I don’t think it’s “dumb” to invest in something you need or believe in, for me it’s quite the contrary, as if they succeed you win on two fronts, and if they fail your heart was in the right place.

You might say that mixing emotions and stocks is bad, and I can’t really argue with that especially in this bull market after the things I’ve seen.

But when that emotion to invest comes from empathy, rather than pure greed/speculation, and you invest with money you’re willing to lose for a chance towards the betterment of millions, it hits differently.

I still have very mild high freq hearing loss and had lots of tinnitus attacks (latest one after Corona) 

Thankfully I’ve gotten some relief over the years by habituation and retraining of the damaged nerves with medicine and mindfulness.

Honestly if this fails, I can live with mine, but I keep hearing stories of people getting depressed and living a hard life because of hearing issues, and since I was one of them after the first tinnitus attack, I really wish others got relief, and Freq to manage to pull through these horrible times."

From  a macro perspective, small caps tend to lead during the beginning of a  new bull market. Based on everything I've read, most predictions are  that it will continue to outperform the broader market for the  foreseeable future and this correction is a very good buying point.

Take SOO or UPRO, which aim for 2x and 3x the s&p500, for instance. 

I know the risk of decay is there, but overall the most likely outcome is that the market increases you're likely to beat the market by several fold. So there's a potential for huge returns.

It seems like the worst case is if there's a badly timed crash,  which is on average unlikely. You'd lose your investment if you're not on margin, or you get margin called if you are. But then you can declare bankruptcy and be out of it all in 7 years. 

If you're young, that seems like a reasonable strategy given that the risk is minimal (7 years with bad credit) and somewhat unlikely, while the most likely outcome is serious returns.

2021-03-24 01:02:22,stocks,"BABA - Good Value? Thoughts? I was thinking of doing a more in depth DD on BABA at some point, but wanted some thoughts/input first.

My initial reaction to BABA is that it seems like it's trading at pretty reasonable prices, despite antitrust worries. But I'd like to dig deeper and was wondering what everyone thought? What else should I cover in the financial statements, what other risks are there?

&#x200B;

**Financials**

*Basic ratios*

* Trailing P/E: 27.
* Forward P/E: 20.
* 5yr CAGR: 24%.^(1)
* PEG Ratio (5yr Expected): 0.91.

These generally seem reasonable, especially given broader market averages. Are these ratios indicative of a value play here, or are they below sector averages for a good reason?

*Profitability*

* Consistent revenue growth, but inconsistent profit margin. In Q4 of 2019, they had a 35% profit margin, and haven't reached it since. Last quarters profit margin was 24.7%.^(2) It could prove problematic if BABA's profit margin continues to be unstable.

&#x200B;

^(1) [^(https://finbox.com/NYSE:BABA/explorer/revenue\_proj\_cagr\_5y)](https://finbox.com/NYSE:BABA/explorer/revenue_proj_cagr_5y)^(.)

&#x200B;

**Governmental Environment**

I'm not overly familiar with the antitrust investigations/fines imposed on BABA.

Is China likely to impose real antitrust sanctions on BABA, or is this something that will blow over? Let me know what you think.

BABA's seemingly precarious governmental environment seems to be one of the main reasons the stock has declined the last 4 months or so.

This is something I will have to do a lot more research on before posting a DD.

&#x200B;

**Management**

This is another aspect of BABA I'm not overly familiar with.

Morningstar reported the following on BABA's stewardship:

""Like many other Chinese Internet companies listed in overseas markets, Alibaba operates under a variable interest entity (VIE) structure designed to let companies bypass Chinese legal restrictions on foreign ownership in certain sectors,” explains Hottovy. As a result, foreign investors who hold shares of the firm's VIE domiciled in the Cayman Islands may find that they have limited legal rights. Further, its partnership structure could jeopardize the board’s independence, suggests Hottovy. The partnership is led by a committee of five, which includes Ma and executive vice chairman Joe Tsai, and effectively controls the board and limits the influence of outside shareholders.""^(2)

Does Alibaba's legal structure/stewardship present a significant problem long-term?

&#x200B;

^(2) [^(https://www.morningstar.com/articles/908190/8-good-companies-with-bad-stewardship)](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/908190/8-good-companies-with-bad-stewardship)^(.)

&#x200B;

**AntGroup IPO**

Seemingly related to regulatory issues, AntGroup's IPO (which Alibaba holds 33% stake in), a digital payment platform, was put on hold. One article attributes BABA's ensuing $60bn daily drop to that.

How much will this impact Alibaba moving forward? Other thoughts on AntGroup?

&#x200B;

**What do you Think?**

I'd like to get a lot of feedback before posting a real DD on this. I don't know that much about BABA yet, so I'd like to get a better understanding before posting an argumentative article on it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I live in China (have done for the past 11 years)

Taobao is huge (people on here go on about JD, they aren't even close). Alipay is huge (I'd say it's 50/50 with Wechat pay when it comes to payments, nobody here uses cash or cards). Both apps are essential to life here: Taobao is as dominant (if not more) than Amazon in the west, Alipay is a more predominant form of payment than Visa/ Mastercard in your home country. 

Anecdotes: I went to the dentists the other day and they would only accept WeChat/ Alipay. Credit cards or cash weren't even an option. Taxi drivers will look at you like you're a leper if you try to pay with anything other than Alipay/Wechat pay. Beggars now don't accept cash, they all have QR codes.

03/24/2021,stocks,Peg looks good but im not too pleased with thier pe and trailing pe ratios
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's very difficult to account for. They have 4 primary risks I can see:

1. The antitrust regulation will end their ability to force vendors onto their platform (their ""choose one of two"" policy). It's unclear if they have enough of a sustainable advantage for this not to be a big issue.
2. I'm reading that they will sustain a large fine, possibly on the order of $1b for antitrust issues.
3. Ant Financial has come under new regulation that will force them to keep capital in their assets to offset possible bad loans. Ant will not be as profitable as they were previously. Alibaba has a 33% stake in Ant. I can't quantify the effect of this on BABA, but I suspect the yanking of Ant's IPO is doing collateral damage to Alibaba's stock price.
4. The government has requested that BABA sell all their media assets out of concern they might use them to further their business interests. This might not be a bad thing, as it would free up cash they could use in their core businesses.

\#2, #3 and #4 are probably transitory issues. #1 it too hard to tell at this point."

03/24/2021,stocks,Totally agree. It arguably even offers a buying opportunity.

03/24/2021,stocks,Ant Financial got regulated into oblivion. Not as attractive now with the increased loan requirements. This is the kind of China govt drama you have to deal with when investing there. I can get the same returns elsewhere in the world without the capricious government regulatory risk.
03/24/2021,stocks,Exactly. The PRC govt just squashed Ant like an actual ant. The irony.
03/24/2021,stocks,Which Chinese stocks did you hold and for how long ?
03/24/2021,stocks,"What is the “choose one of two” policy? I wasn’t aware of anything explicitly monopolistic BABA partook in, but that sounds like it. 

Thanks for your comment, that had a lot of good information in it about governmental risk."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That’s true. I’m just saying that Ant is an added bonus. Even without it, BABA is growth at a reasonable price."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Baidu and Baba

Bought them in 2019. Made a decent return on both, but got tired of worrying about news like Trump wanting to delist, CCP messing with the companies, etc."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I guess technically it's called ""picking one of two"". Sellers are either with them exclusively or must go somewhere else. What's not clear is how much business they might lose not being able to leverage this way.

03/24/2021,stocks,JACK MA IS NOT THE CEO OR ON THE BOARD OF ALI BABA
03/24/2021,stocks,I think r/stocks and r/investing have an algorithm that auto-deletes this type of Jack-Ma-is-not-the-CEO comment any time it comes up. Everyone seems to think he is still in charge.
03/24/2021,stocks,Can't believe this is still parroted around
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the clarification.

At the same point, is it unfair to say that his comments perhaps led to some of the issues with Ant Group? If I recall it was basically right after his comments that the Ant spin-off failed. If so, I don’t think it’s irrational to say that he’s still tied to the company."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Seriously, it's insane. I wish mods would sticky that Jack Ma is not CEO of Ali Baba to the top for a couple of weeks..."
03/24/2021,stocks,"it's insanity, its been years"
2021-03-24 01:00:01,stocks,"What Are Your Thoughts Going Deep on Tech? Yolo profile, high risk. There's 15 stocks, it's dollar cost averaging being bought each week. Each stock is 6% to 16% of the profile, the majority on the lower end. It's like an ETF.

1. Apple
2. Amazon
3. ARKK
4. Broadcom (AVGO)
5. IDEXX
6. Nvidia
7. Shopify
8. SQ
9. Twilio
10. Lattice Semiconductor
11. Altria (MO - Marlboro)
12. STORE Capital
13. Paypal
14. Pepsi
15. Microsoft

I know tech sector moves as a whole, some companies won't continue appreciating so there's a mix of companies like Pep, MO, and STOR which are not tech related. However, I can't imagine all of these tech companies going down under, or being worth less 5 years from now with inflation.

The whole goal is the beat 13.6% in a year or the SP500. What do you think? DCA will make this possible? (Wouldn't do this lump sum investing)"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not exactly yolo in my opinion. Despite what everyone thinks about a bubble or a crash, tech is still the future and will always be. Some of the stocks you listed are blue chips and those always recover fast even in a crash. I honestly am still gonna be bullish on tech even in a bear market because of its sheer dominance in our society today."
03/24/2021,stocks,"As others have said, consider an ETF for some of the bigger names (especially “FAANGs” like AAPL, AMZN, MSFT). If you have special faith in one or more of them, then great, but still consider it. Big names like those make great anchors for a portfolio, but it’s also entirely reasonable to consider an ETF or two to act as an anchor (QQQ is just one, look on ETF.com for others that may even suit you better).

You have good tastes, but it’s nothing super edgy. Not a criticism at all, I just wonder if you’re benefiting by individual holdings with a balance like this. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if a couple of ETFs that fit your strategy wouldn’t be better.

I feel confident with this recommendation. I’m not going to tell you which ones — there are countless ETFs out there that could fit your approach and do you well (again, ETF.com).

Really, your high risk comes in the form of big cap corrections. For example, Shopify, Twilio, and Square are all fantastic companies, but valuation is a huge question. Your gamble is not on whether they will take a jackhammer when it comes to carving a niche, it’s whether or not a jackhammer will be taken to their stock prices.

If you’re going to YOLO and do high risk, don’t roll the dice on another repeat of past performance. *Absolutely* keep your faith in most or all of these names, but you should be seeking out new risks.

Find a company that might slip under the radar and surprise Dorsey himself when it comes to accepting crypto payments. Or maybe there’s a small-cap beverage company that people who dig Pepsi will start reaching for when they grab a soda.

In summary, you have good choices — but the market already agrees. If you want to make bets on the next all-stars, I’d focus half of your portfolio (either going forward, or rolling existing investments) on the draft rather than the Pro Bowl."
03/24/2021,stocks,Do you factor in ARKK having some of these holdings in it's portfolio too?
03/24/2021,stocks,Add google and sony
03/24/2021,stocks,I'm curious what draws you to Lattice. They popped up on my radar a few weeks ago but I never completed my planned DD
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know this Sub is about Stocks, but because the Discussion is about Tech, maybe look into Cryptocurrencys?"
03/24/2021,stocks,You forgot to add TDOC
03/24/2021,stocks,Right on. This isn’t YOLO at all and will probably outperform the market. Apple Amazon Microsoft and arguably Nvidia are blue chips.
03/24/2021,stocks,Do your DD on Disney. The multiply it is trading at doesn’t make sense
03/24/2021,stocks,Stripe looks like a sure thing but it’s going to IPO at $100b unfortunately
03/24/2021,stocks,I didn't want to directly expose myself to Tesla but it is the best of its 3 other ETFs so at least trying to get some of Arkk moment and Tesla/Genomics exposure
03/24/2021,stocks,"Cryptocurreny has no value, it's not a company that's profitable. You buy it hoping you can sell it to someone else for more. It's gambling, imo. Eth gas fees are ridiculous, Bitcoin can't become a currency, Bitcoin SV has more of a chance and it's a scam lol. Crypto is for trading, not for long term investing unless you want real risk."
03/24/2021,stocks,I don't need to do DD on them when I'm holding until retirement.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Does the multiple on anything make sense anymore? Mariott was just at all time highs, MGM is at its highest since 2008. Do you believe hotels and casinos are in a better place today than they were in 2019?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you can handle putting money into losses every day then yes, but sometimes you have to do it for years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Or say ""good luck I diversified since tech took a big nose dive after that massive bullrun"". Past performance isn't indicative of future performance..."
03/24/2021,stocks,Lol wut. Just cuz you buy a stock doesn’t mean it automatically goes up in 25-30years.
03/24/2021,stocks,Intel
03/24/2021,stocks,"Nothing. Sentiment remains the same. 

We could rush straight to bullish sentiment or take a bludgeoning next week. Or just continue on sideways"
03/24/2021,stocks,"But then because it's dollar cost averaging, everything is a better deal, until the next bull run. Basically, have to view it as an opportunity to buy stock cheap. If there's a big nose dive after the massive bull run, do you sell, or keep trusting big blue chip tech stocks to perform and recover in a few years and keeping buying? I def don't want to sell for a loss lol"
03/24/2021,stocks,Some tech names may take a long term nose dive after this past year of pandemic fueled exuberance...  but I would bet my life savings that Apple and Amazon will be higher in 2030 than they are today.
03/24/2021,stocks,You think Disney will fail. Ha.
03/24/2021,stocks,Not at all. I think you should do your homework before investing and having a long timeline doesn’t guarantee they will go up
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'll be fine. It's money I can afford to lose if it comes down to that. And if I win, then that's a retirement bonus."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If anything, Reddit is just a circle jerk of people telling others to buy tech constantly soooooo"
03/24/2021,stocks,"reddit is just circle jerkers jerking each other off. we are all gay

my banking friends say they're shorting tech stocks and i'm feelin a little iffy about square being my biggest holding. hoping to get off at 275 lol"
2021-03-24 00:59:06,stocks,"Breaking: Robinhood reportedly files confidential IPO Robinhood Markets Inc. has filed for a confidential initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a report late Tuesday - by Bloomberg. 

Robinhood is moving forward with its IPO although its listing plans could change, said people familiar with the matter. 

Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/robinhood-is-said-to-have-filed-confidentially-for-u-s-ipo"
03/24/2021,stocks,"This may be unpopular - but I downloaded the Robinhood app, then deleted it without putting any money into it.  Then I moved to Webull.  But despite all the drama, I'm very grateful to Robinhood for allowing everyday people to trade.  Before, you needed to have $2500 in an account, and pay $4.95 a trade.  After RH became popular, all the rest started no-fee platforms.  So it definitely was a game changer.  If it wasn't for its ease, I'd still be making 0 interest in a savings account, trying to save my pennies.  At least my money works for me, now.  So there should be at least a small sense of gratitude, IMHO.  Good luck to whatever they want to do..."
03/24/2021,stocks,Coin base  is a much more attractive IPO in finance. Fuck robinhood ill wait.
03/24/2021,stocks,"You can say what you want about WSB, but there are a large number of them that are going to try to rally to fuck up this IPO in some way. There is still a bitter taste from the prior fiasco and they are still (maybe wrongly) frothing at the mouth. You don’t think they will have any impact? When this IPO comes out every other post there is going to be rallying to hurt this in some way."

03/24/2021,stocks,i truly hope payment for orderflow gets banned

03/24/2021,stocks,Time to starting shorting
03/24/2021,stocks,Here's a short if I ever saw one.
03/24/2021,stocks,I wonder if they will take advantage of being public by offering shares to users for cash.  They can do share offerings every day.
03/24/2021,stocks,When RH restricts trading of RH stock due to shorting.  Oof.
03/24/2021,stocks,Puts on RH
03/24/2021,stocks,Perfect opportunity to short the stock
03/24/2021,stocks,Can someone what Robinhood actually did wrong during the GME craze? As far as I have read how they acted was less malicious and more that they literally couldn't afford to continue the trades?
03/24/2021,stocks,Time to short it into hell

03/24/2021,stocks,"ISPO... Just made it up! I

I'll sell naked puts, we'll call them a ""liquidity solution"" that way it doesn't sound illegal. I'll fund the margin requirements with cash advances from my credit cards and I'll  just keep transferring the balance around my ten credit cards so I never actually have to pay interest... When they go to zero, I won't have to pay taxes, and I'll finally pay off that revolver of free debt I used to concoct this scheme in the first place!

**SEC: THIS IS SATIRE... OR IS IT 😉**"
03/24/2021,stocks,You can't short a company before the first 3 months of IPO.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Then you would be doing exactly the same as the hedge fonds you hate.

Do you want to punish RH without selling your soul to the ""enemy""?

Make so much people as possible to stop using it. No customers, no money. No money = bankruptcy. 

The difference... you keep your hands clean"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I would love to short Robinhood if shorting didn't imply limited gain and infinite risk. Which is why I will never ever short anything as a retail investor. Losing 50% in unrealized gains is bad enough, I'm not down for over 100% losses AND paying interest on the shorts"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I absolutely WISH we could do that.

However, I absolutely WISH to not lose any more money in this bloodbath, lol. I understand WSB would say ""hold the line,"" or some shit like that, but I'm into stocks because i want to make money, not because i wanna stick it to the man."
03/24/2021,stocks,"They have zero competitive moat at all. There are a bunch of apps like Webull and SoFi that do the same thing and didn't just take a massive reputation hit, fair or not. I get that there are some differences like SoFi not offering options trading (yet) but there is nothing stopping them from doing whatever Robinhood does.

Also Webull has a much better UI. Robinhood makes me feel like I'm playing Candy Crush."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Same, I switched to schwab, but I still keep a some money on rh to gamble it on penny stocks from time to time."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Rh user, could confirm"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Personally, I like their UX too much and I don’t think the other brokers are some sort of saints either."
03/24/2021,stocks,"As much as I don’t like RH I do agree with this. They changed the game for everyone. If they do go public i will buy one share as a thank you to them and I will never sell it. 

I’d probably buy from one share to get the certificate and put a thank you note in the engraving part."

03/24/2021,stocks,I hope you still use robinhood. You deserve them
03/24/2021,stocks,Do you think that investors managing billions use Robinhood?
03/24/2021,stocks,Around half of ALL Robinhood users owned some GameStop stock. Not a minority at all.
03/24/2021,stocks,"> Pissing off all it’s customers or pissing off a tiny, loud minority?

Upvoting you because you're right. Robinhood, unfortunately, was able to grow it's user base during and after the GME scandal (it was the #1 app it iTunes for a while)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"But being heavily shorted makes it harder for a struggling company to recover and bounce back.   

You’re thinking like a retail investor and not like an institution who 1) made up their mind to short a company into the dirt, 2) has the entire financial media industry at their disposal, and 3) has essentially unlimited funds to go towards the goal of steering that company towards bankruptcy."
03/24/2021,stocks,"AMC almost got shorted into bankruptcy.

When the WSB pump hit, AMC was in a lot of debt. The pump squeezed the shorts, the stock popped, and their biggest lender decided to convert a bond to stock, taking something like $600M off the ledger. Effectively they called the loan directly on the shareholders instead of the company.

So it can happen in the right conditions."
03/24/2021,stocks,I’ve literally said that last sentence word for word at least 10x this week 😂
03/24/2021,stocks,"Many of those users are sticking with RH because they hold GME shares and don't want to miss a short-squeeze, should one occur. Others are keeping for tax reasons, others for customer service reason, ie. RH customer service has been non-existent, and retrieving money from RH has been difficult. So yes, some people will be lazy, but I still think there will be a large wave of people that switch brokers at a later time"
03/24/2021,stocks,Looking like candy crush is exactly why so many users have become addicted. It’s very sad. They should be prosecuted for their addiction-UI just like smoking companies and all the rest.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Schwab has no fee on OTC, so you could gamble it there."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Wow - I think this is an excellent idea!  And I will join you in buying a share!  It's a thoughtful gesture!  (But I will buy a share a week after the nuttiness of the IPO, you never know where the final price will rest before an IPO - burned so many times, lol)"
03/24/2021,stocks,How do you even get paper certificates today?

03/24/2021,stocks,"Don't know why the down votes. As much as I hated what happened in February, I highly doubt robinhood will tank. As a matter of fact I think it will go parabolic early on and then self correct."
03/24/2021,stocks,But why? Its a pretty controversial company and there are way better investment options available. I just don't understand the appeal to buy into robinhood.
03/24/2021,stocks,"""Unfair"" LMAO"
03/24/2021,stocks,Where did I ever say that
03/24/2021,stocks,"Interesting. You mind sharing a solid source on that because all I see is a tweet from Motherboard Twitter account and then the next tweet is about how that percentage is incorrect..

I highly doubt it was close to half but am open to be proven incorrect on this. I just fail to see any evidence of this being the case."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep. Thank you for agreeing. I actually believe my point was kinda common sense just maybe not here on Reddit. 

Here’s an article discussing just that exact point you made:

03/24/2021,stocks,"Actually no, because technically the stock price can be 0 even though the company is doing well (though I don't think something like this has happened before). If the company is making money, it doesn't matter if the stock is heavily shorted or not. The stock price follows the company's performance/financial stability and not the other way round."
03/24/2021,stocks,"AMC wasnt shorted into bankruptcy. The company was already on the decline and Covid was the nail in the coffin. However, you could say that the increased stock price contributed to it staying afloat.

But the shorts did not send AMC into bankruptcy"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Because eventually, you realize that the GME peeps won't ever listen to reason and the only tool you have against them is ridicule"
03/24/2021,stocks,"On a different post I read, a customer with Fidelity was talking to a Fidelity rep and they said that just this week they were handling over 500k accounts switching to Fidelity. And the RH fiasco was months ago."
03/24/2021,stocks,You got a lot of down votes on this but it’s 100% true. I know several people who got into stocks since January and I’ll let you guess who they signed up with
03/24/2021,stocks,"GUI most definitely matters. It’s like marrying a 1000 pound ugly ass dude, but he is great in every other way. No one will even approach them for it to matter."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Debatable. That would feel very nanny state to me, and I highly doubt a case hinging on the UI being too user-friendly actually working. A ban on PFOF would probably be a better bet, although I'm not sure if any platform would be able to offer options trading after that ban."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Entire market is free, including US OTC"
03/24/2021,stocks,Agreed I got burned on affirm well as the youngins say. “It’s got to go up” lol
03/24/2021,stocks,"Cool, you can’t answer a simple question"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I guess I’m wrong then. I just heard it. Either way, Robinhood pissed off not only GME holders, but retail investors in general. It doesn’t matter if one held GME or not - they took away their users abilities to buy and sell stocks. This is not only appaling by default, but extra so due to their whole «Robin hood, we fight for the little guy» image. They did it once, what’s stopping them from doing it again?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If stock price is low, they have no room for errors, no room for extra capital (low MC) etc... So it indirectly affect them."
03/24/2021,stocks,But it does mean they can't sell stock to generate investment capital. Is also means they can't leverage loans using themselves
03/24/2021,stocks,"Short sales were significant part of the volume and were helping drive it down. If it hadn't become a meme in the mob that was targeting short sellers, the company would never have been able to pay back that loan. The shorts were keeping the stock from being valuable enough for the lenders to call it. So that's a scenario where shorts could drive a company out of business."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Shit you’re going to ridicule me for turning 8k -> 300k in a month? And then making another 50 in the second squeeze? Fuck sign me the fuck up for more of that, please please please ridicule me daddy! 

Jokes aside, even if you don’t know what’s happening, it should be *very* clear that something is amiss with that stock. Retail doesn’t have the coordination or buying power to randomly pump a stock up 500% over night into a 25b company. Nor are a bunch of people who refuse to sell dropping the price by 35% in a matter of minutes on no volume. 

It’s a pretty murky situation. It’s definitely gambling. Anybody claiming they have all the answers is probably full of shit. But on that same token, it’s pretty clear that GME apes are right about some things, and they’re making a fuckload of money for it sometimes when they time it right."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Just curious, are you against making money? Because if seeing 200% of institutional ownership doesn't come up as a $$$ in front of your eyes, then it's time to get glasses bromigo"
03/24/2021,stocks,TD?

03/24/2021,stocks,"If there were piles of scientific research showing how specific design choices in their UI fuels addictive behaviors such as constantly checking prices, putting more money into the account after losing a lot of money, high rates of panic buying and selling, would you feel differently?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"They still charge a fee for options, so not entirely free for true gambling."
03/24/2021,stocks,I absolutely can just has nothing to do with anything I said.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Quick to move the goalposts there but I appreciate you admitting it’s wasn’t true. 

There were/ are a lot of RH customers pissed off about how they handled GME, but I still stand by my initial statement that it’s a relatively small minority. 

Happy to be proven wrong if someone can share evidence to the contrary but that hasn’t happened yet."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Why don't they have room for errors? Why don't they have room for extra capital? Capital can be raised in numerous ways (e.g. bond issuance, credit facility at a bank, preferred share issuance, convertible bond issuance etc.) so I'm pretty sure they have a lot of room for extra capital.

The MC is a market determined figure. It's simply the price of one share times the number of shares outstanding. If the MC goes to 0, it doesn't mean that the book value of the company also has to go to 0. The company still owns assets, which have value. The main issue it would create is the dilution from issuing new shares at low prices which would lead to dilution (more shares would have to be issued for the same amount if the price is lower). But as I said, if the company is profitable, then they won't have any problems because they won't need to raise outside capital."
03/24/2021,stocks,I see you read a lot of those misinformation posts with high karma about GME and AMC lol
03/24/2021,stocks,"Issuing shares isn't the only way to raise capital..  Capital can be raised in numerous ways (e.g. bond issuance, credit facility at a bank, preferred share issuance, convertible bond issuance etc.). Stock can also be issued at a premium to market prices. They can also use internally generate income to invest. As you can see, they have a lot of options to raise capital."
03/24/2021,stocks,"They can set their assets as collateral, e.g. their offices, any cash they raise from the IPO; they can also do a private offering on another share class. Honestly their outs are endless."
03/24/2021,stocks,"But their business model doesn’t require them to keep raising capital. They aren’t a tech startup, they’re movie theaters. AMC was on the downtrend for a while. So the business model got them into bankruptcy. 

Boohoo the dying business couldn’t receive more money to delay the inevitable. 😂"
03/24/2021,stocks,Fidelity has a new app called Spire. I wish they would use that design on their investment app (though you can invest on there too). I don’t need all the extra shit they got in the Spire app. It’s a nice UI though
03/24/2021,stocks,"Didn't they try something similar when they sued McDonalds? Investing in general likely fuels addiction. Hell, I probably have a bit of a gambling issue at this point and I mainly use Fidelity, which has one of the stalest interfaces around."

You’d have to scroll for many minutes to find just ONE positive comment. Even the media picked up on the controversy, and the CEO was called in to testify in a congressional hearing. That just doesn’t happen with a small minority. It’ll be interesting to see the amount of users lost as time passes."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Their business model requires them to pay their debts. Convertible bonds can be redeemed for cash or stock. The shorts made redeeming them for stock non-viable.

It had modularity, and the live tiles were a neat concept, but it just didn't jive with anyone I knew who used one.  Microsoft pre-shot the market by putting what would have been a decent tablet GUI onto a personal phone sized interface (before tablets became widespread).

Android was more straightforward, though still allowing a customizable interface, and with a larger breadth of apps as you mention.

2021-03-24 00:40:09,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 23, 2021 Stocks pulled back Tuesday, extending the recent bout of volatility, as market participants considered commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Moreover, a rise in COVID-19 cases in Europe prompted a new lockdown in Germany. 

Market participants closely monitored remarks from both Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen. Powell said that “economic recovery is far from complete” and reiterated the Fed’s commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy in place while acknowledging that the economy “progressed more quickly than expected”. Yellen echoed similar sentiments, saying “ we should be clear-eyed about the whole we’re digging out of, as the economy remains about 10 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels.”

While the Fed has been resolute and reiterated this stance multiple times, the market remains volatile, with Treasury yields rising once again in anticipation of strong economic recovery and inflationary fears that could cause the Fed to reign back sooner-than-expected. We think the fear is overblown, given the Fed’s consistency in this stance. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Early today, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to ""wash up on our shores."" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.

The rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Today, the US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an “incomplete” assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)). AstraZeneca’s vaccine is not approved in the US and has been administered to around 5 million Europeans.

&#x200B;

* Comparable store sales increased 6.5%;
* Net sales were $2.122 billion compared to $2.194 billion in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, reflecting an operating environment that included a 12% decrease in the store base due to the Company’s strategic de-densification efforts and a reduction of approximately 27% in European store operating days during the quarter as a result of temporary store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
* Global E-Commerce sales (included in comparable store sales) increased 175% and represented 34% of net sales in the fiscal 2020 fourth quarter versus 12% of net sales in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter;
* Gross margin was 21.1%, a decline of 610 basis points compared to the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, reflecting an expected mix shift toward lower margin console sales in response to the launch of generation 9 consoles, increased freight and credit card fees associated with the shift to E-Commerce sales, and a broader promotional stance;
* Selling, general and administrative expenses were $419.1 million, a decline of $92.6 million, or 18%, from $511.7 million in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter, driven by the Company’s cost optimization initiatives;
* Income tax expense was a benefit of $69.7 million due to a change in the tax status of certain foreign entities, and the impact of the CARES Act, including tax benefits associated with the availability of a five-year carryback period for certain current year tax losses (which compares to income tax expense of $43.8 million in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter), and;
* Net income was $80.5 million, or $1.19 per diluted share on 67.8 million shares outstanding and included a $1.03 per share tax benefit as described above, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.32 in the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter.   Adjusted net income was $90.7 million or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $83.8 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter."

Exactly. In fact, the stock mooning was a stark contrast to their business model.

They really remind me of Radio Shack, or Blockbuster. If you need a new controller *today*, then the business model works perfectly. But there’s only so much money that can be made that way.

Here’s what I would do if I was GameStop: Vending machines. Their market segment is people who need something *right now* and can’t wait for a Prime shipment.

So, let people nab a peripheral at a moment’s notice. Maybe even support hard copy trade-ins. If brick-and-mortar still seems beneficial, replace the stores with kiosks, or partner with a place like Kohl’s or Walmart.

I dunno, I’m sure even the old CEO knew more than me, so I’m not saying I know how to run a huge chain. It just feels miraculous they’ve lasted this long with this business model."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The idea is that we are waiting for a catalyst. The conditions are perfect for the squeeze and all they need is for something to trigger it. This is why you had the news about the CFO being fired, the quadruple witching day was a thing, and now the earnings report. However it's not the earnings report that I would follow. If I were investing in the stock based on the actual company, they're making the right moves by hiring the lady who helped with Amazon and clearing out the old upper management to make way for new management. Their balance sheet is pretty good and all things considered their earnings aren't too off from expectations. I bought GME for the squeeze, but I also see the fundamentals if it doesn't pan out. I could easily see this company being worth $150/share in a couple years provided they do things right."

A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.

Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.

Public sentiment is the reason why the price is low, but this is slowly changing. By the time people start admitting GME is a good investment, this will have already rocket.

Not to mentioned they are making 37% of their revenue from e-commerce already, up 170%, are introducing PC gaming products, and are hiring a new COO, hired a new CTO, and will announce a new CFO.

It sounds more likely to me that people are selling because they expected any of the things that were being pushed on GME and WSB as super-catalysts - Ryan Cohen as CEO, buyback of shares or rollcall vote of shares. And this comes after the bullshit about 'quadruple witching hour' just last Friday. Some people are feeling like they were lied to. You can only give a specific date for the squeeze so many times before losing people who have bills to pay"
03/24/2021,stocks,Something to do with the fact that more than 100% of shares are owned
03/24/2021,stocks,"But what about those damn fUnDaMeNtAlS! these shorters have many stakes in this.
1. shorts that need to be covered
2. more competition to amazons major e-commerce monopoly which is gonna lose another portion (video games/electronics) like how they lost the pet market to chewy.

This is a marathon not a race. If you invested just for a squeeze that’s on you. But simply i like the stock. It’s selling on a future discount and is still underpriced imo. Doing 8B in revenue with a 12B market cap seems cheap too me. They did more revenue than Chewy yet they have a 45B market cap. Gme could go to that and still be cheap based on other e-commerce pricing l. It’s startling us in the face but people close their eyes."

I believe him when he says he likes the stock, and I believe one of the reasons he likes it is to stick it to the shorters.  Not because betting that the value of a stock will go down is wrong, but betting massively that the value of a stock will go down, then MANIPULATING the value of the stock to go down, is wrong.  Then when the pop hits the fan, robinhood himself comes by and says stop everything in the ultimate greatest MANIPULATION play of all time.  The behavior is enabled by the powers that are supposed to be stopping it.  The government/congress is either stupid or incapable.  Because it’s been 2 months, and no one in any position of authority seems to be able to answer one silly question - did the short squeeze happen or are the shorts being hidden week to week.  Personally I think it got destroyed when Vlad removed the buy button.  But I’ll hold my 6 shares at 175 because what I’ve witnessed this year is Big Money and Algos foaming at the mouth scraping new retail and stimulus money out of the market by manipulating the market in ways that should be obvious, but apparently aren’t, and it’s sick.

So I don’t know why he does what he does.  Probably just cause he likes the stock.  But I hope a lot of people get involved in this thing, and refuse to let go, because what I believe was supposed to be designed as a tool to help companies grow and help people to save for their retirement at times seems like a place to destroy companies and help big money clean out the little guy.

It was up by one billion, do you mean last year?

When all of their stores were open, and people were going out and buying stuff at the mall?

That is a loaded question because you don’t provide any information. Was there a gaming boom, and if there was, how much do you think GME should have earned?

03/24/2021,stocks,"Legally speaking, a company is never going to say that something WILL happen. But they also wouldn't need to have statements like these if it wasn't an issue. This statement alone is not sufficient, but combine it with data showing institutional ownership topping 135%, and it guarantees two things: 1) That at least 35% of the outstanding shares are naked shorts (synthetic shares), and 2) GME is bringing warning and awareness to longs and shorts in that they might be recalling shares. #1 is a truth, and #2 necessitates action by #1. The DTCC and GME are both going to have actions to fix this activity, both of which are similar to margin calls.

I believe that GME *must* act upon this knowledge as a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders. Because institutional ownership is greater than 100%, firm evidence is being established that naked shorts have been distributed to shareholders to the extent that the naked shorts are diluting shareholder value. I don't know which entity will act first, but somehow the outstanding number of shares will need to be reconciled, whether that is by the DTCC, the SEC, or GME, I don't know.

The issue is also related to GME share ownership (non-locked) being greater than 100% of the outstanding shares. Institutional ownership alone makes up 135% of the outstanding shares, per FINTEL. That doesn't even count retail investors. This why management is giving a warning that shorts may have to pay a premium to cover shares, until the total outstanding shares is reduced to 70M outstanding shares. This is a little different than a squeeze, and this is more of an outstanding share rebalancing squeeze. However, in GME's 10-K, they describe it as a short-squeeze"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Once again, you should try reading the filing. Pay close attention to the words that were used."
03/24/2021,stocks,It maybe not short interest specifically but the fact ownership of the stock exceeds 100% pointing to naked shorts that created more shares than that which exist
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don't know why people are surprised at how high this stock is, there are companies with much higher market caps that are burning money and some will fail completely... It's all speculation. That said I think the 13bil market cap ain't shit... Especially with the hype, this could easily go to 45bil+ in 3 years which would be 600+ a share, that's nothing in this market. There are some shit brands valued at 45bil+ with no hype like gme at the moment.  

This is just my opinion though, not financial advise at all."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The over valued thing is just weird, the market cap is basically nothing right now. 

Decent execution and I think GME could have a 45bil market cap easy. Just my opinion."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not earnings, but sales. And despite their pivot, they are still, at this point, mostly a brick and mortar retailer.

Based on their cash flows however, they are at the very least a 2B company. That is if they grow at the pace of the general economy. There is certainly some up-side. Not at a 11 billion current valuation imo, but maybe in 5-10 years."
03/24/2021,stocks,"that's because they have had declining revenues for 9 straight quarters, net negative same store sales, and declining margins. They’ve been on their death bed for a while now, and their e-commerce transition hasn’t even fully happened yet, so why should it be valued as such"

03/24/2021,stocks,"Buddy. GME’s EPS is -4. Lmao there is no such thing as FUD. The thing is a dumpster fire in a casino. There is no short squeeze and their earnings were ok considering everyone was playing video games last year. If you like the stock go right ahead but GME is as overvalued as TSLA. TSLA is doing great so maybe they will too. I don’t have a crystal ball.

Also I didn’t write the post, many articles quoted it."
03/24/2021,stocks,"That’s not what is said. It’s the risk section in which they describe potential risks. “A short squeeze happened already; it could happen again.  This is what a short squeeze is”. 

Nowhere does it state the short interest. 

The last bold sentence is written in the future conditional. “If something is true, I will do this.”

Consider it written this way:

> If aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure will have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock."
03/24/2021,stocks,Priced in. $30 and $40 is actually a really good valuation for gamestop. I thought DFV is bloody smart buying the 2nd one but he is playing people by not setting them straight.
03/24/2021,stocks,"True - but the key difference there is future potential. Whatever you say about Tesla, they are revolutionising multiple industries - electric cars, batteries, self-driving AI etc.

The same can’t be said for GameStop - whilst Ryan Cohen being on the board is a huge plus, even Cohen can’t do much about all the legacy GameStop stores which are loss-making. Currently they’re closing stores which is good - but even as they move into online, they will have stiff competition from Amazon etc.

Plus of course all these future plans require cold hard cash - so the more losses GME have now, the more shares they will have to issue in the future to fund these plans (hence diluting existing shareholders more)"
03/24/2021,stocks,">“Being forced to make a complete transformative change” that’s an odd way to put Cohen who could live a rich man for the rest of his life, being proactive and making an activist play to transform a company while firing and hiring executives. 

Personally I think Cohen can transform the company... in 10 years... after they issue large amounts of stock offerings...

That just means that the 25$ price that GME was at before this mess was pretty high, nevermind the 180$ price it's at today."

03/24/2021,stocks,They're not typical words because nothing happening with GME is typical. Other filings don't include these words because other stocks haven't been hovering at 20+ times their on-paper value with IV pumped through the roof for over a month. GameStop's lawyers had a lot of ass-covering to do that most companies don't.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Considering the video market is forecasting to be about 300B in 2025 at 45B they have a 15% market share which imo is plausible with a p/s equal to that of other e-commerce companies as that is their plan. I’m holding a handful of shares that i plan to hold long term that will be inflated like tesla imo due to retail love and hype with squeeze potential on top being the icing on the cake.

When more than a third of your business is e-commerce and your sales were short by 5% from a 2019 estimates, meaning they fell 5% short WITHOUT taking into account the pandemic, something is going really good, especially for a brick and mortar.

Not to mentioned Ryan Cohen is in control of the board, it’s in charge of the transition process for GameStop into an e-commerce, and has hired a new CTO, COO, and will soon hire a new CFO, you can see this is heading somewhere else.

Because they have $600 million in cash, and their e-commerce grew 170%, and makes 35% of their revenue.

If they are making more money, are spending less money, have positive cash flow, and are transitioning into e-commerce successfully how are they a dumpster fire?

If so, I agree: We had a big hit to a large number of families. Many of them still have yet to find a buoy so they can stop treading water.

Now, I’m not sure what that has to do with the point I was trying to make. After all, many of the people who maintained employment and had even more expendable income (stimulus) had money to splurge. And the places they would spend that money if they wanted to get the latest consoles or games? Amazon, Xbox Live, etc.

The people who were trying to stay afloat spent even less on gaming.

The people who had money to blow spent even more.

I definitely see Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and Best Buy as companies with revenues linked to either demographic. GameStop? It literally feels like arguing Blockbuster versus Netflix in an era where we have Hulu, and Sling, and Prime, and Fubu, and..."

03/24/2021,stocks,"i think as it concerns gamestop, its definitely a supply issue. but thats due to the insane demand in the overall market for ps5. sony could probably make more, but it seems like they literally cannot keep up with demand. scalping is a huge role in that, but the overall demand for ps5 is insane. same with any new GPU. theres just so many gamers willing to spend."
03/24/2021,stocks,"To play devil's advocate, part of running a business is ensuring supply.

Was mostly referring to that comment. They are getting there, and actually as of today has the ability to download games electronically via the Gamestop website. 

If you still see GME as Blockbuster, by all means. But you are looking in the past and not at the new variables in play. The change I mentioned above being one, same day deliveries in the past few months being another...no one else is really delivering on that.

Also GME pushing into the gaming computer space. If you really think about it there isn't a resource for those not well-read on the industry. Imagine a parent wanting to buy their son/daughter a gaming rig...where do they go? GME will be the answer and the one they have name recognition to search for rather than an existing resource. Brick & mortar will remain to walk in and ask questions, also to push the 'PC Bang' Korea model. E-Commerce is only getting started & was up nearly 200% from their report yesterday"

Companies literally can't produce product. Gamestop isn't going to be able to secure 100 percent market share from Sony or MSFT either. 

With saying that they 100 percent need to diversify their revenue streams moving forward. Realistically though they're at a 10B market cap. That is laughably low. They were severely undervalued from being shorted for the better part of 5-6 years and have bought back an epic amount of shares at market prices reducing their float significantly over the years."

Edit: to further explain, they wouldn’t need to mention the short exposure being greater than the number of shares available to explain that they may have to buy the shares at a premium. Short exposure can be less than the amount of shares available and they would still have to pay a premium to buy the shares during a short squeeze"
03/24/2021,stocks,"My apologies, but I feel like my previous comment was worded poorly and would like to restate my point.

If they were indeed explaining a short squeeze and what happens as a result, they would not need to mention anything about the short exposure being greater than the number of shares of the company, because a short squeeze can happen with only 20% short exposure in relation to the number of shares available."

New revenue streams, new COO, soon to be new CFO, several other new executive hires,  closing down unprofitable locations, looks to me like they’re doing all the right things.

My only point is that they could have absolutely been decimating the market, both leading up to and in spite of the pandemic. But, better late than never. I'm glad they have been able to survive to the point where they could be lead to make these changes. It goes to show the important of good leadership.

It is simply describing the conditions that lead to a short squeeze. 

**Stock available for purchase on the open market** /= **floating stock**

If floating stock is 10 mil but there is only 1 mil available for purchase on the open market, that’s different. If 5 mil short positions try to cover with only 1 mil available to purchase, “investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares”

Exactly, and they are closing unprofitable stores, reducing rent and inventory costs tremendously, it's a great move. 

>One idea that's already been implemented is a revenue-sharing partnership with Microsoft. Announced ahead of the Xbox Series X launch, the ""multi-year strategic partnership"" sees GameStop receive a portion of every digital sale on any physical console purchased from a GameStop store.


>According to CEO George Sherman, GameStop is planning to move into the markets of PC gaming, monitors, and gaming TVs. While these are definitely a major part of the gaming market, GameStop has traditionally only dipped its toe into the PC and TV markets up to this point.

You're trying really really hard to bend over backwards to find some justification this company is going bankrupt. Sorry, it isn't. And you should put your money where your mouth is if you actually think something as silly as it will go bankrupt within a year. 

Wait, you're right bro. Cohen spent tens of millions on shares, they created new executive positions for Ecommerce and Customer Success, fired their CFO and began a hunt for a new one, and hired a new COO with Google/Amazon/McKinsey experience, just to lose all their money.

A short squeeze isn’t about buying **all the stock at once**. It’s about continual buying at increasing price points. 

Consider this:  there are 100 Honda civics in circulation. How many are available for purchase?

The float is 100 but there may only be one available for purchase. (But if the price suddenly became 10 million, there would probably be more than one available for purchase)"

03/24/2021,stocks,"Maybe this will help:

Why did r/wsb constantly suggest holding with diamond hands?  They constantly said “do not sell”. 

Ask yourself why. 

Because if they don’t sell, there’s less available for purchase. When there’s less available for purchase, the short squeeze pressure is more. 

So when the 10k discusses a short squeeze, and they say “the amount available for purchase on the open market”, they are not discussing the total amount of stock in circulation rather the amount available for purchase during the short squeeze. 

The stock float is simply the total amount of stock the company has issued that can be traded in the market. 

The stock available for purchase in the open market is the amount of stock being sold at a given time (like during a short squeeze). (So when wsb diamond hands their shares, they reduce the amount of stock available for purchase on the open market). 

That’s all I got for this discussion. Cheers!"

There’s nothing stopping them from selling other than their opinion of value, which doesn’t preclude them from being on the open market for sale. 

At no point did they mention anything about a timeline or a price point, only “shares available to be purchased on the open market”. Which includes every share sans restricted shares or insider shares that are not able to be traded due to various legal restrictions.

Under the risk related to common stock, they list risk factors in bullet point form. Further down they describe some of the risk factors. Each section is preceded by an Italicized and bold summary. It is then follows by a more In-depth description of the discussed risk factor. 

> A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.

>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”

>A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.

This entire section is nothing more than a description of a short squeeze. 

And a short squeeze is simply upward price pressure when demand from short covering outweighs supply. That’s all they’re saying. Supply and demand change all the time; it’s what determines the market price. Hence, when demand outweighs supply the price increases. 

Demand is how many people are trying to buy. Supply is how many people are trying to sell. 

So when the 10k says

> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. 

It’s just stating if demand exceeds supply, price will go up. Or, short positions will pay a premium. 

It is not saying “if short interest is >= 100%, you’ll pay a premium” because you can pay a premium at 1%-99% short interest too. 

It doesn’t say “total, or aggregate, shares available for purchase on the open market”. 

And if they were referring to total shares available, or the stock float, how would “additional shares become available”

> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock **until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.** This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”

You said yourself, a short squeeze does not require 100% short interest. It only requires demand outweigh supply. 

And that’s all they’re describing. As evidenced by the final sentences only two Sentences later

> To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.

How am I the one twisting what they mean? I’m using definitions of the words they used in the filing, while you are trying to equate it to supply and demand terms. 

They used the literal definition of stock float in the document “number of shares available to be purchased on the open market.” But you believe they mean just the shares that people are willing to sell cheap and not those that believe the value is higher?

And yes, they have explained that a short squeeze is a risk that the common stock may face in the future, including having short exposure over the number of available shares for purchase on the open market, which is a separate risk in and of itself. Which is why they used the wording that they did. I’m sure the SEC would have a problem with them saying “hey everyone, come look at how much naked short selling is occurring on our stock!” That would be no bueno!

Also, one way that additional shares of their stock would become available is a large portion of their board is planning on leaving and has already left. Therefore, some restricted stock could become available on the open market, if they decide to sell, which was not previously available for purchase. All of that is outlined later in the document, even with a timeline!"
03/24/2021,stocks,You smell like your dads taint
03/24/2021,stocks,"Well, that’s not the literal definition of stock float. 

> A company's float is an important number for investors because it indicates how many shares are actually available to be **bought** and **sold** by the general investing public.

There’s a distinct difference between shares available to be purchased and total shares. How are you going to purchase shares from someone who isn’t selling?  How are you going to buy DFVs 100,000 shares? He’s at a 15.5 mil gain. **His shares are unavailable**.   Are they part of the float? Yes. Can they be traded on the open market? Yes. Are they available for purchase? No. 

A lack of supply is what drives a short squeeze. Supply is available shares. Available shares is decreased when people refuse to sell. 

Of course If restricted stock **became available for purchase**, it would change the supply. Just like if DFV made his shares available. 

I don’t understand why you think they would specifically refer to a unique type of short squeeze (SI>100%) and then end the paragraph with “this is a short squeeze”. 

Again, **shares available to purchase on the open market** is not the same as **total shares that can be traded**. 

It’s literally just a paragraph describing a short squeeze where demand outweighs supply. Its not describing a unique type of short squeeze. It’s not describing naked shorting. It’s not that complicated. It’s literally just describing a short squeeze and ends with “this is often referred to as a short squeeze.”

But really, I’m done with this conversation."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you believe DFVs shares are just completely unavailable and that’s the end of it, I don’t think you understand why he has money in the stock market. He is investing to make money, and I’m sure at a certain price point he would sell his shares and take profit. Whether that be $500 or $1,000,000,000 a share. And no I’m not implying that it will get that high, but for arguments sake, those shares are still AVAILABLE TO BE PURCHASED. There is no imaginary “unavailable button that he or anyone holding common stock can push. This is(n’t) a video game.

And yes, total number of shares available to be purchased is the same as total number of shares that can be traded."

Context: I own a Nissan Sentra, and I love it. As does my wife. I think the quality of their product is very good. However, I notice that Nissan's stock has been dipping for a while. They seem to be offering a high dividend yield to try and attract new investors, and they seem to be coming out of their dip a little bit. I'm vaguely aware that Japan has been having some problems with devaluation of their markets, though I admittedly know very little on that subject, and I wonder if that has anything to do with Nissan's stock dipping."

Fidelity has detailed info on most stocks that trade on the NAS/NYSE, and often for larger companies that trade over the counter in the US. they have valuation estimates, financial strength, growth potential, etc. but for whatever reason, there's not a lot on Nissan when I look at my Fidelity account. some potentially good news: the P/E ratio is lower than average for the auto industry (11 for Nissan vs. 33 for the industry average). price to sales is also lower (.5 vs. 8.4), and Nissan is trading under book value. 

According to Guru Focus, Nissan ranks 3/10 for profitability, 5/10 for financial strength and 8/10 for valuation. they are unprofitable according to most recent data. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/NSANY/summary

2021-03-24 00:14:03,stocks,"$FROG DD -- A Necessity to Achieve Fully-Autonomous Driving **JFROG** is in a spot that you rarely ever see: a spot where the market doesn't quite understand what they do. You get the chance to capitalize by understanding.

This is my first real DD post, so I would appreciate feedback and criticism here. I think this company is massively overlooked, and here is why:

**What they do:**

Their main product is **JFrog Artifactory**, a universal repository for software binaries (executable code). It also serves as a mirror repository - it stores local copies of Open Source Software. They also offer **JFrog Xray**, which scans those Open Source libraries for malware/vulnerabilities. **JFrog Pipelines** then puts the pieces together, automating the ""building"" of the software. And the last piece is **JFrog Distribution,** which packages up the finished software package and delivers it to its destination (a piece of hardware, like your car, phone, watch, computer).

As a metaphor, let's use a pizza restaurant. Artifactory is the walk-in fridge, Xray is the health inspector, Pipelines is the chef, and Distribution is the delivery driver. They all work together seamlessly so that you can get your pizza.

**How this ties in with the huge Autonomous Driving market:**

JFrog already has partnerships with all of the big players in autonomous driving -- Tesla, Lucid, BMW, Daimler, Toyota Motors, etc. They actually have an Automotive DevOps conference every year ([https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/](https://summit.jfrog.com/automotive-devops/)). **JFrog is the sole reason** that you no longer have to turn your car off to apply an update, it's just done automatically over the air.

I'm going to fit the earlier framework into the framework of Autonomous Driving-

* Developers want to improve the function of their vehicles, so they write fresh new code or pull in a new open-source software package
* The fresh code they write, along with the open-source packages is stored in Artifactory
* The code and open-source packages pulled in need to be scanned for vulnerabilities - this is done with JFrog Xray
* The open-source parts and the fresh written parts need to be combined into a program and tested for errors - this is done with JFrog Pipelines
* The code then needs to be delivered over-the-air to the vehicles, seamlessly - this is done with JFrog Distribution

As the autonomous driving industry grows to over 3 trillion by 2025, this specific use case is going to **explode.**

**Other big growth catalysts:**

You may have heard of the Solarwinds and FireEye data hacks/leaks, described as a “supply chain vulnerability” attack or ""dependency confusion"". The toolset JFrog offers is the best thing on the market to combat this kind of threat, and will stand to benefit from the need to increase cyber security. **JFrog's Xray tool won the DevSecOps solution of the year award in 2020** ([https://devopsdozen.com/](https://devopsdozen.com/)), beating out all the tools available on the market by a significant margin. Analyst firm **GigaOm** also placed JFrog Xray as the best tool available, beating out other options from Gitlab and Micro Focus.

With each one of these huge leaks -- CapitalOne, Equifax, etc -- the development industry sees another huge shift towards security, and JFrog is positioned to scoop up all of this business. Side note: CapitalOne always presents at JFrog conferences now, and they're a huge champion for JFrog now that they're using JFrog's solution to plug their security holes.

**Company Background**

Founded in 2008, when they launched Artifactory. There is only one direct competitor with similar scope - Sonatype Nexus. Artifactory is both better and cheaper. Sonatype began as a plugin for Artifactory that worked similarly to Xray before Xray was released -- when Sonatype tried to encroach on the ""Universal Repo"" market, JFrog struck back with the release of Xray and nearly killed Sonatype. Sonatype still exists, hanging on by a thread, passed around from one venture capital company to another.

I've used both of these products over the years and have worked in environments with and without. I can say with conviction that Artifactory improves developer productivity significantly and secures company Intellectual Property.

Their product is used by 80%+ the Fortune 500 companies. This includes **Apple, Twitter, Tesla, Google, AWS, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook.** These companies trust this product to keep their crown jewels (the software that runs their entire companies) safe. That should tell you something about how good it is. They have a renewal rate of over 90%, with 133% net revenue retention from existing customers **(FYI, this net retention rate is top 10 in the world among SaaS companies).**

They acquired Shippable in 2019 to turn it into JFrog Pipelines, and the CEO has said that they will be using the funds secured via the IPO to continue to do strategic acquisitions. Other acquisitions include Conan, Trainologic, and CloudMunch.

They went public in late 2020 but it was a bit overshadowed, considering they came out the same day as Snowflake.

**Financials**

Comps here are based on the segment they operate in.

DataDog (DDOG) is another development/delivery infrastructure tool mainly centered around performance monitoring which the teams that use JFrog would typically also use. Atlassian (TEAM) makes Jira, Confluence, and Trello, which are used by most software teams for managing development requirements and agile dev team collaboration. They're not exactly a comparable solution, but I view them as a developer productivity tool that you need around the same time you start needing Artifactory. Crowdstrike (CRWD) is another best in class cybersecurity company that comes into play as you are in operations protecting and detecting threats as your application is running.

* As a high-growth software company, it's not surprising that their GAAP earnings are negative. What is surprising is that they're very close to profitability, and even had a quarter of profitability last year.  

   * **FROG: -$0.1861**
   * DDOG: -$0.05
   * CRWD: -$0.4763
   * TEAM: -$4.9355
* Market cap:  

   * **FROG: $4.9 B**
   * DDOG: $26.3 B
   * CRWD: $47.8 B
   * TEAM: $59.4 B
* Forward P/E Ratio  

   * **FROG: 615**
   * DDOG: 666
   * CRWD: 771
   * TEAM: 173
* No long term debt
* Their current ratio (short term assets/short term debt) is 5.3
* GAAP Margin is 81%
* Revenue growing 44% YOY, will probably accelerate with acquisitions

**Ownership**

65% owned by insiders and institutionsMost of that ownership is insiders -- there are only 5 ETFs (including an ARK Fund, IZRL) that own it. They just bought another huge block of shares a few days ago.Their final lockup release was 03/15 and there weren't really any huge sales, insider ownership has stayed pretty much the same.

**Summary**

JFrog has a great product, and they are uniquely positioned to corner a growing market (that they invented) which has high barriers to entry. They have proven to be forward-thinking and have fantastic financials.

Relay’s platform will automate the payment process for Old Dominion, digitizing reimbursements and eliminating paper receipts. The Tuesday press release said the agreement will also cover the 800 new drivers the carrier is adding to its network.

“Working with Relay Payments has allowed us to remove tedious and manual steps throughout the payment process and modernize the way we do business with our customers,” said Todd Polen, VP of pricing at Old Dominion.

The relationship allows the carrier to process millions of dollars in payments each year, realizing “millions in savings through data integration, digitalization of receipts and simplified reimbursements,” Polen added.

Venture-backed Relay’s payment network provides electronic lumper payments for the transportation, logistics and supply chain industries. The platform processes more than 150,000 payments monthly for many of the industry’s largest carriers and brokers.

The company recently closed on funding rounds equaling $43 million.

“Old Dominion is a leading LTL carrier in the U.S. who, like many of its peers, was challenged with manual payment processes that created a suboptimal experience for its customers. Our goal was to design an end-to-end solution which eliminated the use of paper-based payments and introduced operational efficiencies and increased revenue for the organization,” said Spencer Barkoff, Relay co-founder and president.

03/24/2021,stocks,"It's important to understand that your best risk/reward is to buy index funds and hold until retirement. Ride out all market downturns and don't sell. The hardest part is having the patience to wait. 

It's possible to beat this, but it's very tricky and when you screw up your portfolio returns start lagging behind.

Some people recommend using modest, low cost leverage when you are young, and buying index funds. Backtesting shows the leverage strategy performs much better than a standard 100% stock strategy. You need to be able to stomach the volatility and need to commit and stick with it especially after you get a down year. The truth is most people are very loss averse and find drawdowns intolerable. Leverage makes drawdowns worse so you really have to understand the strategy."

Prior to Covid, Airbnb's biggest advantage in China was outbound traveling, meaning people traveling out of China to other countries.

On the qualitative side, it basically has a monopoly on web traffic and video sharing and has the majority of the mobile OS market share. Arguably its weakest area is its cloud services and advertising due to competition from AWS and FB respectively, but the fact that that's their weakness is actually insanely good considering how strong these two parts of their core business are doing.

I noticed with many stocks, cannabis sector especially, there’s this trend of green weeks followed by red weeks followed by green weeks, etc. in a mostly never-ending cycle. 

I’ve been making modest gains by buying during the red market, selling high and then waiting for a dip towards my initial purchase price. Is there legitimacy to this practice? Obviously it’s not the case for many securities, but am I better of taking modest gains bi-weekly, or holding and hoping that I’ve bought in very low for a future huge gain?"

And of course, people who aren't upset that they sold their GME shares too early.

Do you believe the stock is as shorted as the folks over at the GME sub say it is? Is this situation unprecedented? Do you think a short squeeze will happen? Do you find price points of $1000, $10,000, $100,000 realistic?

Not looking for anyone to waste their time posting DD (although that would be great) but your unbiased opinions would be quite helpful. Thank you."
03/24/2021,stocks,"They stated in the conference call they are looking at at the money offerings at market prices throughout the year.  Similarly to what Tesla did.  There’s going to be a constant drag on the stock price because of this.  Any pop in the share price; they can just do a silent offering.  The squeeze is DOA.

“Since January 2021, we have been evaluating whether to increase the size of the ATM (at-the-market) Program and whether to potentially sell shares of our Class A Common Stock under the increased ATM Program during the course of fiscal 2021, primarily to fund the acceleration of our future transformation initiatives and general working capital needs”"
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you got in early I’d cut on the next *potential* run. WSB and other similar subs have posted a tremendous amount of misinformation. While DD which counters popular sentiment is disregarded as shills throwing shade.

TLDR any of those price points are not realistic. There’s too much available volume and a large number of holders that $1000 per share could offer a life changing amount of money. Not to mention where will this unending demand come from to fill that massive hole? As you get to price points higher there’s an even more stringent necessity that no volume is transferred. *I could be wrong and will swallow my words if I am.*

We’ve seen multiple times now both institutional demand and retail demand falls off quick over the $200 mark.

Following this I don’t believe a short squeeze will happen. We have no reason to believe the numbers can be misrepresented to the level to indicate a 200%+ outstanding short interest. For this to be reality a level of large underlying fraud would need to exist. A level that large I simply find unlikely. *Once again could be wrong but I trust available data.*

GME is **not** that over-shorted anymore. Because of volatility bears are able to feast and cash out 5-10%+ reliably whenever it’s not short circuited. Not to mention after previous surges nobody in their right mind holds short positions very long.

In essence, it was an amazing feat to pull off the original gamma squeeze. Just don’t forget Wall Street lost money, but part of what drove the prices so hard was the incredible surge in retail demand.

In present state Wall Street lost and adjusted their strategy, retail investors didn’t. The biggest giveaway to me is that deep OTM calls for $600+ are being opened and were selling for over $100 per contract. This is the literal definition of feeding the bears.

Full disclosure I did hold, sold mid way up both sides and both times more money on the down side. I have developed a strong bias in the past weeks. This bias has stemmed from regularity reading DDs which overtly misrepresent or misinterpret data which feels almost intentional to fit confirmation biases. It kills me internally because if you look in the other side of the spectrum there’s a group of bears that are having the feast of their lives off the table set by this misguided sentiment.

It’s a pure gamble which is far too emotionally driven for many.

While sone of the hype gets old and annoying, one thing I know is the basis for all this beginning is still sturdy. 

The hedge funds already said if we lose interest and walk away they are coming in to short that stock all over again. So while some things are hype and fluff, the reality exists that retail came in and saved GME."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I agree with both of ur viewpoints.

But one thing to look at is AMC. I have no idea what the fundamentals for a squeeze there was and at this point it seemed like AMC basically tracked GME which feeds into the theory that the big guns are just trading it out as they see fit. I wouldn't be surprised if we are another dump or another pump at this entry, and it seems ideal if ur into swing trading. 

Secondly let's say we are playing this GME squeeze game how do u know when to get out. You would need to time ur entry and exits as perfectly as DFV. Most hedge funds run trading bots which will probably prevent an 'infinite' squeeze. Theoretically hedge funds may be able to make more trading off volatility to cover interest, but that's just a guess I didn't do the math there. 

I do think the /r/GME crowd is drunk. They are creaming themselves over the 10k mentioning a short squeeze potential which is kinda common sense since it's in GMEs best interest to mention it."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I disagree on two of your points. One big catalyst to start the run up was DFV buying. People on WSB and GME follow his every move. Now, it didn't pop the stock up more than a few dollars at most, but it only took one tiny catalyst to get GME to $50, where a lot of call option strikes were sitting. The run up from 50 to 100 was pretty apparent if you were aware of the call option volume

Your Citadel theory may be somewhat right in regards to making money on the way up and down. However, one big problem is that GME just revealed on their Form 10-K that short-interest is greater than 100% of the float. They also mentioned that short-sellers may have to pay a premium to buy back shares in the near future. See page 15 of this link:

https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000032/

If the short-float is still greater than 100%, then it doesn't make sense to say that Citadel has been covering on the way up from $40. If that were true, then right now, near the top, SI should be much, much less.

I would agree that Citadel does not usually get bossed around, but certain entities are now threatening to. The DTCC has recently passed a law that allows intraday SLDs to be given out to MMs and/or HFs. This would allow the DTCC to collect on debts whenever they want, and which would not allow MMs and HFs to continue to reset the SHO through various loopholes in the system. Additionally, a share recall given out by GME would force the brokerages hand into a type of forced cover. This would effectively squeeze HFs and MMs until the outstanding shares are at minimum back to the correct number that were originally issued, which was 70M shares. Fintel and other sources currently are reporting 135% institutional ownership, while NASDAQ is reporting 105% institutional ownership.

The fact of the matter is that **I know what is going on** and so do many other people. I don't know everything, but I know a lot more than you seem to think is possible to know about the GME play currently

However, I do think it will be much harder for it to squeeze this time. When it went from $20 to $230, those that shorted at $20 lost 1,000%. At $440, they'd be down 2,000% and would've been liquidated. However, everybody that shorted at $350, 300, 200, even 100 can ride this one out because they have all made money, or they have minimal losses and probably aren't being margin called.

03/24/2021,stocks,"Got this straight from an article. 

“Early in the document, while outlining its growth strategies, GameStop revealed that it was considering a sale of its stock to fund operations and expansion costs. In December—at a time when Redditors were beginning to rally around GameStop, but before the short squeeze had fully taken effect—the company set up a plan to sell a total of $100 million in Class A Common Stock “from time to time.” 
Since January 2021, in the thick of the short squeeze, GameStop has been wondering whether to sell more than the planned $100 million worth of shares. It will depend, the 10-K acknowledged, on a number of factors, including “market perceptions about us”—or, in other words, what the stock trades at.”

Listen I’m just trying to help out traders. I literally predicted this could happen  with my comments over the past weekend regarding this earnings report.

Also note that Citadel Securities is an AP."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’ve read through some of that study in the past (Frank and Qifei are two different people,) and, from what I recall, their main argument is it is a strategy used to short stocks that are currently hard to borrow. They theorize that they short the ETF and then take a long position in the underlying assets other than the securities they are actually targeting to short, and argue the risks are much lower because of how ETF shares can be created. It’s a heavy paper for sure, but it’s not entirely supportive of what is currently being discussed, and I don’t think it mentions disassembling the ETF to access the underlying assets."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I forgot to add an ”and” between the authors.

I am not sure what we are discussing when you seem to be aware of the mechanisms. It is possible to synthetic short through ETFs (1.1 specifically mentions creation for the purpose of lending), and I imagine that redemption can come into play when you are in acute need of certain shares (for instance for Stop-Loss raids or some FTD issues).

There might be massive overhead involved, but I'm sure most of it can be automated and when you have the choice between this and bankruptcy, the route is clear. I find it incredibly suspicious how the SI should have decreased so dramatically with the amount of institutional ownership involved. Going synthetic short would provide an answer."
03/24/2021,stocks,"The institutional ownership is misleading because the reporting dates are all over the place.

My point is it’s not possible for someone to unpack an ETF to access the shares. The theory in the study is that they are synthetically shorting the stock by positioning their investment to focus their short on that specific underlying asset. I get the theory, but you are correct in that it’s an expensive means to achieve this, but would make sense in GME’s case as it was a HTB stock for a while. That said, it doesn’t do a lot to put pressure on GME because they aren’t shorting it directly, they are still shorting the ETF. they are simply trying to profit if and when the price falls without exposing themselves to the volatility."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know that you can't rely on IO. However, I've been waiting for months now for it to drop low enough, but incase I didn't miss the window, it didn't.

How certain are you that it is not possible? The paper seems to imply that creation is possible on demand, so I would think it safe to assume that the opposite can happen as well. But I generally understand creation and redemption as a more or less automatic action done by APs so that ETFs can stay close to NAV at all times, while also providing liquidity. So shorting an ETF would at least drop the underlying's prices as well.

I also only trust Citadel to care about the legality of whatever they do as far as I could throw Kenneth Griffin."
2021-03-23 22:39:21,stocks,"Metromile Discussion Looking to have a bit of a discussion on the (relatively) newly public Metromile ($mile).

In summary, they are an insurance provider which offers pricing based on mileage. They position themselves as a disruptor in the space. People like to compare them with LMND, which frankly I disagree with wholeheartedly.

1) Their model has a market penetration weakness

Only in 8 states as of now, with aggressive forecasts aiming for nationwide by 2022/2023. This would require growth rates that the company has not yet hit or shown any reason for me to believe they can hit.

The main weakness: They require hardware installed into customers' vehicles to track mileage. This hardware drains the battery, albeit slightly. I see this come up as a large issue their customers have. Furthermore, long trips are effectively ruled out unless you want to switch providers or pay absurd premiums for that trip.

2) Competitors offer this pricing structure (Allstate). The main argument here is their entire differentiation tactic is imitable by formidable players. As it stands they don't have any sustainable competitive advantage based on pricing. Competing based on price with large players is a typically cutthroat and small market. Growth will be capped under this approach.

3) They have a large physical asset base. This is not like LMND or other agile competitors' business structures. They have a physical cost basis that exceeds that of a competitive online provider.

4) They license their software which they claim makes them competitive. Risk assessment and fraud detection are the primary use of this. I believe they license primarily to other insurance providers, something which I find goes against their growth strategy. Conflict of interest between revenue models.

5) Their growth has been largely fueled by stay-at-home orders and the shift to working from home. The reason they have experienced growth in 2020 is largely due to this. They were established in this space targeting low mileage customers which made them an easy choice for insurance switchers. I believe this ship has sailed and customers will either look to switch again or at least evaluate it.

6) Their valuation is largely based on their cash on hand (200-300M range). This was raised equity and is focused on paying down their debt. They are still not making money. They are all in on growth and if they can't meet targets, this company will be crushed.

tl;dr Company isn't making money, has existed for 10 years, and has likely seen the peak of their growth stimulated by the pandemic. They face monumental hurdles and have dominant competitors to stand up to.

Disclaimer: I am short shares of $mile."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Your assessments are completely wrong. Be careful 

1) they have a lot of cash to pursue the growth. The hardware is very cheap. Metro mile is not for customers who do long trips so the battery is not a problem.

2) this is something I agree with you - they have solid competition and this is why going public gives them a lot of cash to turbo charge their growth. I do agree it’s a cut throat market due to low pricing but the future lies in the data they are collecting to understand driver and customer behaviour 

5) this is the million dollar question - whether they will continue to grow at an accelerated rate like the pandemic... I think the trend would continue as more people will continue to work from home but their 2020 growth was an exceptional one"

2021-03-23 22:30:56,stocks,Where are the “costs” associated with owning individual stocks or mutual funds? I’m reading a book called common sense investing it’s about index funds. The main argument is that index funds will always provide a better long term return than mutual funds or individual stocks due to all of the “helpers” taking percentages off the top. An example is given that shows a nearly 150000 dollar loss over 40 years with a 10000 dollar investment. My question is where are these back door costs? I use fidelity and other “free” brokers are these really free? What are the costs associated with mutual funds he’s referring to? Any help would be appreciated thanks for reading! 🙏
03/24/2021,stocks,">will always provide a better long term return than mutual funds or individual stocks due to all of the “helpers” taking percentages off the top. 

(a) index funds ARE mutual funds. indexing is one possible strategy used for investing in mutual funds. a mutual fund is an investment that's owned mutually by a group, not by any one individual. 

(b) it's widely agreed that index funds will **usually** beat active management, or **tend** to beat active management more often than not. (IMHO nearly everyone should have a core position in a low-fee fund or index covering the entire market or a cross-section of the market). but when you look at the details, however, it can get a bit more tricky. (i) value investing tends to beat the averages over long periods, but can underperform for years at a stretch; now there are growth and value indexes that adjust for this data; (ii) smaller funds with lower Assets Under Management are more likely to beat the averages, which is why funds will occasionally restrict or block new people from buying into the fund; (iii) there's some strong data that active management is more effective with smaller and international stocks, especially emerging markets, where there's less reliable data or where stocks are less liquid; (iv) there's a new topic called ""active share"", with lots of research finding that the amount a fund deviates from its benchmark is associated with beating the averages.  so **in general** indexing is hard to beat, but there are a few details in the fine print you should be aware of. 

>I use fidelity and other “free” brokers are these really free?

Fidelity charges no commission when you buy. but they charge 1 penny when you sell stocks, and they charge 1 to 3 cents per $1000 when you sell ETFs. plus you always pay something at the buy, due to the bid-ask spread. you pay the higher ask price, but the stock goes into your account at the lower bid price. the difference is usually a few cents, but can be more for some stocks, and that few cents is a fee to the market-maker(s) who handle the transactions. but overall, buying individual stocks is a lot cheaper than it used to me. 

>What are the costs associated with mutual funds he’s referring to? 

a management fee will cut into your growth. the larger the fee, the more profits they take. the fee will never eat up 100% of the growth, but it can eat more than people realize. your can play around with this calculator to get an idea how it works. you could take something like investing $10,000 per year earning 8% over 30 years, then do it with a low fee (.04%) and a high fee (1%).

03/24/2021,stocks,Am I right in thinking that using a free app like fidelity and purchasing individual stocks has no overhead cost at this time?
03/24/2021,stocks,So mutual funds have management fees and index funds don’t? The major point of the book is that index funds provide greater returns than mutual funds. So I’m confused about your comment that index funds are mutual funds. In an example provided in the book a 10000 investment in mutual fund results in a return of 114700 over 50 years due to costs whereas an investment in an index fund provides 294600. He is clear to say that it can underperform for several years as you say but statistically and historically it equals out to an average of 9.8 percent per year. There is a chart that shows index funds beating out 95 percent of large cap and 99 percent of small cap. So there must be a difference between mutual funds and index funds if index is that much better statistically no?
03/24/2021,stocks,"It's not a losers game.  On average index funds give around 8% a year in gains and for that you are paying a fraction of a percent in fees.  Actively traded funds that are doing well will return even higher.  The point of that book was that over time active funds have a hard time beating the index (higher highs but much lower lows) and because the fees are so much higher index funds are better.  Now there will be a lot of people that say if you find the right fund it will consistently beat the index and justifies the higher fees.

 John Bogle (who wrote the book you read) founded Vanguard which is a mutual fund company that is known for low cost index funds because he feels that is the best way to invest thus his book.  VOO is the Vanguard ETF that tracks the SP500.

To go along with the theory of Index vs Actively managed funds Warren Buffet made a bet in 2008 that an S&P index fund would beat any set of actively managed hedge funds after fees in a way to prove Bogle's point.  One fund took him up on it and they wagered $1 million dollars that Buffet would beat the hedge fund after 10 years and he won.  This is why some in this thread thought you were reading one of Buffet's books.

03/24/2021,stocks,"No, index funds have fees but they are much lower because they only have to rebalance to the index not actively traded.  VOO and SPY are both index funds while ARKK is an actively traded fund and if you noticed my earlier post ARKK fees are 25x higher than VOO (and honestly ARKK is actually pretty low for an actively traded fund).  In all of my examples they are ETFs as I don't know any mutual fund tickers off the top of my head.  Mutual Fund vs ETF is just the structure of the fund and how it is traded there are index funds that are both mutual funds and ETFs just like there are actively traded funds that are both mutual funds and ETFs."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Technically speaking index funds are a form of open-ended mutual funds (as a matter of how they are organized and regulated). Their management and administrative fees are smaller than those of other mutual funds since the resizing and rebalancing are largely done automatically (by software programs).

I'm sure a lot of you have had experiences lately with people who have just joined the stock market in the new craze so here's mine. I work in the construction industry and a friend of mine recently got into trading/investing. The main thing I took away from him was that he sure about everything, company's hed done minimal D&D on (basically read an article that confirms he bias) he had faith in. He would read an article and see the words analysts and then say analysts have said this company is going to be the next tesla! Or just take there word for things. Honestly with the way things are going he might make money since hes betting on all the major ev's but not from a point of knowledge. He was invested in xpeng I said there cars are nice and he said oh ive never seen one he then went on to say how he believes they will be the future of the chinese ev market with no real d&d to back it up. It was a very eye opening experience I talked alot about stocks and crypto with him & got to understand how this new money is thinking. Please dont take down this post it should be okay to discuss the negative parts of peoples strategy's as well as the good."

What is everyone’s thoughts on AMD at current price?

___________

Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics processors for servers, workstations, personal computers and embedded system applications."

Fact of the matter is that they have such an enormous competitive advantage in proprietary knowledge, processes, and technology that it would take years for anybody throwing billions of dollars at the endeavor to even reach where TSMC is at right now. That’s not to mention that these plants are going to take years to materialize and that TSMC already has plans for a $35B gigafab in Arizona as well.  
  
If you ask me, the downward pressure on AMD is coming more from the fact that it won’t be as easy to steal Intel’s lunch anymore rather than any sort of perceived supply chain weakness such as what you suggest."

If you take EPS Growth, it seems like some do a trailing 12 months and some so based on future estimates over the next 12 months. For argument sake, let’s say you use the next 12 months estimates. Given you’ve decided to use future 12 months data estimates for the EPS Growth, would you then use future estimates for share price and EPS in the P/E ratio?

03/24/2021,stocks,"> proper technical analysis 

I've been cutting and pasting this quote a lot lately: 

>Technical analysis, or the study of past stock price behavior, has been practiced ever since I joined the industry (and well before that), but it’s been in decline. Today observations about historic price patterns may be used to supplement fundamental analysis, but we hear far less than we did in the past about people basing decisions primarily on what price movements tell them

Howard Marks, The Most Important Thing (2011), Columbia University Press, p. 17. 

Marks is a billionaire, and manages over $150 billion, so he's worth paying attention to. Ken Fisher, also a billionaire investor, describes technical analysts as ""witch doctors"" in his book 100 Minds that Made the Market, and he believes it's little better than astrology in most cases. 

the risk of technical analysis for an amateur is creating the illusion that there's some magic key to unlock the market ... that if you can identify the right pattern, at the right time, you've uncovered lost treasure. but it simply doesn't work that way, long-term. the university-level research shows TA can perhaps be helpful in a few narrow situations, but overall it's simply not effective. it's difficult to pin down if the results are due to luck or TA strategy."
2021-03-23 21:20:59,stocks,"Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine? Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. 

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. 

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud** 

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! 

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. 

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. 

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. 

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends and has netted shareholders billions. 

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x. 

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years. 

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Enjoyed this DD a lot! Thanks for the effort! I am in agreement that the likely fair value is below the 281$/ avg street PT but there is some upside from the current ~239$share. Great leadership at the top and with SaaS/teams/cloud, they have a lot of runway"
03/24/2021,stocks,I love Microsoft. I’ve been holding them 1 year now. 101 shares and never selling. Make sure you’re fully seated before they split.

03/24/2021,stocks,"As a developer using Windows, VS do not get better over time. Also, Windows multi-tasking is not very good. I am skeptical about MSFT’s software quality. One great example is IE, it literally lost a battle to Chrome. How could it happen?!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Msft will never go below $200 and stay there!  Long term nothing to worry about.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Great writeup, just wanted to mention one thing because I think you might find it interesting from a data/business perspective.

Have you heard of linkedin talent insights or linkedin sales insights? They are packaging the data to help companies set high level strategy about their talent & recruiting, as well as sales market segmentation and account prioritization  (think ZoomInfo but without selling the personal info, just the aggregate stuff). Just got pitched sales insights the other day and it’s pretty neat.

Plus, targeted search is a key feature for their recruiting and sales focused enterprise licenses, while targeted ads are how they make money with marketing.

Linkedin definitely monetizes all that data in a variety of ways... I believe that’s why they grew by 1.4 billion!"
03/24/2021,stocks,Nice!  I bought in at $24 and have been adding  ever since.  On the dips I put in the chips!
03/24/2021,stocks,"I second this. Yes, Xbox 260 and One was a clusterfuck but with Phil Spencer at the head of their gaming division, I do think that they will do well. The series x and s fill in the two most important spaces, performance, and cost. Even people in gaming underestimate the power of the Xbox series s. The goal of the xss was not to be just a lower price point. It was to give a good console for Xbox game pass. People buy the xss just because of gamepass. I do think that Game pass will become just as large as the console business and bigger. Playstation has no good alternative to game pass and neither does any game studio other than maybe EA.

Also, cloud gaming is going to be big and may even replace consoles in hte future as everything moves to the cloud. xCloud is looking pretty good and by having remote servers in your homes called consoles, it makes everything so much easier for microsoft."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yep, was going to add that. And you forgot to mention msft's investment in cloud gaming -- xCloud is already on Android and will arrive on PC and iOS ""this spring"". Many, many people have been waiting for the moment."
03/24/2021,stocks,Well said !!!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Exactly. To add to your point in bold -- I have hardly ever seen people (as consumers) send Google doc links. They almost always send a Word document as attachment. And since many people already have an Office license associated with their work email, they may log in the account on their personal account as well (subject to the company policy), and continue to use Microsoft Office for personal use instead of going to Google docs."
03/24/2021,stocks,Nothing is forever.

And they did it, by inventing Chrome. On the other hand, Microsoft's business, at least in 2008, does not depend on web technologies very much, and Internet Explorer is just a component of Windows, and they do not care or have no motivation to put a lot of attention on it, which is a mistake in hindsight. msft software quality is generally good enough (despite all kinds of bugs I have seen myself, I believe it is better than most other software companies), it is more about focus.

Hopefully that makes sense what I’m asking. I’m honestly not sure if my question does make sense or not or if I’m just not fully understanding PEG. I’ve not seen an answer to my question anywhere online.

2021-03-23 21:05:03,stocks,"Taseko mines (TGB) # Taseko Mines (TSE:TKO) (AMEX:TGB) - Copper is Near All Time High - This Low Cost Producer is Taking Advantage (DD)

&#x200B;

With copper prices near an all-time high and demand growing I wanted to find a decent junior mining company that is undervalued. Taseko stood out because they have been running in the red for a number of years but have started turning it around and will likely be profitable this year.

Summary

* Copper prices are rising and near 8-year highs with demand expected to grow
* Taseko currently produces copper at a cost of $1.92/lb – current price is $4.1/lb and is hedged well against downside price risk. They are taking advantages of high copper prices
* An environmentally friendly and low-cost mine under development in Arizona is going through final permitting, and if approved this would be a significant boost to their operation

Taseko Mines Overview

Taseko Mines is a dynamic and growing mining company focused on the operation and development of mines in North America. Headquartered in Vancouver, Taseko operates the state-of-the-art Gibraltar Mine, **the second largest copper mine in Canada**, with a nearly 700 person workforce producing an average of **140 million pounds of copper** and 2.5 million pounds of molybdenum per year. **Taseko’s wholly-owned Florence Copper**, Yellowhead, and Aley projects are all **advanced staged projects that provide the company with a diverse commodity pipeline**

Market Outlook

I highlighted two key articles below - essentially copper demand is increasing and supply is dropping, which is starting to be reflected by the price of copper.

**Copper price to rise in 2021: analysts** (SP Global – link [here](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/011821-copper-price-to-rise-in-2021-analysts))

* Copper to flip into deficit
* Chinese stimulus to support demand
* Decarbonization bullish for metal

""Of all the metals used in the generation, transmission, storage, and consumption, copper remains the common denominator,"" Stifel said. ""Electricity generation, transmission infrastructure, energy storage, and consumption all require copper.""

**Copper supply expected to move into deficit in 2021.** (Mining - link [here](https://www.mining.com/copper-supply-expected-to-move-into-deficit-in-2021-says-stonex/))

Copper was already **trading near eight-year highs** in January but prices for the red metal surged again in mid-February, with March contracts reaching $4.12 per lb. on Feb. 22 – **nearing an all-time high of $4.58 per lb**. in 2011, as investors bet that supply **tightness will increase as the world gradually recovers from the covid-19 pandemic.**

Price of Copper and Taseko’s Hedge

As a mining company a lot of their value ties to the price of copper (I know, pretty obvious\*\*) Price of Copper is $4.1/lb as of writing this analysis\*\*. This bodes well for Taseko, which we will discuss a little further down in the analysis. Taseko also employees a hedging strategy, like a decent commodity production company should, to limit their downside risk

Taseko’s hedging strategy is designed to secure a minimum price for a significant portion of their near term production through the purchase of copper put options. Put options maturing over the first half of 2021: 7.5Mlbs at US$2.80/lb for Q1 and 30Mlbs at US$3.20/lb for H1 (Page 25 – Link [here](https://www.tasekomines.com/assets/docs/presentations/Taseko_Senior_Secured_Notes_Offering.pdf))

&#x200B;

Summary of how this works: Buyers of put options can hedge their downside price risk for a period of time and still **benefit from potential price gains if the market should increase**. Once the premium is paid, the put buyer has no further obligation. **Depending on price movements, the producer can either accept or leave the guaranteed price.**

This leaves Taseko in great position to take advantage of high copper prices and limit downside risk.

Mine Overview

**Gibraltar – Copper Mine in BC – Currently Operating**

* Taseko bought this mine in 1999 for $1. Can you believe that? Interesting piece of info
* On a cost per ton milled basis, **Gibraltar is one of the lowest cost operations in the world**.
* Cash cost of US$1.80/lb to produce copper
* Has produced an average of $125 Million lbs of copper on an annual basis

**Florence Copper Project – Arizona – Development Phase**

* Currently in the development phase – permitting in is process with the EPA. All major power, transportation, road and rail infrastructure are in place. Once complete, Florence will be one of the greenest sources of copper in the US
* Annual production capacity of 85 million pounds
* Permitting and construction to take place throughout 2021 and production will start in 2022
* After-tax NPV(7.5%) of US$680 million and an IRR of 37% and a 2.5 year payback

**Note on permitting.** This can make or break a mining company. Approval is obviously great, but denial can significantly impact share price of the company. In a recent SEC filing Taseko addressed the timeline for the permit process. The paragraph below highlights a positive outlook Taseko has about the upcoming approval

On December 8, 2020, the Company received the Aquifer Protection Permit (""APP"") permit from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (""ADEQ""). The APP permit was issued following a public comment period and public hearing in August 2020 where the project received strong support from local community members, business owners and elected officials. The other required permit is the **Underground Injection Control (""UIC"") Permit from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA""). The EPA's technical review for the UIC permit has identified no significant issues and the Company expects to receive this permit in the coming month.** link [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000878518/000106299321002406/exhibit99-1.htm)

Highlights from Recent Earnings Call – Feb 25, 2021

I pulled a few highlights from a recent earnings call. In summary, they are one o the lowest cost copper producers in the world and their Florence mine adds significant value to Taseko.

* CEO “We run our mining operations at the highest level we can in the lowest operating cost we can achieve. And on top of that, we ensure that our capital discipline is a No. 1 priority for us. **We produced 123 million pounds of copper for the year at a cash cost of $1.92 a pound**,
* Florence is one of the lowest capex intensity copper projects in the world. **It also has a low operating cost of $1.10 a pound**. And it's a green project that will **produce refined copper capital with 90% less carbon emissions than a conventional mine.** This will become a new U.S. domestic supply of green metal that fits very well into government plans for renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle manufacturing.
* CFO “Florence has a net present value of 680 million based on our 2017 technical report using a $3 copper price. With funding substantially in hand and removing that capex in that model, that increases the funded NPV of Florence up to 900 million or USD 3.25 per share. And **if I run that funded Florence model using 3.50 copper price, it's USD 4 per share**. And at today's copper price of 4.30 per pound, I see an NPV of USD 5.50 per share.”

Financial Highlights and Comparables

* **Analyst Price Target** \- Average: $2.63 and High: $3.00
* **Price to Book**: Taseko has a PB Ratio of 2x compared to the CA Metals and Mining industry average 2.8x. A lower P/B ratio could mean the stock is undervalued.
* **Quick Ratio: 1.25** \- The quick ratio is important for evaluating mining companies because of the substantial capital expenditures and financing necessary for mining operations. Analysts and creditors prefer to see quick ratio values higher than 1, the minimum acceptable value
* **Debt Level:** TKO's debt to equity ratio at **1.1450 which is high**. For comparison Copper Mountain Mining Corp has a D/E ratio of 0.6 and a similar market cap

Comparables with CMMC📷

One interesting thing I came is across is in a recent Copper Mountain Mining presentation they highlight their Eva project is relatively “cheap” from a capital expenditure perspective at $3.87 which is about half the average CAPEX/LOM. However they also include the Florence mine, the one under development for Taseko, **and it has a CAPEX/LOM of $2.35, which is 60% Less than the Eva project**. Link [here](https://www.cumtn.com/site/assets/files/4379/cmmc_q4_2020_conference_call_vfinal.pdf)

Risk

* **EPA Permit does not get approved** – this is unlikely but Taseko is banking on this project coming through as this mine is one of their key assets.
* **ROE: -0.07** \- Average ROEs in the mining industry range between 5% and 9%, with the best-performing companies producing ROEs closer to 15% or more. The ratio is calculated by dividing net income by stockholders' equity.
* **Long Term Liabilities**: TKO's short term assets $157.2Mdo not cover its long term liabilities CA$514.5M.

TLDR

Copper demand is increasing, supply is decreasing, and the price of copper has therefore increased. Taseko is one of the lowest cost copper producers, with a great existing asset, and they are nearing the final stages of developing another low cost and environmentally friendly mine. They are waiting on EPA approval, and if approved, the CFO has projected a value of $4.00 per share.

2021-03-23 20:36:43,stocks,"Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. (TAST) 50% Upside Near-Term *This is not financial advice. I do not, nor does anyone I advise, currently hold any position in TAST though I may enter one in the near future.*

Summary:

Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST) is underpriced given industry tailwinds currently playing out and overhang from past underperformance. I believe there is 50% upside in the near-term to $10 per share based on a bottoms-up analysis of the company and industry.

Discussion:

Carrols is the largest Burger King franchisee with 1,009 units as of 12/31/20 and 65 Popeyes locations. COVID has bifurcated the restaurant industry with large, delivery optimized chains benefiting materially and small, undercapitalized chains fighting to survive. 

Carrols was a bit of an oddity when compared to the landscape of public restaurant peers through COVID. As one can imagine, sales shifted mostly to drive-through during the 2020 period, with 86% of sales being drive-through vs. 68% in 2019. Same-store-sales were down 2.8% during 2020, a less than stellar performance in a field of clear winners and losers. The decrease was the result of an uptick in average check and a decrease in customer traffic offsetting each other. Digital sales, however, jumps out as being the largest industry lagger. Only 3% of sales in 2020 were derived from digital, which includes delivery from third-party apps. The sales trend clearly points to Carrols benefiting in a post-COVID world rather than a delivery-centric COVID one. 

With this sales dichotomy in mind, I believe Carrols is well-positioned to take advantage of a US reopening with less restaurant competition as a result of COVID. Channel checks indicate that while January and February were strained – particularly February, given weather (TN, where 11% of TAST stores are located, was hit fairly hard)– March is setting a compelling pace. Based on this, I model 5% same-store-sales through 2021, trailing to 3% in 2022 and 2% for 2023 and beyond. I believe there is upside to these numbers given the roll-out of chicken sandwiches and the impact of the stimulus. 

This level of sales increase is meaningful as management has stated in the past that 45% of marginal dollars converts to EBITDA. However, given the timing of the large integration of the Cambridge acquisition in 2019, plus the new store openings and store closures, I believe the marginal profitability is now greater than before, giving upside to these profitability figures.

A point that almost always comes up when discussing profitability is the prospect of increased minimum wage. Management downplays this and often points to New York (12% of stores), where they operate in some locals at or near $15/hour with no change to labor percentage from elsewhere in the system. A recent pricing study out of Princeton on MCD corroborates this claim suggesting near full price pass-through to consumers when wages increase. While some point to possible technological automation to counteract wage inflation, I believe that is not a factor within the investment time-frame discussed here. As a result of these considerations, I model flat labor percentage, which I believe is likely conservative given the increase in labor efficiency from the average unit volumes I have also modeled. 

Another frequent case against the stock is that it is a value trap and that the CAPEX profile makes the free cash flow picture uncompelling. While remodels are certainly a seemingly suboptimal use of capital from a franchisor investor perspective, we’ve gotten quite a bit of clarity recently on long-term CAPEX guide from management, which allows us to back into some fairly robust assumptions. Further, the recently amended development agreement (ADA) with BK gives Carrols' management the ability to grow into strength but not the obligation to open as many stores, a positive in my view. The company gave up its right of first refusal to amend this, which I think was a worthwhile trade. 

Modeling out the ADA minimum store buildouts with some catch-up CAPEX from a suppressed 2020 CAPEX figure and historical averages on everything else gives a sustainable CAPEX figure not far off from the $60 million management guide for 2021. Given the operating modeling, which I believe is obtainable, this level of CAPEX creates an attractive free cash flow picture allowing for material deleveraging of their debt over the coming years, which has actually gotten fairly expensive, particularly on the B-1 term loan and the full revolver commitment fee, which successively steps up over the next few years. While I have modeled debt paydown with free cash flow, this capital could also be deployed to higher use cases.

All things considered, I am projecting $118 million in 2021 EBITDA, which includes stock-based compensation expense, as I view that as a real cost. At the historical average EV / adj. EBITDA multiple that is a $630 million equity value, and when taking into account the conversion of the preferred shares resulting in a 63 million count results in a $10 price target.

Note that the lack of near-term catalyst pre-May earnings could result in downside pressure on the stock in the coming weeks and months. Additionally, given management, Cambridge, and BKC hold nearly 50% of the stock on a fully diluted basis, the lack of float could deter some prospective investors.  

Upside Risks:

Upside risk to my projection is higher than expected unit volumes driving profitability and making new unit development more compelling. Additional new unit upside could be found with reduced retail rents post-covid reducing occupancy cost.

Additionally, management trying to buy down their multiple with additional franchise acquisitions within the Popeyes and BK systems (historically average 4x) could add value.

Downside Risks:

Unit volumes do not come back, resulting in operational underperformance. 

Wage inflation is unable to be passed through, resulting in decreased profitability.

Potential COGS inflation which cannot be passed through to customers

Restaurant remodels are significantly higher than modeled (both in frequency and cost), reducing free cash flow projection

Management tries to buy down their multiple but has difficulty integrating acquisitions"

03/24/2021,stocks,"Congress was okay, I personally think PPP was a massive waste of money and we would have had such better results targeting people that need it and let businesses fail.

I think the Fed was right to slash rates to zero. I did not like them buying up corporate bonds. I don’t like them buying up treasuries either though that is more defensible. They should have let the bottom fall out and let the market run its course instead of artificially propping it up. 

I hope I’m wrong, we’ll probably know in 3-5 years. Kudos to Powell if he pulls it off but I think this will blow up in his (or the next Fed Chairs) face."
03/24/2021,stocks,"To learn about options I read a book ""Options as a Strategic Investment by  Lawrence G. McMillan""
Its very dry, but I mechanically put into practice some of the strategies there, first covered calls, then naked puts aimed at buying stock, etc. All in moderation can produce nice gains. I even ventured out and did a short vertical call credit on GME for a nice profit, mind you I sweat bullets for the night I held the short leg naked after selling the long side.

When you can understand and calculate risk better, then you can take on more risk. Until then, only safe plays."
03/24/2021,stocks,"ETF
CEF

Seriously you can invest in the laziest shit ever and turn a profit. Your problem was going in and out of positions too much."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Trading takes a lot of time, effort, mental and emotional strength.  If you have qualms about any of this, buy ETFs or index funds.

03/24/2021,stocks,"I was down 250k on these last few dips, but its ok, I’ve invested in companies I believe. 

I have investments in msft (substantial) amazon etc that I do not touch at all - I only add. The new investments I added in recent months - palantir as example has been very volatile and causes wild swings in my portfolio, but the trick is to do your DD and invest in companies you believe and be patient. I dont care for the swings right now...5 years from now I know these stocks will have good growth. 

On the other hand I have a limit on my fuck around account - 5k to fuck around - if I lose it who cares, but I do risky plays there (gme was one and made bank as example). But then guess what I do with those gainz - invest in my solid plays that I believe in. I’ve been able to grow over a millie in 5 years (not as crazy as some of the guys here, but I’ll take it :-)). Once you chase get rich quick plays your odds to get burnt are super high. Being patient is key."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah same here buddy. I YOLO’d massive savings.  Fortunately discussed with wife before I did. I have a little girl too so it’s a risk with massive repercussion.  Every night I check the stock and have had little sleep. I’ve actually fallen ill because of it, but getting better.

That’s why we’ve all done it for different reasons and we can’t judge each other.

Ultimately at the end of the day it’s only money and as long as one works hard they will always come by it.

Now as far as keeping hold, the question is if you’re at a loss then what’s the point of selling.  

Finally if you believe in karma  of the universe, there are too many people invest on GME with the hope of the stock going massive.  

All these positives energies will translate to the positive outcome we are all aiming for!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I’ve only ever invested in my retirement account, so this is all new to me too. I have lost money overall. I’m only playing with $1K as a way to learn. So far I find my biggest problem is not being decisive enough. Being too slow to take profits has left me no profits. I’m trying to learn from my mistakes but it’s hard. 

What do you think your biggest mistakes have been?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Losing money sucks but it is how you make money. Yea if you bought at the highest ever you may never make the money back but even in that case you can still make money if they pay dividends over enough time. 

Also the only amount you can lose is the original money spent.  Plus if only in for a year your not even planning to make the full amount you can. Capital Gains tax advantages take a year."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you try to beat the market the trouts is that most people gonna lose money,so if you are new then you should not go for that, make at strategy that reflect your level of knowledge,perhaps some index or some big solid firms maybe they look boring but the odds for making profits on the long run is much higher .."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I guarantee you're doing one of two things: either looking for ""discounts"" and buying stocks that seem ""discounted"" and are falling, hoping they turn around after you buy; or you're buying tech stocks at the top the market then selling when they barely drop and taking a loss.

Instead, pick some no-frills household brands that are slowly rising and sit on them for a year. You'll most-likely see some gains."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You need to understand the difference between day/trading and investing.

It a fact 90% of day traders go broke. This has been consistent for the last 40 years that I have been in the market.

You have just expressed the results of 90% of the people day trading using this platform. You simply had the balls to admit it.

Did you know less than 10% of all hedge funds bet the S&P index?

Now you know the score. But do not stop! 
Read refine you investment skills across all asset classes: real estate, precious metals, stock investing, etc. I mean everything books, biographies, newsletters, etc. So you can see through the crap.

Focus on 1 trade or methodology and do it over, and over again. Be an expert on 1 methodology of capital development and repeat it.

You are going to witness with the next 120 maybe the biggest crashes of my investing lifetime so be prepared to take advantage of this correction."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I know how you feel.  I have a tendency to be reckless, and I'm a glutton for punishment.  That's is my natural state of being, although I have chilled out a lot since I was a kid.  I know the moment I get greedy, and the moment I'm being too passive.  It's a thrill to win, and a comedy to lose.

You have to find a plan fit for YOUR personality.  Maybe slow and steady is the way for you (which is a great way to build true wealth).  Maybe there will be times you have a small windfall and you can have a little fun and take a risk - but you do have to do your DD, regardless.  

Every morning, I go to Google Trends, type stocks in the search and pick the Last Hour setting - see what others have been interested in.  Then I go to Stocktwits (look at the Trending Ticker), Finviz, Benzinga.  In that order.  I see what stocks people are talking about, and I look for catalysts/news/chatter/upgrades.  I also go to Finviz sometimes and use the filters - something simple like, ""Companies that have had 10% sales growth in the last 5 years"".  Then I filter by price, and go through each one to see if there is any new news.  

The market hasn't been the best, but there are gems.  If this is too stomach churning for you, I get it - just stick with ETFs with good track records.  The last 3 I chose for my IRA returned over 30% in the last year.  I found them by researching for articles like ""Best Large Cap ETFs for 2020"".  Those articles definitely exist.  There are hundreds of articles by analysts that choose the best ETFs for what you desire, whether they be small cap, tech, consumer staples, 2021Q2, whatever you want.

Information is your friend."

03/24/2021,stocks,If you started a year ago it’s close to impossible that you still haven’t make any money. The only way that it’s possible is if you all in on baba last year lol. Though baba is likely to be the best large cap tech stock to own right now.

In some cases it’s a DCF, a free cash flow yield, dividend yield, revenue multiples, PE multiples, etc and various combinations thereof. Then you must be able to tie this to qualitative analyses like best of breed, tam, etc. why don’t you start by googling for a free DCF excel download and try to value a company that already is somewhat mature with cash flow."

03/24/2021,stocks,Everyone takes a bath at the beginning. It’s like getting baptized. If your time horizon is a decade and you really don’t understand valuation you can just buy the dow and s&p and let it compound. Most pros don’t beat the market anyway. SILC will be a great buy at $45. My basis is $30 but I’m still buying here. Check out seeking alpha cobiaman for a good write up (he is Jeff Meyer a top value investor). Rare combo of 20% growth and a high free cash flow yield. Like a growth stock trading at as value stock bc it is illiquid
03/24/2021,stocks,"Don’t do a mutual fund they’ll rape you with fees. But even if you give up on the stock market, you still should plan for retirement and invest into a Roth IRA. Buy into index funds. They say you’ll average like 8% returns every year, that’s way better than just saving money. But you mentioned student loans—if you have any debt that’s around 8% or more interest, than  pay that off first before you invest anything. There’s no sense in trying to make 8% interest on your money when you’re paying more than that into debt that you owe! Then once you pay off your debt, invest for your future. What I’m saying is, don’t let this turn you off completely from opening some sort of retirement fund. You don’t want to admit that you lost, I get it, but you’re still have to be smart about your future! Open a vanguard account, and don’t think of it as “money to pay off your student loans”, think of it as a separate thing for your retirement. I’m 38 and just now starting, I wish I would have done it years ago. Now I got 3 kids to put through college, 19 years left on a mortgage, and who knows how many years left working!

You have an answer for why you can or can’t do this or that...could it be that you’re like me and you’re just stubborn and hard headed? Lol are you Italian too? Maybe we’re related? All joking aside though, you said yourself you don’t like to do your DD. That answers your question. You’re wondering why you’re not getting better, but you’re also not putting the time in to actually succeed. That’s like a fat person wondering why they aren’t losing weight, but saying they hate eating healthy and working out. Now, you could just be down today, I have no idea how you are on a day to day basis, but maybe, just maybe, the problem is your attitude and unwillingness to accept people’s help. And maybe you’re not putting in the time that this shit needs in order for you to succeed. You know they say that a person will only change when the pain of staying the same becomes greater than the pain of having to do something different! Good luck buddy"

03/24/2021,stocks,"You sound real receptive to advice so best of luck.

Coming from someone who works in the industry, it's easier to set and forget(index funds, sector specific) they're not sexy but they make money and reduce risk.

My frustration isn’t with losing money. It’s with the lack of progress that I have made. While making money is the goal, my current hang up is how to make that money. I’ve realized my strategy isn’t working and so I’ve begun to wonder if theirs a point where people realize they’re simply not cut out for it.

I get it.

Pick an ETF. 

Dump money. 

Wait. 

I want to be better than that. But I’m curious if I’m even capable so, *as someone who works in the industry,* when do you know when someone’s not cut out for trading? Drop the sarcasm and I’ll drop the periods, if that makes you feel better."
03/24/2021,stocks," Cool, have another down vote"
03/24/2021,stocks,"I'm not being sarcastic by any means. I'm being serious.

You're picking risk plays. One year ago was bottom of 2020, and indexes rebounded. Start with something along the lines of SPY, VT, VEU, QQQ, QQQJ or QQQM...do your research into them, you'll gain an understanding of what you're actually investing into. Etfdb.com will give you an idea of overlap. You can spread into small caps like the Russell 2000 such as IWM or VTWO. You'll notice overlap depending on what you look at but it's best to start easy then broaden out."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted here. It's clear to me that you're frustrated and I came to reddit today to make sure it wasn't just me. It isn't just me. 

I'm trying to look at this as an exercise in risk management - admittedly a tough thing to do when my trading account balance is trickling away - but I've stopped (mostly) looking at the dollars and really try to focus on the percentages. I read the charts and watch the indicators that the price action seems to respect. I stay away from penny stocks. F that S! and I trade only tickers valued in excess of 1B market cap. I've set rules for entries, exits, and stop losses and I stick to them no matter how much it pisses me off. I never exceed 10% of my trading account balance on any single position and I avoid GME and AMC and any other meme stock at all costs. 

It's not working for me \*yet\* but I am certain that it's the correct path for me."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Had you just leave the money on arkk last year
You would already making close to 100% of gains."
03/24/2021,stocks,"You're never going to make it as a day trader in the stock market based on your personality.

Just go buy and hold SPY long term like everyone else before you lose everything.

I feel sorry for you."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Lol I hadn’t even noticed I was getting downvoted here. Probably it’s my tone... whatever. 

Yea, I’m going through a lot of self reflection here. It’s clear my current strategy isn’t working.

But I’m not sure I can settle with “just pour money into SPY” (or VOO, or w/e.) I want more. And I’m frustrated that my work up to this point hasn’t shown for anything... I guess no one else on this sub-Reddit feels like that. Save for you and me!"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Okay well I’m down 15% on it, so"
03/24/2021,stocks,"And you’re never going to make it anywhere doing anything if you get all worked up over your internet points. 

Speaking of which, have another down vote.

03/24/2021,stocks,Hang in there!
03/24/2021,stocks,Think about what you’re saying though. You’ve been losing money and it’s not working so clearly you haven’t perfected it. What size are these trades ?
03/24/2021,stocks,Depends... I usually try to go for cheaper contracts to limit my exposure. The most expensive one move played was like a $300 contract
03/24/2021,stocks,"i dunno you posted this thread and im seeing some useful advice in here. there's a lot of people making money in this sub and using the market to their advantage. you complained this isnt really working out for ya. id suggest going to the basics and going long on some s&p stocks while you do some research. Once you start understanding cycles and valuations a bit more, you'll gain a huge advantage on your options plays"

03/24/2021,stocks,">I was about to break one of the most known rules of investing. I bought everything at its peak.

That's definitely not a rule of investing. ""Don't try to time the market"" is, though.

By the way, I bought some ARKK when it peaked at \~$65, and some more when it peaked at \~$90. Turned out fine."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I got into NIO and Workhorse at the high and both dropped the next fking day. So now here I am. I'll hold them for years but it kills me a little bit to see it. 
I also got into PINS at the higher end. I think of it like last March when my whole portfolio was f'd. They will all be ok eventually. At least I hope...no one knows the future."
03/24/2021,stocks,"If you believe in the stock, and I assume you did your DD and that's why you purchased them then relax, put them to the back of your mind and watch them increase in value over time,  if your impatient and want the money back then you will have to put more money into them on the dip to bring your average down. then wait for a good rise in price and sell  half, keep doing this until you have your money back."
03/24/2021,stocks,"This speaks to me: In 2020, lost $1k on GME made $950 on WKEY and $100 selling a few other stocks. That feeling of trying to make up that loss sucked. (Also, knowing that if I'd held, I'd be up 2K blows.)"

Youre learning, i did the same. I made 4 into 35 then dropped to 22 doing the same thing because I didnt really grasp what I was doing. Then I turned that 22 into 60k with RKT and now Im in GME. 

Best things you can do is learn at every cost. The more you learn the more you realize you dont know. If there is **anything** you dont get them take 5 minutes and go research it.

Learn the kelly critierion as well, dont blow up your account. Manage your bankroll like a poker player does. You have 10k then you can bet small 2-500 plays. Itll take longer but if looking for better returns LOGI calls for 115 for June will make you 40k if it hits the high PT of 135 by then. 

Thats assuming you spend all 10k at a $4 25+ $115c

119 is your break even, LOGI will be back to 120 by end of April easily barring some market setback over all."
03/24/2021,stocks,This is so true. You’ve got to be resilient and patient. All my ticker are in red but I’m still holding out for a hero.
03/24/2021,stocks,Makes sense to me.
03/24/2021,stocks,Right? I’m crushing the market. Haha
03/24/2021,stocks,"It took me $150,000 in MBA tuition to learn the same lesson.  I think you got the better deal. I owned 1,000 shares of AAPL @ $4.50 cost basis and sold @ $7 per share because I thought no way they can keep charging a premium for iphones with Samsung and China entering the market. I left $120,000 in gains on the table given today's price.  

The lesson? You take a deep breath and make the best decision you can under the circumstances. Also, never bet against a great team."
03/24/2021,stocks,Appreciate the advice.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the advice. Yeah, not used to the volatility. I have companies that should be good long term. JD.com, PINS, Microsoft, and some Ark ETF’s."
03/24/2021,stocks,Truth!
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I feel like if I wait 5-10 years I’ll be surprise at how much they grow."
03/24/2021,stocks,Wise words
03/24/2021,stocks,"Didn’t jump on the GmE train. Bought JD.com, PINS, pltr, Microsoft, and some Ark etfs."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Maybe I’m doing it all wrong. I don’t trade options. I have been buying shares and partial shares in some cases. By my math, it I bought 10k worth that is 95.65 shares of LOGI. If it goes up to 135, that’s only a little over 12k. Correct?"
03/24/2021,stocks,That's why you diversify. The guy who bought pets.com and Amazon in 1998 and then just left them alone couldn't care less what happened to his pets.com shares.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Cool those sound like decent long-term picks. I know it can definitely suck when the whole market tanks and you see your stocks keep dropping (I check my portfolio a few times a day even if I’m not planning any trades) - but equally you will have great days where even big companies like Microsoft jump 4-5% in a day.

Also if you have companies that you’re confident in, but they’re dropping just because the whole market is tanking (and not due to any news on the specific stock) - then I actually see that as a great buying opportunity to pick up more cheaply. For all the talk of markets being forward-looking, they seem to be very volatile in temperament and can drop suddenly for no reason. So if your stocks are being dragged down for no good reason, rather than panicking instead that’s a good opportunity to buy more - as if it’s a strong company it will certainly recover as the market calms down/improves."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I did quite a bit of reading and looked at all sorts of stock forecasts, websites and videos. 

Bought JD.com, PINS, pltr, Microsoft, DNMR and ark etfs"
03/24/2021,stocks,True. Didn’t think about that.
03/24/2021,stocks,"If even one of those takes off in the coming years, it will make up for any laggards. Looks to me like a good start: four solid companies, some volatile high-return ETFs, and a speculative biotech that could go to zero or could make you rich.

Speaking of PINS, I bought it at around $30 in 2019, an all-time high at the time. Six months later, it had tumbled down to $17, so I was looking at a lot of red. But now I've more than doubled my money and wish I had bought more."
03/24/2021,stocks,See above!
03/24/2021,stocks,I appreciate the advice. Good to know PINS did that for you. I’m sure long term I’ll be like oh well that worked out.
03/24/2021,stocks,Dnmr is very intriguing to me. Could be boom or bust.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Correct in how iOS 14 won’t fuck them over completely and that they partially rely on internal behavioral targeting, albeit ALL social media sites target you based on what you do on the platform. 

I’m curious though, are you a Pinterest user? I downloaded it for DD and I found it to be a very unfulfilling user experience. I am their target demographic and used it a little bit in the past so I was hoping that the algos would be improved now many years later. The content did not adapt properly to what I liked and the same content was shown over and over again. 

We are used to hyper personalization at this point, any platform with poor content serving algorithms is doomed to fail eventually."
03/24/2021,stocks,Lol cheers sorry read right over the actual number....
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, my wife and I are both users and my 18 y/o daughter loves it too.  I'm the cook in my family so I use it to collect and organize recipes.  My wife uses it to collect hairstyles, tattoo ideas, stuff like that.

I see what you're saying about repetitive content but that's something that will improve over time with more data and improvements to the algorithm.  Other than that I find the app very easy to use.  Every so often I decide to randomly scroll through my main page to see if there are any new recipes to pin.  The ads fit in so seamlessly to the experience that they don't bother me at all, whereas they drive me nuts on Twitter for example."
03/24/2021,stocks,Good time to get in on some.
03/24/2021,stocks,"This is the way.  At 29 Id probably also park some in a small-cap growth fund like VBK, but it’s kinda pricey right now. Set a small amount aside to try different ideas in individual stocks if you want. I would not have a prob with that."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I am not giving you this advice. I am relatively new myself (got interested in the market around December/January), and also I am currently not buying more. This is mainly due to an unclear income situation. With a fixed income of a few thousand Euros per month I probably would.

If you’re only looking at the number of shares, which you and I both know is dumb. However you’re devaluing those shares by receiving a dividend because each share falls by the amount of the dividend on the Ex date. 


I’ll say it again. You can own 100% of $90,000 or 90% of $100,000. At the end of the day it’s the exact same. The only difference being, with non dividend payers, you choose when to make a dividend. With dividend stocks you receive the dividend if you need it or not. 


Let’s say you have two identical companies that are valued exactly the same, have the same growth, same products, ect. However one pays a dividend and the other doesn’t. Let’s say you and I buy 10,000 shares for $10. 


**Company 1: Non Dividend payer.**


I buy 10,000 shares for $10. Thats $100,000 portfolio. I decide to sell $10,000 worth of shares off because I need the money. Now I have $90,000 in stock and $10,000 in cash. At the end, I have $100,000 total. 


For fun. Let’s say I decided I didn’t need the money. So I still own 10,000 shares at $10, or $100,000. I have no tax liability. 


**Company 2: Dividend payer.**


You buy 10,000 shares for $10. That’s $100,000 portfolio. The company decides to pay a $1 dividend. The price of the share falls by $1 on the Ex date. When you receive your dividend, this leaves you with $90,000 in stock, and $10,000 in cash. At the end, you have $100,000 total. 


For fun, let’s say you didn’t need the cash at that time....oops. The company is going to pay it anyway. 


This is why, before taxes and fees, there’s no logical basis for an investor to prefer cash from a dividend over cash from selling stock. This is also why the dividend capture strategy doesn’t work. 


I don’t think you understand what a dividend is from how you talk about it. Dividends are not a creation of wealth, they’re a transfer of cash. What I mean by them not being a creation of wealth is....this money isn’t being created out of this air, it’s being paid to you by the company. This is why I talked about your logic working in HYSAs, in a HYSA, you don’t lose value on your principal when you’re paid interest, with dividend stocks you do. This is why the only thing that should matter to the investor is capital appreciation."

Dude XD I can’t tell if you’re trolling or just ignorant. 


A when a landlord is paid rent, the building isn’t paying them, the tenants are. The value isn’t being extracted from the building but rather the people inside it. So to fix your “example”, when a landlord is paid rent, the net worth of the tenants go down by the rent they paid out. 


When a company pays out a dividend the company is paying out cash for the dividend, therefore the company loses value equal to the dividend. Say you have $10, you pay me $1; do you still have $10 in value? 


Answer: No, you have $9 in value now."
03/24/2021,stocks,"No, (using T still) after you get your $.51 in March, you get another $.51 in June. And another in September.  Does that change with share price?

It's the same as rent, hence the analogy."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> No, (using T still) after you get your $.51 in March, you get another $.51 in June. Does that change with share price?  


Another example of something nonsensical. 


If I sell $100 worth of Amazon when it’s at $3,000 a share, is that the same amount as if I sell $100 worth of Amazon stock if it’s at $500? 


Answer: Yes. $100 in Amazon stock = $100 in Amazon stock. 


If T pays a dividend of $0.51, it doesn’t matter what the share price is at, the share price will drop by the amount of the dividend. If it’s at $100 a share, on the ex date it’ll sell for $99.49. If it’s $10 a share, on the ex date it’ll sell for $9.49 a share. 


So what’s your point?

Yes you get it handed to you but it’s no different than selling shares because the price of the shares drop by the amount of the dividend on the Ex date. 


Again, you can own 100% of $90,000; or you can own 90% of $100,000. There’s no logical basis to prefer cash from a dividend versus cash from selling shares. 



> Not theoretical value, actual real dollars.


In “actual real dollars” the share price on the Ex date falls by the amount of the dividend. Meaning while you’re handed 13% of your initial investment in cash from the company, your portfolio’s value drops by the same amount too."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes it is different since you still have your basis.  You lose a percentage of your stake when you sell shares and pull money out. You do not when you take your dividends. 

Hence dividend income is perpetual. Selling shares is not.  

See the difference? You get 13% infinitely with dividends, you run out with selling shares.  The less you have in the account the less you can make with buying and selling shares.

And also dividend yield isn't tied to share price so you don't care about it. With selling stocks, you can only sell for a money when the price is up.  Dividends just keep paying."
03/24/2021,stocks,"> Yes it is different since you still have your basis.  You lose a percentage of your stake when you sell shares and pull money out. You do not when you take your dividends.

> Hence dividend income is perpetual. Selling shares is not.


Smh. You’re not reading anything I say. 


> See the difference? You get 13% infinitely with dividends, you run out with selling shares


That’s not how it works. A) You’re operating under the assumption that dividends will cover your entire yearly expenses and B) You’re operating under the assumption that after you sell shares there will no longer be capital appreciation. C) You’re operating under the assumption that the company won’t cut their dividend or halt it. 


Second off....The typical rule of thumb is 4%, you can sell 4% of your portfolio per year and never run out of money with index funds and that has been backtested all the way to the 1910s. That’s because the capital appreciation will compensate to cancel out your selling."

Wait, taking tax losses on shares you are never going to sell is bad?  I think you need some schooling.

> Ugh. It doesn’t work like that.

That math was from your dividend calculator.  Are you arguing against it now?  At a $40+ share price for most of the time and $1.2 dividend for most of the time, your calculator proved you would get $1284/year on T if you held from 1995.  That is about 13%/year.  That is literally your source.  If you hold from now at $30 and get a $2 dividend, if it stays flat you'll get like 50%+ a year.  Learn math.

03/24/2021,stocks,"A 7 trillion dollar market cap? Thinking like that scares me. I’m worried a lot of people are about to get the rug pulled out from under them.

They’ve had an e-commerce website for years. I used to use it all the time to find which store had the used game I was looking for. I doubt the revenue from their pivot would offset the lawsuits that franchisees would inevitably throw at them if they cut them out."

03/24/2021,stocks,GameStop doesn’t have franchisees. All locations are corporately owned.
03/24/2021,stocks,The rug is in motion as we speak.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Sure. So you can buy a put option which is basically a bet that a stock is going down. Each option is for 100 shares and has what are called “the Greeks.” One of these Greeks is “delta.” 

Delta refers to how much a change in the stock represents a change in the price of the option. A deep ITM put has a strike price well above the current price of the stock and a delta that is > .80. What that means is that if the stock falls 1 dollar, you would gain 80 dollars and vice versa. 

That being said, for under 40k premium, the put expiring in January 21, 2022 at the 510 strike only has a delta of .5. In other words, if GME falls a dollar, you would make 50 while if it gains a dollar you would lose 50. The premium is the price you would pay regardless. For the put that I mentioned, basically you would need to pay 40k up front. 


Two things to keep in mind. One, each day that passes, the more you will need to have the stock fall. This is because each option has a value for time factored in. Each day that passes, the less time there is and the less the value of the option. Two, option premiums also have the price of volatility built in. The idea is that if a stock is volatile it has more likelihood to move up or down towards the strike price. Before earnings, this causes the price of options to rise significantly and fall after earning, referred to as “implied volatility crush.” With GME, this means the price of the option will go down significantly today or tomorrow, so the premium may go down to less than 40k. That said, you may need the stock price to fall even more if the option has IV crush, which GME most likely will. 

Please realize that this is a very risky strategy. Although there is a high likelihood that GME would fall, there is also a chance this madness continues. In the mean time, you will have a very stressful time. If tomorrow, GME goes to 170, you would be down a significant amount of money. It would only be really after it falls to about 130, that you would begin making money that covers the price of the premium you paid. In my opinion, GME is worth about 50 max and 75 on the high end even with any changes made. 

I highly recommend that you watch the following video if you are going to spend 40k on this and start with something that is not GME. It is the best overview on options I have found and is about 1 hour long: https://youtu.be/SD7sw0bf1ms

In short, if don’t know what you are doing, this can cause you to lose a lot of money very quickly. Hope that makes sense. The video is probably better at explaining than I am.

How do you have 40k just sitting around? I wish I had this problem."

03/24/2021,stocks,"I believe with the put you bought, that is essentially like paying for insurance on your investment. You bought a put with a strike of $14? So you were insuring your 100 shares in the event that the price dropped below the minimum price you’d like to sell them for. You paid the premium to guarantee that your shares would be worth at least $14 each by the expiration of the contract. I’m not familiar with the greater intricacies after that."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Good advice.  First diversify by getting into some index etf. These move with the market. A single bad stock won’t tank you. Then put some in a few blue chips you like then lastly some growth stocks you like.  Periodically adjust. If you don’t like the stories anymore then exit your position. 

I think :

20% Index etf1
20% Index etf2
10% sector etf of sector you like( tech, health care etc)
10% international or bond
20% solid stocks
20% growth/risk

This allows you to pick a few stocks you like and believe in for larger gains. The index etf likely return steady growth over time. This provides enough diversification that if every growth stock you pick loses 50% you only drop 10% overall.  

Normal market returns are 4-6% a year. At 6% you would double your money in 10-12 years."

03/24/2021,stocks,"ABB is a good shout. I work in the manufacturing industry and their robotics technology is very highly regarded. I would, however, add Siemens to this list. They’re already a huge company, but once again working in industry I can see first hand the level of impact they have on industrial electronics, automation, communication protocols and i4.0 in general. Rockwell/Allen-Bradley are one of their main competitors (another good addition to the i4.0 list) and I honestly think that Siemens has the edge when it comes to their profinet/profibus comms protocols and SCADA systems. IMO their PLC/PAC tech is also ahead of the game but I’m sure there’s people who’ll disagree with me on that.

For what it’s worth I’m currently studying for an EE qualification and we learn a lot about i4.0. ABB, Siemens and Rockwell are all oft brought up examples of those putting a lot of R&D into industry 4.0 tech.

At the moment I still believe them to be underrated. Sure their GPU market is undeniable and their AI plays are well known, but the recent movement into robot controllers with the Jetson series and supporting interfaces isn’t as highly reported.

Even at current share prices I see them continuing momentum. For example they have a beta out Isaac for robot process automation that provides a solid GUI and is built around their new Jetson platform server shelf. It includes deep learning synthetic training data generation and motion planning. 

Right now they play a big role in academic robotic research, but this seems like a play to break deep into the market.

I'm also wondering how Arena relates to Windchill in the context of this acquisition, but it would surprise me if there isn't a plan behind this... We'll have to see what comes out.

I disagree that ""the VR stuff is just a marketing tool"", for two reasons:

1. the tools I mentioned are Augmented Reality (AR), not Virtual Reality (VR), which is a completely different medium.
2. In my view, Vuforia Engine, Chalk and Expert Capture are becoming quite mature and widely usable products very quickly, and the latter two (Engine is an SDK) are made to help people in their day-to-day activities, so definitely not marketing tools.

Edit: I looked up ""Windchill vs TeamCenter"" and the results I found paint a more nuanced picture than you describe. [https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=windchill+vs+teamcenter&addon=chrome&addonversion=3.3.0&method=topbar](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=windchill+vs+teamcenter&addon=chrome&addonversion=3.3.0&method=topbar) (via Ecosia, using Microsoft search), [https://www.google.com/search?q=windchill+vs+teamcenter](https://www.google.com/search?q=windchill+vs+teamcenter) (Google)."
03/24/2021,stocks,"So let’s just say I’ve nearly never seen VR used in the engineering setting. It’s a design studio/industrial design tool. 

Also regardless of the nuances of windchill vs teamcenter, teamcenter and enovia are the two leading plm packages. Windchill is a 3rd place solution let’s say. 

If that’s what you mean/are wondering ?"
03/24/2021,stocks,"Yes, but I'm talking about AR: here you are not cut off from the real world like in VR. Instead, 3D information is overlaid over the real world, with a smartphone or with a device like Microsoft Hololens if you need to keep your hands free for work.

Chalk allows two people to have a video conference in real time, where both can mark out elements in the real world with simple sketches, and they 'stick' in 3D. Think: Operator standing in front of a huge panel with buttons, asks the remote expert which button to push. The expert draws a circle around the right one, and there is no guessing anymore. Much easier than with voice-only calling or regular video conferencing.

With Expert Capture, advanced operators can record procedures as they perform them, using e.g. Hololens as a head-worn camera. These are then edited and played back in an interactive viewer for less experienced operators who need to do the same work. For example with the pretty rugged RealWear HMT-1. 

These are very practical tools that operators use in their day-to-day, so not just for the design studio.

Regarding Arena and Windchill: I was wondering if the strategy will be to replace or combine, or maybe take higher level functionality of Winchill and transplant it onto the SaaS architecture of Arena.. I have no idea, but it would be weird to have two competing PLM packages in one company, so I just assume there's a plan behind it :-)"

It traded up for a couple in anticipation of getting a big defense contract and then insiders became aware that Boeing didn’t get the contract and sold their shares and told all their buddies to share before the news is the lost contract came out today. 

Insider trading may be legal but it’s fucking bullshit. 

C suite selling of shares should be required to be disclosed before sale and then not actually be able to sell shares until 5 business days later."

03/24/2021,stocks,"Ha, own."
03/24/2021,stocks,"I don’t really understand your logic unfortunately. How does it make sense that the average investor should be the one making risky bets? Let’s say you are the average investor and have 50k to invest. That’s plenty to invest in Amazon, just buy a few shares. I feel you’re using the logic that more shares automatically means better. Which is why companies do stock splits, because they know human psychology tells them “ooh Apple went from 500 a share to 100 a share that’s so cheap I’m buying now” when in reality they have the EXACT same amount invested. It’s like taking a pizza and cutting all the slices in half and saying “oh now I get TWICE the pizza” that’s not how it works. Also Amazon has been a big company for YEARS. Back when it was 500 a share people like you were already saying it was too big and you should invest in the “next Amazon” instead. If those people had invested in it they would’ve had a multi bagger. But instead they probably chased some meme cannabis stock a few years ago and lost all their money. ALL the wealthy folks I know got that way from slowly building wealth, compounding interest means if you play the market right you can easily become a millionaire by investing 500-1000 a month in stable investment but people always think they can do what nobody else can do. Once you have enough you can set a bit aside for risky stuff and if it goes down you’re ok and if it goes up maybe you’ll strike gold. But taking your advice and chasing risky stocks from the beginning is going to keep a lot of folks from becoming wealthy."
03/24/2021,stocks,"And to clarify I’d never say ONLY buy one stock like Amazon. If you have 50k maybe buy one Amazon stock, maybe a few if a big healthcare company, a few in the energy sector, a few more tech stocks like nvidia or square. And then save a few shares for fun gambles like the “next Amazon”. It’s possible to stay diverse without having a million dollars or buying micro caps"

03/24/2021,stocks,I see this as positive news.  The stock should go higher making it possible for the Chinese to invest in the companies.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Couldn’t agree more. And not my business what anyone choose to invest in, but I don’t have a good feeling about how this is going to end for so many people who are on the AMC 1000, 2000, 10000 cultish bandwagon. It seems fishy with the massive volume - more volume is traded than Apple, fucking APPLE, DAILY!! It’s crazy. I suspect large institutions are taking advantage of the amc ape gang hollering. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark, but hell what do I know. 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️"
03/24/2021,stocks,Netflix is bound to be screwed. All the entertainment companies are starting their own streaming companies and taking their properties back from Netflix. Remarketing old foreign movies ain't gonna cut it.

03/24/2021,stocks,Stupid question(s) alert: Why many of the uranium companies have 0 revenues the last couple of years? At least in yahoo finance. How could you value companies like this?
03/24/2021,stocks,"There are no stupid questions, so don't worry. The reason for this is that after a decade ling bear market, most companies that were left are not producing anything, thus having no revenue. The way you value those companies is by looking at the assets they have, their management team and their plans for the near future (find a deposit, start permitting, take over something etc.)."
03/24/2021,stocks,damn missed the sell off by a day.
03/24/2021,stocks,"> they have 11 products in clinical trials between vaccines, precancer and cancer treatments.

There are literally dozens of companies who are in the same position, and hundreds more who have been in that position in the past only to peter out. Biopharm is a grueling sector and 90% of these companies bleed out to R&D before ever seeing a dime of any actual pharmaceutical sales money.

> When you see that number than any improvement, or an attempt at improvement for quality of life for patients shouldn't be dismissed. Your comment is unnecessarily dismissive.

I'm sure that's what you'd like me to say as it's an easy argument to attack, but that's a strawman and a half at best. Nowhere did I say I'm dismissing attempts to innovate in medicine. This isn't a discussion about what *should* be done for innovation or what avenues should be explored to treat GBM. It's great that Inovio is doing this, and if they succeed I'll celebrate my being an imbecile as much as you. But that's not what this conversation is. This is a discussion about stocks and what a good financial investment is. You seem to have those two conflated. 

>I didn't insinuate success of the trial, as any clinical trial is exactly what it says (trial), and without trials you cannot learn much about disease

Considering that 

1) you're endorsing this company to become profitable

2) their business model probably doesn't rely on failing clinical trials (unless I'm mistaken)

3) that any significant improvements to a GBM cure would be quite literally Nobel prize worthy breakthroughs 

You are absolutely insinuating success. I can't connect the dots any further for you there. 

>Maybe you are suggesting that we should have stopped with Aspirin

This is a gold medal worthy leap to conclusions. Again, science is good. Trying new treatment modalities is good. That doesn't make it a good investment. Stop confusing the two."
03/24/2021,stocks,I kinda wanna do a little of each. I’ll probably read some of both paths. I’d like to do some trading and build up some wealth to also do some nice long term investing. I want both for sure. Excited!
03/24/2021,stocks,Thank you u/Zachincool for putting this together. This is really cool.
03/24/2021,stocks,"Ray Dalio also has very good content on market and macroeconomic cycles. I think there should be some mention of books around monetary policy, trade, currency, and dollar hegemony to make the conversation complete.

03/24/2021,stocks,"ARK will not get desrtoyed due to outflow like a mutual fund.

ETFs trade at NAV and when they go below NAV, a liquidity provider buys ARK etfs and sells the components and keeps the arbitrage.

Mutual funds CAN trade below NAV, and when people cash out, the fund has to pay them in full, which causes them to slip and go to zero.

2 different mechanisms, ETFs like ARK cannot be wiped out by redemptions like a mutual fund. Do some more research on the topic."
03/24/2021,stocks,"Looking back at it, as you said - it seemed this jumped right up after the dip on the 18th, before taking a nose dive later on, on the 19th.
