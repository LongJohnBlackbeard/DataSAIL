2021-05-10 19:51:13,stocks,It would only be a wash sale if you bought back the SAME stock withing 30 days after the loss
2021-05-10 19:54:39,stocks,I believe you should be able to claim that as long as you don‚Äôt buy back into riot for 30 days after you sale
2021-05-10 19:57:54,stocks,Be careful as it actually is 30 days before to 30 days after.  So if you buy twice and sell once at a loss you could get caught by that prebuy as well as a post buy.

You are young and have a lot of time to make money both through work and investments.  Sit this out for a bit. Let him liquidate and start focusing on getting your own cash up.  Doesn‚Äôt seem like you got caught chasing meme stocks, just hit some poor luck.  More mature than most but time to show that by backing out."
2021-05-10 19:42:49,stocks,You‚Äôre 19 bro just tell him you‚Äôre going to hold it? 10 years from now you will be 29... which is young af and those investments can pay off. But hey huge props to your dad for giving you that leverage... be thankful. My dad got me into investing as well and I will be forever grateful
2021-05-10 19:41:33,stocks,What is your overall strategy? Chasing losses is the most dangerous game to play. Expensive lesson but a lesson nonetheless.

In my IRAs I have a big block of FBGRX, Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund.  That's where I'm cringing the most.  I've held it for 10+ years and it's up nearly 200% for me overall.

To OP, it isn‚Äôt abnormal for the market to react downward just as violently as the rise when something gets overheated, usually you just don‚Äôt see it quite as widespread, but for overall market health it‚Äôs probably good that it‚Äôs happening to renewables, software, etc.

Look for solid companies with a sound business and plenty of future growth.  Learn to always check p/e and p/s ratios before buying.  See what the stock traded prior to covid, did they launch something new or improve their business during covid?  If not, why would the company be worth more now than it was pre-covid?  Always have a hold philosophy before buying (is it 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years before you think you may want to sell it?)  
Now is a great time to start buying some of the big tech and some of the other moderate p/e tech companies that will be long-term (3+ year) winners like AMD, SKWS, TSM, LRCX, AMAT.  This does not mean go all in on them but rather start buying with a plan.  Look at the solar and green-tech companies, if you find something with a p/e below ~40, research it maybe buy a few share and keep it on the radar.  Now is a great time to start buying small positions in longterm winners that have been beaten up.  This however, is not a time I could recommend looking at too many things that are still unproven.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't look at small positions in things like weed, on-line betting, eV, big data, just keep those risks as a small part of your portfolio."

2021-05-10 14:13:17,stocks,"No, but it does increase your cost basis. Once you exit the position, and wait over 30 days, then the wash sale rule is completed. Meaning you can deduct if it is a loss."

Another option is to buy ETFs in each sector with the same dollar distribution $100 in XLF, $100 in XLE, etc

The goal with either of these is to periodically sell a little of your winners and buy your losers to keep roughly the same dollar amount so when rotation happens you get that upside and you don't lose as much on the hot runners.

2021-05-10 14:11:38,stocks,"I'm not an economist. But it does NOT make logical sense that interest rates remain so low in an economy that is healthy, creative, free and robut. It makes sense that if Mr. Investor were to deposit a sum of $$$ in a bank, that he would get decent returns (perhaps 3-6% ?).. but current rates, as OP points out, only encourages and incentivizes this crazy over-leveraging. 

So naturally the interest rates are going to increase again. This would be the healthy normal thing to eventually happen. However governments (local, state, federal) have borrowed so much money that they can't afford to pay people's pensions.. so it's a pickle.. it's basically pretty much a scam by the government. The government borrows large sums of money to fund inefficient and horrible government expansion, then the government reduces the interest rate, essentially on itself, to buy itself more time. 

Meanwhile, the big banks take advantage and over leverage. It's telling me something when I myself now started using margin when 6 months ago I didn't even know what margin was. So there has got to be over borrowing going on.

But is the solution to raise rates and cause a correction? Or is the solution to fix the system and not allow such high levels of borrowing? 

It seems to me that the ultimate fix is far away and citizens have to fend for themselves and make wise decisions.. which we know that on a population level is unlikely to happen and is an elitist concept of of itself..

Excuse me for I'm just thinking out loud. I don't know what the solution really is (in a low voice: except for a system reset)"

That would be suicide longterm... although think about which voter base and politicians are all about the short term and don't care about future generations? Yes, those people want you to think low interest rates are a good thing, those people argued vs Powell to raise the rates *before the pandemic.* But you're not an expert, so let me know if you don't understand what a catastrophe that would have been."
2021-05-10 16:19:45,stocks,"The fed don't print money, they lower the federal funds rate which allow banks to loan more money, or the fed buys US treasuries, replacing them with 'credit' on the balance sheets of banks. If they want to reduce quantitative easing, they just remove dollars from a banks balance sheet and replace them with treasuries. If they do that, they raise interest rates. Technically no money has been printed throughout this process. They did this between 2008-2014, adding 4 trillion to the money supply, and it certainly benefited the market. They were in the process of slowly getting this money bacn since then, and it didn't affect the markets, as you can see from 2014-2020 pre pandemic."

2021-05-10 16:11:41,stocks,"I think stopping printing money right now is more important.  They printed so many dollars last year and far as I am aware this year as well.  With so many dollars in circulation that, in my understanding, is having a bigger impact on inflation than interest rates while the continuing extension of unemployment and stimulus payments have largely gone to ballooning the market.  More so than lower interest rates.

Those issues need to be addressed before interest rates need to be raised, far as my lay understanding gets it."

As right as you may be, I think it's always important to leave things open ended instead of suggesting 'this WILL happen during this time' while leaving no room for interpretation."
2021-05-10 14:44:26,stocks,"I'd love to. I wasn't trying to offend, just hard not to laugh at a random internet stranger giving such factually stated advice that runs directly contrary to most industry professionals. 

My short term outlook isn't as optimistic as yours. Given abnormally high P/E and extreme valuations throughout the market, I'm betting we're due for a solid pullback in asset prices ranging from 10-15%. I don't expect this to have much impact on the economy though since the fed has a pretty firm firm hand on the trigger to prevent recession. After the market corrects, I expect to finish the year strong, but we're unlikely to reach higher than the current ATH we're seeing now. 

Predicting the future is tough. Simple fundamentals show prices are too high. Investors at both the retail level and the institutional level are expecting a pull back. Consumer cash is high and with the economy opening back up we should see some healthy cash flow throughout the economy."
2021-05-10 18:32:11,stocks,"Good time to get out of tech was a week ago, wait for the bottom and get back in.    I think there will be a slight bounce - get some buying going again and then dump more once people are calmed down a bit.

I see 10 to 20% dips in a lot of those stocks.  ARKK is down >20% from recent high, and more from ATH"
2021-05-10 16:57:36,stocks,"Well the commenter evidently thought this was the case, or at the very least, didn't realise that interest rates would rise if the fed reduces Quantitative easing. I think a lot of people run the misconception that the Fed is printing money. They give banks more money to lend, but they don't add more money into circulation, since they remove these credits as the economy recovers. They did this, but on a larger scale after the 2008 disaster, and in that period, the Nasdaq ran from ~$1100 to ~$3600."

I mean, usually people suspect everythings gonna crash, thats nothing new. But, lately there have been at least 5-6 posts every single day either stating the market will crash as a fact, or someone really new asking/concerned about the market crashing.

Just a hunch but I have a feeling we've hit the bottom, or are nearing the bottom."

CMRE and CRE motgages will bust around the same time the fed will need to change policy and talk/enact rate hikes and bond tapering due to 3-5% inflation (which although high is historically normal) after that we will see a broader 10-25% market correction due to margin debt and valuation models ignoring fundamentals, many currently fair value companies suchs as $LMT $REYN, and $TSM (I would argue 4.1x revenue at $110/share is fair value) will drop leaving smart money an excellent buying opportunity while the mass media and broader market panic sells, hedgefunds are still overleveraging which is the greatest danger to the market currently i.e $BLK but their stocks and funds will not crash down until policy change since borrowing money is so cheap and making money off that regardless of interest is easy. Notice how on a visual like finviz you can see that rotation

TLDR: no crash. no hyperinflation. buy the dip in certain stocks"

Not sure about Chipotle, but Starbucks is a winner in my book.  Agreed the PE is rough, but every time I go to Starbucks, their line is 10 cars deep.

It shot up on news of acquisition and merger with HYLN. It is now caught up with all the SPACS that are tanking back to their ATLs. I would argue that HYLNs entire price history, with the exception of a few spikes from good news, is completely uncorrelated with the company itself. The stock price right now just reflects market sentiment on SPACs and pre-revenue speculative stocks."

I have always disliked the small number of holdings in the fund given the volatile nature of biotech stocks, and it wasn‚Äôt too long ago that they lost big on betting ARCT to win the COVID vaccine race for example. It needs way more diversification.

2021-05-10 15:04:37,stocks,"I work at an easier job that pays 15$ to every new employee in every state since *start of q4 2017* (I was hired 2017 at 12 and saw a bump for myself and all employees under 15 lifted to 15) and it is not chipotle or McDonald‚Äôs. Its not fast food and frankly no fast food job appeals to me but I‚Äôve had friends work at chipotle and say it really does suck vs other places. Hiking the wage to 15 is something that should have been done years ago but laws not requiring it meant few companies really would do it. Why if there‚Äôs not much competition wage wise with other employers? 

Now we see companies desperate to hire and desperately raising wages.

But I think it‚Äôs some bull. My dad doesn‚Äôt think so as a former business owner and I understand - he thinks that the worker as an individual should not feel as though these companies owe them something. That we should be driven to succeed and find better wages if our employer can‚Äôt give it.

But what if there really are no other options and something like a fast food job will pay the bills greater than unemployment, why not work a turnaround job for a few months? At the rate of pay they‚Äôll never want to stay. I think raising it now makes sense because they have to, but truly I think the workforce should hold out longer. Bleed unemployment dry if they have to to squeeze wages higher. 

The labor shortage is country wide. A LOT of companies will be doing this kind of thing, so why look to chipotle as a good employer when their workforce is already largely unhappy? For the unhappiest employees who still work there the pay raise might not retain them for THAT much longer.

Edit my first gild is the dfv gild :O thanks stranger!!! I also want to clarify this is totally a good thing but the workers in this country need to realize the ADVANTAGE THEY CURRENTLY HAVE to DEMANd higher wages. Because they can, and they should. Edit again for clarity"

Now I'm well aware that being a line worker at Chipotle isn't the exact same as being an software engineer at FAANG, but if you invest in your people in the form of competitive pay, training, and benefits, then you'll clearly have an advantage in the market. 

All of these things pay dividends. And when the talent is retained, the cycle of good hiring and training is perpetuated. The store is kept clean, the line moves faster because the workers and leads are experienced. The employees greet you with a smile because they're not miserable and overworked/understaffed.

Plus, it's good PR. Part of making a company and a brand is to have advocates. On one hand there's the external advocates like customers ""I love Chipotle's new quesadilla, we gotta go!"" and internal advocates ""Hey I just started working at the Chipotle uptown, if you're looking for a good gig they pay the best and you basically eat for free!""

I can't see this as a bad move if it attracts more talent and gives a higher incentive for workers to stay and work hard."

Well guess what, people who were indoctrinated too hard into the ""minimum wage jobs are starter jobs"" community, the market is now dictating that wages need to be higher or their literally won't be workers. Consider this the most reasonable win for the laborer. Other companies will likely follow suit, particularly if they are already competing for this shrunken labor pool."

And you know, it wasn't even mad. Things are fuckier than usual at Chipotle and it's really obvious.

All that said, it really seems like there's a whole new crew every time I've gone to that location since it opened (I almost excursively go around lunchtime, so it's not as simple as different shifts). Even before all this, the people I know that worked at Chipotle left pretty quick."

Obviously this is just one chipotle store not every chipotle store but I say all of that to say when I did walk in I could tell they were understaffed and that could have possibly been why they were only doing online orders for pickup.

When I left the company two years ago, I was making 17 an hour as an hourly manager, and we were starting staff at 12 or 13 an hour I think. I took a pay cut and actually declined a promotion to Apprentice (Chipotle's term for a GM in training) to go to a smaller fast food company. It was absolutely worth it, Chipotle asks more of their staff than any company I've ever seen and I saw so many people burn out just like I did. In 5 years with that company, I worked for 11 GMs at 3 locations - and GM is probably the lowest turnover position there. Only saw a couple of GMs in our whole region last for more than a couple years."
2021-05-10 13:36:01,stocks,"Maybe but if you have it $15 minimum, then basically everyone working will get $15 instead of some getting $18.  Cost of living in CA is way higher than in Florida which is way higher than in Kansas. So should someone earn the same in Kansas vs California? Probably not"
2021-05-10 14:01:39,stocks,"There should be no minimum wage. People should be paid exactly what they can trade their time for. If your labor is worth $15 to a particular employer, that employer will pay you $15. If there is a labor supply sufficient that they can offer $10 and someone else will do that work instead of you, then you aren‚Äôt getting that job at $15. 

With a $15 minimum wage, you literally cannot trade your labor for less. This means that you cannot temporarily trade your labor for $10/hr, developing skills and gaining experience, while building a resume, to launch into higher paid work. Instead, you‚Äôll stay broke until you can present enough value to an employer to justify the artificially higher wage - which may never come if you can‚Äôt get a toehold at the bottom rung of the ladder.. 

People say things like, ‚Äúthere should be a $15 minimum wage‚Äù or ‚Äúpeople should be paid a living wage..‚Äù. These only take into account what they‚Äôd like to see everyone make. It doesn‚Äôt take into account most of the relevant considerations when it comes to wages.

In order to protect a fair labor market, illegal immigration should not be tolerated. That is, a zero tolerance policy with respect to undocumented workers should be implemented. There is no way for upward wage pressure to build in the market if there is an infinite labor supply. We don‚Äôt need a minimum wage if people compete in a market free of this sort of gross distortion."

All manner of software (and the subset of robotics) are eliminating jobs at a rapid pace and will continue to do so."
2021-05-10 13:19:19,stocks,You tip at fucking Chipotle? For people to scoop rice into a bowl?
2021-05-10 17:53:25,stocks,As a General Manager. Makes good sense.
2021-05-10 18:16:09,stocks,Baffling that anyone would go into debt for a degree at this point.
2021-05-10 19:22:43,stocks,"Imagine working at Chipotle and making 38,000,000. Makes no sense"
2021-05-10 18:38:43,stocks,"For a general manager position? 

Or are you trying to intentionally be misleading?"
2021-05-10 16:53:42,stocks,the problem is the inflation means the poorest are actually getting more poor =/
2021-05-10 19:48:47,stocks,"General managers get on average 3x beginner worker pay or 1.5x shift manager pay. You don‚Äôt think having to do all the hiring, firing, no overtime, accounting, legal responsibilities, taking blame for losses, etc is worth getting the extra pay? Chipotle still pays experienced workers more than small businesses do."
2021-05-10 19:56:48,stocks,"After a decade I would expect to be a GM or damn close, making the 80-100k range. What‚Äôs the incentive for giving up over a decade of a life to work there doing management.. $100k."

That will be soon after the enhanced unemployment payments from the fed stop in September."

Chipotle at $15/hr would be an annual income of $31,200.

The only thing embarrassing is your math.  


ETA: Youre right, your confusing word salad made it hard to decipher what the fuck you were actually trying to convey. So you had unemployment for a limited number of weeks that was 80% of your original salary, congrats that's what unemployment is supposed to do."
2021-05-10 16:24:26,stocks,"Here‚Äôs a newsflash: taxpayers have already been making up the difference between the low wages and the new cost of the product you think will happen, in the form of taxpayer-funded benefits these employees qualified for and received.  Now, we‚Äôre looking at putting the cost burden of fast food *directly onto the business and their customers*.  Isn‚Äôt that better than keeping their product artificially low on the backs of taxpayers?"
2021-05-10 15:48:22,stocks,You should probably take 30 fucking seconds and do the math to determine what the labor cost is on a $15/hr employee taking 1 minute to make your burrito bowl.  Please tell me how this is going to double it‚Äôs price?
2021-05-10 13:47:20,stocks,"Ok, but prices have already been going up without an increase in employee wages. And tbh the fact that you think working at chipotle is just scooping rice into a bowl is pretty telling in and of itself. If you don't believe the people making your food deserve a livable wage, don't order the food. Make it yourself."
2021-05-10 13:47:32,stocks,I don't know if you've noticed but this is already happening. What do you think happens when you pump the fuck out of the stock market? The top 10% of people have a bunch of money lying around so everything starts to get more expensive. Housing inflates rent inflated and on and on. Giving poors more money is a drop in the bucket. But it's certainly better for the ruling class to make everyone agitated at the people working in fast food and collecting unemployment than it would be for people to direct their anger where it rightfully belongs.

2021-05-10 16:19:27,stocks,Read the fine print.  Average of $15 an hour.  They could be averaging their $100K (supposed) manager salary with a bunch of $11 an hour workers.

The only way to fix it is for the labor shit to continue this way, for it to press the hand of business. maybe we are on a good path here for the worker"
2021-05-10 16:13:58,stocks,Make it yourself and buy the Mexican coke at the store then
2021-05-10 18:50:14,stocks,They're only doing this because the government unemployment wages are allowing people to not work there for less lol.

2021-05-10 16:04:33,stocks,"They can't get it correct. They can't get it on time. They can't not be assholes when asking when an online order will be ready. They can't cook rice properly. They can't make guacamole that isn't 70% salt. They can't do anything right at the Chipotles around me. They have plenty of workers, they're probably just miserable and don't give a fuck. I don't blame them, but it sucks ass. Thankfully I found a local burrito place recently that's barely more expensive and 100x better."
2021-05-10 16:16:31,stocks,"AND YET YOU STILL FUCKING EAT THERE!

WHAT IS FUCKING WRONG WITH YOU ALL?!"
2021-05-10 17:50:49,stocks,"Lmao, same. My local Chipotle didn't have any staffing problems (as far as I can tell from every time I've been there), and I always order online like 30-40 minutes ahead of time, and show up late to pick up my order, and they STILL don't have my shit done. I end up waiting an extra 15-20 minutes every time. 

Like, it's been over a year in this pandemic, and you fucking bozos can't figure out a system that works, yet?"
2021-05-10 18:24:15,stocks,"Yea, that's the experience I've had. Idk where this understaffed Chipotle is."

2021-05-10 15:25:20,stocks,I used to be a chipotle manager at a location in San Bruno and stonestown. It was a mess. I hated every minute of it. It was hard to keep employees and when we got a new general manger he sucked so much the whole manager crew quite besides me. I quit a week later because I got sick and couldn‚Äôt breathe and he wouldn‚Äôt let me go to the hospital. Chipotles in the Bay Area are the worst ones to work at.
2021-05-10 14:47:47,stocks,Bruh what the fuck are you doing ordering Chipotle in the best burrito area in the country?
2021-05-10 15:50:21,stocks,"I think that would be true of any restaurant...when people are happy, they tend to not post rants..."

2021-05-10 18:41:24,stocks,UPS is not an easier job than chipotle.  Go load a tractor-trailer destined for Barnes and Noble and then say how hard it is to make guac or sweep the floor.
2021-05-10 18:01:46,stocks,Good to know!
2021-05-10 19:23:42,stocks,Except they work you like a dog the whole time. I worked there for a while and the pay was good but that was definitely not worth it.
2021-05-10 17:08:55,stocks,I think the majority of Chipotle workers are high
2021-05-10 17:21:02,stocks,"I can't believe this is rated controversial. I can't even remember the last time I went into a restaurant and saw a teenager working there. A lot of people working these minimum wage 'teenager jobs' are middle aged to elderly adults. This is hardly something that started during the pandemic, it's been that way for many years."
2021-05-10 17:11:34,stocks,"No, I don‚Äôt. I support higher wages and better working conditions for these workers. Ideally through a union - but whatever method gets it done is good. 

I was just speaking to my sons specific situation."
2021-05-10 18:04:48,stocks,Anecdotally around my area yes the majority are in the 15-20 range.
2021-05-10 18:15:27,stocks,"18$ an hour + 5k a year in tuition is also going to work out really well for adults trying to go back to school. It would more than cover tuition for a 2 year degree, or a transfer degree from a tech school. Like the other person said, that's a grind (especially cause you are going to need to work way more than 15 hours a week to keep afloat) but is interesting."
2021-05-10 17:39:58,stocks,I‚Äôd say college age.
2021-05-10 18:17:11,stocks,Probably worth pointing out that not only teenagers can go to college. I imagine that there are adults going to school later in life who benefit from the tuition reimbursement as well.
2021-05-10 17:07:21,stocks,"I really don't think adults should be working at restaurants. They should have skills and make real money

2021-05-10 15:15:17,stocks,It‚Äôs not normal but corporations are trying to make it ‚Äúnormal‚Äù so they can pay their employees less.

2021-05-10 17:18:17,stocks,"I worked at In n Out for a while. It was a great place to work. You work hard, but they compensate you fairly for it. The only thing that sucks is that everybody works part time unless you're in management, so many of the folks there were working two jobs. Isn't as big of a deal if you're a high school student, but many my age (early 20s then) had rent, car payments, etc. that they couldn't cover with just 20 hrs/wk. All in all a great place to work though. The culture's great, everybody's friends with each other, all of that. It's been years and I'm still friends with some of those that I only worked with for a few months, and I see many of them still going out together today. I liked my time there."
2021-05-10 15:05:41,stocks,"Bingo. There's about 30 states where $15/hour is more than a living wage, but they can absorb it. The small businesses can't."
2021-05-10 14:29:08,stocks,"They could easily have a full staffed kitchen and maybe 1-2 people cleaning or taking orders if the automated menus are broken or an elderly customer can't use them.

Then have a dedicated delivery team. They can kick scummy gig food delivery jobs to the curb while also paying their delivery people a decent wage."
2021-05-10 17:25:14,stocks,What menus? I do all my orders through the app now. Never had to communicate my order to a cashier or kiosk ever since COVID started.
2021-05-10 15:23:14,stocks,"So what? Because we fear Automation people shouldn't have a living wage?

Then what do we do? Eliminate the minimum wage so companies would still hire people?

Who needs a wage when the automation takes over. They can just pay people in McDoubles."
2021-05-10 16:49:07,stocks,"No reason to treat small and large businesses alike. We‚Äôre fine with complex tax codes but when people come to this problem it‚Äôs like all laws have to be equal. Subsidize small businesses, or just allow them to pay less and see how the industry reacts at first"

2021-05-10 17:54:12,stocks,So in the 40 or 50 odd years where minimum wage hasn‚Äôt kept up with production or inflation what the fuck have small businesses been doing? Are they all operating on deeply flawed models? Because what I‚Äôm hearing is if they paid the same amount as they did 50 years ago they would be out of business which sounds insane
2021-05-10 14:41:28,stocks,"So, before they didn‚Äôt want those customers? Why where they keeping minimum wages down for so long? 

This is something that is going to happen regardless of any factor, there‚Äôs too much public support behind it. They are NOT devising some ‚Äúsecret strategy‚Äù, they are resigning to social pressures."

2021-05-10 14:27:02,stocks,"Ah, the local McDonald‚Äôs. A struggling small business."
2021-05-10 14:55:03,stocks,"> Who cares what Mc D's CEO says, I'd like to hear from franchise owners. Small businesses is who gets hit the hardest.

Obviously the CEO knows how much the menu price would rise far better than a single-location franchiser. Their analysts run one of the best supply chains in the history of humanity. And you want to hear from one isolated endpoint of that supply chain, not the experts running it?

Lunacy. This is purely a political answer by you, and it's because you know a lot of small businesses owners are very political and ideological and they will say what you want to hear regardless of the reality of the economics. I can't think of any other reason to prioritize a single franchisee's opinion over the analysts who run this corporation.

It would be like saying ""Who cares what Amazon says about their supply network, I only care about what last mile contracted Amazon delivery LLC's have to say"". It's not rational, and it's bad investment advice to suggest that the CEO of McDonalds is willfully ignorant or misleading about how much menu prices would rise based on labor cost increases. It would be negligent or even criminal for him to lie about it to influence investors."
2021-05-10 14:27:16,stocks,I don't think Chipotle is actually franchised. McDs owns all the spots.

2021-05-10 13:53:35,stocks,Prices will go up regardless. Employee pay has a negligible effect on that. Pay has to keep up.

2021-05-10 14:26:47,stocks,I hear people saying that but I've paid roughly the same for a cheeseburger meal the past few years. I haven't seen prices go up.
2021-05-10 14:33:54,stocks,The deals section in the McDonalds app is my greatest friend.
2021-05-10 15:10:29,stocks,"It takes a couple pennies per burger to compensate for a $15 minimum wage. McDonalds employees don't sell 1 burger per 1 hour. It's not a 1:1 conversion ratio of food item cost to wage. 

Prices at McDonald's have gone up because of supply chain related factors, not because of employee wages."
2021-05-10 18:51:19,stocks,That doesn't make it not good business sense.

2021-05-10 13:46:59,stocks,"Why does the fact that people can only make a livable wage if they are on unemployment have to mean that unemployment is bad? To me, it speaks more to the fact that people are underpaid. Just a thought."
2021-05-10 14:08:49,stocks,"If you're thinking about this strictly from an economic perspective, you're right. 

However, if the difference between 10 and 15 bucks an hour still means a person can't afford to rent a two bedroom apartment with three other people, then there's probably something much worse going on economically than simply competing with absurd unemployment benefits."

2021-05-10 14:03:57,stocks,the fact that people are choosing to live off the meager social safety net we have in the USA than work these fast food jobs just shows me and the rest of the country that the fast food industry has essentially **required** their employees to live in poverty for their businesses to function. i don't understand how that's not somehow an even worse moral hazard than people expecting to not live in poverty.

But we need a national minimum that isn't trapping people in poverty and on government benefits. It's just subsidized wages for shitty businesses."

The minimum wage based on simple inflation was much higher for them. Based on production (workers on average today are far more productive) it was even higher.

Companies should **be encouraged and incentivized to pay their employees more**, like Chipotle here, but mandating a small shop to pay 15 dollars an hour to me, a 16 year old dishwasher who just wants to smoke weed and stand outside smoking cigarettes all shift, that makes no sense to me. I want nobody to suffer, but I'm curious how or why a part time dishwasher like myself doing the above, deserves a ""living wage"" - I guess I truly do not get it. I could be replaced by any other kid on the street, I'm doing a job that takes 30 minutes of training and I'm doing it average at best. The owners work 50 hours a week and make 60k a year...but now I guess this shop will now pay its 10 dishwashers and extra 5k a year, where the fuck do you think that 50,000 dollars a year is going to come from? Air?

Anyways, could somehow explain to adult me who wants to open a restaurant, why I should pay younger me 15 dollars an hour to do the above? I don't get it I guess and am honestly asking.

>From 2021 to 2031, the plan would increase payments to workers by a net  $333 billion, after accounting for wage increases and job losses, the study found. **That would allow low-income workers to spend more, but would increase labor costs for businesses and raise prices, especially at restaurants.** The loss of jobs would cause a modest negative overall impact on economic growth."

If you want jobs that make society better, and pay a ""livable wage"" I think you are really arguing for a socialist state.  And that is OK, but just realize what you are all saying.

And realize we need to **hike up taxes to 50-90% of your wage** to make all of that utopia work.

So pick your poison: socialism, and you pay 70% taxes, and take home a couple of bucks an hour, or our way, and you take home more, but get less utopia.  You can't cherry pick what you want from society, it is really one way or the other, we can't afford both."

You do realize that by making minimum wage go up capitalisms would make it so people who don't think it's worth being an EMT would stop working there and eventually EMTs would have to hike up prices (like Chipotle is in the article above) to have enough people working in those positions.

Chipotle workers get their increased wage, small restaurant doesn't go out of business, and we move forward.

The only real answer to this type of thing, that‚Äôs occurring in all industries (and not just physical automation - broaden your view - *software* is automating jobs at all levels) is to create a tax on automation and the percentage of a company‚Äôs output that is created using automation vs human labor.

If that means the worker asks for $50/hour, and the company offers $10, if they employee accepts the offer at $10, that was the outcome of their negotiation. If there was a shortage of workers who could perform that job, or if this candidate offered something uniquely valuable, they‚Äôd likely have been able to negotiate more than $10.

I also find automatization to be a boogeyman as well, we automatized past 100 years and it always worked out in our favor. Its not some fucking boogeyman job killer, news jobs will always arise, irrelevant ones will slowly disappear.

On top of that it will happen indiscriminately as well, i traveled to poorer countries where your average worker earns 1 - 2$ and i traveled to rich countries where your average worker earns 10 - 20$, and you know the same automatization is coming in both of them.  The prices sometimes can be exactly the same in some given 2 comparisons, but one country work force is ridiculously cheap, yet the same automatization is looking to replace more and more burger flippers, cashiers and everything else all the same.

I think its more tied to techonological development than peoples salaries to be fair. When its easy to replace the workers, we will, no matter how little or much we pay them, meanwhile we are just willingly choosing to pay everyone less.

And replace what, shitty underpaid slave jobs that nobody wants to work ? More people are choosing to opt out of work force every year.

But that‚Äôs the thing, if you force a wage hike and eliminate the small business, then this person with no opportunities doesn‚Äôt even have the option. There is no small business to work at. They went from ‚Äúno other opportunities‚Äù to no opportunities at all. And big business sure aren‚Äôt going to be hiring MORE people than before, considering they have to pay even more for each employee. It results in less job openings overall, even though the openings pay more. People get left behind entirely (not getting ANY paycheck), there is less competition, and more monopolization.

From my perspective, idea of raising the minimum wage to help people pay their bills can‚Äôt stand on it‚Äôs own foundation. It‚Äôs predicated upon people being able to have jobs in the first place.

Second, why would you even care about non smart TV marketshare? It's dying quickly, and it's a crappy pure hardware business with 0 software/platform/advertising monetization lol. 

Third, I'm not even sure any of the reputable TV brands sell any non smart TV models anymore. LG, Sony, Samsung, etc. all come with a smart OS.

Me neither, I was talking about NASDAQ index which is commonly used to benchmark tech performances. How do you even talk about tech without talking about quotes? 

I frankly don't get where you're coming from - you talk about a correction that for you *did* happen via pesky hedge funds that shorted 90% of tech for *reasons* but then NASDAQ didn't even reach a 6 months low - and punctually ignore hedge funds that *really* overleveraged like Archegos pumping VIAC to the stars.

They've done a bunch of owning up and fixing bad purchase decisions so if anything I was more bullish.

Looking at TCNNF, do I really expect them to 4x in price?  Last year they made $521M in revenue and HRVSF just upped projections this year to make $400M in revenue.  So how do they get to buy them at 1/10 of share?  Sure they are profitable but it was only a matter of time for HRVSF. 

Now I see this law firm put out a press release on investigating them for ""fiduciary duty""  It also says current HRVSF shareholders will own ""only 26.7% of Truleive's issued and outstanding pro forma Trulieve shares.""  Maybe this is why they couldn't go any higher because if they gave anymore HRVSF shareholders would own too high a %?  Not sure if this is correct, I assume they are creating new shares to give us?

I've been in Himax since around $6. It peaked about $17.50 - 17.90, and that was prior to pre-earnings for Q1 2021 & Guidance results. Meaning, before people knew that Q2 2021 was going to be forecasted with ridiculous #s, and before people knew exactly how well Q1 2021 was going to be (although guidance told us it was probably be close to what we got, even though it was beat).

I'm not telling people to invest into Himax because of it's past stock price. I'm telling people to invest into it because I fully believe it's a solid growth stock pick, coupled with the fact it has been consistently showing solid results. It's never posted these kinds of numbers before. The past two quarters have been all-time high in revenue and gross margin (and this quarter, record EPS). Last quarter (Q4 2020) was close to record EPS.

Not even just that, but the fact that they are heavily progressing with automobile TDDI makes me fully believe the growth will continue onward, especially given that automobile's is one of the most profitable segments for them, and display in cars is the new big trend. They are sitting at a comfortable 29.7% market share at the moment."

2021-05-10 15:53:50,stocks,">What is driving the growth?

They are invested in multiple segments. The newest one is automobiles, which is also extremely profitable and slated for continued growth. They are currently at a 29.7% market share for TDDIs in automobiles. That's despite being capped right now in supply. The future guidance growth for Q2 will largely be attributed to this segment.

Besides that, they also have TCONs in high-end TVs, Display Drivers in devices such as Phones, Tablets, and Large Panels (tvs, monitors, notebooks). Other misc categories, which can you find, and another one (WiseEye) slated for mass production in Q3 - Q4 2021ish.

So essentially: demands for electronics in general. Expensive electronic products also providing a sizeable return.

As we can also see, TDDIs are forecasted to continue growing each additional year, from 921 M units in 2020 to 1.168 B.

>How are they affected by the current shortage?

Supply is limited, but they are still breaking record #'s. They stated in the Q4 earnings that supply will increase each consecutive quarter in 2021. Not to mention, that supply each quarter would exceed the demand/supply back in Q4 2020, which we can see as a result in their financials. Q4 was a record ATH quarter, and Q1 was a larger increase above even that. That's why I'm largely excited about this year, this country is going to exceed the $1 B revenue cap with solid financials, EPS and Gross Margin.

And what's it valued currently?

With that being said, lots of these predictions grew much more in the long term than what might be attributed to pump action. Again, a bunch of predictions 10x'ed over 6 months. I attribute this more to the super volatile nature of penny stock trading- they would likely be less successful in a bear market.

2021-05-10 12:51:17,stocks,"I'm not holding at the moment but I will considering it again after I've read the transcript.

Apple recent change impacts app traffic but the ability to monitor and retarget based on behaviour was already hampered significantly over the past 18 months due to Safari ITP and Firefox ETP, and these changes are debatably as or more damaging to TTD business model but haven't hurt revenues. I'd expect much of the same when 3rd party cookies are deprecated from Chrome. Digital will continue to win share of ad spend but likely that less emphasis will be placed on behavioural retargeting and the methods of measuring effectiveness will be adjusted. Brands who are hyper focussed on direct response will pull back spends but big brands will use other methods and continue to grow their digital branding advertising.

My main concern is that all the changes above are more likely to handicap the ""little guy"" and result in even more ad spend concentration with the big platforms and publishers that have registration and first party data at scale.  Also important to note that one of the biggest growing areas in digital right now is SME and TTD isn't really accessible to them but Facebook and Google are amazing in this space. Big brands advertisers are also going heavier on video so Google and Amazon are likely to do better from this growth, as well as any other ad funded video services. Yes TTD does have a role to play in the transacting of video with their DSP so I might be a bit harsh for not fully understanding how much this will benefit them... and if that growth is enough to offset declines elsewhere. 

TTD are in a growing market, digital ad spend will continue to grow in low-ish double digit percentages for the next couple of years which is good for them, but I think they need to see much higher growth than this for the valuation to make sense.... and they are already killing it with their gross margin. Also most of the areas that account for the recent and forecasted growth in digital spend are not necessarily the areas that TTD excel in."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"DD: $IRBT - The Dust Has Settled **Note:** Before reading, consider if I'm worth my salt. Here's an overview of my performance since I started posting Stock Analysis to reddit: https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7. Any good investor heavily considers the underlying performance of a business before buying into them, so why shouldn't we do the same on reddit?

**Intro:** iRobot = Roomba, got it? It's really that simple. It's a household name brand that sells their robot vacuums, as well as automatic floor mopping robots, a robot that teaches kids to code(this speaks directly to my heart), and their new robotic lawn mower. Incorporated in 1990, Headquartered in Massachusetts, blah, blah, blah. 

**Bear case:** Yeah, we're going to do this analysis a little differently. 

There have been a few good threads examining IRBT, most of which have the same few comments and criticisms. 

1. ""There are so many low cost alternatives to the Roomba, iRobot has no chance at maintaining market leadership."" This isn't wrong, only... it kind of is. iRobot has been stating this for literally *years* in their 10Ks. They know it exists. There *are* low cost alternatives that reduce the quality vs price trade-off, but this does 2 things:
 * Creates a race to the bottom effect between low cost manufacturers thus competition grows between *them* just to survive. This reduces overall profitability of low cost brands and removes them from the market sooner.
 * Hurts the robovac industry *short term* as people purchase these low quality products, realize they're not super effective, and decide to just stick with a regular vacuum in the future. 

2. ""IRBT has failed to capitalize on their technology or to expand."" First of all, they lead the market in their technology and I don't mean ahead of the aforementioned discount brands, I mean against Samsung, Shark, and other major players in the household cleaning industry that have been established *for years.* They are specialists, through and through. Their process is slow and deliberate and that's *exactly* why they'll maintain their market edge. Admittedly, this is exactly what frustrates investors- the lack of perceived growth in a time when every other tech-centric consumer good is gaining momentum- and I love iRobot for this.

3.    ""IRBT stock price hasn't really moved much."" If you're investing based on stock price movement, you're not investing at all. But since I know that's not helpful, fine, the price has about tripled in the last 5 years.

Alright, I admit that the above Bear case was only used to illustrate some rebuttals to common arguments against IRBT. It's important to consider that just because I disagree with the arguments above, doesn't mean that the rest of the market does as well. Public sentiment is always a factor when considering investments and I realize that right now I'm betting against the above arguments. Below, I will get further into some of my subjective analysis that further defends this thesis.

**Metrics:**

1. **P/E** of 16. I know, everyone is hating on the P/E ratio lately, but it's still a valuable indicator of a company's performance whether we like it or not. Ok, so a P/E of 16 is reasonable at least, especially considering today's current max market P/E or Sharpe ratio. But that's not even why I'm mentioning it. If we exclude last year's COVID crisis effect on the market, iRobot's P/E ratio has *never* ***ever*** been this low. Now that's not to say it can't go lower, but I don't think I've ever seen a strong, high functioning company been as undervalued compared to itself as iRobot is right now. (MacroTrends)
2. **PEG ratio**, as a result of the above, is an absurd .89 if dividing P/E by the projected next 5 years of earnings growth. What's great about this is that that's *a low end estimate* for earnings growth. IRBT saw an earnings growth of 73% over the TTM, is projected for a 62% EPS growth over the coming year, and even their past 5 years show a 28.5% EPS growth. Dividing the P/E by any of those numbers makes the undervaluation theory *even stronger*. It's absurd how undervalued this is right now. (Finviz)
3. **Debt:** Zero debt, but I did want to mention this for a specific reason. When a company lacks *any* debt, it's perceived that growth is limited if financial leverage isn't being used. This is understandable, but I think that iRobot has found a middle ground between funding new projects with their own cash and maintaining a ridiculously healthy balance sheet.
4. **Other Basics:** Revenue, gross revenue, and Cash Flow from Operations has continued to climb steadily year after year. Their product lineup might not be growing, but they sure as Heck are growing stronger financially over time. Also, their entire cash position outweighs their entire Liabilities column on the Balance Sheet- how can you not love that?

5. **Institutional Ownership** is 100%. There's no real room here. This shows confidence in the company, but prevents major moves upward by a new, big interested buyer to jump the price significantly. It also brings along the potential risk of a major move down if an Institution decides it wants to pull out. What compounds this issue is that there's only about 28 million shares of iRobot to go around and while they have issued buybacks to reduce this amount, which is good for investors, it can also be very scary during tumultuous times. 

**Subjective analysis:** I love but had the concern going into this that the company hasn't ""grown"" in a few years. After looking through their financial statements, I've been proven wrong. As a matter of fact, they've proven me wrong time and time again when trying to find cracks in the armor. I was hoping that perception of their product lineup was poor- it's not. Even with Samsung being in the same market as them since 2014, Roomba has *crushed* their competition and it's partly because the customer base believes in them. I then turned my attention to employee sentiment -that too was a dead end. Glassdoor shows raves reviews for iRobot. People like working there.

Warren Buffett has said(yes, I know, the entirety of reddit quotes him but today this is extra applicable to this thesis) that there might be a thousand people who don't agree with your investing opinion- and that's fine. As it stands now, I don't think many people perceive iRobot as a company with the growth momentum of a rocket ship. Putting myself in the perspective of a business owner, which is what you become the moment you hit the 'Place Buy Order' button, has made me realize that I would love to own this business. It's a profitable leader in a market segment that has the *ability* to expand further into the quickly growing tech and robotics industries, but doesn't *rely* on them. So if the haters hate then let them hate, and watch the money pile up.

2021-05-10 11:21:43,stocks,"Not long on iRBT.

I am a professional product developer and one of the things I have developed in the past: Robot vacuums.

Some things you may not know.

1. I robot actually licenses their older design patents to competitors on the open market.

Some of the discounter designs are literally just knock-offs of older Roomba's patents/designs.

I don't believe in Roomba long-term and here is why:

Those generics offer similar performance at a lower price compared to Roomba.

I had one of each (remember this is 2019 and not current) and was testing designs to see which one we should patent-design around (basically deciding which design type is best then knocking it off in a way that does not legally violate patents).

The patents Roomba leased were kind of forced. Their technology was 100% stolen and dumped onto the Chinese market so they pursued litigation and took a check for licensing deal since it was already publicly available. This includes source code and includes pretty much everything except the vacuum cleaning patterns (stored in the hardware, but was actively being dumped in an effort to decode).

In the end, the generics performed very close to Roomba in every test except pattern logic (the patterns the Roomba takes are superior to the Chinese ones but cleaning efficacy is nearly identical).

I see Roomba has squandered its position as market leader and spent most of its money on advertising for short-term sales and doesn't really appear to be staying ahead as far as performance, R&D, and technology.

My info is a bit old (2019ish) but I have to say that Roomba seemed like its days were numbered due to competition catching up FAST using Roomba's very own technology as a springboard aginst them."
2021-05-10 12:04:22,stocks,"Now *this* is good quality counter-evidence. Thanks for taking the time to add to this.

Given your background, do you see any other competitors gaining control of the marketplace over iRobot or besting them in terms of financial stability and/or growth into other directions?"
2021-05-10 12:12:40,stocks,"The Samsung probably had the best Tech but all the extra parts inside also means it will never be cost-efficient. Talk about over-engineering.

I would have picked one of the cheaper Chinese competitors at random and selected them as the ""future"" really as I see the tech as adding unnecessary expense but not really adding much to the actual performance.

Reasoning: It seems cheap ""dumb"" robot vacuums with good (cheap) patterns and a SHAPE/WHEELS that prevents getting stuck will be more ""future"" than adding (expensive) super-genius intelligence and apps to a robot to avoid getting stuck on your kitchen threshold.

Being ""smarter"" with maps and learning AI just means I have to find and unstick it less often. Considering how easy it is to find (almost always in the same place) I dont think the added expense of AI justifies the convenience.

Robot vacuums are quite simple and adding layers of technology doesn't make them clean better. The ones that map and ""learn"" your home get stuck less, but clean the same and also prevent a security risk IMO as now your 3D home floor plan can be sold to strangers by Roomba (read their app ToS).  


Just KEEP IN MIND my information is industry-specific to 2019. We bailed on robot vacuums as the market was saturated with low-cost competitors (who were ahead of us), marketing was CRAZY expensive for critical keywords, and the technology increases were shown to be mostly gimmicks (mapping, lazers, AI).   
   
From 2019 my market research also showed PPC costs were EXORBITANT with Roomba bidding $40.00+ to ""park"" on brand keywords."

I‚Äôm watching Apple and Tesla as the two bell weathers of turnaround here.  I think both have 20-30% downside potential before buying picks up again.  People should not forget: this is healthy.  Price discovery is a sign of markets working properly.

But one thing you must not do in markets like this is change your investment thesis.  There is no real catalyst here other than normal price discovery which squeezes out weak hands.  Switching to an indexing strategy at points like this is like switching to bonds in 2008."

I actually think its very funny what boomers are doing now. They were the beneficiaries of major inflation followed by unprecedented investment inflation (supply side economics). They saw their own minimum wage triple in about a decade when they were young... but ask them to give the young folks today a 5% raise and all of a sudden their panties are in a bunch and its the end of America and capitalism...

I hope its just inflation. We can deal with that. What I dont want to see is another Reagan demagogue with a kindergartners understanding of economics getting into power and pushing further into feudal style policies."

Overleveraged? What does that mean? Even if companies doubled their leverage since a decade ago, interest rates are 1/3 what they were 10 years ago... So what does that mean overall?

Naked Shorts? Do you have evidence? I have accounts with IB, TD, Fidelity, Etrade and Shwab. None of them allow naked shorts. Thats not to say it cant happen, and maybe they give special privileges to hedge funds and such, but do you have any numbers or you just guessing?

Fraud MBS's? Again whats the evidence? I dont think there is anything of the sort in residential. Most of those loans have plenty of equity or are agency and again, interest rates are literally 1/3 what they were a decade ago. So even if price is 2x higher, payments are still lower than then. Commercial is certainly a problem but thats been true for decades now since the internet age began.

I do think there is a stock bubble and an insane amount of speculation. I think at least half of the new tech startups wont survive. There is also a general inflation of valuation going on that leaves me uncomfortable but thats been going on since Reagan opened the floodgates. Its not new. Still I dont like it.

2021-05-10 15:04:13,stocks,"[S&P National Housing Price Index](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/csushpinsa) rose over 12% over the past year and 36% over the past 5 years. For comparison, [inflation averaged 1.92% annually](https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-inflation-rate-history-by-year-and-forecast-3306093) over the same time frame. I'm expecting a medium-sized correction in the next year or two

My hypothesis is twofold:

1) New home buyers keep getting priced out by those seeking to rent out property

2) Covid relief programs and renter protections will expire eventually (example, the $300/week federal unemployment payment is set to expire in September, if I recall correctly), which will severely impact rental returns. 

I think the hardest hit will be rental companies (and maybe REITs) that specialize in single family residences (I think commercial-oriented real estate has already had [its crash](https://www.greenstreet.com/insights/CPPI) in March-May of 2020)"

But obviously the feds themselves dont want to do that. There is no incentive for them. There might be incentive for guys like Trump for a myriad of reasons due to his real estate holdings.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"APD - A company set to dominate the Hydrogen business (but not reliant) I've been into Hydrogen for quite a while, and I think APD is severely undervalued at its current price. I'd love to hear other opinions on this, and Hydrogen in general, but I also want to give my perspective, and why I'm extremely bullish on it.

Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. $2/kg is considered a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. 

People think we need to move to EV cars to lower Carbon Dioxide emissions is the big move we need to make, but transport only accounts for 16% of greenhouse gases. Planes cannot run off electricity or solar, they would require either nuclear power, or hydrogen to sustain travel. Maybe you might disagree here, but I think the safety concerns would make it unfeasible. For a lot of industries, especially ones reliant on forms crude oil, hydrogen may be the only feasible replacement, with its extremely high kilogram calorific value. Other viable options are Butane, Methane, and Natural Gas. 

What are the current uses of hydrogen? Well, key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry and development in the cement and power generation industries, this all ignoring the many favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment.

$APD not only produces hydrogen, but also have room to grow in their production of Oxygen, Nitrogen, Argon and Carbon Dioxide. They have great earnings and a P/E ratio below 40. The projected market for Oxygen is $30 Billion by 2025, for Nitrogen its about $33 Billion. Argon has a much smaller, but not insignificant projected market of $487 million by 2026, and $12.1 billion for carbon dioxide by 2027. As if that weren't enough, they also produce semiconductor materials (with a semiconductor shortage, there is a lot to gain here); natural gas liquefaction technology and equipment (I don't know much about that stuff); epoxy additives (Epoxy resins are used in Wind Turbines, Electrical systems like circuit boards. Epoxy resin market is expected to almost double in value to over $10 Billion); Gas Cabinets (It costs $4k to get a projected market size, I aint paying that shit, but for reference here's what wikipedia has to say: A¬†gas cabinet¬†is a metallic enclosure which is used to provide local exhaust ventilation system for virtually all of the gases used or generated in the Semiconductor, Solar, MEMS, NANO, Solar PV, Manufacturing and other advanced technologies.).

I listened into their conference call today to see what had to be said, and some very interesting points were made, that puts my bullish stance far higher. There is a lot of debate on the efficacy of green hydrogen. The argument is that its inefficient. Well, APD have aims to become the leaders of Blue Hydrogen, alongside their efforts to produce green hydrogen. Now, what is blue hydrogen many may ask. Well blue hydrogen refers to hydrogen produced using natural gas, with the CO2 emissions generated during the process being captured and stored. I plan on sending an email to investor relations to see if I can get more details on this, as I'm aware they sell CO2 and CO, but this development puts me very bullish on the company, as this would be an efficient way to produce hydrogen with low environmental impact. Blue Hydrogen is not a dream either. I posted yesterday on the Dutch Government's subsidies for a carbon capture project, which directly benefited APD. Carbon capture is already a reality. 

Another thing said during the conference call was that they're very bullish on is high purity Nitrogen in the electronics market. They've earned a lot of contracts, although some of them they cannot announce for client privacy reasons. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted 46% of sales in 2020, while hydrogen, syngas and related products constituted 22% of sales. Evidently they don't rely on hydrogen for revenue, but being the leading provider, they put themselves in a good position to profit heavily from the eventual move to hydrogen

 A lot of interesting questions were answered in the conference call, which I suggest anyone thinking about investing having read this should listen to. I've said it for quite a while, and I'll continue to say it, but hydrogen is the future for the majority of industries, and the safest investment you can make into hydrogen is APD, they have insanely strong earnings to their name (11% CAGR), and offer a 2% dividend as an added benefit of holding shares. They don't do any stock buybacks, but I'm completely fine with that. P/E of about 34, and earnings are not affected by any rises in natural gas (Their customers subsidise the cost of natural gas). 

TLDR: I think this is severly undervalued. They are profitable now, but do they have room to fucking grow. As clean energy is pushed more and more, I think their earnings will grow exponentially, and I wouldn't put it past them to do it."
2021-05-10 10:58:27,stocks,Thank you for this in depth post! Will be keeping an eye on hydrogen stocks
2021-05-10 11:36:02,stocks,Interesting point about blue vs green hydrogen. I think green hydrogen is inefficient in comparison since you're taking solar and wind power as electricity and using it to create hydrogen through process like hydrolysis. Blue hydrogen you're using fossil fuels separating the hydrogen from the hydrocarbons. The idea is that youre better off just using the electricity from the green tech but the blue hydrogen is a clean alternative for fossil fuel use. I'm not sure on the efficiency of blue hydrogen vs straight fossil fuels but I don't think that matters considering the way policy is going. Hydrogen regardless is going to be a huge part of our future in energy.

# Observations/Assumptions

* [Index funds have been shown to be the most successful stock investing instrument for most people](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-money/)
* [Index   fund returns, such as the S&P 500, are now predominately  determined  by a handful of extremely large, mostly tech stocks.](https://www.investopedia.com/top-10-s-and-p-500-stocks-by-index-weight-4843111)
* [Most funds do not beat the index over a long period](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-pay-investment-adviser-beat-144400899.html).
* The more money that flows into index funds, however, [may worsen the results of index funds](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/).
* The cost of stock trades at most firms is now $0.00 and some allow for fractional shares.
   * This is a simplification as there are costs between the spreads, but you either pay management fees or the spread costs. You no longer have to have commissions on top.
* During times of volatility, companies that have poor financials will likely find it challenging to survive.
* [Zombie companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zombie-companies-hiding-uncomfortable-truth-183246812.html) are able to survive for longer periods during times of extremely cheap debt.
* Index funds have these 3 issues that are hard to get around:
   * You are unable to effectively [Tax-Loss Harvest](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp)   even though many of the holdings that make up the index would have had   losses, thereby reducing the return compared to directly investing in   that same set of stocks in the same proportions.
      * This may not be totally accurate as the manager may be doing some of this, but you don't have the choice of when he sells, only when you do.
   * You have no control over the holdings within the fund and may be supporting things you don‚Äôt want to support.
   * Due   to the way the index works, any large stock that becomes part of the   index is potentially a huge drag on the index. This happened when Tesla   was going to be added on 12/21/2020, which was announced on 11/16/2020,   forcing funds to buy the stock at the same time driving up the price,   which had already been driven up by people buying the stock knowing it   was then going to get added to the index forcing more people to buy the   stock. If you think it sounds kind of circular, that‚Äôs because it is.
      * Funds can attempt to counter this with some complex financial tools, but that doesn't mean they are successful.
* For most people it is impossible to time the market effectively. Tons of us seem to be able to buy at the peak no problem.
* Stock prices have all available information at the time priced into them.
* The markets are relatively efficient over the long-term.
* Companies   with strong financials, a competitive advantage, good management, a   sustainable business model, etc. tend to do better than companies   missing one or more of those attributes over the long-term.
* Tech   seems to be heavily weighted in most indexes. I don't see this necessarily as a problem. In my mind the digital landscape is infinite   compared to the physical world's finite space. With more tech being   found in every day devices, the advancement of [Industry 4.0](https://www.ibm.com/topics/industry-4-0), and younger generations more tech heavy than older generations will continue that trend in my opinion.

# Hypothesis

Using industry bench marking against the best companies in each industry in equal measure should provide a well   diversified portfolio that over the long term should be able to beat the   S&P 500.

# Industry Classification

* For Experiment 2020 the Sector was used to determine where companies should be compared.
   * This is made up of 11 sectors such as Information Technology, Communication Services, Utilities, etc.
   * This   seemed to be too restrictive and compared companies against each other   that aren‚Äôt really accurate comparisons. See the example on ROE below.
* So, for Experiment 2021 I used the Microsoft Excel Stock function to pull industries for all the stocks.
   * This looks like it pulls data mostly from Industry and Sub-industry.
   * This was successful on 98% of the stocks and for the final 2% I manually classified based on the taxonomy in the [Global Industry Classification Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Industry_Classification_Standard).
   * I   ended up needing to collapse the structure a little further.  Originally  there were 55 classes with many of the classes having less  than 10  parts.  I was able to collapse this to 44 classes. This will  likely be  tweaked a little further next year as I had mathematical  issues dealing  with averages/medians that were negative. There were  also just too many  categories with similar enough results that they  could be combined.

# Experiment 2020

750   stocks were analyzed against their peers in their industry. Stocks  were  given a score based on their relative percentage compared to the   industry index. For example, each companies‚Äô average ROE of the last 4   years was compared to this index value with the following type of   breakdown:

* ROE < Index ROE = Poor = 1
* ROE > Index ROE = Good = 2
* ROE > 150% of Index ROE = Great = 3

For   example, the ROE communication services industry index value used was   10.10%. If a communication services company had a ROE average of 9%,   they would receive a poor rating. If they had a ROE of 10.5% they would   receive a good rating. If they had a ROE of 25% they would receive a   great rating.

This was done for all of the metrics below:

* ROE
* Revenue Growth %
* EBITDA %
* FCF %

The   relative scores used for each of the metrics was tweaked until there   was a good distribution of results. e.g., if the 150% revenue growth   only found 5 companies with a Great rating, that may need to be   decreased to 125% for a better distribution.

Any stock that received a poor in any of the 4 metrics was eliminated.

Example on ROE [https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE](https://imgur.com/a/kujNkWE)

That left 53 stocks. EBITDA was then analyzed to see if it was declining, and if so, it too was eliminated.

This   left 45 stocks. These 45 were reviewed more thoroughly. What did the   company do? What were their competitive advantages? Are they currently   in any lawsuits? Does their debt look out of control? Do I see them   being a long-term sustainable choice? Is their IP about to expire?   Essentially boiling down to: Is there any reason that I want to exclude   them?

That left 26 across 7 sectors. [https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb](https://imgur.com/a/NsBdPtb)

These   26 stocks were bought in equal amounts in July 2020, August 2020, and   September 2020. To easily perform time weighted analysis of these  stocks  and determine if there was an opportunity cost, 10% of the total   purchase each period was also allocated to VFIAX.

The   chart below shows the total return of each stock including reinvested   dividends. MATH INDEX, second to the bottom, is the average of returns.    [https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN](https://imgur.com/a/al60PZN)

2020 LIST OF STOCKS:

* MNST
* MPWR
* MTCH
* OLED
* PAYC
* PHM
* PRAH
* TER
* TTD
* UI
* VEEV
* VMW
* VRTX

You can see VFIAX returned 28.20% vs the MATH INDEX of 36.56% over the same period, 30% higher returns.

For   those wondering how the exclusions did, they were only tracked against   the first July purchase, but that comparison to date, including   dividends for July purchase only, would be:

* MATH INDEX return of 39.24%
* Exclusions return of 33.75%
* VFIAX return of 30.05%

Overall after \~10 months we have 2 excellent results.

1. The full set of initial stocks had a greater return than the S&P 500
2. The ones that passed the more extensive due diligence returned an additional 5.5%

This is obviously a short period. Can we do it again this year? Should we go bigger? Yes.

# Experiment 2021

2,850   tickers of the largest US stocks were identified as the initial list.   The stocks had their last 5 years averaged for each of nine metrics:

* Revenue Growth % - shows growth rate of the company
* Profit Margin ‚Äì shows how effective the business is at making money
* Operating Margin ‚Äì shows how much money the company earns on its revenue
* FCF Margin ‚Äì shows how efficient a company is with their cash
* EBITDA Margin ‚Äì shows a companies‚Äô operating profitability
* ROE ‚Äì shows how well management balances profits, leverage, and assets to make money
* ROA ‚Äì shows how effectively a company utilizes its assets to generate profits
* ROIC ‚Äì shows how effective the company is at using its money to generate returns
* Debt/Equity Ratio ‚Äì shows the financial stability of a company

More   metrics were used due to the increased data set. These stocks were  then  grouped by industry, and the average of the averages is taken to   determine the industry average for the last 5 years; I switched to   median based on a few outliers really throwing the average for some of   the metrics. If that was confusing, here is an example:

* 3   stocks that make up an industry averaged -10%, 15%, and 20% ROE over   the last 5 years. The median over the last 5 years for that industry is   then 15% and all 3 of those stocks will be compared to that benchmark.

Each   stock was compared against its Industry benchmark for each of the   metrics and given a score 1=Poor, 2=Good, 3=Great as well as a composite   score out of 27. 9 metrics with a max score of 3 in each of the   metrics. The scores are based on how much better they are then the   average. I measured them against the benchmark using the same   methodology as previously performed: Poor < 100%, Good < 150%,   Great > 150%. Again, these may be tweaked slightly depending on the   particular metric to find a useful distribution.

I   also ranked every stock against the entire list for each of the  metrics  and overall. For those wondering, the best stock in this  ranking was  CORT with a score of 2,097 and the worst was CYCN with a  score of  23,095. Because the overall rank is a combination of 9  categories with  values ranging from 1-2791, the theoretical best a  company could do  would be 9 and the theoretical worst a company could  do would be 25,119.  Anyone wondering why the number of stocks doesn‚Äôt  match the original  input is primarily due to mergers/acquisitions or  the stock being taken  private. Another stock was acquired during the  analysis, changing the  max number yet again.

Here is an example showing Aerospace & Defense scoring: [https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE](https://imgur.com/a/fKDYNXE)

Here is an example showing growth scoring (the Revenue Growth column is the company‚Äôs most recent year): [https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM](https://imgur.com/a/6hy5NuM)

Here is an example of the visualizations for the data:[https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM](https://imgur.com/a/bMH98rM)

I   applied a series of filters to eliminated unwanted noise. I looked at   the top 5 stocks per industry (extending out for any ties), any stock   that scored a 25, 26, or 27 on the composite, or any stock that had a   high enough overall rank to justify being reviewed.

Next,   I read the description of \~300 stocks and looked through their   financials for any inconsistencies, such as one huge year throwing off   their average, profit margins higher than operating margins, highly   leveraged companies with poor growth, etc. My favorite find was that   Chemed Corporation provides hospice/palliative care and owns   Roto-Rooter. Yes, I did end up keeping them, no there are not great   synergies between the sectors of the business, yes, they are aware of   this. I also eliminated industries I wasn‚Äôt interested in reviewing,   such as REITS due to the need to look at different metrics like FFO, Oil   and Gas because it‚Äôs oil and gas, etc. These activities eliminated   \~150. I would like to get back to REITs, but I‚Äôd need to build a   separate model.

I then looked at   each stock in more detail compared to its peers that made the cut. Are   all the rest of them in the double digits for growth, are the profit   margins substantially less, which one is in a better debt situation,   etc. Who deserves to be on this list? This eliminated \~75.

We   were down to 84 stocks at this point. I then attempted to look at each   company's investor presentation, annual report, etc. to better   understand what the company does, their revenue model, risks, etc. I was   not nearly as thorough on this portion this year compared to last year   just due to the substantial increase in companies, 26 vs 84. I only   eliminated 1 company which left us at the grand total of 83 companies   across 31 industries. Breakdown here: [https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9](https://imgur.com/a/8P9dmd9)

# Notes

* I   partnered up for both the 2020 and 2021 experiments. This was critical   for both expanding my initial idea, brainstorming methods to build the   model, assistance on the code, gathering data, and reviewing for  errors.  This was a team effort, and I by no means deserve all the credit.
* All data is shown through close of market 4/30/2021. Took a long time to write all of this up.
* Unless specified, all returns are showing reinvested dividends in the total return.
* Interestingly   5 out of the 19 stocks that were eliminated in the last round of the   2020 experiment made it to this year‚Äôs list. 15 out of 26 of last year‚Äôs   final picks also made it. I‚Äôll post an update once I have more than a   few data points. If you have any questions, I‚Äôll do my best to answer   them. Hope you enjoyed the journey.
* The indexes ended up heavily weighted in tech/semiconductors. This is the way the math pointed me, so that's the way I went.
* It would  be great to be able to run some more thorough regression analysis, but since the math portion only narrows the playing field and a fair amount of the heavy lifting still occurs with individual analysis, this would be pretty much impossible. Creating a model based off past results may also provide a bias that I'm not sure I'd be immune to either.
* The math is used to find stocks worth reviewing, provide the visualizations to perform comparisons between stocks in the industry and across the full data set to assist with the human analysis.
* I've seen a fair number of posts along the lines of ""How do you find your stocks, how do I find stocks to research, etc."" Here are a list of \~100 stocks in a variety of industries you can review if interested. Some you've heard of, some you probably have not.
* The 2021 stock list makes up 28% of the S&P, with the 59 stocks that are in both lists, due to the market cap ranking.

\*I   am not a financial advisor or anything else I should put here to  ensure  it is clear that I did this for myself and am sharing my results  and am  in no way forcing you to push buttons to buy things you don‚Äôt   understand or requiring justification for this run on sentence and   henceforth. Past results are no guarantee of future returns."

2021-05-10 14:01:34,stocks,Very cool. How do you measure against the benchmark? Did you use ARIMA or similar methods?
2021-05-10 14:21:45,stocks,"Thanks. Even easier, I just take 10% of whatever I spent on my selection of stocks to buy the index.

Amazon has been a fairly infrequent issuer, but it comes in big on those rare occasions. It last tapped the bond market in June 2020, borrowing $10 billion for general corporate purposes. Prior to that, it sold $16 billion of bonds in 2017 to help finance its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc.

The proceeds of Monday‚Äôs offering will be for general corporate purposes, which may also include acquisitions and working capital, said the person. The two-year bond will be allocated for eligible green or social projects.

Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. are managing the sale, said the person.

DKNG's strategy this whole time has been a larger outlay to get more customers in the door and then hope to keep them. Revenue numbers would say, that's working. At some point, yes margins are going to have to get better but we are still in the early stages of sports betting where the emphasis is more on expansion than profits. If we are talking 3+ years down the road with widespread betting and DKNG is still losing money, that's more of an issue. 

DKNG still has a good debt structure and it's pretty apparent that for the foreseeable future they and FanDuel are going to dominate the US Sports Betting market."

2021-05-10 10:30:11,stocks,"Their earnings were not positively tending. Q1 EPS is lower than Q4. I urge you to actually do some DD. Net loss exploded from $68.7 million a year ago to $346.3 million in the first quarter, primarily on the back of marketing and administrative costs. Its revenue doubled, but cost of revenue tripled. Those types of costs, read in conjunction with their industry competitors, look structural.

Their earnings report was their first real test on whether online gambling is a legitimate gold mine, or if it's just a mirage. There are plenty of low margin highly competitive markets where profitability is years away. DKNG, it was argued, wasn't that. Turns out, it is.  

If you invested with a number in mind for what DKNG's maximum market looks like, which is like basic DD, by necessity you need to be substantially reevaluating if profitability is possible in the next decade. If an extra 500 million in revenue only equals a few extra cents on the share, you have to think 5 billion is a realistic revenue goal. 

Even if such-and-such billion in revenue is realistic, which it isn't, DKNG has not shown any ability to be a market leader. It markets especially well to younger demographics, which is why it's here on /r/stocks versus Penn National, GAN, Golden Nugget, Rush et al It's still priced at a 10% premium, give or take a few percent, over its many competitors for no actual reason at all

It has a long way to drop. Conceptually, there is a world where DKNG threads the needle and continues to balloon in revenue, defeats its competitors, doesn't burn all its cash, gets a better margin, gets through the next seven years without a conventional gaming company dominating etc etc. Personally, I'd leave the bags and get the hell out. 

If you really like the market, just invest in MGM Resorts or Sands or any of the conventional gambling companies that have mulled entering the crowded field. Either way, it's obvious why the shareprice has taken a beating"

2021-05-10 11:22:08,stocks,"Just a few things I would say in response to this:

> Those types of costs, read in conjunction with their industry competitors, look structural.

A lot of this is tied to either expansion and new user acquisition. While states legalize, expansion is going to outpace the revenue jumps early on. As for the user acquisition, a lot of this is bonuses for new users which I wouldn't consider ""structural""

> Their earnings report was their first real test on whether online gambling is a legitimate gold mine, or if it's just a mirage.

Friendly reminder, that the US Sports Betting market is still in its infancy, it's difficult to make any true judgments on the industry as a whole. UK sports betting companies do work on tight margins but are profitable. I think the US market can be much for lucrative especially for DKNG who A. owns their own primary tech partner (SBTech) and B. will be more mobile-based which should help margins

> Even if such-and-such billion in revenue is realistic, which it isn't, DKNG has not shown any ability to be a market leader.

DKNG and FanDuel are the overwhelming market leaders in the US

>Conceptually, there is a world where DKNG threads the needle and continues to balloon in revenue, defeats its competitors, gets a better margin, gets through the next seven years without a conventional gaming company dominating etc etc. Personally, I'd leave the bags and get the hell out. If you really like the market, just invest in MGM Resorts or Sands or any of the conventional gambling companies that have mulled entering the crowded field.

Two points to make here:

1. These conventional gaming companies had the same opportunity, if not a better one, to enter the sports betting market already and were breezed past by DraftKings and FanDuel. Why would now be different?

2. Mobile betting is dominating the sports betting market and even pre-COVID held 80%+ of revenue in newly expanded states. Unless traditionally gambling entities can put out apps to compete with DraftKings and FanDuel, I don't see them being legit competitors.

Full disclosure, I do like MGM but as a igaming play. I don't think they will compete with DraftKings and FanDuel in the sports betting market and the igaming market's potential is capped and widespread legalization will be a much steeper uphill battle."
2021-05-10 11:29:51,stocks,Physical space and employees of a casino are a major negative for MGM or Sands.  Casinos are dieing and the more states allow online gambling the less people will travel to a place to gamble.
2021-05-10 10:48:41,stocks,"Profit is irrelevant at this point, they are in the high growth stage.  And they're seeing fantastic growth in all their other metrics.  The industry is still in the early stages too, with only a handful of US states having legalized betting at this point.  And while there is a lot of competition, this is an absolute massive market - some estimates put the TAM at close to $100B worldwide.

And you're wrong that DNKG is not a market leader, they are the leader in DFS and are doing an excellent job transitioning from that focus to broader offerings.  Monthly users more than doubled this quarter."
2021-05-10 12:47:25,stocks,"I think as states continue to legalize sports gambling this won't really be an issue. I'd rather go direct than use a bookie somewhere, sure it's more fun at a sportsbook but I can see them capitalizing on that market share state by state as legality rolls out. I'm long on DKNG for sure."
2021-05-10 19:24:30,stocks,Offshore betting seem to offers better odds

The problem was DK and FD got their start in the quasi-legal DFS scene, which no regulated casino gaming company was going to touch with a 1000 foot pole, lest they risk their casino licenses.  There is nothing fundamentally special about DK and FD's products compared to their competitors, and there is no reason to think DK or FD enjoy any long term structural advantage or have any regulatory moats (unless they can convince more states to go the NH/Oregon route where there is a single state vendor)."
2021-05-10 10:55:05,stocks,What do you think is DKNG's revenue in 6 years
2021-05-10 17:02:14,stocks,Brand image and presentation counts for something if all the products are structurally the same.  DraftKings has the best app and best presentation.  FanDuel is just as good sports wise but their casino sucks.  All of the other gaming apps are either barebones or embarrassingly poor UI wise.  You can make the same argument for Discord vs Slack vs Teams.
2021-05-10 11:48:39,stocks,"Six years from now?  No idea, I'm not an analyst.  But they did revise guidance upwards for 63-79% growth for 2021.  Even if you give them a very conservative estimate of 30% growth annually, that would take them from $1.1B this year to $5.3B in six years.

Just to give you an idea of the scale of the TAM, the single state of New Jersey has generated $920M in revenues for sports books since June, 2018.  That's one single state."
2021-05-10 17:31:24,stocks,"Oh I completely agree, which just supports my point.  Regarding Discord, it wasn't that long ago that people heavily used TeamSpeak, or Battlecom, or Roger Wilco (going back a bit farther, admittedly).  Turnover in the software sector can happen very quickly if you don't continue to innovate.  While FD and DK had a head start, there is no reason to think MGM, Penn/Barstool, Wynn, Caesars, etc, won't ever be able to catch up if they put the effort in."
2021-05-10 11:49:58,stocks,"What do you think their cost of revenue will be in 6 years, and then please give me an estimate on operating expenses."
2021-05-10 17:56:37,stocks,Sure which has gotta be why they‚Äôre spending so much on marketing plus nabbing those exclusive deals with the UFC and NFL.  I agree they can‚Äôt slip up because of the competition but I see them doing everything right at the moment in what I think is going to be a hugely popular industry.  That said I never expected to see it drop to 45 or PLTR to drop below 20 so what the hell do I know.

They waited for the 1 year mark, so they can take profit at Long term capital gains rate. 

Same will happen to crypto. People who got in early with huge gains will realize them eventually. It's a game of chicken. All it takes is some big players to cash out, and no one wants to hold the bag."

However, the other 40% of my portfolio is down massively these last 2 months (-15%). I don't need the money right now, and I invested thinking on the long term, so I am not planning to sell, but I do wonder for how long growth stocks will be hammered? 

Both DOW and SP500 keep hitting ATH day after day. This surely cannot go on for much longer, right? I have cash in hand, but I don't want to buy because I feel like this could reverse any moment. Thoughts?"

Is there any reason for optimism this may stop soon (completely aware many were supremely overvalued but was happy with my average cost). Dow somehow hits ATH while QQQ is starting to show cracks. Even on green Nasdaq days these growth companies still bleed. Many are approaching levels from summer last year during  start of crazy tech run. I don‚Äôt want to sell for a loss on companies I like long term but it kills me day after day of these beat downs and I‚Äôm getting sick of averaging down just to see another leg further down.

2021-05-10 10:01:06,stocks,This tech sell off could just be people taking profits ahead of the CPI data release. Since it is expected to be the worst so why hold tech stocks through that and ruin your profits. When you can buy stocks that can thrive in an inflationary situation.

2021-05-10 18:20:39,stocks,"For all the discussion of Nasdaq overvaluation and has run up to far, consider the following:

1 yr change (%)

 Nasdaq:  +50.77%

S&P:          +44.47%

DOW:       +42.93%

&#x200B;

I'd argue that DOW/S&P are overvalued currently and the Nasdaq is arguably undervalued.  After all, tech companies by and large experienced record profitability and expansion over the course of the last year + due to Covid.  Most of the companies composing the S&P and Dow   
ate enormous losses.  

Anyway, just found this to be interesting since the conventional wisdom is tech valuation is too high.  It no doubt was last September.  But I don't think that is the case anymore at all."

Absolutely nothing changed in a number of companies but I saw a bunch of price targets get lowered.   

So they are just reacting to the market instead of the actual fundamentals. They care more about being right than actually providing real analysis.  

Anyone can look at the current stock price and make up a price target close to that number. The job of analysts is to show a price target based on the fundamentals of a company.  

There are a lot of good deals in tech right now, and while the retail investor might be too scared to buy in, I‚Äôm sure that funds with dedicated research teams will be scooping them up at great entry prices."

If it finishes up I'll be really surprised, if the similarities continue, the market likely weakens throughout today. 

Frankly there's probably risk that the Dow throws this away as well. Maybe it doesn't do it completely, but it'll likely shed at least half of this."

To put things in perspective, current median NTM revenue multiple is ~14x, this is 27% higher than pre-covid levels. For high growth software, current median NTM revenue multiple is ~22x. 41% higher then pre-covid levels. So if we expect to hit pre-covid valuations (which could happen due to inflation concerns) there is still a long way to go to hit bottom.

Even after the sell offs, the valuations are well above historical levels."

If it's really as bad as those commodity's futures, then there will be huge pressure on corporate earnings. It will also be passed on to consumers. People will be spending much less as they want to make sure they can be ready for the massive price surge coming to grocery stores."

It blew its revenue forecast out of the park Friday with 267% revenue growth, and it's still diving deep into the red today. Not only that, but this was its third consecutive profitable quarter. It's a really good company. The Motley fools opined that it might be because the BMO Capital Markets noted its good numbers but didn't make the recommendation for its members to buy it. 

This is just one example, but it's not an outlier. There are good profitable companies getting hit hard right now for no apparent reason.

I love the idea, but at the end of the day they're essentially a government contractor with a modest book to price ratio. I'm not even sure they should be public, but evidently they wanted that money. 

They're years away from profitability, and even when they become profitable Palantir will be what it is today. They'll be working the margins of federal and state government contracts. At best we can say in a few years from now their offerings will appeal to some private companies, but then again maybe they won't. Private companies don't buy good products every day. 

What I do know is their current price is untethered from Palantir's own guidance, and as far as I can tell also detached from even the most bullish analyst. It was a fun ride, but all rides have to come to an end."

We are seeing companies put up big earnings beats and still slide... what do all these companies have in common? Lofty valuations. 2020 valuations didn‚Äôt matter, however it seems this year anything trading at a high multiple is getting crushed regardless of earnings. Why? Likely due to risk of inflation. Whether it be transitory or hyper inflation, growth stocks struggle during inflation. They have narrow or negative margins which only further decrease when commodity prices increase. Their losses will amplify. And inflation is here, we just don‚Äôt know to what degree or how long it will last (right now it‚Äôs within limits). However if inflation continues, feds will be forced to raise rates which also hurts growth stocks. That cheap money they use to grow and invest in themselves is no longer ‚Äúcheap‚Äù.

I did this not because I don't believe in steel, but because as steel continues to rise I will make less money on them than on a comparable OTM strike, because my ITM's were no longer gaining extrinsic value, just intrinsic.

Whilst you may only work for money, to a lot of people work itself gives you a sense of purpose and self-worth that goes beyond the earning potential. If business cannot provide that then they should offer more.

I think the jobs report is a mixture of people choosing to get the correct job for themselves rather than accepting underemployment or bad pay and working conditions, whilst also reflecting the weaker economy in high employment sectors (hospitality and tourism) which are not at fully capacity."

2021-05-10 11:53:09,stocks,"I would say this is a tad disingenuous. It's not just tech. Off the top of my head: small caps, travel, entertainment, weed, clean energy, (and tech) have all seen huge corrections.

2021-05-10 11:17:22,stocks,Yup without my VTI I‚Äôd be down a lot more... definitely will continue adding to VTI this year to beef up my portfolio.

2021-05-10 12:40:16,stocks,"Im using it as an experiment, I bought at 66 on the 29th and was up 2% on the same day but thought ""who sells for a 2% gain?""

I mean I should have in hindsight obviously lol but now I'm going to see what happens to it over the next few weeks. 

It's recovered from 57 to 61 twice in the last few days, now I just need it to go from 61 to 66 and then I'll be back in the green. Stranger things have happened and it's not a large position so I'll just see where it goes."

2021-05-10 18:30:53,stocks,A lot of tech is down 10% from ath this year though.
2021-05-10 18:36:11,stocks,FANNG continue to crush earnings so QQQ has held up for the most part but a lot of companies with real earnings have fallen 10-40% from ATH‚Äôs.  Speculative growth has fallen 40-70% in some cases - which I know were overvalued.
2021-05-10 19:15:37,stocks,buying puts will define the downside. Short selling...can we say rather risly?

2021-05-10 18:09:06,stocks,"Shutup lurker suit.

hedges drive the price down to make money on the way down, before buying on the bottom.

that is manipulation. the increase in downward momentum for a lot of these growth stocks is absolutely caused by hedge funds shorting these stocks, and the price levels are below what would be if they were not actively shorting. and why the hell not? its a money making opportunity!

however, you could also argue part of the upward momentum we saw last year is ALSO caused by that as well."
2021-05-10 12:57:41,stocks,"You're not kidding. I was about to say ""People will rent more cars now that the pandemic is over,"" but that doesn't justify it going to 2x what it was *before* March 2020."

2021-05-10 16:21:40,stocks,because big mega corps are worth so much of the total market so them being at ATH lifts the whole market. Even if every other stock is massively down
2021-05-10 15:26:53,stocks,"I dont think its a crash at all though, otherwise it's one out of nowhere for no clear reason.

2021-05-10 15:25:41,stocks,"There are many stocks that have been getting beaten up for months now, most are closer to 30-40% off recent highs not 3-4%.

I'm getting 3-4% losses on things like TSLA on the reg. Hell AAPL and AMZN are both down nearly 3% today alone for no reason. 

AMD for example has now been trading sideways since August despite killer earnings and massive growth"
2021-05-10 15:24:07,stocks,"Depends on the index, and for some, especially those that are tech heavy, it feels like much more of a drop"
2021-05-10 10:08:55,stocks,"Anybody who got in before the mad run up last year, if you joined the stock market this calendar year (like myself), you‚Äôve basically spent the last 4 or so months getting fucked on a daily basis for no reason"

nothing makes sense."
2021-05-10 11:38:36,stocks,Inflation fears should affect the entire stock market though right? Not just tech.
2021-05-10 14:03:26,stocks,"Yeah, that was why I didn't buy in until after it fell 36%. I just guessed wrong about the bottom apparently."

2021-05-10 19:51:46,stocks,"I‚Äôm surprisingly hopeful for earnings this time! Usually stocks tank after earning because a lot of short term traders pick‚Äôem up a couple weeks before and drop right after, even when the earnings are great!

2021-05-10 11:09:28,stocks,"I've been buying up more and more of it. Clean energy is one of those areas that's insanely complex and I'd rather trust an ETF with it. Bought some of TAN too, but I would very much like the beating to stop now üòÅ"

2021-05-10 15:30:19,stocks,"I really want to think that too, I‚Äôm inclined to think that it‚Äôs misplaced fear and panic by large funds because of all this inflation drama, infrastructure talk, the microchip shortage etc etc etc"
2021-05-10 15:44:46,stocks,"a large part is manipulation. 

how do you know - this response will get downvoted into oblivion, by lurking suits. that's why. 

it's common knowledge that it is manipulation, so the only reason to downvote a post is to manipulate the new reddit stock community into thinking its not manipulation and  thus not blame the suits."

2021-05-10 09:35:37,stocks,"Yeah the green run in late April was a fakeout. Tech's still got some correcting to do. I only feel good about holding my FAAMG stocks and that's cause as an IT/software guy myself I have an intuitive understanding how much products are developing and as far as growth companies go, these guys have the best shot at naturally growing into their overhyped value and beyond.

2021-05-10 12:46:46,stocks,PLTR OTM ones at $20 and above. DKNG is also getting super cheap. Both might be considered meme stocks to some though.
2021-05-10 12:50:36,stocks,I never said I was buying just that they were getting cheap. Im waiting until at least after the CPI data release this week to consider it.
2021-05-10 13:50:04,stocks,"8 or 9 is fair value if you don't work in the data space and don't understand the future potential.

Here is an analogy to help explain what they could POTENTIALLY do (and is the reason why I am invested in a small %):

PLTR is to Data Insight/Analysis Tools and Insights as Apple was to Computer User Interfaces in the 80's.

The problem they are trying to solve is immense and much harder than what apple did, however (and some could argue apple just stole other ideas as well). its a huge risk."
2021-05-10 13:03:43,stocks,"Good point, they haven't really proven any growth in their earnings thus far, so it's understandable to put that as a fair value. I think without an improvement in their latest earnings this week, $10 could offer a nice entry point, maybe I'll begin buying at 11 and average down to 9 if I ever get the chance. Not sure if I want to get into them yet though. I haven't done enough DD into them to get an idea of where they stand"
2021-05-10 08:38:09,stocks,I think $15 LEAPS are a good play. I just dont see it getting above my cost basis ($26) anytime soon. It seems like its on its way down and is yet to find a new floor (maybe 14-15)
2021-05-10 10:33:03,stocks,I dont know. If CPI data shows inflation could cause people to sell out of tech even more and want to wait until they know inflation is temporary. Which could be months. What bailed us out Friday was the jobs report. Could be a lot worse right now for tech holders.
2021-05-10 16:09:16,stocks,DOW stocks have been holding up my portfolio so I liked the green.

2021-05-10 08:50:18,stocks,"I‚Äôm sure SPX is also irrelevant since it had a 100+ point reversal from Tuesday while hypergrowth stocks only could really catch a bid on Friday morning.

Heck, let‚Äôs toss in QQQ too since all things considered, it was only down a bit under 2% last week."
2021-05-10 09:43:43,stocks,"The DOW is probably the stongest managed portfolio in the world. It may not represent the entire market's health accurately at times but its choices and diversification have allowed it to consistently rise even as markets shift in all kinds of directions. Some of its members are big tech stocks but you wouldn't realize that given how the overall index's score continues to soar. 

No other index/portfolio manages to achieve such incredible diversity and consistent growth while at the same time still being relatively condensed with just 30 stocks at a time."

2021-05-10 18:32:22,stocks,"Yeah it's a complete joke. Do people think TDOC was some sort of pop-up company that only existed for the duration of the pandemic and will be out of business next year?   

TDOC got a massive jump forward because of the pandemic. Their timeline is significantly accelerated as a result.   

Even without the pandemic, there would be no reason for it to be valued the exact same one year later. With the increased adoption due to the pandemic? It's worth *way* more."

2021-05-10 15:06:18,stocks,"I know, I'm just sort of insinuating that the continued drop-recover-drop behavior of the highly speculative ARKK (and others like it) is a typical precursor of an asset bubble breaking.

 In no way do I claim that this is a risk free investment, far from it, but just like many other ""futuristic"" technology companies(Tesla being the biggest one, though very different industry), I believe stocks like these are overlooked early on.

Also, and I realize the following might point my investment towards ""meme stock territory"", yhe medical field isn't exactly tied to the market in the same way as other fields. For crsp, they currently don't have a full time ""product"" to sell, what I'm betting on is that their research will lead them to something groundbreaking.

Or I could be throwing my money away on risky memes. Such is the nature of the game.

Bezant resources (BZT) tiny market cap and expecting news soon. Basically even distinctly average news should make this stock move. It has recently re-rated but I think this is only just the start.

Kefi minerals (KEFI). Amazing prospects. Not amazing CEO. The date to final project funding keeps getting pushed back and back (literally years and the people who bought in years ago have been diluted to hell) but it really does look as if the end is in sight now (couple of months, if that, for one of the properties). Once financing is sorted, it will easily 5x in 2 or 3 years. That's not counting the other properties like the one in Saudi Arabia.

Jubilee Metals (JLP) - A very safe bet for the future, with a 450m MCAP and if you want a more green mining company, this is it. They buy the waste ground that other mining companies can't be bothered to use and make a killing from it as there is so much. They have recently had a bit of a run up as well due to various factors including moving into Cyprus.

Greatland Gold (GGP) - if you want a safe bet and an amazing value play, buy this stock. They have Havieron (Google it). Recently the stock has been hammered due to it being the golden boy in mining but it had bad results back from one of its other properties. Complete overreaction.

Alien metals (UFO) if you want good exposure to a silver mining company. They also have amazing iron ore and graphite prospects.

EUA if you want to gamble on an amazing sale to various majors. They have Monchetundra (again, google it) and the sale process has been going on for over a year by now. Danger is it is Russian juristiction and putin is bait as fuck. Sale could 10x tomorrow for all we on the boards know but it will likely be another few months and will probably 3x when (if) the sale goes through. But if it doesn't go through and we mine it ourselves then Holy fuck the possibilities for return are endless but so will the wait be.

I have to jet for dinner now so won't be giving any more detail but if you want higher risk / higher reward like the first one in particular then check out GWMO / WSBN / XTR (all AIM tickers).

My other point was simply that airlines have not ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù until they are flying the same number of flights, with the same capacity, with fewer cancellations, and with better revenue and earnings (to account for inflation and the added costs of paying down the debt that floated the companies through 2020+).

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"PSFE (Paysafe): A better way to bet on multiple high growth companies like DRAFTKINGS, BARSTOOL, FORTNITE, TWITCH, YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, ETC. Paysafe is one hell of a company. They are a fin-tech like PayPal and Squares, thus should be given a higher multiple for valuation. They got a lot of exciting and growth customers/partners like Barstool (PENN), YouTube (Google), Twitch (AMZN), FanDuel (PDYPY), Roblox (RBLX), CoinBase (COIN), Visa (V), ApplePay (APPL), BetMGM (MGM), Spotify (SPOT), Microsoft/Xbox etc., and on top of that they got a huge digital wallet (#2 in market share) where you can trade/buy the fast-growing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins. I truly believed this Paysafe is undervalued compared to its peers. You can read a very good Paysafe DD below on reddit and it gives a lot of insight of Paysafe valuation and bear cases:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing\_the\_bear\_case\_on\_paysafe\_psfe/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mysz54/reviewing_the_bear_case_on_paysafe_psfe/)

(the link above is a really really good read with lots of info about Paysafe including discussion of bear cases, so I‚Äôm not going to repeat most of the good points the author mentioned in that sub.)

Most of the time analysis use assumptions to make predictions on future growth. As an example, EV-related stocks (PLUG, BLNK, QS, LAZR, NKLA, BLDP, etc) get higher or ridiculous valuation based on assumption that gasoline cars will eventually be phased out. As you can see most if not all of these companies are unprofitable and some don‚Äôt even have revenue, yet worth billions. While this assumption may be accurate, it is extremely hard to know when will growth begin to accelerate. Because of this predictive nature, it‚Äôs really hard to know how long you will have to hold onto the stocks before they pop. When or if it will pop is anyone's guess. So while holding onto these stocks will likely result in wild price swings thus high risk / high rewards.

But what if you have the data before you showing the financial growth of your customers or partners? If your customers/partners' revenue grows, it‚Äôs more likely than not they are using more of your products or services. Paysafe is one such company where you can actually look at their customers/partners' financial reports to predict where the company will go in the future and when growth will start. For this reason, Paysafe is more of a lower risk but still has high reward potential.

Paysafe will be reporting earning for the very first time as a public company again on May 11. The good news is we already have their customers results in and here are some breakdown of their 1st QTR results showing huge growth:

1. PENN (Reported May 7, 2021) - ‚ÄúPenn National‚Äôs income from operations rose to $216.5 million in the first quarter against ($560.6) million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDAR jumped 77.2% from the year-ago quarter to $447 million. Moreover, adjusted EBITDAR margin expanded to 35.1% from 22.6% a year ago.‚Äù ( source: [https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates](https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/1515673/penn-national-penn-q1-earnings-revenues-beat-estimates) )
2. DraftKing ( Reported May 7, 2021) - ‚ÄúDraftKings is raising its fiscal year 2021 revenue guidance from a range of $900 million to $1 billion to a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, which equates to year-over-year growth of 63% to 79% and a 16% increase compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance‚Äù

(Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/07/2225374/0/en/DraftKings-Reports-First-Quarter-2021-Results-and-Raises-2021-Revenue-Guidance.html) )

3. Spotify (April 28th, 2021)- ‚ÄúRevenue increased 16% to ‚Ç¨2.15 billion ($2.6 billion) from ‚Ç¨1.85 billion ($2.22 billion) in the same period last year‚Ä¶.‚Äù (source: [https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9564180/spotify-q1-2021-earnings-report/))

4. Youtube/Google ( April 27th, 2021 ) - ‚Äú In its first-quarter earnings report Tuesday, Google parent company [Alphabet](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) said YouTube [brought in](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/alphabet-goog-earnings-q1-2021.html) revenue of $6.01 billion in advertising revenue during the quarter ‚Äî up from $4 billion from a year ago, for a growth rate of 49%. That‚Äôs an acceleration over its 46% growth in Q4. It‚Äôs also nearly twice the growth rate of Netflix, which reported 24% revenue growth [in Q1](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/20/netflix-nflx-q1-2021-earnings.html), and [expects](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf) growth to slow to 19% next quarter.‚Äù (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/youtube-could-soon-equal-netflix-in-revenue.html) )

5. Skillz ( May 4, 2021 ) - ‚ÄúRevenue grew to $83.7 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 92% over the prior year. Gross profit grew to $79.4 million during the first quarter of 2021, up 95% over the prior year.‚Äù (source: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210504006307/en/CORRECTING-and-REPLACING-Skillz-Reports-Record-Q1-Revenue-and-Raises-2021-Guidance) )

As you can see these Paysafe‚Äôs customers/partners are reporting explosive growth. While some of these companies may report an earning loss it may be due to higher expenses such as customers acquisition cost (i.e. Draftking). However, here we are more focused on their revenue as the more transactions they do the more likely all or part of that transaction is done by Paysafe. These companies reported earnings before Paysafe, so it can be highly expected Paysafe will report a very good earning and future growth projection tomorrow ( May 11).

Several things to note about Paysafe besides their customer‚Äôs earning growth. These factors will also influence Paysafe‚Äôs future growth:

1. They are a monopoly when it comes to iGaming/Sport Betting as you can see the explosive growth by DKNG, MGM, PENN, SKLZ, etc.
2. Paysafe took a hit during the pandemic because they also do offline transaction processing, but now things are opening up we can expect going forward these offline transactions will grow again. Also, when re-opening occur, more sport events will occur thus more betting means more transactions for Paysafe.
3. They are #2 in digital wallets and you can buy digital currency with the wallet. These currency has been generating huge revenue for PayPal and SQ (more on this below)

Finally, both PayPal and SQ reported earning before Paysafe and their results beat estimation:

Paypal earning ( May 5, 2021) ‚Äú Revenue: $6.03 billion vs. $5.90 billion expected by Refinitiv‚Äù (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/paypal-pypl-earnings-q1-2021.html) )

Square earning ( May 6, 2021 ) ‚ÄúSquare reported a profit of 41 cents per share vs. 16 cents per share expected in a Refinitiv survey of analysts. It also brought in $5.06 billion of revenue vs. $3.36 billion expected by Refinitiv.‚Äù ( source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html))

So I can say with confidence Paysafe will likely beat their own guidance for Q1 on May 11th. For those of you who don‚Äôt know Paysafe, they are not a small player. Their transaction volume is about that of SQ \~$100 Billion. If Paysafe is able to show growth on par with PayPal and SQ they should be trading at a much higher multiple. See the reddit link above for DD on valuation.

In summary, I think Paysafe is a low risk / high reward stock compare to other fintech. Their growth is easier to predict as we can rely on their publicly traded customers data which is showing high growth going forward. They got the 2nd largest digital wallet. They are involved in the highly popular and fast growth digital currency market. I believe as a monopoly in iGaming/Sport Betting their growth will be massive when the 4 largest states: CA, TX, NY, FL begin to allow online sport betting. This is something about Paysafe that I like so much because no other fintech has. This is a massive high growth area and they own the space. For these reason, I am extremely bullish and I like Paysafe for both short and longer term play.

There is a lot of competition in fintech and digital wallets, they have a solid grip on that niche but need to expand to grow quickly enough to be valued alongside other fintech.

I think their valuation is nice, but growth has slowed, hence the risk. If they seem to be stagnating over the next 1-2 years I am out, otherwise I expect it to 2-3x in the next three years. I think downside is limited to maybe 20% from here in 3 years time if they continue to slow growth and rely on current profit rates"

If you read the other DD link I post, you'll know why the CAGR is small because it doesn't include igame/sportbetting.

While you can pay with your bank account or credit card. Why would you want to enter in you info each time you go shopping online or do sport betting online or deposit to your gaming site? A digital wallet kept all your info so you just login and deposit. So it's actually more convience, not less.  This is especailly true for sportbetting.  You can transfer your funds from/to multiple betting site into Neteller/Skrill wallet like from DKNG, betMGM, Barstool to Neteller/Skrill and vice versa.

2021-05-10 05:59:47,stocks,Very similar to PayPal with the whole digital wallet. Think this is the area that Foley will be able to add the most value to with the connections to casinos. Even my broker accepts payments from Skrill so at least here in the UK it's everywhere and the more expansion to different countries the more value will be placed onto the brand

2021-05-10 06:07:11,stocks,I guess you are right! Why would I choose skrill over paypal tho?
2021-05-10 12:31:46,stocks,"Exactly. 1/2 Paysafe revenue comes from outside you US so growth going forward is inside US with igame/sport betting which they are monopoly so growth is huge. Even with less than 1/2 the population just start betting their customers already showing huge growth. Imagine when the other 20+ states including the 4 largest state go online with gambling and sportbetting. Mind you gambling is addictive people will keep betting.

Again, you kept mentioning 2016 and the past. I mentioned there was no sportbetting in the US back then. It recently overturn by the SCOTUS. In their investor presentation and in the DD link I post above from the other author, igaming/sportbetting wasn't included in their CAGR estimate.  Their earing report is tomorrow. We'll see what their new CAGR estimate will be. I'm not looking at the past, I'm looking at the future. This is why in this DD I point out to the customers recent 1st Qtr earning so it can give us an idea how much potential there is for Paysafe to increase revenue.

It's not that they (or SQ or PayPal) are taking away market share from coinbase as you imply. Its that the market expand (i.e. more people getting into it). If Paypal and SQ can increase revenue with digital currency why can't Paysafe when they are #2 in digital wallet? We'll see their report tomorrow.

I post the link to the other reply."
2021-05-10 06:12:34,stocks,"Not all gambling sites accept PayPal. So the idea of Skrill is to be as accessible to as many sites as possible. Helps a person to have one wallet that can be used easily and across the sector. Every time to deposit you get loyalty points that can be used to purchase gift cards for popular websites such as Amazon, this offsets the fee for deposit."

The options are expiring mid June.
Ally seems to have a consistent $1 a week rise and that looks like it will prob continue.

2021-05-10 08:29:23,stocks,Now. No further consideration needed.
2021-05-10 05:22:10,stocks,130% is nice. You could sell with zero regret if the value went up after. Or at least part.
2021-05-10 04:56:53,stocks,"You can always sell a part of the position now and more later.  For example, sell half now and you recouped all you money and a small profit and still own half of your position."
2021-05-10 08:53:30,stocks,"Take profit. You should have some trades already aet to do that for you so you don't have to think about it.

You can sell in stages (say 50% up, then 60%  etc), but do yourself a favor and develop a strategy, so you can save time and nerves by not looking at the screen for six and a half hours a day.

Think about it: how much can you realistically milk out of those options? How much will it hurt if there something that brings that 130% down to 25%

Good luck!"

2021-05-10 16:53:44,stocks,"I say sell now. After playing with options for a while, I think the most important thing I've learned is SELL WHILE THE GOING IS GOOD. There have been times where my option was up about say 50-60%, but because I was greedy and wanted more, it would drop like a stone in water. Time is your worst enemy when it comes to options. The extrinsic value of your option is guaranteed to go down with respect to time, while it's uncertain which way the intrinsic value of the option will go. Under the odds where one is uncertain and the other is a guaranteed loss if you wait, selling is definitely a good idea."

2021-05-10 04:50:02,stocks,"Fair.

Also btw- my question isn‚Äôt on whether the price will go up or down.

It‚Äôs more regarding the dynamics of options pricing etc

I‚Äôm fairly certain the share price will keep going up, albeit only slightly, but I am unaware of the underlying dynamics of options pricing. Will the Price go down as we get closer to expiration?

Exercising is almost never worth it besides a few unique circumstances.

I'd probably cash out at least some, even if you are confident that there's more near-term upside to be had"

2021-05-10 15:30:44,stocks,"Nah, it's better to sell options in 99% of situations.  If you're  interested in owning the underlying shares and selling covered calls, the smart thing to do is sell the option and used the premium to buy the shares in a separate transaction. The exception would be if the option is illiquid to the point where exercising would be more profitable"
2021-05-10 15:41:04,stocks,"Selling options generates a minuscule amount of premium with a lot of downside potential. 

It could take weeks or months to save up enough cash from selling options to buy 100 shares of the underlying. 

If OP bought a call because he wants the company then he should just exercise the options and take the shares. That‚Äôs what options are for, they‚Äôre hedges and insurance policies. If he just wants the profit he should sell the calls and collect the 130% return."

Chip shortage? Naw, how could that be? You drive your car to their lot, they do a 124 point check on it, they put it on their lot, and sell it. So who needs chips if they are selling cars from Larry, Joe, and Moe? They get a 1k-2k profit per car. They have no overhead like the other used car dealers have. Just the lot and the car salesman. They aren‚Äôt even on commission. 

It‚Äôs at a current short of 49%. It used to be a name we can‚Äôt say.. but it‚Äôs moved on. It‚Äôs rated at a buy at 15 and 22. Only currently trading at $7.07 a share. It‚Äôs even got warrants if you want to go into that world and leverage your position.

That‚Äôs where my question comes in: Do online investors ever mislead other investors for personal gain? The incentives are there. If they do, what forms does it take and how common is it in forums such as this one?

**Edit**: I‚Äôm less curious about, say, Ponzi schemes, and more curious about the psychological phenomenon of good intentioned people deceiving others (and perhaps themselves?) in the hopes that their investments grow. For example, I‚Äôll often see social media personalities awkwardly break character to speak about an investment and it makes me question their intentions."
2021-05-10 03:09:05,stocks,Pump and dump is the most common because of how low effort it is.
2021-05-10 03:10:36,stocks,Yes.
2021-05-10 04:17:25,stocks,"Short answer: yes

Long answer: also yes"
2021-05-10 03:41:08,stocks,">Do online investors ever mislead other investors for personal **ego**?

Most people don't want to be wrong, that include with their stock pick decision. And they may intentionally (or maybe not) mislead other just to justify their decision."
2021-05-10 03:15:07,stocks,Obviously. Don't believe anything online unless you are able to research it for yourself.
2021-05-10 03:55:37,stocks,"Yes, people will attempt to pump a stock they have invested heavily in, in a attempt to raise the price so that they can take profit. It's been proven that stock tickers that were mentioned on WSB and other subs would see and increase in price in the following days because of people FOMOing in and media algorithms catching hold of it. At least, that was the case post GME but I'm not sure if it's still like that.

Tbh I'm not sure how common it is, but I'm a newer investor who became interested when WSB started making news and it seemed like there was a pump and dump every day on there and some penny stock subs. It took me a couple of weeks to figure it out and I lost a couple hundred bucks to a dumb scam (RTON lol)... luckily I only invested a small amount. 

My advice would be to spend time lurking in any new stocks/investing sub for a couple of weeks before making any decisions about anything based on what you read there. As a new investor you need some time to figure out your portfolio, and getting caught up in FOMO isn't really going to help you. 

There's no way to really know who's behind a screen. It's been alleged that companies pay people to set up fake online profiles just to try to sway user's opinions about certain stocks on Reddit and other platforms. If you see someone posting about a stock you're interested in and you're unsure, you can always check out their comments history on their profile. If someone seems to be copy and pasting the same kinds of messages across a lot of subreddits, it's probably a shill."
2021-05-10 04:44:57,stocks,Would someone lie to you face to face for financial gain? How is the internet any different? Of course people will.
2021-05-10 03:13:24,stocks,"Obviously. Even if they're not influential, they might join in or post a thread shitting on a particular stock when they are short on it, or sing praise when they're long and close to strike. Or some other, more convoluted reason.

2021-05-10 04:08:31,stocks,"Yes. 

Though the Dunning-Kruger investors are the bigger worry - the ones who think they know a lot about investing but in reality know very little. Usually they are genuinely passionate and certain in their investment choices, choices which subsequently implode and they learn a lesson the hard way.

2021-05-10 07:55:19,stocks,yes and no. Yes as there are numerous pump and dump schemes going on; no because investing/trading is a game of opinions (among other things) and you can't determine the validity of someone's opinion. Still that doesn't mean that their intention was to deceive others.
2021-05-10 10:18:45,stocks,"Ever? Yeah a good amount. You only need to look at those trendy investors selling you a course and you'll find scammers and people leading you on. In other cases people hype a stock, then execute a pump and dump and screw people over.

That being said, there's lots of genuine people who just want to see you succeed. Try to look out for the following red flags:

Are they trying to sell you something? Do they tell you nothing of substance unless you buy their course? They're likely going to just bring you into a cult-like group to hook you on unnecessary services.

Do they flaunt wealth as credibility? Are they showing off stacks of cash or cars or mansions to back up their claims? Chances are they're just trying to rope you in on a lifestyle they're not actually even living."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Inflation Coming? Hey guys. I'm so worried about this. Most countries around the globe, particularly the U.S. are going to reopen soon. People will then have to spend most of the money they got from stimulus check/social support they got from the government, which would drive up the demand for goods and services. This increase in demand would also increase the prices of goods.  I was wondering how do you guys prepare for inflation. Should I liquidate all my stocks at a loss and then buy assets that protect against inflation? Or should I just hold them for the long term like I was supposed to do?

&#x200B;

Also if the fed is going to increase the interest rates back to where it was before, it would hurt the prices of stocks. Are you also expecting another dip in the stock market as we are moving forward to the economy's reopening?"

What makes you think that stimulus money hasn‚Äôt already been spent?

I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, and I‚Äôm relatively new to investing, but to me the best ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to a huge dip/crash has always seemed to be have the liquid cash on hand to DCA out of your losses."

The market was crashing every time JPOW talked even though he swears they aren‚Äôt changing the interest rate and meaningful (like the 70s era) inflation isn‚Äôt going to hit. Bunch of scared ass investors out there.

The consumer price index is usually a good inflation measurement but they compare year over year and March is compared to when the economy was basically shut down a year ago. Prices raised 0.6%. People flip over half a percentage point! 

Also, lower than expected job gain numbers recently meant people are still struggling, which means the economy won‚Äôt burn as hot as people feared it might. Yay for wall street, shite for those who lost their jobs. 

Anyway, I think it‚Äôs all a bunch of baloney meant to scare people into selling so that institutions can buy discounted stocks."
2021-05-10 06:26:56,stocks,"TLDR: Just Keep Investing

What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)?
Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy in which an investor divides up the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset in an effort to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. The purchases occur regardless of the asset's price and at regular intervals. In effect, this strategy removes much of the detailed work of attempting to time the market in order to make purchases of equities at the best prices. Dollar-cost averaging is also known as the constant dollar plan.

Inflation has averaged about 8% per year.  There was never 1% or less inflation, even though it was reported as if there was.  Keep in mind that you may spend money differently than I do, so some non-necessities in my view (TVs, cell phones, etc) may have an impact.  But what differs this year is that even Warren Buffet is saying there's high inflation.

If you haven't been tracking what you buy, you'll be behind. Now is a good time to REALLY understand how you've spent money and what you'll be spending money on and get ahead of the curve. This is why you should be tracking your own inflation - it gives you insight into how you can prepare in these cases."

2021-05-10 01:43:49,stocks,Honestly and your situation financially may be different aka you didn‚Äôt NEED to spend the stimulus money. But most people have. Because most people actually needed it to survive. Al it of people who didn‚Äôt need it for immediate survival have used it for paying off debts/ mortgage etc and investing. But again I think most people have spent their money.
2021-05-10 05:19:27,stocks,"Wait, you actually believe the small stimulus people received in times where everything was more rough wasn't spent already months ago? And if people were good up at saving money, then they also wouldn't spend it once the economy re-opens. And it would be a minor part of what people spend."
2021-05-10 05:21:38,stocks,"Inflation is a plot by Blackrock to get cheaper GME.  
You cant come up with more idiocy than reddit, amazing."
2021-05-10 03:42:06,stocks,I am not spending fuck all tbh‚Ä¶
2021-05-10 10:22:06,stocks,"I‚Äôm not an economist, but I do believe I have a good fundamental understanding of macroeconomics, and I have the same concerns.

I don‚Äôt believe this monetary policy from the Fed is sustainable. Printing trillions of dollars, giving out $1400 checks to 85% of the country, keeping interest rates at 0% (basically since the global financial crisis, save a year or two where we were at ~2%), and else-wise pumping obscene amounts of money into the economy is bound to lead to rampant inflation at some point.

As for how to prepare, a good general principle is to buy stocks in companies that will be unaffected by inflation, or even benefit from it. For example, I own a stake in Foot Locker. Foot Locker‚Äôs basic business model is to buy shoes from manufacturers like Nike and sell them in retail stores at a premium. These manufacturers usually manufacture in China, where I am less concerned about inflation than within the US, meaning that the cost to manufacture these shoes likely won‚Äôt increase. Nike and other manufacturers can then keep wholesale prices consistent instead of raising them with inflation, and Foot Locker will be able to buy their inventory at the same prices as before. They will also be able to raise their retail prices in line with inflation because demand for essential products like shoes is liable to remain constant. Their cost of goods would remain the same, but their revenues would increase. In this scenario, they would actually benefit from inflation and grow their margins.

There is a possibility that NKE and other manufacturers would decide to raise prices in-line with inflation, which would prevent FL from growing their margins at all (in which case, it would be manufacturers like Nike that benefit). That being said, Foot Locker could still increase prices and would at least remain largely unaffected.

In other words, look for companies that sell essential products, where rising prices will not lead to a drop in demand, i.e., shoes, pharmaceuticals, food, etc.

Another strategy would be buying stocks in payment connections firms like Visa or MasterCard. As spending increases, leading to inflation, these companies will be largely unaffected as their basic business model is to charge fees for processing transactions. As spending increases and more transactions happen, there will be more fees for companies like Visa to earn (although I can‚Äôt say I recommend buying at these valuations).

I do not believe you should liquidate your stocks in favor of ‚Äúassets that protect against inflation‚Äù. If you‚Äôre buying stocks in the right companies, with high-quality business models that will be unaffected by macroeconomic situations, then your stocks WILL protect you from inflation. That‚Äôs really all there is to it."
2021-05-10 03:57:35,stocks,"Stocks are actually a hedge against inflation lol, they are backed by assests and their liability decreases due to inflation so why will you sell it? Unless you are holding growth stocks with high revenue projections which will be adversely affected by inflation you should hold your stocks."
2021-05-10 03:49:17,stocks,Most of your statements/predictions/rumors are just plain false.
2021-05-10 02:03:20,stocks,Got my Stimmy check yesterday...inflation is here so buy FCX
2021-05-10 09:22:10,stocks,"It has to come.  The question is when. By when, I mean when does the government start fighting it, not when the actual inflation starts.  Inflation already has increased massively as I'm seeing.   I have about 1/3 of my net worth right now in bonds, and I think I moved a little too early.  Of course, that's better than moving a little too late because by then it is too late."
2021-05-10 09:58:40,stocks,"LOL @ people are now going to spend their stimulus money,you obviously don't know how the human brain works."
2021-05-10 10:55:22,stocks,"It‚Äôs all just a massive overreaction as per usual. Inflation rates are going to rise, and so are interest rates from unsustainable low rates caused by the pandemic. That doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre turning into Zimbabwe and you need to move all of your assets to commodities. A lot of commodities have been oversold the past decade though and were due for a rebound anyways."
2021-05-10 13:10:10,stocks,"there's a rise in inflation because there's a pandemic happening that affects price level of all level.

 business cannot operate efficiently if the market conditions are unpredictable, that in itself drives price level up by cost factor."
2021-05-10 13:44:20,stocks,"Commodities can be a hedge against inflation in some ways. It really depends on what you are currently invested in if you're planning on liquidating. 

If you're invested in commodities those are doing quite well right now because demand is causing them to increase their prices. Steel, gold, lumber etc...

If you were invested in commodities ETFs last year you're probably quite happy right now.

Should you be liquidating your stocks? Well have you lost faith in the company you invested in? Do you feel like that company is going to fail? Then yes you should liquidate. 

Are you worried that your dollar value will be less for a few months? Harden up and ride it out."
2021-05-10 14:11:32,stocks,Shame what happened to the concept of supply/demand over the past couple centuries. It‚Äôs reported that when B Franklin proudly explained its concept to the Rothschild clan they rolled on floor laughing at how easy it would be to twist it to their will. All we need to do is look out the window to view how successful they were twisting it to their will.
2021-05-10 03:54:37,stocks,"Yeah, right. And comies are comming too."
2021-05-10 05:10:26,stocks,"Nah man. Just buy TIPS, and keep your assets. 

TIPS are Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. 

They‚Äôre not 100% foolproof, but they‚Äôre likely the closest you‚Äôll get to an inflation hedge. You can buy TIPS direct from the US Treasury (linked here: https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_tips_glance.htm) or buy a TIPS ETF from your broker."
2021-05-10 10:33:17,stocks,"People in general on these subreddits do not understand the difference between supply/demand effects and monetary effects when it comes to price changes.  There are a lot, and I mean *a lot* of people who take positions that boil down to ""Whenever a sale at WalMart ends, that's inflation"".

I'm not saying there's no risk of actual currency devaluation in this environment, but bear in mind that people use the same word to describe two completely different phenomena with completely different implications for your investment strategy."
2021-05-10 12:49:32,stocks,"First thing, inflation is **always** coming




Second, when these businesses increase prices of goods, that will help stocks. Hence why stocks are good investment against inflation."

2021-05-10 12:17:37,stocks,"When a person spends money, it doesn't just disappear. Stimulus check largely went into paying rent and investing in stocks. So that money went into some landlord's bank account, or are sitting in some retiree's brokerage. The question is, when are the landlords and other rich people going to have to spend their stimulus money on things poor people also buy, like food, energy, housing, and healthcare. Housing is already skyrocketing in certain areas."
2021-05-10 04:09:38,stocks,"I don't think the CPI can always be trusted if the government is incentivized to underreport inflation figures...

2021-05-10 16:02:43,stocks,"The disconnect between the stock market and the economy is a new distinction. Historically asset prices have been tied to economic conditions. Given current economic conditions (namely large piles of consumer cash) combined with extremely high asset values, we could easily see a trend the other direction over the next 6-9 months with asset prices dropping, and the strong economy preventing a recession."

2021-05-10 07:54:23,stocks,"I am sure some things are inflating, especially anything investment class, but what else? 

Food hasnt changed. I shop twice a week give or take. Ground beef, chicken, bread, and cheeses are the same. Greens change all the time due to season and conditions so its hard to say with them but they still remain cheap especially if you go to non-chain markets. We have tons of small markets here in SoCal and though some stuff did get more expensive, its not really impactful. 

For example, yellow onions are about 3lb/$1 right now where in the past it was regularly 5lb/$1 and as low as 10lb/$1. So yea, they have almost doubled in price but in terms of real impact, I only buy about 1lb a week.... so the effective difference is an extra 15 cents per week for onions... not exactly life changing and for all I know, it might be temporary.

What are you buying that is more expensive and where are you? I am in San Diego and aside from real estate (rent) and stocks, I am not seeing much inflation (yet)."

2021-05-10 04:33:15,stocks,"Minimum wage about to be $20 just due to market demands‚Ä¶ at least in the major metro areas.

Which makes sense‚Ä¶ I live in L.A. and staying at home and cashing checks from the government certainly works so long as you actually stay at home.

But if you try to have a life again‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll need to work. But, it can‚Äôt be $12 an hr. You‚Äôll end up with almost nothing. After commuting, insurances, taxes, eating more food, ticket, etc.

When you‚Äôve got just your nose above the water drowning‚Ä¶ the last thing you think of is: I should work hard and achieve more.

You basically hate everyone and everything. Which is why our minimum wage workers despise their customers whereas other generations or countries actually gave/give great service."
2021-05-10 08:08:06,stocks,"With all due respect, if jobs cant compete with welfare, then there is a problem with the jobs and their owners. Minimum wage should be substantially more than basic housing + food stamps but it isnt. In fact, minimum wage is so low that you still qualify for food stamps even if you are working near full time.

Walmart was sued for this recently. They kept wages low enough to insure their workers qualified for food stamps. How asinine is that? This is very sad and is nothing more than corporate welfare. What are we, Afghanistan?

The problem was never welfare. Its Reaganomics which has been the philosophy of our political elites for far too long. Its a middle class death sentence. There will be a tipping point and I hope the boomers and silent gen bear the brunt of it as they deserve. They should have learned from their parents. Instead they betrayed them and stole from their kids and grand kids... there is a reason why we call them the ""me"" generation."

I'm based in NZ and use Hatch Invest.

Right now I own a mish mash of stocks, ranging from Apple to Sony to Baba, to VACQ.

I'd like to set my portfolio on somewhat autopilot, with 10-20% for speculative plays (I want to keep my VACQ for eg). I'm bullish on certain plays, and I enjoy the personal picks aspect.

I'm only a few thousand into investing so far, and only put in a couple hundred a month, so now seems like the ideal time to rebalance before moving forward.

So I'm looking at one of the following options, and would love suggestions or reasoning on ratios and combinations:

Option 1:
40% VOO
20% VXF
20% VXUS
20% personal picks

Option 2:
60% VTI
20% VXUS
20% personal picks

Option 3:
80% VT
20% personal picks

I believe that they'll be able to leverage their existing provider network and superior customer/patient experience to beat out the telemed providers that various insurance companies have started. Their software is also more seamless than just zoom. Dealing with insurance SUCKS for patients and providers, dealing with tdoc support is good, and their reviews vs WalMarts MeMD supports this. Telemed is the future of healthcare, but the question is, which servicer will come out on top? 

10,000 boomers will retire daily for the next 20 years. There just are not enough healthcare providers to support that portion of the high healthcare nude population, nevermind that younger people are sicker/less healthy than ever before.

ii) masses amount of data that they can use in a flywheel effect to improve the quality, cost and creativity of service.

Both profitability and free cash flow, again, are trending in the opposite direction of its growth. 

Price to sales ratio? It‚Äôs around 11. If that screams sale to you, I can‚Äôt help you.

If you don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll continue diluting your shares in the future while they‚Äôre unprofitable, you‚Äôre mistaken. 

All of this for Teladoc, which you‚Äôre paying a premium today strictly for potential future returns only. Decent product I‚Äôm sure, but no moat and at this point much too expensive."

Shopify

Crowdstrike

Okta

Robolix

Palantir

Lol on EARNINGS but not revenue. By the way is this the same analysts who have an average consenus price rating target of $240 presenting a potential 70% upside? 

They did it to acquire Livongo - if they do it again to acuiqre another company - I'm all for it, providing it make sense.

**XOM Long Term Debt**

March 31, 2019- 40B

June 30, 2019- 45B

June 30, 2020 (Highest Point)- 69B

March 31, 2021 - 63B

? No?

[Chevron's Debt is up 50% from 2019 levels.](https://ycharts.com/companies/CVX/total_long_term_debt)

CVX 2019 Debt- \~32B

CVX 2021 Debt- 45B

You argue that XOM isn't a buy due to their large debt and their inability to cover their dividend. That's a disingenuous argument. 

When it comes to leverage, you look at the industry average- not whether they have a lot of debt. The oil and gas exploration business is capital intensive and **requires** companies to be highly leveraged to remain competitive. XOM still has far less debt compared to BP and Shell. 

Debt

XOM- 63.3B

CVX- 48.2B

BP- 75.2B

PTR- 83.6B

RDS.A- 102.4B

SNP- 54.9B

TOT- 73.3B

&#x200B;

Then you talk about the last quarter being the first quarter XOM has been cash-flow positive. There wasn't a single oil company that was cash flow positive during the COVID pandemic when oil demand plummeted. Arguing that they were struggling to remain cash flow positive is disingenuous because **COVID is a black swan event that made the entire industry cash flow negative.** 

&#x200B;

XOM may not be a buy due to other factors, but debt and being unable to have positive cash flow in 2020 is not one of the reasons. Out of the western superoils, XOM is the best performing company at $80 oil."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Earnings reports always cause a dip? Hey everyone, I‚Äôm fairly new to stocks - been trading since early Feb during the GME hype and have since blown up an account and brought it back from the dead as well as turning another $500 account into $1,000 trading options; so I‚Äôm somewhat versed but still a little green regarding earnings reports and the resultant price fluctuation - and I was wondering why it seems that a stock almost always takes a dip after grade A++ earnings. Recently it seems like a lot of companies are beating their expectation by major margins, yet the stock still proceeds to tank after earnings report. Is there any reason for this besides institutions and retail investors taking their gains and moving on to the next earnings report? Or is there a legitimate reason these stocks tank even after they prove their financial strengths?"
2021-05-09 22:54:28,stocks,"Buy the hype, sell the news.  Stocks tend to run up in advance of positive earnings, and folks then either rotate their positions or take profits on the announcement."
2021-05-09 21:59:38,stocks,It‚Äôs all about the future forecast. Most of the big earnings were out of the bag already and were already priced into the stock.
2021-05-10 00:51:52,stocks,"I think something that many people may not realize is that insiders (founders, CEOs, etc.) will schedule their stock sales to happen after an expected strong earnings report. For example Jeff Bezos dumped over 2 billion dollars worth of $AMZN after the Q1 earnings report. Amazon totally crushed expectations, and the stock would probably have held or gained if close to a million shares hadn't been liquidated over the course of several days. Insiders need to file the paperwork for these sales months in advance, and the best time to do it is to sell into an event that will result in buying strength."
2021-05-09 21:56:33,stocks,Not always. If analysts believe a company will outperform by 1 eps with an expected of 4 and the company has a bear of 4.5 the company is already trading at the 5 eps expectations so there will be a sell off.
2021-05-09 22:39:05,stocks,"Lately it seems. Day 2 dumps , no holds. Similar PA to 2001"
2021-05-09 22:15:59,stocks,"Expectations.  It‚Äôs all based on that.  Earnings is when the company pulls back the curtain and lets everyone see inside, provides guidance etc.  It‚Äôs not enough to beat the estimates, you have to beat the expectations for how much you will beat the estimates."
2021-05-09 23:48:57,stocks,"Depends on the stock. If it does poorly, it will drop. If it beats all estimates by not enough, it might drop. If it beats all estimates by A LOT, then it will go up when the markets open (can still go to red by the end of the day).

You got to also take into consideration if its priced in or not, in other words, if the stock is in a upward trend or downward trend. For example, FB has been in a downward trend 1-2 weeks before earnings after reaching $315. It went down to $305 and then after earnings it went up to $330 (opening hours).

So, a stock will go up if it beats estimates in a downward trend.

The opposite tends to occure when the stock is in a upward trend. Like Apple and Microsoft, they were already in a upward trend and after a great earning, people sell it for profit.

But Google was in upward trend and after beating estimates, it went up.

Because it doesnt follow a single rule. Earnings is very random and it depends on the stock.

Just dont buy weeklies options when gambling on earnings."
2021-05-10 00:11:44,stocks,"Companies give a projection for the next Quarter, and this means analysts / big investors are **already expecting** them to report certain earnings (estimated EPS). 

If a company doesn't outperform their projection from the previous quarter by a large margin than the share price will either drop, or remain relatively the same.

Now the real reason why a company drops **heavy** after earnings but their projection from the quarter before was correct? Then it's because the companies outlook for **next quarter is not good**. This is 9 times out of 10 the reason why a companies share price drops after earnings even if they ""beat earnings"" (beat their projection from last quarter).

Maybe you can give some examples of what companies your talking about? If it was RKT, it's because they are expecting a 20% decrease in loans next quarter. A mortgage company with a 20% decrease in loans next quarter? Damn, no wonder the share price plummeted."

2021-05-10 00:05:45,stocks,"Changes every earnings season for each company.  Depends on current market climate, where the hot money is going, and a bunch of other factors.

An example:  ETSY had amazing earnings that beat expectations but their forward guidance for the next quarters is lower because they expect to take a hit due to re-openings.  If they end up retaining a lot of customers that liked the service their next earnings report will probably cause them to go rocket up, even after the run-up leading into earnings.  So in the case of ETSY, tech was overbought but there is uncertainty due to market climate for lockdown winners.

This sort of analysis is required for each company, and even then it's basically a coinflip because short term is unpredictable.  A better move is to play surprise events on companies (and play it faster than other people) rather than these static dates which you have no deep insight about (unless you work for the company) and can be heavily manipulated by whales."
2021-05-10 03:32:43,stocks,"If there a big run up pre earnings and the earnings are a beat,  the stock drops as it already went up before the earnings and needs a blockbuster earnings to support the run up.  Look at MS and Goog for example.  Both had decent run ups before earnings.  MSFT has a beat and dropped.  Google had a blockbuster earnings and boom went the stock."
2021-05-10 05:14:20,stocks,"There are three parts to an earnings report: the top line, the bottom line, and the forward guidance. 

A company can beat expectations on the top and bottom lines 100 times out of 100, but if the provided guidance isn‚Äôt good, it can sour investor sentiment.

Ford is a great example of this. They beat on the top and bottom lines, but issued a note saying that because of the chip shortage, they would lose about 1.1M units of production. This note sent the stock tumbling 10%."

2021-05-10 01:02:16,stocks,"This makes sense. By saying that insiders need to file paperwork months in advance, do you mean that it is already a law that they must do that or is it just wishful thinking on your part? Is there any way to see these reports if that‚Äôs the case?

2021-05-10 00:53:31,stocks,"Ahh this makes sense. So if price is already factored in, the best way to play it would be either to have a call/put option in place or have bought in long ago and be prepared to sell immediately before or after earnings are announced."

2021-05-10 09:17:13,stocks,"Yes, that‚Äôs the term I was looking for. If earnings at certain expectations are priced in then the stock will move accordingly. Take MSFT for example.

I am genuinely expecting baba to announce monster earnings and the price will tank anyway.

I will probably hold the leaps though because despite all of China's fuckery, baba is too powerful to ignore and trading at a discount."

2021-05-09 22:51:16,stocks,"Same, this earnings quarter has been three outcomes

1. Company absolutely smashes earnings and the stock goes down or trades sideways

2. Company reports good earnings and stock goes down a lot

3. Company missing earnings and stock gets destroyed"

2021-05-09 21:37:11,stocks,"Everyone's going to get a harsh dose of reality when PLTR announces earnings. They're going to have millions of dollars of profit, which will pale in comparison to their billions of dollars worth of market cap. This is a tiny, tiny company that is priced like a huge company. Even at $20, it is grossly overpriced. $5? That might be a pretty good deal."
2021-05-10 00:00:15,stocks,What money would they make that we don‚Äôt know? Their entire income is huge publicly known contracts. Also at their market cap they‚Äôre priced in for about 30 years so there‚Äôs nothing they could possibly make it go up

2021-05-10 04:06:36,stocks,"They got pretty beat up since they came as a SPAC, I think they will do well, but check out how rocket stock performed after earnings. Maybe just wait until after. 

I do like the company though, they are going to do well and is a good long hold. I did short strangles on this one for a while and it was decent money as well. I wouldn't play that for earnings though."

2021-05-09 22:43:35,stocks,"It‚Äôs a terrible short term pick, yes. The valuation is bad. It should continue to trade sideways or down until that changes. 

Long term, it may very well be a great pick. 2-5 years from now, the value conversation and price could be very different."
2021-05-09 21:43:19,stocks,Why didn‚Äôt you tell us last month
2021-05-09 21:10:04,stocks,"They did but they also tampered down Q1 guidance which spooked some people.

Edit: even though they beat earnings they were (and likely still are) massively overvalued in my opinion. That said, I think I‚Äôm still rooting for what they stand for."
2021-05-09 23:50:22,stocks,"The releases of that type of a company, like PLUG, BLNK or NKLA are art pieces and they should be judged accordingly.

2021-05-10 08:18:48,stocks,Yeah I had seen RKT's price rocket down after earnings which is what makes me worried about hopping on pre-earnings. But agree it's a good long-term hold

2021-05-10 08:30:24,stocks,"Thats because the tech they use already existed in other forms throughout the military and corporate worlds. Corporate has far better tech already and military contracts are all about political pay and play and nepotism, not performance or quality. Feel free to ask any soldier about that.

I worked on several project for the military long ago under Raytheon and Lockheed. They all can do the same things Palantir does now. Absolutely no competitive edge between them on that front. Its all about who you know to land contracts.

Not saying this is a bad thing per se, just that people dont seem to understand that they are NOT a tech company so expecting exponential growth will not happen. Welcome to military contracting and the world of stock market half truths."

2021-05-09 21:17:31,stocks,"Hmm, I‚Äôm going with 50. The reasonable valuation/DCF models I‚Äôve seen peg this thing in the 40-80 range (large range because the growth is so hard to predict). 

No idea though, just fun to watch from the sidelines. Maybe I‚Äôm still a little salty because I naively thought I could get in at the IPO at 35 or whatever they wanted to price it at the time. I am rooting for them though and the rest of InsureTech; need to bring that golf playing down!"

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"I need some clarify on index and etfs so im trying to weigh my options. I was looking into buying 5 shares of sphd bc of it's low volatility but then I came across the expense ratio, which is .30% and after doing the math an expense ratio of $67 doesn't seem worth it to me. what do you think? I do plan on adding extra shares over time but .30% still seems kinda high. should I look into other index and etfs? Im looking for something wiht a low expense ratio and rather low volatility but I would consider doing volatility that is average too. I know 5 shares doesn't seem like a  lot a first bc I would buy more over time or is it not even worth it if I only buy 5 shares to start? I hear a lot of people invest a 1000 at first but I don't want to use all my stimi money"
2021-05-09 21:00:47,stocks,"Part of your question. 
An ETF is just a bundle of products. You can pretty much find an ETF on anything.
Ex. Renewables, clean energy. Tech. Commodities. Gold. Silver. Etc, etc.

An index ETF. Is an ETF as above but follows said index. 
So S&P500 Index- An S&P500 Index fund such as VOO will match and track the holdings of that index in particular.
Minus some error and of course fees.
Their are of course different indexes to complicate things. And some comparable funds hold similar indexes.....
But you get the idea.
A total market fund holds just that. The total index.
Such as VTI. 

Your ex. SPHD takes what they have set on criteria for high dividend of the s&p500.
The drawback of dividend funds when young is typically higher mer, less total growth and the yield honestly isn't always that amazing."
2021-05-09 22:06:55,stocks,"Regardless of the math, throw an expense ratio criteria on your fund search to narrow it down.  Schwab and Vanguard probably have something close enough to what you‚Äôre looking for under 10 bps"

2021-05-09 20:39:20,stocks,"oh thank you so much!! I wasn't moving the decimal enough!! so do you think It's worth if if im only buying shares to start or should I look else where? spdh is sitting at $45.99 so if I bought 5 shares for $225 the expese ratio would be 73 cents, for the year, right?"
2021-05-09 22:46:58,stocks,"It's a lot better than the above one. Lower MER, better companies and total returns. So I'd say it's the better dividend fund for sure. If that's the preferred route as an investor."
2021-05-09 20:47:21,stocks,Math is off again lol. 46 x 5 = $230. You'll pay $0.69 for the year

2021-05-09 22:33:09,stocks,"So far I'd say Ben Graham. His notes are brutally honest and put forth no illusions about the market, going to great lengths to say that most people will get hurt playing around in the market. He also goes to great lengths to point out just how silly the market can be, and explains how the shrewd can possibly capitalize off that."

2021-05-10 10:33:04,stocks,"1. Charlie Munger - listening to interviews with this man is an absolute joy. He is incredibly wise, has a great sense of humor, and I believe he has a better understanding of fundamental investment principles than anyone else alive (perhaps even including his partner, who will be next on this list).

2. Warren Buffett - the most successful investor to ever live. Warren is what happens when you combine exceptional skill with exceptional rationality. Enough said.

3. Peter Lynch - definitely my favorite author of investment books. He‚Äôs legitimately fun to read, and his approach to investing is so simple and easy to understand, as it relies on common sense more so than anything else.

4. Philip Fisher - I‚Äôve never personally read his book (it‚Äôs on my to-do list), but I have researched some of his overarching ideas, and I think any investor can benefit from doing so.

5. Benjamin Graham - some of Graham‚Äôs principles are a bit dated, to be sure, but I have to admire Graham as the ‚Äúfather of value investing‚Äù. He was the first person to truly propagate the concept that stock prices are largely determined by what the underlying business is intrinsically worth, and he mentored the aforementioned most successful investor ever, Warren Buffett. The world of investment would look extremely different without Graham."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"Enterprise Value vs Book Value How does EV represent the value of a company rather than the book value?

EV=Market Cap + Debts - Cash

EV does not even consider the assets bought by the company. So I'm not understanding why it's more of an accurate value of a company. When it only includes Market Cap and debts - Cash.

Book Value= Total Assets - Liabilities

So why is book value not the full presentation of a company's value? When it already includes all the total assets and all the total liabilities. What variable is the book value missing compared to the EV? The money acquired (market cap) from the stocks, is it not in the balance sheet as well?

&#x200B;

Newbie here. Thanks in advance!"
2021-05-09 22:27:23,stocks,"Hopefully the company is productive and the assets create more value in the future. Book value is useful if a company is insolvent because it gives you an estimate of how much can be recovered. In most instances, you want to know how much value will those assets be able to generate into the future. EV is an estimate of the future value creation."
2021-05-09 20:46:42,stocks,Are you taking your finance final?
2021-05-09 21:52:12,stocks,Yes trying to get the final number of a company.Just not sure why EV is used a lot in many ratio calculations. When part of EV is market cap. And market cap is based on people's perspectives (which could be right and wrong) and not the actual value of the company. Thats the reason why I asked. I guess the thing with market cap is we assume that people are fairly accurate with its valuation.
2021-05-10 02:49:36,stocks,"Because EV is what you PAY for the company, so you need to know if what you are paying is too high"
2021-05-10 00:37:07,stocks,"Yes you are right. But keep in mind that there is always so much more to think of. 

With the comparison of bv and ev your best indicator for analysis is the price-to-book ratio. If under 1 the company is undervalued. There are a Lot of actively managed Funds that are using this. 

The real question Here is, so you Trust the Market? Or so you want to do your own Research. Valuating with Market Cap is always the easy way. Valuating with DCF is the hard way because you need to valuate the future perspective of a company by yourself Based on current available Data. 

You are basically comparing the Market Opinion (ev)with your Opinion (DCF) and also the the current data (bv)."

Article for those who want a quick scroll. Companys that benefit from this are Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, Air Products and Chemicals, and Air Liquide.

The Dutch government has granted a consortium that includes oil majors Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ExxonMobil (XOM.N) around 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in subsidies for what is set to become one of the largest carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the world, the Port of Rotterdam said on Sunday.

Shell and Exxon requested the subsidies in January together with industrial gas suppliers Air Liquide and Air Products (APD.N) for a project which aims to capture CO2 emitted by factories and refineries in the Rotterdam port area and store it in empty Dutch gas fields in the North Sea. read more

The companies involved have been told that their applications will be granted, port spokesman Sjaak Poppe told Reuters, confirming an earlier report by Dutch public broadcaster NOS.

This clears the most important hurdle for the project, which is set to become operational in 2024 and is expected to reduce emissions in the industrial cluster surrounding Europe's largest sea port by around 10%.

Economy ministry spokesman Dion Huidekooper declined to comment on the reports on Sunday evening.

Details of the subsidies would be made public after decisions had been taken on all applications for this year, he said, which was expected to happen later this month.

The government has said it will grant a total of 5 billion euros in subsidies in 2021 for technologies that will help it achieve its climate goals.

It received applications for a total sum of 6.4 billion euros.

The CCS subsidies are meant to compensate the companies for the extra costs of capturing the greenhouse gasses instead of emitting them, while the port will provide the necessary infrastructure to transport the carbon dioxide to the empty offshore gas fields.

Home to many large industries and Europe's main seaport, the Netherlands is among the countries with the highest emissions of greenhouse gasses per capita in Europe.

It aims to lower emissions by 55% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. Emissions were down 24.5% from 1990 levels last year.


Now I'm not sure how big a benefit this will be, but I do know the likes of Air Products and Chemicals sell CO2. Excluding the subsidy, if they can capitalise on this, they may be able to use it as a steady source of revenue, but if this proves a successful method of reducing carbon, I feel like a lot of factories will jump to this over switching energy sources, as it would save them a lot of work. Interested to hear thoughts on this though"
2021-05-09 20:41:32,stocks,"Yes. Exactly what I am thinking. According to you, ‚ÄúThe answer is there is simply not as much money to be made selling clean energy than there is selling oil...‚Äù  

That is true for now. That‚Äôs why I like them as an investment. What‚Äôs the alternative?  You invest in some clean energy company that‚Äôs losing money short term?  With companies like Shell, you still make killer returns while oil rebounds and at the same time investing in a long play when they finally transition."
2021-05-10 17:24:38,stocks,"How about NetPower in the US? I think Occidental invested in them, how realistic is carbon capture really in the realm of electricity generation from nat gas?"
2021-05-10 03:34:53,stocks,"Huh, I don't see how you can be mad about this.

They were already paying for carbon emission rights. The only difference is now they continue paying for it but the difference in costs between just buying the emission rights and the storage is paid by the government.

I think it is a very good initiative and also a big step forward in making carbon storage cheaper for everyone.

It is very naive to say that Shell should simply pay for everything themselfs. In that case the Dutch (and every other person on the planet) will just buy their oil from some other company.

It is kind of the same where the government helps Tata Steel with its emissions, because if they don't they will simply move the factory/production to a different country and there will be no benefits to the environment."
2021-05-10 05:54:03,stocks,"It's so predictable. That's why they want nuclear energy too. Even though it's the most expensive of all alternatives except for natural gas. GE already was in charge of these power plants in the last century and groomed Reagan to let them be. It's all sooooo predictable.

Global warming is about who will pay for it. It's not the Shells and Exxons, it's the tax payer.."
2021-05-09 20:59:19,stocks,"That's not really the point I was trying to make. In fact, there wasn't really a point to make. I'm invested in APD, saw this news popped up. I know there are some people invested in Exxon, and it's a pretty big subsidy being offered, so I thought I'd post the article.

Long term, I think Exxon is going nowhere unless they can diversify. It is only a matter of time before clean energy is more cost efficient than oil, and I think that timeline has been accelerated over recent years."

2021-05-10 07:10:38,stocks,"I'm still not sold on clean energy.   I know governments are selling the voters on supporting it, and people are believing them and this project looks interesting.  The part that worries me is that there isn't a concensus on what a clean energy end state would look like and a integrated plan to get there.  For example I've been researching mining stocks and came across Resolution Copper mine in Arizona,  that's still on hold since 2009! Obviously copper is going to be an important material if you want to electrify everything,  so any realistic implementation of a clean energy plan would be pushing to get this project started.   It looks like they are just throwing money at random projects with zero coordination towards a real goal, combined with a lot of empty promises.   I guess we'll know in fifteen years but right for now I think XOM will continue to be very profitable."

2021-05-10 13:20:08,stocks,"As oxfam writes: the richest 10% cause 50% of the pollution, the poorest 50% cause 10% of the pollution. This is true between countries and inside countries. The  poorest will bear over three quarters of the cost.

If everyone would pay a fee for every unit of CO2 they produce and you divide that fee equally among the population, most people will get more than they put in, simply because the rich pollute so much."
2021-05-09 20:30:32,stocks,"The biggest red flag for me personally is their focus on hydrogen. Hydrogen will definitely have its place in the future, but it's not going to be in personal transport. Hydrogen requires twice as much energy from generation to deployment than electric motors, so unless there's a significant advantage there is no reason to have a hydrogen car over an electric car. The only advantage hydrogen cars have is total amount of range, which means it's only interesting for long-haul trucking/shipping/etc. For cars, it's never going to be economically viable. If you want to learn more about this, I recommend watching these two videos:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7MzFfuNOtY
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoXJYPfag1I

This brings me to my point. While hydrogen, like I mentioned at the start, may very well have a place in the world it is not going to be in personal transport. So why is Shell constantly running ads about their hydrogen stations at fuel stations if 99% of their fuel station customers are never going to use them? Not just not today, but not ever.

The answer is that it's just another form of greenwashing. The average person doesn't understand hydrogen is incredibly inefficient for cars. Even more so, almost every person I've talked to this about was convinced that hydrogen could definitely be one of the big technologies of the future, and all of them gave the reason that companies like Shell and Toyota are ""investing heavily"" into it. Realistically, neither of these companies are actually investing that much into it. If you compare it to the way VW is investing in EVs, it's peanuts.

It's just a PR campaign for these companies. After all, if they were really trying to go all in on a sustainable future, why aren't they building a ton of EV chargers at all of their fuel stations? They could set up a charging network that would make Tesla's superchargers look like nothing within a matter of a few years. This would actually help out their customers and allow them to make money in the long term, so why won't they do it? The answer is there's simply not as much money to be made selling clean energy than there is selling oil, and they're not gonna make that change until they really have to."
2021-05-09 21:41:28,stocks,"None of his points are rooted in fundamentals, if anything he's the one virtue signaling. The only thing I'm worried about in regards to Shell is their reserve life and rate of replacement, which is the lowest among all the supermajors by a substantial margin. Carbon capture should be a big boon to it, but XOM, CVX, BP and even OXY are better plays in that regard."
2021-05-10 06:01:03,stocks,"Shell couldn't find anything green to invest in. Very little money was made available and even less was invested. They have large intrusive and aggressive PR campaigns on Dutch television and the internet about what they do. For example they claim to make a car carbon neutral if customers would pay 1 cent more per liter. Complete lie and not in proportion, that's like saying you'll lose 200 pounds by not eating a tictac. Then they had this forest, but again if you do the math, the forest will capture 1 hour of exhaust after 40 years. Airing their commercials almost produced more CO2."
2021-05-10 07:39:02,stocks,"Near term, XOM isn't going anywhere sadly. The conversion of air and maritime transport to cleaner energy will be a long one, so there's still money to be made out of them, but as for how long they'll last, you raise some good points on why they could last longer than many anticipate."
2021-05-10 05:45:58,stocks,"I've read into the production of hydrogen while researching on APD, and from what I found, it seems like they sell on the biproducts from steam-methane reforming. One of the main uses of hydrogen is actually in the desulphurisation of fuels. Do I think we'll see hydrogen cars in the next few years? Probably not, but the price of fuel is about $46, as the video said the price of hydrogen fuel is about $80, while the price of electric is $10-12, but with electric, you're getting it cheap, but have to wait around for charging. The $80 hydrogen price tag for fueling which the video quotes is certainly a questionable one, since the production cost is about $0.7 - $3/kg, depending on whether the hydrogen is produced on or off site. I imagine that the insane pricing comes down to a lack of demand. Hydrogen will excel in longer distance transport though, even if it cannot compete with EV for shorter distance."
2021-05-10 06:29:50,stocks,Shell actually has a network of chargers for electric vehicles.
2021-05-10 09:58:35,stocks,"If Shell deploys them as fast as their LNG station we're in for an 100 year plan..

Yes i am a truckdriver driving Volvo LNG and yes i want the Tesla Semi badly. I've heard they are working on a solution to make faster charging happening back in january. My hopes is that the charge power is around 2.000 kw that would enable 30min charge speed. Which is do able for us we are driving non stop 24/7. If Friesland Campina can get rid of carbon thru that they will force all truckers to go electric by offering lower prices. That Volvo LNG has 500-600 miles and it's enough."
2021-05-10 06:04:21,stocks,"True, Hydrogen will definitely have its uses. It may also be interesting as a store of excess energy during peak generation hours as long as we don't have enough batteries or alternative energy storage systems to store all that energy.

Ultimately though, the fact remains that hydrogen is energy inefficient, so even if it were widely adopted, hydrogen cars would still be twice as expensive to operate as EVs, and then we're not even considering the much higher maintenance costs like with ICE cars.

As for the long haul transport I still see some competition from electric by the way. For example, the Tesla Semi is expected to have a 500-600 miles range, which means with the regulation for mandatory rest for drivers, it can actually drive for the full 11 hours that drivers are allowed to drive per day as long as they have access to charging when they rest. Obviously the infrastructure for that isn't there yet, but then the same can be said of hydrogen refuelling.

And then financially Tesla's Semis will have a huge advantage. Taking your prices, the Semi would cost roughly a quarter of the hydrogen's alternative to recharge. This is a huge cost saving for trucks that are driving 800 miles a day."
2021-05-10 07:09:04,stocks,"They've started building a few, but they currently have 50 charging locations in Europe vs 6,000 for Tesla, 0 in the US vs 25,000 for Tesla. Again, it's more of a marketing ploy to be able to run some greenwashing ads and have a page on their website than an actual commitment to sustainability. They have about 44,000 fuel stations worldwide. If Tesla can find places to build roughly that many in a decade, why can't Shell when they already have the locations?"
2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"The love/hate mating dance of Cathie Wood (ARK) with this subreddit, her take on this correction and her strategy going forward Preface: I'm **not** invested in any ARK funds myself. I do hold some of the stocks in her funds.

Loved by most of this subreddit in 2020. Hated by most in 2021. Yikes. In the past 3 months, correlating with the sharp drop in most of her funds (Most of them have dropped 30%+ since February), more and more people have started critizing ARK. ARK has seen outflows of more than $750 million in the last week. Now, everyone has a different take on whether her stock picks will do well or not, that's fine. I think we can all agree that 2020 has been an extraordinary year, with growth / tech / speculative stocks being the absolute winners of this mad year, mostly due to historically never before seen low interest rates, but also affected by a huge in-flow of new investors, support packages which are focused on certain sectors (Clean energy for example). More traditional sectors have underperformed last year, yet we've been seeing an institutional rotation away from speculative stocks into more value oriented names. 

However, let's not forget that pretty much all ARK funds are still up 300%+ up from the beginning of 2020. And while the sectors ARK is heavily invested in outperformed hard, they are most likely primed to underperform this year as institutions rotated away with interest rates picking back up and the global economy slowly opening again. Is this a problem though? No. 300% in a year is insanity. This is a healthy correction. And while it may hurt seeing your portfolio like this, this is a good moment to remember why you invested the way you did (and also a good moment for self-reflection). 

Whether the criticism she's getting lately is deserved, i'll leave that up for debate. Some of her picks are HIGHLY questionable in my opinion, yet i also see some as primed for explosive growth in the upcoming 5/10 years. She has also received a lot of criticism on here for selling her bigger blue chip stocks. Is this warranted? How does she view this correction?   


‚ÄúI love this setup,‚Äù she said Friday on CNBC‚Äô. ‚ÄúThe worst thing that could have happened to us is to have the market narrowly focus on just our ilk of stock ‚Äî the innovation space. From our point of view ‚Äî five-year time horizon ‚Äî nothing has changed except the price,‚Äù she said. Back in February, Wood expected a 15% compound annual rate of return from her strategies, but after the recent fall in prices, she envisions that number rising to between 25% and 30%.""

In other words, she welcomes this. Now, obviously she would not say this is a disaster, as she is the fund manager. But there is also truth to her statement. Now, why does she love this setup? She sees this as an amazing buying opportunity, now that prices have dropped. But where does she get the money from? Mainly her blue chips, which is heavily debated on this sub.

 ‚ÄúThe FAANGs certainly meet that criteria ‚Äî they‚Äôre acting like defensives,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDuring a period of volatility like we‚Äôve just seen, we will sell those stocks and move into either our more pure-play or earlier-stage innovation companies that are being hurt by risk-off.‚Äù  

I actually wrote a quite comprehensive piece on this (on this subreddit as well), diving deeper into her strategy, and how she exectutes this. To read more about this, click [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mtb0kc/analyzing_cathie_woods_ark_strategy_in_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

Let's not forget that most people (even fund managers) do not beat the market over a long term (and even less on a risk-adjusted basis). ARK funds have outperformed in 2020, and will most likely underperform in the short term. Whether it will underperform in the long term, who knows. Imo, she has some holdings that i do not see a future in, and her projections and valuations are... Rich to say the least. But let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy. It's also possible that this correction gives her the ability to make changes in her portfolio's for favorable prices, and thus makes higher returns possible. 

This is not financial advice. Do your own research.

2021-05-09 22:59:21,stocks,"I'm very wishy-washy on ARK funds.

The issue isn't ARK or the concept. The issue is this long bull market has produced too many new investors that aren't thinking about risk management or risk minimization in their portfolio.

They want the biggest gains possible, but aren't thinking about risks. Too many people have been trading and glorifying funds and stocks in a majority of their portfolio that likely should have been minimized to 5-10% with a variety of different risks less than ARK funds in the rest of the portfolio. 

People just need to be aware that trying to gauge companies that aren't the big thing yet, but will be in 5-10 years, is a risky game. Also, a potential high rewards game.

I'm not bullish on ARK, but I am on the concept as a small part of balanced portfolio."

I remember back in January if you dared say anything negative about Cathy you would be meet with a boat load of downvotes. I still hold the same opinion of her as do back in January. I never bought her ETF because ETFs are mostly used to minimize risk-reward while her ETF is maximized risk-reward. She barely has any blue chip companies in her ETF and if she does she usually sells them. A lot of the companies she has are ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù companies that will either make it or break it. Also her Tesla earnings prediction she released in March really turned me off of her fund because it was just so far out there and not really reasonable. She had their robo-taxi revenue being greater than the entire revenue Apple makes by selling all of their products which is so outlandish. So yeah needless to say I would never put money towards her ETF.

My issue with arrk is that the valuation theories are fkin mental and always have been."
2021-05-09 20:15:39,stocks,"My thing with Cathie is that some of the stuff she has said is batshit. Not Elon levels of crazy but still out there. Like God telling her to create the ARK ETFs, praying to figure out which stocks to pick, etc. Obviously some of it is taken out of context but her comments attract negative attention which is ignored when ARK is doing well. The second ""stonks always go up"" stops happening, it all comes out."
2021-05-09 20:44:53,stocks,The congressional hearings later this month will probably change a lot of minds on ARK funds.

2021-05-10 05:05:38,stocks,"I don't think that's the case at all. I think nothing changed about the perception about her, except that people who disliked her style of investing were afraid of looking dumb by speaking their mind when the fund was doing well. These people are now speaking up, but will still look dumb when market sentiment shifts again.

The people that were positive about here before are still positive now, but they're not posting because they know they're just going to get a shit ton of hate from short term minded people."
2021-05-10 02:45:29,stocks,"I started disliking her when the info came out that her strategy is ""jesus take the wheel"" and that's also the motivation for making the funds. I would prefer someone who relies on a scientific world view to lead investments into futuristic tech.

I don't own ARK and will not own it."

2021-05-10 05:16:20,stocks,Looks very bearish to me just like the Nasdaq and if that drops ARKK is going to get destroyed.
2021-05-10 09:24:12,stocks,"Everybody loves talking about how they want to ""take on more risk"" but then freak out as soon as they see a few months of red. When you go heavy in growth stocks with largely forward-looking valuations, this is the game you are playing. It is what it is."

Idk it feels like deja vu to me cause I swear I‚Äôve seen something extremely similar to this comment before."
2021-05-09 20:24:16,stocks,CNBC turned on her like a pack of rabid dogs in January.
2021-05-10 04:19:25,stocks,"Ah come on. From what I read, Cathie Woods goes by her gut and does not do the most in depth analysis like her worshippers think she does. No one in her team has stayed for more than 3 years and she hires people with no prior experience en masse.

And all of that shows in her valuations and reports. Ark makes the impression that getting the fully diluted outstanding shares number wrong by about 120 million is just a rounding error. They say Tesla is gonna be the most profitable insurance company in the world in 4 years - even though they aren‚Äòt in the business today and did not set aside capital to enter it. But we shouldn‚Äòt fuss over details. Their Bitcoin Paper in collab with Square makes no sense and contradicts itself numerous times. Ark and Square also obviously didn‚Äòt read each others work even though it was published as one."
2021-05-10 11:39:53,stocks,But did/does she do any sort of hedging or risk management? Kind of seems like her 'strategy' is to yolo into meme stocks like TLSA. Works great when it works.
2021-05-10 07:16:01,stocks,">I remember back in January if you dared say anything negative about Cathy you would be meet with a boat load of downvotes. 

And why do you think most people were praising Cathy?  

The people who were actually blinded by the light are very stern in their beliefs, and it would be pointless/a waste of time to try and argue with them.  

Edit: She honestly reminds me most of Karen the supertrader."
2021-05-09 21:16:55,stocks,"Uhhhh....that‚Äôs exactly what Ark does.  They do research and come up with 5 year price targets for all their holdings.  Usually people just laugh at their price targets and pretend they don‚Äôt exist because they don‚Äôt post 12 month P/T‚Äôs and their 5 year targets seem absurdly high.

If you believe their 5 year price targets then ARKK is extremely undervalued.  If you ignore them then it‚Äôs not.  What‚Äôs so hard to understand about it?"
2021-05-10 04:58:35,stocks,"Examples of questionable stocks imo. I honestly believe these are very bad buys. 

SKLZ, ZM, SPCE. 

Some examples of stocks i believe have the potential to grow quite a bit still;

TDOC, PYPL, PSNL, SQ, PINS, ADYEN, JD.

Then there are also some plays which imo are just too far away to recognize the winners, but they are interesting speculative plays such as Joby, Lilium, Velo3d, FATE, PSNL, TWST, and more."
2021-05-10 03:56:26,stocks,Why? What's happening?
2021-05-10 04:59:46,stocks,ARKX is still around where I bought in lol
2021-05-10 12:45:34,stocks,In and out around 122 after seeing it fall and then creep back up.  not my time...
2021-05-10 04:01:01,stocks,"I've been a hater all along and I'm just rubbing my hands in glee.

But on a more serious note. Mneh. Star fund managers come and go. I invest in my ""play money"" in what I understand and for diversification with the other 90% of my funds I just index. I felt justified in my decision to pass on this fad when she went on some christian radio(? tv?) show and said god told her to start this fund. Either a) it's a marketting ploy targetted at christians(99% sure this is the case. And to me that is grift) b) she's insane or c) everything the bible said about god is wrong and she's the true prophet of the one true capitalist christian god."
2021-05-10 12:13:30,stocks,Absolutely genius.

2021-05-10 16:23:40,stocks,Mhm haha
2021-05-10 10:40:49,stocks,"Short term minded people?

History has shown that, in the long run, actively managed mutual funds generally have not beat ETFs. The short-minded people are the ones who look at a very good 3 years for the ARK funds in a period where speculative tech did very well, and somehow extrapolate that to mean that ARK funds will continue to beat the market.

2021-05-10 09:09:51,stocks,"Lol, a capitlaist Christian hedgefund is the dumbest, most dangerous thing i think I've ever heard of.

It's bad Christianity, it's bad economics. It's just bad all around."
2021-05-10 10:48:44,stocks,If you buy Tesla over 600$ and GME over 100$ you better believe in fucking miracles.
2021-05-10 10:47:39,stocks,That turned me off to ARK funds as well. Putting your investment choices into the hands of a non-existent spirit doesn't sit well and appears to be divorced from reality.
2021-05-10 04:06:47,stocks,"I mean, that was probably just marketing talk, unless she's either insane or a prophet of the one true capitalist god. So rather than depending on attracting customers through smarts, she's happy to rely on grift"
2021-05-10 12:05:09,stocks,Mhm. Short term stuff.
2021-05-10 05:08:39,stocks,"Why the hell would ARK reposition to avoid short term downside when they could just double-down on their high conviction stocks for even more long term upside. They're trying to earn money, not to look good paper.

This is exactly the short term thinking that makes hedge funds underperform funds like ARK."

2021-05-10 01:21:36,stocks,I asked someone in the Ark invest sub about her Tesla targets and he basically said it‚Äôs supposed to be stock split adjusted. Tesla split stock 5-1 a few years ago and if you x5 Tesla stock price she‚Äôs not as far off with those claims. But I think they‚Äôre full of shit that she was talking about split adjusted.

ARKK is down more than 30% since early February, is this good risk management when the poster above is saying she ‚Äúcalled‚Äù the downturn? If she expected a downturn in momentum stocks, why not go bigger into her ‚Äúcash like‚Äù positions eg blue chip tech stocks?

2021-05-10 12:25:14,stocks,"Performance between it and ARKK did not separate until mid-March, so I wouldn't say it shrugged it off."
2021-05-10 04:11:55,stocks,I have and $1500 alone is moronic.
2021-05-10 11:59:34,stocks,"Arkk won't recover ever, unless we have a batshit bull run again with Tesla going to 1.5k and SPY booming to 500"
2021-05-10 12:08:58,stocks,"She can't sell, she owns like plurality of the shares of those companies excluding the big asset managers (vanguard blackrock etc) for like a quarter of her companies, the price would free fall"
2021-05-10 07:11:30,stocks,"> Is ARK investing long term when they buy FSLY last Tuesday and sell on Friday?

Yes, actively managing and rebalancing a portfolio is completely different than trying to time the market by selling to buy back in lower. ARK does the opposite by selling when things are high and have become a larger position in their portfolio and buying back in if things drop. That's what long term investors do."
2021-05-10 16:51:55,stocks,Arkk peaked on February 10th. Mid March it was 20% down
2021-05-10 03:59:00,stocks,"You simply got roasted. Just take this huge L and stop talking for the sake of our community, thanks"

2021-05-10 12:35:27,stocks,Yeah that's a fair point. She does own a fair share of relatively illiquid stocks.
2021-05-10 07:18:55,stocks,"First off, FSLY wasn‚Äôt rebalancing, she sold almost the whole position. 

Secondly, I never said that they should have sold their whole positions, but rather rebalanced as you put it. If they expected a downturn in growth, then weight more towards their cash like positions."

2021-05-10 07:20:43,stocks,"> First off, FSLY wasn‚Äôt rebalancing, she sold almost the whole position.

So then the first time she bought was probably rebalancing and the sell off was when they decided they wanted to exit the position. It's very unlikely they bought with the intend of selling days later.

> Secondly, I never said that they should have sold their whole positions, but rather rebalanced as you put it. If they expected a downturn in growth, then weight more towards their cash like positions.

Again, that's not how long term investing works. Rebalancing has nothing to do with trying to time the market like that."

2021-05-10 01:18:47,stocks,"Just not an attractive return and it‚Äôs a real conservative pick. It‚Äôs more for preservation of value than any kind of growth even with inflation. With how the stock market has outpaced inflation (by a large margin), placing your bets on limited upside TIPS in a college fund where you have years to grow it doesn‚Äôt make much sense. 

Not financial advice but seriously look at the historical returns even with rising inflation fears."
2021-05-09 21:10:52,stocks,I am trying to do my best with what I have. It is a 529 plan. Not too many options.

Ownership of a stock is the key principle, you can neither gain or lose on something you don‚Äôt own.

However if you're buying a random stock based on emotions or a random reddit post said so, then you lost the second you bought it because you have no reason to hold on beyond ""it looked cool.""

The idea of ""you don't lose until you sell"" is to help emotional investors stay invested. During recessions and market crashes, the people who do the worst are the ones who are emotional and sold at a bad time."

Many employees lost their jobs and being desperate sold the stock for pennies.
My friend got another job and held because selling it for squat was pointless.

The tattered remains of the company was bought cheap.  The resulting company did ok.  That company got sold.

If you have a long term hold plan from the start and it rocketed then drop with no real news or plan changes then yeah keep holding. If it rockets up and you buy near ath then yeah you just lost and it may be a long time before you make the gains back holding and is usually better to put what you have left elsewhere.

If you know the intrinaic value of your investments you wont sell at a lower price becuase you are getting lowballed basically. You are not hurting when you portfolio is down. When covid crash happened that was an opportunity to buy nit be bummed out that your portfolio took a dip."

2021-05-10 00:06:27,stocks,I feel personally attacked
2021-05-10 00:17:24,stocks,Say that to the useless stock in my portfolio from the company that went under. (This was my punishment for not trading or checking my portfolio for over a year.)
2021-05-10 00:24:02,stocks,"Definitely see what you are saying.  For me, this is more dependent on what I invested in.  Did I aim for a quick buck or is the buy into a company with continued promise?  If the latter, and in a continuously ""in demand"" industry, the longer hold tends to be more successful.  On the flip side, a lot of subs also say that you should consider anything you put into the market as money you've already lost.  Would you say that is more accurate?"
2021-05-10 00:28:37,stocks,"So, this was my initial logic. It's not even *not* my logic anymore, it's just that I consider it more strategically. Technically, it's correct. And, if you're willing to wait long enough, you likely will see that money again if you leave it alone. Problem is, that money could likely have been pulled sooner, with less of a loss, and put to work elsewhere to earn that money back a lot quicker. So, if you're a long term investor, this might be sound advice. For traders, it may or may not be. 

The example isn't accurate either. It's like saying ""the dog is on a farm"" when it's actually buried there. The phrase is technically accurate, it just leaves out other important details."
2021-05-10 00:29:30,stocks,"Try to tell this bull shit to the IRS.

You don't have a loss until you sell.  Just like you don't have a gain until you sell.

They are unrealized losses/gains until sold."
2021-05-10 00:48:44,stocks,But... but it‚Äôs true
2021-05-10 01:07:05,stocks,"Yeah, no.

Unrealized loss is not realized loss, no matter how much you want to try to talk around the point.

Your ""net worth"" fluctuates, but as we all know, net worth isn't the same thing as worth.  Nothing is _anything_ until it's liquidated or converted.

Your portfolio is _unrealized capital_.

Even by your own statement 

> Your portfolio is worth what you can get for it

That value doesn't manifest until you actually liquidate a stock.  If a stock is valued at 1 and you can't sell it at 1, then your portfolio isn't even worth what it says on the tin.

Until you have some kind of confirmation that the stock itself can never recover, you've not lost until you've sold.

Same goes for houses, if your house is valued at 150k and you can only get offers for it at 120k, doesn't matter what the claim of value is, you have a 150k asset until you actually sell it.  The loss is only manifest at the time that you have to account for it."
2021-05-10 01:50:29,stocks,"A stock, a house, a bag of potatoes have a market price and an intrinsic worth to themselves. Here, what I want to explain is that while on one hand we infarct lose when market price goes down if that is what ultimately concerns us, that is a bad premise to be investing by. When I buy a bag of potatos I don't buy it at whatever price. If I find it too expensive I may skip it and consider trying another place to shop. And once I have it, I mostly want them around to eat as I please. A house works similarly. I buy the house I like at a price I find reasonable and I will only concern myself with a price again if I really want to sell.
Why would we be buying stocks and be worried about their price on a daily basis after purchase? Why would we not consider their price carefully before we buy them?
When buying stocks we in fact are buying a business. And we do that to make money, sure, but we should be aware that not all businesses are going to start  profiting out luck on a short period and that a market price is not always on pair with the intrinsic value that we should consider to be the fair price (a metric each should consider for himself and understand deeply when investing). I notice stock A dropped in value a bit due to a piece of news regarding a downturn in potato sales, and I think the market is going bonkers and panic selling so I see an opportunity and buy below the fair value (an amount you judge using the public metrics for the sector/company) and on the next few days the market is still in panic. Should I care for the price and think I'm making a loss? Imagine selling your house because 5 neighbours got on your front yard and told you the house was not as nice as you think. That is what it sounds like to me when people panic sell a stock.
With this said, do your due diligence before you buy. Understand what would make you sell a stock if you bought it and consider where you think this stock might go with all the information you gather. Is a stock being sold under the total sum of it's tangible assets minus their debt? If yes, there is an undeniable bargain, and the market has been known to take companies below such valuations on a whim."
2021-05-10 16:03:53,stocks,"You‚Äôre misunderstanding the saying. The loss isn‚Äôt realized until you sell. If you hold it and it goes back up, you haven‚Äôt lost ground on that stock. If you sell it at a loss, that‚Äôs it.

You know why they call them UNrealized gains/losses? Its because they are unrealized. If you dont REALIZE your losses, then you havent lost. If you dont REALIZE your gains, then you havent really gained. 

This isnt a myth, its why they are labeled UNrealized.

edit: If you buy at $10 watch it go to $2 and didnt sell, you didnt lose. If you buy at $10 watch it go to $20 and didnt sell, you didnt win. 

When you buy at $10 and it goes to $2 then to $20 then to $5 then back to $10 you didnt gain or lose. 

Your portfolio is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it and you choose when to decide to find someone to sell it too. It is not a myth, you have to realize your gains and your losses."

If your asset goes down and you sell it you lost some money and if you hold it when its down or up, you dont win or lose there. The price can go back up and therefore you didnt lose a thing and then make money when you sell it then. No one can predict the market, but if you sell lower than what you bought, you didnt make money and therefore actually lost out.

2021-05-09 22:36:30,stocks,"The reality is you‚Äôre winning and losing all the time. You should only keep your position, whether it‚Äôs down or up overall, if and only if you‚Äôd acquire your position again if the money your position is worth was in your bank account instead. For example, if you own $40k of tesla stock, whether it‚Äôs up 50% or down 50% overall, if that $40k was in your bank account instead of in tesla stock, would you use that money to acquire the shares you have now?

To the people who don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve lost when your stock goes down, but only when you sell:

* If I bought $100k worth of beanie babies back in the 90s and I have those beanie babies to this day, have I not lost my $100k?

* If my friend and I both buy $1000 worth of stock and that stock is now worth $800 and I sell but then decide to buy back in right away, why is my loss realized buy my friend‚Äôs isn‚Äôt even though our portfolios (including cash in our bank accounts) is identical?"
2021-05-09 22:36:53,stocks,"I used to work for a guy who loved casinos.  his view was that if you still had any money in your pocket, you hadn't lost- because you could still win it all back.  With stocks, you need to decide if that's true or just a crack pipe dream.  

I've bought stocks that I fully expected to go up, but have not yet done so.  Looking at them, if I still feel that they are either undervalued or are still waiting on events, I'm happy to hold.  If I feel buying them was a mistake, then yeah, it was a loss.  But until I've got something really good to put it in, I'll leave it be, waiting for fluctuations to go my way.  

UWMC is a good example- r/uwmc is full of people panicking and saying they're going to sell, and it's a big red mark on my screen, down 1.15 from when I got in.  Is that a loss?  I thought it was undervalued at a little over $8, I think it's a lot undervalued below $7.  I'm buying more and I'll wait.  If I sold now, I'd lose, but I believe it's even more undervalued than it was.

I'm down right now, but I haven't lost."

Most new investors do not have patience to hold a stock through dips so when the stock dips they immediately wanna sell which is kind of weird cause you could wait for it to go back up eventually. This all applies if you made the investment in the right company. If the fundamentals of the company suck then no amount of waiting will change anything however to see if the company has changed fundamentals or is failing takes patience and time. You have to give the company a chance to bounce back.

So you are right in the sense that when the price goes down, you have loss, at the moment at least. But you can end up in the gain if you hold. When you sell on a loss, your loss is finalized and that can't be changed. This is kinda what it means. Maybe it could be worded better."

Firstly, unless you're an options trader and it's expiration day, your portfolio is *not* worth merely what you can get for it *today*, and that's the *whole point* of investing.

Moreover: ""You don't lose until you sell"" doesn't mean ""I don't understand how numbers work"" or (more weirdly) ""stocks owe you money."" Nor is it a 'dog got sent to live on a farm' comforting lie. It means ""while there certainly comes a point where you should consider cutting your losses, particularly if the fundamentals have changed, short-term market fluctuations are a constant reality and you won't last long if you let them scare you into panic-selling.""

On the contrary. I've seen this sentiment in countless P&D and meme stocks, and I'm so sick and tired of correcting this idiotic advice.

""You don't lose until you sell!!""

So you're telling me there's no fundamental difference in the wealth between Person 1 who bought 10 shares of company A for a total of $100 ($10 P/S) and Person 2 who bought 10 shares of company A for a total of $10 (it dips to $1 P/S)? Is Person 2 worth $100? Is Person 1 worth $100?

The first investor has absolutely lost money, by paying more than the current market price of a security.

People use this stupid piece of advice to justify holding bags.

When <weed stock> was still coming down from its huge pump, people were bagholding instead of exiting @ $1.30 because ""you don't lose until you sell!"" It's at what, 0.7 now?

Not only are you banking on a huge recovery just to break-even, you are missing out gains in other worthwhile stocks in the meantime. Also, if the sentiment is looking poor, but you're too afraid to realize a loss of 5% in a meme/penny/growth/risky stock after you FOMO'd in, then every day you are holding the stock, you are making a decision to buy at that price. It's better to put your head on straight, realise you chased a pump, cut your losses early, and enter into the stock later for a much cheaper price, so that you can own effectively the same or more shares at a much cheaper cost."

He would tell me I need to sell because I missed target.  Of course I didn't and yes I was down $1000 the next week so I sold then.  The point is, if I sold when he said, I would have only lost 500 vice 1000.  I would have minimized loss.  So I think your misunderstanding ""you only win or loose when you sell"". No,  it doesn't  mean hold your loosing hand till you have nothing <or> hold your loosing hand cuz you might win someday.

The other thing that helped me with the selloff was having an emergency fund in place plus 6 months expenses in case I lost my job. That put me in the frame of mind where I could feel comfortable throwing money down what appeared to be a bottomless pit of losses.

The only way you'd make more money is if you perfectly timed the tops and dips.

If investing and trading is something that you genuinely enjoy and would do as a hobby then be all means go ahead, but I think that most people are best off sticking to a Boglehead style method. There's less that can go wrong, less mental burden/stress, and tons more free time."

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"What's you people's opinion on a bull run for oil tanker stocks? I've been talking to a dude that works in the shipping industry since shipping stocks have gone up quite a lot and the logistics of goods have become incredibly expensive via this route.

He told me that the classic logistics stocks have run pretty hot and I should take a look at oil tankers.

Since oil and energy seem to be (at the same time) a pretty decent play as well with inflation coming and tech slowing down I could really see this working out.

Most of the oil tankers haven't run up crazily and I even read a McKinsey report stating that the demand for oil is gonna keep increasing.
Pretty little information and just basic stuff I'm spouting out here but I'd still love you guys take on this.

An interesting ticker I found is $DHT.
Profitable, low market cap and seems to be in a juicy uptrend.

2021-05-10 06:56:47,stocks,"Interesting.   I read something about shipping companies a long time ago about how it was a very cyclical business but on long cycles because of the length of time it takes to build a ship.  Something like there are too many ships and the can barely make a profit,  so no one builds any,  eventually as ships are old and retired,  they become profitable,  but still don't build much so profits keep going up as more ships are too old and get retired. Every one now has enough money to order new ships but in the time it takes to build them,  every one of them just prints money.   When all the new ships start being delivered the rates fall and the cycle starts again.   I  believe it was a long (decade? ) cycle. 

Any idea if this is right and where in the cycle this is (if that's the correct way to think about these)?"
2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"HeWhoSleepsNot random ass weekly report for the markets 5/9/2021 edition Hello Everybody! [Echo- Hello Doctor Nick!]

It‚Äôs me, HewhoSleepsNot, here with another fantastic product for you and I have a question for you all at the end of the post from The infamous TeB!

So, disclaimer, this is not financial advice, we are not financial advisors, and we are certainly not YOUR financial advisors. This is a labor of love and a thought experiment. I am hoping that you all will push me further in my analysis so that I become better over time!  These are just our personal thoughts and views based upon news shared out in the world. 

This information is not groundbreaking but more us gathering from various sources some interesting stories, news, and tickers to share with the community! I will note where I found the material from when I can remember or when my notes include it but some are just from memory and came from places like Twitter, emails, reddit, etc.

Now lets get into it, shall we?

From the recent articles of Fortune we have some socially conscious companies and companies that are good to work for. A couple of ETF‚Äôs mentioned and then one stock I pulled from this set:

ETFs:
   ICLN- etf focusing on clean energy, should be seeing benefits from he shift towards environmental focus for at least 2 years of full dem control and 4 years of Biden. I own a couple shares and so does my spouse. 
   TAN- solar ETF, same rationale as above
   PBW- clean energy ETF, same rational as above.

   Then we have $RKT [Rocket Companies, including Rocket Mortgage] Innovation in an old field. Taking care of employees exceptionally well which should pay dividends in loyalty and retention which I think is extremely valuable in the tech field. During the pandemic they gave extra free time off and made it mandatory because had noticed no one was taking PTO to stay at home and twiddle their thumbs. This should help morale and employee satisfaction and avoidance of burnout.
   All 24,000 employees had shares during to/prior to the IPO so they should as a majority be invested in the companies market performance personally.
   Yahoo 1 year price target consensus of 24.75 and it was ~22.65 so only a small upside at current prices.
   I may sell a cash covered put or 3 over the next few weeks to see if can make some premiums and then possibly get a block of stock with strike of 20 or below. Not sure yet. I just had some cash secured puts I sold expire OTM so will be deploying that capital this week and will include my moves in my next report. I am long a handful of shares here. 


From Swaggy stock reads:

   DKNG! I am long DraftKings and currently very excited to be a hodler. THe analysis in swaggy stated that they are a market leader with 20-40% market share varying by state [or sport- I forget and deleted the email so /shrug, I‚Äôm good like that]. Main competitor is FanDuel who has yet to IPO followed by Barstool and BetMGM. Online sports betting legalization is moving forward to help govt generate tax revenues.
   And my sports ball boy TeB likes it for the Daily Fantasy Sports and knows people who have made line ups for over 180 days straight! That is some dedication [or addiction- and we know addiction is great for reoccurring revenue even if it may not align with personal morals]

From some MarketBeat emails/website articles we have some interesting news for insider trades:

CSX director sold 1.4 million shares at an average of 100.93 worth ~142 million and now only owns 12,399 shares worth ~1.2 million. This could be a bad sign of the prospects of the company if directory bailed out of nearly ALL of his shares. Would check other insider trades for this company before taking this to the bank though for sure.

FDX CEO and MMM VP both sold small blocks of share but hold much bigger blocks so probably just wanted to put some money down on a new Ski Chalet or super car! (I own both tickers)

From market sentiment we have some facts:

RKT fell 16% Thursday following 1Q revenues rising 236% and net income up 170% but the guidance of loan volume was disappointing along with worries of rising interest rates and inflations. May be good entry point if you‚Äôre bullish long term. Or may want to do what I do and make some cash flow selling cash secured puts waiting to be assigned blocks of stocks in companies you are ultimately fine holding for year+ and either sitting on or selling covered calls on to keep the cash flow coming.(I own some shares and thinking of selling short term cash secured puts depending on the premium)

Etsy was down 13% at some point despite good 1Q results because guidance for 2Q was disappointing. (Own a handful)

Corsair 6% down despite exceptional growth. 


And finally, from pits most foul, the depths of my memory:

GDRX- discount pharmacy deals, makes decent money there and also making inroads into telemedicine to compete with likes of TDOC, was ~38 a share and Yahoo had a 1 yr target consensus of ~53. Should be fine as long as Pharma system not overhauled, which is certainly a concern right now.(have about a grand in here so one of my small mid positions)

AAPL- quietly making acquisitions. Instead of large blockbuster billion dollar buys of competitors like we see FB doing, or of new areas to expand in like we see AMZN do, AAPL has largely been buying smaller companies with the main goal seeming to be talent acquisition which is critical in the tech field. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all seen the graphic comparing AirPods revenue to entire companies and man is that intoxicating. The amount of product apple sells is INSANE, but that‚Äôs why their market cap is also INSANE! I do think they have a fair chance of being the one to make one of the next big technological break throughs given their focus on talent acquisition [think AI, AR, VR]. Currently have 5-7 shares and selling cash secured put for 125 after having a stock secured call getting exercised for 127. 

I am bullish on public storage companies and storage REITs as we have huge housing demand yet not enough supply, so people maybe selling houses to capture the insane mark up but not have a place to go yet or place of same size, so that‚Äôs some storage business. Then we have the disparity between main and Wall Street and historically public storage does well during down turns and evictions where people are unfortunately removed from their homes and have to find someplace to store their belongings. I am long PSA and SAFE, maybe some others but I have over 200 separate tickers and didn‚Äôt spend more than a minute quickly scanning trying to find all of my tickers in this space.

SCI- have about a grand here. Cemetery‚Äôs and death shit. People always be dying. Just had big quarter so not sure best time to buy in. Yahoo 1 yr price consensus is 56.88 and currently ~56.71, 1.57% dividend, 19.69 P/E ratio]

AMZN I think is safe bet to keep growing and growing and growing and....growing until government intervention. One of my beta readers questioned why Bezos has been dumping a lot of his stock. My response: Cash burn at Blue Origin [private space company] has to be huge right now, so until the flights become regular and he is actually making money on space tourism this should be the reason behind much of the sales. Then again he also has access to private companies/venture caps so he‚Äôs investing money in companies that he thinks will be the next big thing that none of us have access too. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/05/amazon-ceo-bezos-sells-nearly-2-billion-worth-of-amazon-shares.html (I am
Long Amazon)

NFLX has incredible amount of IP and reach on hand.( I am long)

DG- another recession play. Yahoo 1 yr target consensus is 233.12, 0.78% dividend, currently ~216. (I am long)

Defensive stocks like grocery stores, essential suppliers, utility companies, etc with dividends may be safe recession plays if think the future is not as Rosey as it looks when you‚Äôre 4 corona seltzers deep and just boofed some MDMA after smoking one of them blunts dipped in resin covered in keef or wtf ever the young bloods are doing these days.

CLX- i have some of this. Clorox. I think people will have germs on the mind for a while. I don‚Äôt know about you all but my hand washing has gone up at least 2500% since last March, wish my gains matched! Think this focus on cleaning will last at least a couple years post pandemic. Yahoo 1 yr consensus is 191.92 and dividend of 2.46%.

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"How to value stocks as a non-professional? Hey, I have been investing in the stock market now for a couple of years. Started out as a very passive index ETF investor, but during the last year have transitioned my portfolio to be more stock heavy.  Due to this I have started to do my own research into individual companies. I find it somewhat easy with my value investing goals to identify good companies. The part I find extremely difficult (and I understand that I am not alone and that this is a multi-trillion dollar question) is to identify what is the ""fair"" value of a company?

I have tried to create my own DCF models and understand all the variables that go in to evaluating a company, but I have very quickly realized that I am way way out of my depth.

I am also a firm believer that you can overpay for a wonderful company.  Case in point: If you would have bought MSFT at the height of the dotcom bubble, it would have taken you over 15 years to get back on green!! 

So my question is to the non-pro veterans of the stock market (or to anyone who has had success in getting a good value for their picks), how should an investor know when to buy when they think they have found a wonderful company?

English is not my first language so sorry for any spelling errors or otherwise weird sentences!"

2021-05-10 00:00:00,stocks,"BIGC earnings on May 11, could see a recovery from recent slide BIGC is an e-commerce company that competes with SHOP. The difference between BIGC and SHOP is that BIGC targets large companies and is more focused on customization of their shop front.

BIGC has recently been clobbered by the tech company bear market, seeing a price slide to ATL, well below its IPO opening price. The IPO was priced at $25, BIGC started trading at $80, and after some peaks to $120, its been on a slide consistently down where it has now settled at $48. So really, $25 --> $48 in the ultra-realitic case.

BIGC saw a small jump in its price after releasing its earnings on February 26, but returned back to its slide since then. https://investors.bigcommerce.com/node/7361/html#ITEM_8_FINANCIAL_STATEMENTS_SUPPLEMENTAR

In 2020, they saw 45% profit growth over 2019, which is a big jump from 2018-->2019.

At their current price point, they have a P/S of 21, which is on the low end for a tech e-comm company, especially since the comparisons to SHOP are direct. SHOP comparatively is at a PS of 40.

Now, here's the interesting risk/reward part. BIGC is trading at a level where a strong revenue beat, and projections of 50% revenue growth YoY could drive up the stock price with a 50% upside potential. Here's my logic:

Current P/S is 21 with a current revenue of $152M in 2020. Growth from 2019 to 2020 was 50%. So right now, it seems that revenue growth has not been factored into the price yet, and BIGC is in undervalued territory. If BIGC sees revenue in Q1 of $55M, that means they're on track to hit $220M for 2021, which is 50% revenue growth from 2020 to 2021. If that happens, BIGC now enters a trajectory to justify BOTH a higher multiplier (like SHOP) and a price increase based on the current multiplier.

BUT, here's the risk part. If BIGC misses revenue, and only gets revenue of $40M, I expect its stock to crash all the way to $25. BIGC is at ATL, and the only support below its current price is at $25 which was the IPO price. So the downside right now is 50% loss vs 50% gain. It almost feels like a blackjack hand.

Its also important to note that BIGC missed revenue in Q4 by 10%, coming in at $32M instead of $38M estimate. So maybe the dreams of a $55M quarter may be aspirational."
2021-05-09 21:06:33,stocks,I see a lot of people on Reddit making these comparisons and then can‚Äôt believe the stock they bought is down 30% I can name 20 tech stocks now down 30% that that had p/s ratios at 20 or lower. Just saying.... It‚Äôs not cheap by any standards
2021-05-10 07:31:29,stocks,"Oh, totally agree! I think there's a huge social psychology aspect to this that I'm not cognizant enough to understand. I wasn't saying that BIGC deserves 40 P/S. I'm just saying there are ""more stable"" companies that have more ""institutional investors"" that have higher P/S ratios.

I wonder if the bottom will ever fall out of SHOP."

2021-05-09 20:30:15,stocks,"It's also a good idea to get out in time. I'm no Tesla bear, merely cautious, but the fact they're losing (not gaining) marketshsre is troubling. Their current sales, even if they were to dominate, is hard to justify. Even more so as they're getting pushed back by other brands...



Yes, they got batteries (made by  Panasonic) and solar but neither of these are new markets or unique. There is massive competition so valued much lower hence its hard to pretend Tesla is somehow going to dominate. It may happen, bubt it's unlikely. Even gigants like Yahoo or Hertz fall, even seemingly good stuf like Enron and Luckin Coffee fooled many."
2021-05-10 00:07:56,stocks,"Tesla is not supposed to maintain 80% market share. That is just unrealistic and I don‚Äôt think anyone expects that.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Inflation is a measure of the rate of rising prices of goods and services in an economy.
Inflation can occur when prices rise due to increases in production costs, such as raw materials and wages.

A surge in demand for products and services can cause inflation as consumers are willing to pay more for the product.

Some companies reap the rewards of inflation if they can charge more for their products as a result of the high demand for their goods.

Hmmm sounds familiar."

There is an argument that the American economy is operating way under full capacity and this argument is supported in part by the unemployment numbers. In my opinion, the spending is justified because the American economy has so much room to take the increased spending in. Economists spend their entire career trying to piece together what causes inflation really, a short Google search won't get you all the factors and answers."

The only reason they ran up towards the end of the 90s was .com valuation bubble. 

That said, their big threat right now is cloud so I give the edge to AMZN going forward. They jumped on that sooner. Also GOOG is making headway and they control Android. Dont think MSFT will go away just that there is less reliance on their tools today since everything can be run as an app from the internet (aka cloud)."

2021-05-09 22:05:55,stocks,"It isn't a bad choice alone. Yield is low for an income focused strategy. Personally I'd split JEPI, SPHD, and SCHD and favor heavily towards whichever currently had the highest yield if I was targeting producing cash flow using ETFs and hopefully add in the capital appreciation behind it doing this between the three. This is just my personal preference."
2021-05-10 07:41:31,stocks,"Dumb luck, honestly. 
I‚Äôm in my 30s, my target retirement fund and STAR fund have been doing great, the ladder robofund set an aggressive risk management till 2040, then goes even safer at 2060. But a lot of those funds beat the market average by a few points at least."
2021-05-09 23:28:40,stocks,"The app sucks, I don‚Äôt use it for the app. I pay .08-.34% in fund fees max. Which is the only real thing I care about. Target retirement funds have the cheapest fees, which don‚Äôt matter too much on a few thousand bucks. But imagine paying 1-4% a year in fund fees (this is common) on a million dollars‚Ä¶. Vanguard robofund fees are awesome low."

2021-05-09 21:56:03,stocks,"A traditional DRIP reinvests dividends into the same security that issues the dividend purchasing fractional shares with no associated fees. Originally it was the only way to acquire fractional shares of a given security. Shares are purchased through a DRIP using a standard market execution when you receive the dividend. You still have to pay taxes on the dividend though if it is held in a taxable account.

DRIP stand for: Dividend Reinvestment Program"

2021-05-09 22:15:53,stocks,"Exactly the reason I'd add it is for the growth potential. JEPI probably represents the highest risk reward proposition though.

I wouldn't necessarily say that because he is young that he should be extremely aggressive. A lot depends on his personal circumstances and goals. I feel that the blanket advice of ""since you are young it's OK to take risks."" honestly does more harm than good in the long run and it encourages a gambling mentality as apposed to a gardening one."

2021-05-09 21:57:15,stocks,This is a good perspective on things
2021-05-10 04:12:03,stocks,"I usually hold 30+ stocks and rebalance monthly/quarterly, as you said, rebalancing into different sectors regularly to match trends and capitalise on small dips in the market compounding profits.

Even in the last 30 days I'm up 4.56% in realised gains and my YTD is 36% realised gains."
2021-05-09 21:30:02,stocks,Cathie Wood is trying to reduce volatility?
2021-05-10 07:57:55,stocks,"I understand risk, specifically the difference between compensated and then uncompensated risk. Uncompensated risk is risk that is not expected to result in higher returns, e.g. an inexperienced investor trying to beat the market. Sure you _could_ pick the right stocks and make a lot of money, but you could also pick the right numbers at the roulette wheel and make a lot of money. You can also permanently lose a lot of money. Would you advise a young person to take money that would've otherwise been practically guaranteed to make good returns in an index fund to a casino instead? Because, who knows, they might pick the right number?"
2021-05-10 04:42:52,stocks,"but also, if he sticks to index funds he has decades of compounding on his side. why risk it?"
2021-05-10 03:54:09,stocks,">Problem is the economy use to collapse every 20-30 years and now it seems like it happens every decade.

If you take a look at the MSCI World index you will see that there is not a single 15 year period in its entire history where you wouldn't have profited. Despite multiple economy crashes. The good thing about passive investment strategies like ETF indexing is that you don't have to time your investment correctly. You simply invest monthly and your investment grows due to overall economy growth and compound interest."
2021-05-10 06:50:20,stocks,"Right - but the op wanted a system where he / she was not interacting much with the account, so this would suck"
2021-05-09 21:36:23,stocks,"Depends on the fund. People like Cathie Wood just make speculative plays. It‚Äôs obvious she won‚Äôt beat the market long term. The moment we hit the next recession her fund is getting its clock cleaned. 

Fund managers are constantly buying and selling, they can‚Äôt buy and hold when that would be boring and clients wouldn‚Äôt pay them. 

Lynch and Buffet have both noted retail investors have an advantage that firms don‚Äôt - which is being able to buy and hold, there‚Äôs no pressure to move money around constantly. For example Buying and holding FAAMG will outperform the market this decade most likely. It‚Äôs not difficult to spot businesses that are ingrained in society yet still growing rapidly.

u/mjr2015 is right. Now is the time to learn and improve investing knowledge. The stock market isn‚Äôt necessarily a casino, you can absolutely make educated, higher probability moves that pan out well."
2021-05-10 08:54:00,stocks,then... you don't understand risk.
2021-05-10 05:11:35,stocks,"I never said don't invest in index funds all I said was he's young and he needs to be investing in more than index funds potential returns of individual companies will far outweigh with that index pain is going to bring it to you and because he is so young if it doesn't work out still has time

I did the index fund thing only when I started investing and I 100% regret it because the individual companies that I did investing have a grew far beyond what my index fund has returned.

All in the name of being conservative but there is such a thing as being too conservative I could have knocked 10 years off my working life if I didn't listen to people who said index funds only

And the inevitable response is going to be but you didn't know and the only response that I can give you is risk-versus-reward

When you are young you have plenty of time to make money plenty of time to take additional risk this is exactly why when you do a Target date find they give you a majority of holding of stock and as you grow older that Target date funds slowly shift away from stocks


Go out there find some companies you use on an everyday basis alongside your Index Fund. Some will work out and someone that's just the nature of the Beast"
2021-05-10 18:12:03,stocks,"Yes, but considering how frequent market crashes and bear market runs occur, it also makes a lot of sense to sit on a decent chunk of cash and only throw it into the market when one of those inevitably happens. I mean seriously, at this point we have an actual market crash and multiple bear market runs each decade. I'm currently kicking myself because I didn't put enough money aside side to take advantage of last March."

2021-05-10 06:43:26,stocks,"i agree man don‚Äôt worry haha, but yeah that‚Äôs also true i think a lot of newer investors (including myself) won‚Äôt have a lot of success with that. so if you preach like maybe 30% of your portfolio to individual stocks i think that makes sense. as i‚Äôm on the younger side i‚Äôm not going to do any less than 30% individual pickings personally even though a lot of indexers recommend a max of 10%"

That‚Äôs the million dollar question which will not be answered on reddit. 

But what is general knowledge is the mathematics of portfolio optimisation. As others have pointed out, modern portfolio theory argues that you should try to be a mean-variance optimiser - that is, maximise return and minimise risk (volatility). Which of the two you should prefer is a question of your risk tolerance. 

Moreover, managing a portfolio also comes with significant transaction costs. Thus, we also introduce minimising transaction costs to maintain as close as possible the optimised mean-variance. 

These are the only answers you can get. If you want to know how to decide stocks to include in your reduced portfolio, you‚Äôre going to have to answer that yourself."

&#x200B;

I was seeking input onto my 11 holdings, not the 33 in my portfolio that I am obviously still working on. 

&#x200B;

Your initial criticisms were often inaccurate. For example, you belittled my investment in GAW as simply relying on the past and offering no reason to invest, where I listed 4 and made clear these were 2 liners. 

&#x200B;

Your other ""help"" consisted of explaining to me what I already know - that a dividend $ is the same value as a share price $ - using sources that must have been known to me because I referenced one of them, and I'm not being funny, are hardly rocket science. You are acting like the be all and end all in investment knowledge, but I'm not seeing it. And it's not like I've not owned my mistakes, engaged constructively with others who made reasonable points that have actually helped me out. 

&#x200B;

So I guess I am in a similar situation. If you are genuinely trying to help, I think you could do the below and you could get a more receptive conversation and actually help: 

&#x200B;

1) Read my post and understand what I'm asking for

2) Offer constructive analysis/opinions/thoughts on the companies I've shared

3) Actually read my thoughts on each company with an open mind

4) Couch your teachings in a way that is likely not to get peoples backs up

5) We were debating the benefits of divi over non-divi, but when I raised rebuttals that I thought were reasonable, you again went back to pointing out my ignorance instead of engaging in my points. 

&#x200B;

I hope that proves helpful."
2021-05-10 09:56:36,stocks,"OK yes, I could have worded it better, another way to look at this is say a security is trading at e.g $100.

Likewise, if you hold the security at $80, and you think at $100 it would be ""fully"" valued, then you could sell $100 calls. In both cases, you're taking the view that volatility in the security's price will not correlate much with any fundamental change (I'd say that is true most of the time, but there's obviously risk associated with the cases when it's not)."

I'm not ignoring it, Tesla is cutting costs not just of their batteries but also the production of their car much faster than any other automaker. Their cars are already so much cheaper than their ""competition's"" that the Cybertruck is half the price of the electric Hummer, while it's coming out sooner and easily beats it in terms of specs.

> Quality is more than just the numbers, it is also material, feeling and reliability.

Definitely. That's why it's so important that Tesla is making their own materials, as in literally inventing new materials. No other automaker does that. They're also developing new manufacturing techniques that other carmakers can only dream of, like casting the front and rear underbodies from a single piece, where other automakers are using hundreds of parts, greatly reducing vibrations (feeling) and increasing reliability.

> Furthermore people tend to stick to things they know and Tesla got no customer base.

If that would be the case, half the world wouldn't have traded their flip phone for an iPhone within a few years time. I know a highly successful German businessman who drove Audis, Mercedes and BMWs his entire life and traded them all in to buy 3 Teslas the moment he tried one out for the first time.

Once customers get the products at a rate they really need, they'll start cancelling orders, if suppliers will let them, or stop placing orders until what they ordered gets used up.

This is why semis historically have been through enormous boom & bust cycles. To see these cycles, you have to cut off the last several years of explosive growth and zoom in on historical prices, as a simple ""to-date"" graph scales historical performance down to the origin line."
2021-05-09 22:39:29,stocks,"Can someone tell me how AMC is worth 10$ a share without the ""short squeeze"" theory.

-On Dec 2019 a couple weeks before the first case of covid reported, it was trading at 8$ with 103M shares outstanding.

-Now it is trading at $9 with 450M shares outstanding. That is 4x share dilution.

-So the share price  just gone up ~ 4 times in a span of 1.5 year without bringing in any revenue.

Inflation will run rampant and tax hike will lead to more exodus from US growth stocks to crypto or other foreign assets. No way foreign growth investors will choose US growth stocks for quite some time shall that happen. Borrowing cost will surge as well and some small caps growth will probably go bankrupt. I‚Äôm wondering if foreign small caps tech will start moving to crypto favored country and listing in crypto exchange, that could be a huge blow to US stocks in the future.

2021-05-09 23:28:48,stocks,"I like to think of it with 3 broad categories:


Value: Low PE ratio, but generally small growth prospects. Will often provide dividends and does profits right now. Example: ABBV. It provides a nice 4.49% dividend but i doubt it gets crazy growth. Often called ""boomer"" stocks because they're good choices if you want a safer options, and safe options are great for shorter term horizons.



Growth: Generally higher PE ratio, and far lower dividends. But these companies are expected to grow their profits over the years. Amazon is a good example. 



Speculation: People like to call these ""growth"", but the main difference is these ones usually make little profits at the moment, and making a sizable profit some day isn't even a guarantee. They're based on the hope of some day crushing the market with crazy innovation. Tesla is a good example imo."

2021-05-09 23:33:29,stocks,"I‚Äôm bullish on Apple and love the stock. It‚Äôs a stock I personally don‚Äôt mind buying at any time to DCA, but I think my sentiment and question comes more from me thinking that tech as a whole is overvalued right now, specifically Apple‚Äôs stock. 

They had a fantastic earnings report, legitimately destroyed their previous year quarterlies and beat out several price targets for EPS, revenue, etc... and they plummeted 3-4(?)% since that point.

That being said, I‚Äôm still careful about calling it ‚Äúcheap.‚Äù It is technically by monetary value cheap compared to other FAANG stocks because it‚Äôs been split so many times, but I don‚Äôt think that makes it a great time to invest even for being a fantastic company."
2021-05-09 23:42:56,stocks,but the idea of having a sudden surge in profits perhaps due to insane technology etc such that the price of the stock rapidly increases is the same right?
2021-05-09 23:40:05,stocks,"Yea I can understand that perspective. In the long term (5-10 years), I think the base case scenario with current valuations right now is we end up with sub-par returns compared to major indices. Still not a bad place to park your money, as there most certainly is upside.
 
Full disclosure, I hold Apple myself üòÖ"
2021-05-09 23:44:41,stocks,"Well the surge can sometimes happen earlier, if investors believe in the company. For example, a lot of them gained a lot of value during 2020, but they lost a lot of value since February. The real growth stocks like amazon did just fine."
2021-05-10 01:53:34,stocks,"Agreed! I have to remind myself that 2020 in particular was a funky year for stocks. Apple is something like 115% up since March 2020 so to expect even better returns is... hoping for much in my opinion. 

I expect we‚Äôll see some more sideways trading from Apple in the coming months but who knows how this will end up. I hold a small stake in Apple too but regardless I love the company."
2021-05-10 00:29:46,stocks,No point in trying to reason with someone using Bitcoin as a comp to stocks.
2021-05-10 14:12:50,stocks,"I really don‚Äôt care what anyone says at this point.  This is utterly ridiculous.  With the last three earnings reports, this should have never dropped below $3400-$3500.  The fact that we are here, yet again, is an absolute embarrassment.  I don‚Äôt care what the rest of the market is doing.  This stock is so far off of its target that it will take years to hit and hold at $4k."
2021-05-10 14:27:00,stocks,Sounds like you're ready to sell.
2021-05-09 20:58:36,stocks,"I agree! made some money off my 45c for 12/18. ASO recent move to 33 is great and I still think it has room to grow. Look at DKS and ASO.

In late 30, i read about diversification, compounding interests and etfs from buffet and ray dalio and decided to take the plunge."
2021-05-10 08:13:41,stocks,"That‚Äôs kind of a weird way of framing it though. The reason we use broad index funds as a benchmark is because the *opportunity cost* of any given investment is putting that money into VTI and spending your time and energy on literally anything else. It might make you feel better to tell yourself you still made money, but that was money you were gonna invest anyways. Once you acknowledge that fact, the market equity premium makes a lot of sense as a benchmark."
2021-05-10 17:10:05,stocks,Valid point.

2021-05-10 13:20:12,stocks,lol down 5%...I should have waited until the market opened on that one. But it happens to me all the time. I tend to jump in in the middle of a down turn. There's no doubt that it will be coming back. Tech is getting slammed all around today.

Once the reviews started coming out about how good it was, I jumped in to the stock pretty heavy. At the time, I felt as if they were valued as a dinosaur that would not even be able to make or sell EV's at all. Now that they hit my original price target tho of 12-13 per share, I have since revised my target upwards to 15-17, mostly due to the Google partnership.
