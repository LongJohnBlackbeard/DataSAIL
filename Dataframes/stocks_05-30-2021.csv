2021-05-30 19:51:38,stocks,"Less to do with specific stocks, more about strategy. Most important lesson (at least for me) is time. Accept the long nature aspect of investments and just ride it out. Exceptions of course apply but by and large, don't sell at loss, think long term"
2021-05-30 19:55:09,stocks,"There's really no quick and easy answer to this, and every trader will have their own methods and preferences that work for them but might not work for others. I'm biased but I like the 2 Bulls In A China Shop podcast for a fun way to learn. If you're really serious about growing your knowledge beyond amateur, TradePro Academy has an amazing learning program and a great community."

2021-05-30 15:23:30,stocks,"It’s also my biggest holding. Probably tied with Amazon. Massive potential for significant monetising of their user base. Valuation pretty high right now, though more reasonable than a couple of months ago, that growth has to come in very strong, but then again this could be another Facebook... 

My wife uses it every second day probably. I think a lot of women do / will do. They just need to execute in that monetising strategy."
2021-05-30 16:37:04,stocks,"I’m a big believer in the company. They have very good growth and will continue to do so. They mentioned that their YoY revenue growth will be 105% in the next quarter. That is insane in my opinion. Their platform is really unique since they are a social media and an ecommerce site. They have a strong userbase that don’t mind the ads, since they make the experience multiple times better. People are also often ready to spend money when they are scrolling Pinterest. 

Their platform isn’t very monetized yet, but they will eventually do so as their MAUs grow. I heavily believe in the management. Their founder and CEO Ben Silbermann has a clear vision and knows what is best for the company. The social ecommerce business will be huge in the future, and I’m betting that Pinterest will be on the top of the industry."
2021-05-30 16:55:36,stocks,"Objectively I think it's actually really good and in a fairly interesting spot. Pinterest is my go-to when I want to come up with ""Some Day"" ideas or just want to visualize things. For example, I have my whole closet on Pinterest so if I'm out shopping I can better see how something might fit into it. I bring this up because Pinterest is simple, it's not trying to stick its hands in different industries it's focusing on what it's good at. Another commentator here mentioned Etsy, which is another awesome stock because it also focuses on just one thing and being good at it. With regards to the future, I think many businesses use it fairly effectively. Potterybarn creates boards using its products, so do other companies. Hope that helps."
2021-05-30 16:12:39,stocks,"Love ETSY...still don't own it. I am watching though.
Hold pins. It's just reaching profitability and I'm hoping to hold for the next 3-5."
2021-05-30 15:53:18,stocks,ETSY also
2021-05-30 18:30:17,stocks,">leadership

>I really love the direction

You clearly have researched the company, and understand their trajectory. You know more about the company than me, but have a solid sense about their roadmap that means you have a reason to have faith. If you come away with a bullish thesis, then buy and hold."
2021-05-30 18:46:02,stocks,"I know everyone says women use it, but I don't actually know any women who do (and I'm a woman with a creative hobby). The issue with Pinterest for me is that it takes forever to recognize that old trends are indeed old. I created a couple of fashion related boards on Pinterest in 2015 and even in 2020 it was recommending stuff from that era and I obviously was no longer interested in those trends. The other issue is that it's very consumeristic and I don't like to be sold stuff. I've gone there for ideas and every time I'm turned off by the very expensive products they were suggesting (why do I need to spend $300 on a white tshirt exactly?). It's the kind of place where everything is an ad (kind of like Times Square?), even things pretending to be actual content.

I fundamentally don't like Pinterest as a product and I now actively avoid it (all my Google searches have -Pinterest attached)."
2021-05-30 16:19:11,stocks,Personally I don't use it and incase I need something I usually go to google images for quick ideas lol
2021-05-30 16:09:03,stocks,"I am a big believer in SNAP and it is my biggest holding.  Once I hit my self-imposed limit on the number of SNAP shares I bought, I bought up some PINS.  It is sort of a sister stock to SNAP, as they tend to rise and fall together."
2021-05-30 16:20:03,stocks,"It has really interesting metrics. Pinterest is the top social media platform on iPads for example (home devices).

I kinda like to compare Facebook vs. Pinterest as WalMart vs. Costco. Access vs value.


I saw on the other day that a Pinterest ""story"" for a cooking recipe had a little button that would summon a panel with the ingredients and instructions list. I was like oh my god, it's even better than Google at search for some things lol!"
2021-05-30 18:36:36,stocks,"Yep, I like the potential but it's disappointing that they're still raking in big losses 12 years into their business."
2021-05-30 17:53:44,stocks,"Looked like ETSY bottomed out around $155-160, picked up a couple shares, love that they're already profitable in these early growth stages. What do you think is a good entry point?"
2021-05-30 19:38:38,stocks,"ETSY reported slowing growth, down to 30% in 21, 19% in 22, whereas PINS are at 50% for 21/22, worth factoring in despite ETSY having impressive cash flow and routinely beating earnings."
2021-05-30 18:32:17,stocks,I suppose that is true. I tend not to recognize my efforts. Thank you for this comment.

2021-05-30 18:38:00,stocks,Most people tend to not understand companies as well as you. Thank *you* for actually putting in some effort.
2021-05-30 14:49:50,stocks,It’s because you’re not focusing on your overall growth. You’re focusing on individual trade; focus on the growth of your account as a whole. Once you start doing that then you will appreciate consistent single and doubles over home runs.
2021-05-30 14:55:13,stocks,Be happy about the win. Think about the fact that you managed to succeed. Then move on to the next one and try to do better. Just try not to think about what you could have gotten.
2021-05-30 15:22:57,stocks,Whenever I feel like getting greedy I remember all the times I was greedy and lost out on profits I already had and now I exit at my targets.
2021-05-30 14:48:47,stocks,"I mainly sell, when I am convinced the stock has peaked in growth potential and I am no longer really interested in its future. This usually goes along with replacing the stock with something new and interesting in watch list to bind my focus. You barely ever buy/sell at the absolute optimal point anyways, so you'll get used to miss out on a few % in potential gains. Just never stop thriving to improve your decisions."
2021-05-30 15:08:33,stocks,No fomo. Take your profit. Never regret making money.
2021-05-30 14:51:12,stocks,"Selling in batches can be helpful if you're particularly prone to regret. 

If you're selling a stock once it has become overvalued you shouldn't feel too bad if it continues going up anyways. 

Determine your approximate exit point before you even buy in the first place."
2021-05-30 15:51:21,stocks,"2 things.

Big picture: You will never buy at the absolute bottom or sell at the absolute top. No matter what you buy or sell, there will always be an opportunity to buy it cheaper or sell it higher. Once you accept that, you will be okay with leaving SOME money on the table.

Short term: Before you buy something, know the value that you want to sell it for. If the stock should be fairly valued at $25 for example, would you buy it at 24? 23? 20? 16? If you truly believe it is worth more, then the cheaper it gets the greedier you get and the more you want.

Then when you sell, obviously you want to get the most, but at some point you recognize that it gets to be be overvalued. Knowing this, you decide in advance what price you will be happy selling it at. If you sell a $25 stock at $35, be happy. Maybe it goes to $40.. 50.. 70.. but you know it doesn't belong there, so it would have been foolish to hold out for that price, which may or may not have ever come."
2021-05-30 16:04:17,stocks,"Could haves is what gets people in trouble. Goldman Sachs mentioned that one big reason why they're successful is that they pulled out ""too early"". 

When you pull out, don't look back unless it's your wife."
2021-05-30 14:57:51,stocks,"Well, you can try to allocate lets say 10% of your salary to gambling e.g. options or some more risky stocks. It'll give you some dopamine lol and you won't loose all you got in one day. The rest you can keep in high quality stocks or ETFs. This is how I do"
2021-05-30 15:20:53,stocks,Wait...Your stocks make gains?
2021-05-30 15:12:00,stocks,You won’t go broke taking profit
2021-05-30 15:51:52,stocks,I’ve suffered through this until I realized that there is no crime in re-buying a stock you like 😀
2021-05-30 14:44:42,stocks,Small gains are big gains!
2021-05-30 15:04:16,stocks,"If you are second guessing, it just means there was no strategy for that particular trade in the first place. There must have been a good reason that you took the profit and got out. If not, it just means that you made that trade without a good strategy in place (why and when to get out) and got lucky to get out with a profit.

The same goes for a losing trade with “what ifs”. People tend not to have a good reason and hang on to losing positions way too long."
2021-05-30 16:16:42,stocks,"Ease in and was out of a stock trade. 

If you made say 30% profit, sell 30% of your stake and leave the rest on. You can set other profit levels as you like."
2021-05-30 14:52:52,stocks,"Diversify you strategy with investing and trading. have the majority of your money in broad market etfs, then pick 5-10 long term stocks that you believe in for the next 30 years, and with 10-15% trade. Set a percentage goal and cash out your trades when they hit it. 10%, 15% even 20% gains on a trade and cash out. You decide what your goal is for those short term investments and stick to it, when you got it cash out and find the next opportunity"
2021-05-30 15:41:28,stocks,Nobody ever went broke taking a profit. Gotta put into perspective what you're goals are and learn to keep emotion out of it. I learned my lesson with tesla. Sold at 700 before the split and I still think about that.
2021-05-30 16:27:46,stocks,"Feels bad, but profit is profit"
2021-05-30 16:33:02,stocks, I bought Sony at 18 and sold at 24. Few weeks later it was 36 and now is over 100.... I don't regretted because the reasons I bought back then are no longer relevant. I have to re-study the fundamentals to trade it again.
2021-05-30 14:42:02,stocks,"Accept the win and focus on the next move. I'm a believer in long term and adding to your winners. I don't throw mucho money at investing overall, but when I do I hold for five years and try to stay as disciplined as possible. I sold out GME at 36 bucks and that hurt watching it eclipse 500 at one point, but I was happy to get the win buying at $3 for a scratch off lottery ticket"
2021-05-30 15:58:06,stocks,"You're investing with too much emotion.  

Before you invest, you should have a range of what you think is 'fair value' for that stock.  Buy when it's at the lower end, and if it rises well past that then sell.  Remember that valuations change constantly each time more information comes out so you need to be able to keep with all of your stocks.  

If a company is growing as its earnings grow, but you sell because you're up 25% - that's how you miss out on future gains of good companies."
2021-05-30 15:34:59,stocks,"The woulda-coulda-shouldas are looking at the past with the perspective of wishing you could time travel. 

9 times out of 10, people with your sentiment weren't being realistic with themselves when they entered their positions about what kind of risk they were taking on."
2021-05-30 15:56:20,stocks,"Is you have to do, remember, opportunities in the market are endless. I think this is huge issue with FOMO that I encounter every now and then. I try to keep calm and work instead of FOMO bologna."
2021-05-30 15:58:55,stocks,No emotional attachment to any stock.
2021-05-30 17:55:44,stocks,"You guys are doing it all wrong. Buy at the peak, sell low, always be sad."
2021-05-30 15:25:50,stocks,"Still learning, so I'm trying to sort out this fomo also. I've tried placing puts under my gains, that way I don't feel as worried if I don't get out at an ATH. but it only works if you're not in a squeeze stock because of Volatility.

Another thing I'm experimenting with is buying ""extra shares"". Like 125 of something. I'll deal options around my 100 and then if they get called away those 25 shares are my ""let it ride"" shares. Trying this with AMC currently.

I may try different amounts of ""extra shares"" to see how many shares it takes for me not to feel like I missed out if it continues to moon, but also not so many to where if/when it crashes, it ends up being no gains and essentially a waste of time lol. 

I understand what I just said doesn't really apply to safe stuff. For that I'd just set a price target. 30%, 50%, 100%-- whatever you need to feel a win. Then, like others have said, take that W and on to the next."
2021-05-30 15:26:38,stocks,"Set your own buy/sell levels, live by them and don't look back--for at least 6 months."
2021-05-30 15:36:03,stocks,Just set limits. It helps take emotion out of the equation. Using limits will also help you improve your entries
2021-05-30 15:45:17,stocks,Money is money. Every profit you make is great
2021-05-30 15:57:20,stocks,Happy cake day!  🎂
2021-05-30 16:00:22,stocks,"If everyone could time selling at peak, everyone would be rich."
2021-05-30 16:16:39,stocks,You gotta learn to just be happy you made money. There’s always a chance that a stock could keep rising but the same can be said about it falling. Hindsight is always 20/20 but you can’t time the market.
2021-05-30 19:10:40,stocks,Always remember to lock in gains early and let your losses run.
2021-05-30 15:30:40,stocks,"Profit.

Selling to make more money.

You've lost me."
2021-05-30 15:47:30,stocks,"It’s because you don’t have a plan and you need to let go of these feelings. Trade with plans. If you enter a trade think you yourself: “ I will take 3% profit once I reach it”. Do the math, set a sell order for “good till cancelled” with your exit price. Have a plan. Always have a plan. If you’re stuck in the “ i could have made yyy instead of xxx, think instead “ wow this company has more potential than I thought, I will re enter once I see a decent dip”. And make a plan."
2021-05-30 15:49:43,stocks,Thats why i put everything in index fund and i try to not look at it. Cause trading gave me that feeling.
2021-05-30 15:49:58,stocks,Once I sell..I try not to look back and think about the loss gain..there r many stocks in market.
2021-05-30 15:52:28,stocks,"Sometimes, I do go back in if it's doing well. Usually, when I stop, it's bc I think about the fact that my gains could easily be wiped out.

I also think about just how much I'd be gaining if I did go back in. Sometimes, it's not even worth the hassle. 

I stop watching (literally) that particular stock and sometimes, delete it from my watchlists so that I don't see it throughout the day."
2021-05-30 15:54:28,stocks,"I sell and rebalance to a % weighting on the way up. It really hamstrings some of my gains but I dont get overexposed to stocks this way, which is much better for me personally during corrections. So far youre mostly seeing good times with investing, but its about to get more difficult than just ""everything going up"" like you see at the beginning of a bull rally. When times get tough youll be happy to sell or not lose money."
2021-05-30 15:56:46,stocks,"Viewed my account as a whole so any gains were rewarded, but also I gained the mindset that this is a ridiculous way to make money without leaving my desk so I didn’t mind if I sold early or too late"
2021-05-30 16:04:18,stocks,"ANY profit is a win. If you try to time the market you'll get burned. When you get burned, you'll develop discipline or stop investing.

Never think of what could have been. Do your analysis objectively and make your moves. Learn from mistakes, but never let a stock price run alone decide whether or not your decision was good or bad. You should have a reason for your moves. 

Example: I sold AMD in the 30's after buying at like 10. I made lots of money on that trade. Sure, I could have made more, but I still think AMD is overvalued for their business and is running up purely on INTC's incompetence. I don't regret taking my winnings. I made an analysis, a decision on that analysis, and was happy with the outcome. This was handy when WKHS ran to 30 and I sold out and then they lost the USPS contract and tanked. Make your money while it's there. Hogs get slaughtered. 

Trust your DD."
2021-05-30 16:13:26,stocks,"Compare the profit you would take now to $0. 

If you are satisfied with that number then realize your gains. There will always be more trades. 

Unless it’s a massive short squeeze opportunity or some other anomaly"
2021-05-30 16:48:36,stocks,Don’t sell unless you need the cash. Invest for the long haul. No need to “take profits” unless you need the cash.
2021-05-30 17:11:14,stocks,"Why not just rely on trailing stop loss orders to drop the stock as soon as it starts to tumble? That way, you know it's not going to keep moving up even after selling at a profit. And if the tumble gets reversed, you can just buy the stock again while it's going back up."
2021-05-30 17:39:05,stocks,"A lot of people don’t really know what their goal actually is. They are traders until their shit goes down 20% and then they become long term investors. If you are a swing trader in my opinion you should always be thinking about taking profits on the way up. Don’t worry about the could haves, there are always more opportunities."
2021-05-30 18:08:16,stocks,"I only invest in companies that i think will be successful upcoming 30 years, so i dont sell for profits."

2021-05-30 18:54:35,stocks,"i’ll watch a stock after i’ve sold it and get a wave of relief when it’s gone down below my sell price and a blast of fuck off anxiety when it has gone up.

2021-05-30 14:54:23,stocks,Can you really call it a career?
2021-05-30 15:18:26,stocks,"There's no way to predict the market.  It's impossible to accurately find the top or bottom of any stock.  Remember that.  If you chase the top you'll just find the bottom since once it drops a few points, you'll hold and wait for that top again.

Have a set plan, with entry and exit points when you buy.  Nothing matters after you get what you want.  It's hard to care or worry about what else happened if you hit a set goal, you won by predicting what the stock would do.

If you need to, just delete it from your watchlists after so you'll never know what else happened."

2021-05-30 16:16:50,stocks,"You need to have conviction. Easier said than done.

In order to have conviction, you need to be able to analyze the value of a business, and the future potential of the business, without being influenced in your thinking by the current share price. 

If this sounds difficult, it is. It takes years to gain the experience and knowledge to navigate the market. 

While you build up this knowledge, I recommend putting half or more of your funds in a mutual fund or index fund, and actively manage the rest. This mutual fund/index fund is now your benchmark. After a couple years (not a couple months), compare your performance to your benchmark. If you’re not handily beating your benchmark, don’t actively manage all your funds.

Disclaimer: I had over half my funds in Fidelity Blue Chip Growth mutual fund for over 6 years. My actively managed portion performed well, but underperformed for 4 years. My last 2 years, I outperformed my benchmark. Even though my actively managed funds underperformed for 4 years, the knowledge and experience I gained was more than worth it."

2021-05-30 16:47:07,stocks,"You have to have a plan of profit taking and be ok that you executed the plan. If did better, the plan is your reference point, not whatever the current state of the stock is.

Stocks will always go up and down. You must be OK taking less than what you could have knowing it was 1) already a win 2) your thesis was correct, and most importantly 3) you lived to trade another day.

Always have a plan going in so you are ready to pull the trigger at different points. This will require a little bit of time on research but it will make you Better, force you to learn, and allow you to establish expectations and entry exit points. This will be grow skills as well as allow you to know what to possibly expect in the future given similar circumstances. 

Being alive and adding to your account whether it is small or large is more important than trying to time the top and max profit off 1 play. 

No one ever finds the top or bottom, they’re basically determined by algorithms and big money anyways. So if you try to time the top, the algo would see that and trade even a bit higher perhaps. 

Make the trade against yourself and your plan not the stock. This will keep you going day after day.

Once you hit that price point that you wanted to originally and pull the trigger, walk away. Celebrate rather than lament and keep looking at the stock. Take 10 20% wins rather than look for that one 100% gain."
2021-05-30 16:48:19,stocks,"It's mental training and experience. You have to ask yourself ""was my decision to sell the correct one given the info, price, your financial status,... available at that time?"". The difficult part when answering that question is to ignore what happened to the price afterwards. Now, if the prices keeps going up every single time, you have to question your reasoning of course. 

I'll give an analogy: I'm a poker player (one might say I like everything involving risk and money). Sometimes you will fold what turned out to be the best hand (~selling stock that turned out to rise afterwards). That doesn't make it a bad fold. Sometimes the risk to continue is just not worth the reward. Now, if I see that my opponent is turning up with a bluff every single time, I have to adjust my reasoning and actions of course. 

Things you could try are taking some money of the table (haha unintentional poker reference) and let half your position ride the waves. Or, set a (trailing) stop loss."

2021-05-30 17:06:59,stocks,"No differently than when I play blackjack at the casino.  I almost always make big gains, play a while then take a 10-15% loss and my brain for some reason just says 'ok, let's just get back to where we were and leave'. Then inevitably I lose more the n XT couple hours.  Brain says 'ok let's just get another 5k and leave'.  And now my smart reasonable side of my brain is ringing the sirens and warning bells cause it knows what's going to happen. But my greedy side of my brain has already budgeted for that money and it's not leaving this position / table until we have it back.  Then by either 4am at the casino or 4pm market close on my office laptop I've given back everything and also fully used my margin / marker chasing something that smart brain knows better but my greedy brain somehow has a deeper and louder voice.   
Kinda like my sober and alcohol brain.   Like my sober brain is saying 'hey, were pickled, let's slow down a little tonight we have shit to do tomorrow'.  And my alcohol brain is telling me - 'you know this time it's going to be different.  The last 8 drinks made you feel good right?  Well imagine how good you'll feel with another 8'. 
Anyways tight now I'm going to listen to my little brain and go see melony even though my smart brain is telling me that my wife is probably going to find out again and I'm going to be sleeping in the guest house for the next 4 days.  
TL;DR - listen to the smart brain not the greedy / horny / alcohol brain."

2021-05-30 17:10:43,stocks,"You have to switch to the investing mindset and accept that timing markets consistently is extremely difficult.

Start to think more in terms of allocations, e.g. 'I will be 5% TSLA'. That ways if TSLA runs up massively, you should sell some to rebalance your portfolio, but you still keep open interest. You're not going to worry about exact prices any more, and just be happy to have your money 'in the right places'. Then just sit back and let it play out.

Some people prefer a more active approach but for me it causes too much stress and costs too many fees to be constantly chopping and changing. Very few people are going to outperform the market over their career. You never truly know if you are outperforming, or underperforming, or just having good/bad fortune. I think most people should invest 80-90% of their money passively, and leave a bit for speculative plays if they want"
2021-05-30 17:13:08,stocks,I sell when I think the company will have inferior growth compared to another company. I don't sell based on gains. It's much easier to mentally move on when you have a satisfying thesis based on concrete fundamentals instead of one based on speculative gains.

-always set trailing stop losses, usually 10-15%.

- sell 50% at 30% gains

-sell 100% at 50% gains

day/swing/short hold trading-

-Trailing stop loss

-sell 50% of holdings at 15% gains

-sell 100% of holdings at 30% gains

If your system is built properly then greed shouldn't be an issue, you just buy and sell when the system that you use tells you to.

If you become more greedy over time, change your system so that you can profit more from long runs. Don't make this a 1 trade or 1 day change, do it slowly."

EDIT: the example was just that, an example. You have to align your investment strategy to your goals, but the game plan should still be respected in all cases IMO. I approach my long term investments knowing that prices may fluctuate, so the short term doesn’t bother me as much.

I now buy options for stocks that might jump or drop. I'm also dealing with the expired date of those options. This helps me while investing since it's a time frame. I do about 5% of my portfolio for this for the almost day trading factor.
Then I'll do about 70% in low risk stocks. Ones I might review every 6 months to a year. The other 25% is in speculative stocks. I try to get my original investment back when the chance occurs for these. It doesn't always happen, but I still have 70% in something that should be without high risk to build back up if I lose out.
I also have my options play and I might do this several times on a stock I might have sold early or a stock I missed. This also keeps me active in the market along with my speculative plays.
Also if ur up and like the company sell enough to get ur investment back. U will have less, but then ur not as worried if it tanks. If it goes up then u still don't lose out."

2021-05-30 19:42:38,stocks,"It depends on the position and play. If I'm building a position on a stock I believe in and that has the right numbers backing it, I will be ""greedy"" and not take profits early. For instance AMD. I have a position with a cost basis of $75.50 and watched the price flounder about near my initial buy in (I never plan to sell with any FIFO losses so as not to incur a wash sale.) Instead of taking my profits and locking in at $78.55 ish (initial buy was $78.50) I held through dips because I believe in AMD and sure enough it's now hitting above $80. I also agree that the future is even higher for the company so I will continue to hold and skip taking profits, buying the dips and accumulating in preparation for a nice new all-time high.

Now on a more speculative trade, especially if you start getting into swing trades, you must be prepared to take profits and walk away before any unrealized gains come tumbling down and leave you holding a stock you aren't completely familiar with and not bullish on. That's a bad situation to be in and I would rather sell for a pittance than hold for a landslide that never comes and end up holding the bags in the red."

2021-05-30 19:46:43,stocks,"1) Think of all the stocks you did buy and traded well. Think of all the ones you didn't buy that went off a cliff. There are thousands. You didn't buy SO MANY.

Do you suffer thinking about these losses like you suffer thinking about the losses you focus on?

No.

What's the difference?

Your focus isn't on the thousands you didn't trade. It's on a handful you're kicking yourself over.

2) Don't focus on the loss. Make it useful. 

Study it. Learn what you did wrong and what you could do better. Or, more importantly, see what you didn't do wrong because...

3) Making money is not an indicator that anyone is successful.

Yes. I know it sounds stupid. And obviously we trade to make money. But here's what I mean.

I'll use poker as an example.

You get dealt a pair of aces. You go all in. Some guy calls you. He has a 7 and a 2.

Cards come out. 77853

You lose all your money. He wins everything. 

You didn't make a mistake.

If you run that hand over and over, playing it the same way, you will win way more than you will lose.

Poker is about knowing the odds, knowing the player and making the right decision with conviction. 

The outcome of a specific hand is irrelevant if you're making the right decision using the right information.

Same thing goes for wrong decisions. 

If you did something stupid that makes no sense and win, that doesn't mean you're good. 

In fact, it makes you more likely to lose in the future because flawed thinking got you a good result. 

As far as the market goes:

Last year 495 out of 500 companies on the S&P traded for a profit.

Making money last year was incredibly simple. Anyone could've done it. 

Throw darts at a board with all the stocks on the S&P and buy them and you'd have profited.

I generated a 60% return. Does that mean I'm good? No. I'm not. I have limited knowledge and skills. It means I was lucky. At the right place, at the right time. 

My focus has to be on learning. Not on winning."

id rather have the doubles and home runs than consistent singles.

i have been doing the consistent singles for a long time (15 years now with a high win rate) and if you dont size your positions correctly, you can have a 90+% win rate over 1000s of trades and still under perform.

For example, 1000 equal bets of $100 with 100% win rate, where you earn 10% on each, will still only return 10% overall. so you need to ensure that with each subsequent trade you are increasing the position size."

However, as soon as I sold, the sentiment changed to ""this is a gold mine pick"" type deal and everyone shifted to it, resulting in me missing out on almost 20% more in one sitting. I plan to re-enter once the meme stuff fades away, because I do believe it has game changing tech, but the real value will be there in couple years, right now it's just a pump. I planned to hold through this meme phase, but I also remembered averaging up 4 months ago and being in red because I was too aggressive. I was realistic with myself, I just didn't expect a pick of mine to land in that mindless WSB stuff, so I sold based on my own fundamentals, and didn't want to get caught in a p&d"

2021-05-30 18:33:39,stocks,"An alternative perspective would be to get the “gamble” out in a safer way.

I have a mediocre sized portfolio and I love options trading. I actively manage about 60% of it as I am looking for aggressive growth over the next 10 Ish years. The other 35-40% is put into SPY and VTI, plus some dividend-growth ETF’s. When I close a stock position, I take the cash I pulled out and hold it till the nearest Monday, Wednesday, or Friday. After power hour, I open a series of ATM 0DTE credit spreads to play a short gamma position. After that first hour post-market open, it is usually pretty damn obvious what direction the major indices are moving. For example, on Friday I closed my AMC position and took that $$,$$$ and opened 500 SPY 420/419 put credit spreads for an average of $0.215 premium per spread. I closed the position for a (after commissions/fees) $5,800 profit later that day.

Ultimately, I risked assignment and a loss of only my profit on the previous trade (and a *huge* on-paper loss which is great for tax purposes), and got my gambler’s urge out on a short-term, highly leveraged position that showed big ol huge green numbers to tickle my dopamine.

I do this pretty regularly and have an 85% YTD success rate. To supplement that, I only open stock positions by selling puts and taking assignment. I usually get like 3 or 4 short-term gains out of a ticket before I actually take assignment and open a position. I’ve wound up 5 bagging my portfolio’s value since my last cash contribution by having high-conviction long term holdings as a piggy-bank and using margin to collateralize options and collecting premium.

To each their own, but I know myself and I know I’d rather do it regularly and safely than rarely and risk it all due to an explosion of lack of self control and false confidence."

2021-05-30 17:22:22,stocks,"Recognise the two main emotions, greed and fear, when they occur. The market is opposed to emotions. If you are long on greed, and short on fear, you will lose money. Most people tend to do this. They buy more when they are already up on a position, and sell when they are down. Then when the market turns, what would have been a break even position now becomes a loss, which may make them sell further and compound the error. It is not easy to what you should, the opposite, but if you recognise what is happening then at least you have a chance.

And as the other guy said, have a clear exit in mind."

2021-05-30 14:28:53,stocks,"You got the puts wrong. If you sell a put you are willing to buy it at that strike price. If the stock falls below that price, the person can exercise it and have you buy it for the strike. You want the stock to end above the strike on a put so you don’t buy it. 

You sell a put on a stock for a strike of $50. 
Stock expires at $55, you won’t be assigned as it is OTM. 
Let’s say the stock expires at $40, you will be paying $50 a share since that is what you agreed on."
2021-05-30 14:26:34,stocks,"I lost 5k in the first two months I sold options. It’s a complicated subject with lots of nuances. Do yourself a favor and learn by paper trading first until you understand why, how and when options rise or drop in price."
2021-05-30 17:54:40,stocks,"When you sell a PUT, you agree to buy at a price you set. 
Scenario
1. Price stays the same- you keep premium 
2. Price goes up- you keep premium.
3. Price falls below strike- you have to buy at the option price you sold, but you got in at a lower basis."
2021-05-30 14:31:32,stocks,"More or less. Depending on what level of options you were approved for, it’s likely you will only be able to sell cash secured puts (CSPs) meaning that you will need to have enough cash to cover the purchase of 100 shares if it got exercised.

Ex: you think XYZ, currently at $50, will go up or trade sideways, but you’d be willing to buy at $45. You deposit, raise, or otherwise have $4,500 of free cash to trade.

You sell the put at a $45 strike and collect the premium. Your “cash available” will now decrease by $4,500 because they basically pull it aside and earmark it in case the option exercises (similar to how you have to have enough cash in your bank account to get a cashiers check and then your account decreases immediately by the amount of the cashiers check).

If it doesn’t decline lower than $45, the option expires worthless, you keep the premium, and the $4,500 shows back up as available.

If it gets exercised, you keep the premium, and get 100 shares of the XYZ at $45/share and they use the $4,500 they “set aside” to fund the purchase of the shares.

One thing you can do at TD is open Think or Swim and you should see PaperTrade, as an option, and there you can practice buying and selling the options with fake money to make sure that the way you enter them, your strategies, etc. are what you think they are before potentially making a mistake and losing real money."
2021-05-30 16:38:51,stocks,"A couple of details are not quite correct. You cash the premium the moment you sell any contract. 
Selling CCs if you are bearish is a recipe for losses: CCs work well with a stock stable (but with IV still high) and with a stock rising. You would simply choose your strike price to rinse and repeat. I prefer to stay close in terms of DTE, so that I have ample margin to roll up and out if I want to keep the stock.
CSPs work well in the scenario you mention, but if you go OTM, you can tolerate moderate drops as well. You can get a lot more about these techniques in the sticky posts on r/thetagang"

2021-05-30 14:50:30,stocks,Thanks. I might have to dig deeper into think or swim. I have only had reason to use the regular TD app until now.
2021-05-30 18:10:53,stocks,yea puts aren’t covered by the existing stock you have. rather it’s covered by cash/margin (100x the strike price) since you’ll have to buy 100 shares at the strike if it falls below. if it goes it expires above premium you just keep premium. buying puts are a bearish bets. selling is bullish.
2021-05-30 15:32:42,stocks,"You have TDA . Download the desktop ThinkOrSwim app. Log in to your account, but click the paper money option when you are logging in.

2021-05-30 15:42:06,stocks,"Boo paper trading. You have no skin in the game.

Just go sell a put or two on a couple of stocks in the $8 or $10 range. Your only “risking” $1000 at most. And that’s not even a risk. Because it just gets converted into stock if the price goes lower than your strike.  

Real world trading will teach you way more than paper trading.  With money in the game you will watch it like a hawk.  And you won’t believe how much that actually helps.  Figuring out why you’re gaining or losing actual money will teach you very fast."
2021-05-30 15:29:09,stocks,It’s a simulated account. Most brokers offer one.
2021-05-30 14:55:29,stocks,Think or Swim is just TDA’s “active” trading platform. You don’t need to be an active trader to use it to place trades though. Worth checking out and the paper trading option is worth testing strategies and what not.

You are correct. It's better to start trading with a few K because paper trading is simply not real enough. I made maybe 2 paper trades on TOS and realized this was a waste of time.

2021-05-30 12:42:32,stocks,Stocks in general are a good hedge for inflation value stocks may be a little delayed if they transfer value to shareholders through dividends . But inflation goes up and their prices go up and their revenue goes up. I think your plan is a very good one if you stick to it. I personally believe in international growth as well so I like your 35% VEA / VWO just remember that 5 years is a relatively short duration so we may see a down trend in that time and be prepared to add to your positions without being caught up in the daily % swings. Good luck !

Do you have a spouse? Maxing their ROTH would be a better move than a taxable brokerage account.

Children? Contributing to a 529 would be a better move than a taxable brokerage account.

Does your employer offer a match on a traditional 401K? That would be a better move than a taxable brokerage account.

Even if they don’t offer a match - you’ll still be better off in a traditional 401k than a standard taxable brokerage account.

Just my two cents. If you’re investing with a long timeline - which it sounds like you are - anything that’s untaxed or tax deferred would be better than a typical brokerage account."

No spouse or children, but have considered setting up a 529 account since you can change the beneficiaries. The earlier start the better, and with the tax deduction available to me it is enticing. I was considering this as an option as well. 

Problem with a tax deferred account is that the money is basically locked up, unless I want to forgo 10% with an early withdrawal penalty. Since I’m initially looking at a relatively short time frame (5-10 years), I feel like taxable is the way to go. I also believe tax rates will increase in the future which is why I’m choosing Roth over other options."

That is a great point about having access to contributions, but I feel like paying a penalty on top of any tax on the gains accrued in the account defeats the purpose.

Now that I think about it, there is the ability to withdraw $10k penalty/tax free as a first time home buyer, which is something to consider given my goal. Definitely food for thought.

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Confused and annoyed... I originally had a stock in Robinhood. Most of the shares were purchased at $9.00. I got tired of Robinhoods garbage, and transferred to Webull. Now I'm looking at my holding stats, and it says share majority $13.00. When you transfer, does it lose its original price, and go to the transfer days price on the new platform?"
2021-05-30 11:36:20,stocks,"That's perfectly normal. The company you transfer to has no idea what your cost basis is or what the purchase date was. You should be able to update it in the site or the app, or with customer service.

But even if not, it doesn't matter. You report the real cost basis to the IRS (or your country's tax authority). Just make sure you have the paperwork to back it up.

I'm old enough to remember when brokers didn't track your cost basis at all, it was up to you to go through your past statements and report the right thing to the IRS."
2021-05-30 11:27:47,stocks,Many people have reported their cost basis fkd up after transferring. In some cases the receipt shows purchases on dates even before the customer started trading.
2021-05-30 11:23:24,stocks,[removed]
2021-05-30 18:01:26,stocks,Exactly what everyone already said. The new platform doesn't know the cost basis of the old platform so they record it at the market value on the day of transfer. You should keep the necessary statements in order to back it up with the IRS.
2021-05-30 11:28:51,stocks,"Is that normal, a discrepancy, or manipulation?"
2021-05-30 11:48:59,stocks,How would not having the cost basis be manipulation?
2021-05-30 11:29:24,stocks,I don't know.
2021-05-30 11:44:12,stocks,RH just sucks.  Reputable brokers don’t have this issue.
2021-05-30 11:51:18,stocks,"I use german brokers (because I live there) and when I transferred my depot from one bank to another one, the receiving bank changed all the prices by how much that stock was worth at that moment. The explanation is that the new bank doesn't care, at which price you bought and assumes the actual price.

That's why track all your orders with Portfolio Performance or note it somewhere down. I recommend to do that with the dividend's, taxes, etc. too."
2021-05-30 11:54:52,stocks,Maybe that’s how it works in Germany but in the US there is a FINRA rule that says Brokers have to transfer cost basis information within 14 days of a transfer to another firm.  I agree you should calculate it yourself but in this specific instance it really is that RH sucks.
2021-05-30 12:05:56,stocks,"*copying intensifies*
That is a nice rule. Wish we had it here."
2021-05-30 12:07:32,stocks,"Brokers in the US didn’t have to do it until like 2012 or so, could be off by a year.  Stocks purchased before then are actually excluded and typically don’t need to be recorded by the your broker.  Kinda confusing lol"
2021-05-30 12:33:41,stocks,Do you pay on the before 2012 bought stocks less taxes? In Germany was around 2008 a tax reform on stocks and all stocks bought before 2008 remain tax free when you sell them. So a few old people I know hold them like smaug holds his treasure.
2021-05-30 12:43:16,stocks,Pretty sure it’s the same tax rate but I am not a tax professional in anyway so really I have no idea lol.

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Next VIX Spike Estimate I was wondering if someone knows a method to estimate / guestimate the magnitude of the next VIX spike?

I have been watching [VIX, VIX9D, and VIX3M ratios](https://alphapursuits.com/what-to-do-when-stocks-go-down/) and it seems they are reaching the lower end.

Based on the historical data, this could mean VIX might spike in a near future. However, this monitoring method doesn't tell how large the spike will be."
2021-05-30 10:44:47,stocks,Rule #1 is buy protection when it’s cheap not when your panicking. Friday I bought December $24 VIX Calls. Very reasonable bet that we hit $24 by then in either the volatile month of June or September. I do this every year minus last year to hedge against these two months though this is a little high for the VIX still. I prefer the VIX to be under $20. Then I will continue to roll and add if nothing happens and if we get a big spike I close it and buy a new one that covers the volatility of post Q4 earnings in February. This strategy has saved me more times than I can count. I’m rarely without protection only when we spike I close it out. Too hard to time it so I buy it long always and let seasonality and the fact it spikes 2-3 times a year work in my favor. Of course a $12 VIX is a must buy and hold but be cautious with anything over $20 and roll and scale in your options.
2021-05-30 10:34:04,stocks,Expect a genuine correction this June… https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/jim-cramer-the-vix-is-flashing-signs-of-more-downside-in-stocks.html
2021-05-30 16:34:21,stocks,UVXY $40 call positions along with VXX VIX December!! Only long options I’m plying everything else is 1-3 weeks
2021-05-30 11:10:59,stocks,"How do you determine the VIX position size (beta weighting? Delta neutral?)? 

Do you try to buy large enough so it acts solely as protection? Or do you go larger to try profit?"
2021-05-30 15:25:53,stocks,Isn’t buying vol on vol really expensive? Wouldn’t you be better off with SPY puts?
2021-05-30 10:36:01,stocks,Did you seriously link that with your comment
2021-05-30 11:04:28,stocks,Imagine thinking Cramer speaks truth. Jimbo is a puppet
2021-05-30 12:46:03,stocks,Depends on where it’s at. Currently it’s not quite ready for a big position. So that’s why I’ll scale in over time. If market continues to rally then I trim profits and hold some cash for protection and use the rest of the profits to buy more VIX Calls. Trying to time it has been tricky over the years so I only hedge against two consistent events. A. market likes to drop after Q4 earnings and B. June and September. that being said even those aren’t consistent but selling it long is a hedge. If you want to profit off it you really gotta just gamble with short strikes on a rolling basis and be nimble. We used to do that back in the day with TVIX. Made a ton of money gambling after the monster run of 2016-2017 when I figured we would have a small drop after Q4 and Trump hammered China with tariffs. I will be gambling again as we get closer to the FED raising rates but for now it’s just protection against my long positions and I’ve closed all my short positions.
2021-05-30 16:23:27,stocks,No though I do buy SPY and QQQ Puts when they flash a Sell Signal but VIX can go up even when the market is going up. Look at the open interest on the June 16th Strikes it’s insane. Though I’m out to December because odds are we will get a spike to 24 by then.
2021-05-30 17:30:07,stocks,"In the article, Cramer talks about upcoming volatility and how the VIX could reflect that. Is that different from what everyone here basically thinks is going to happen?"
2021-05-30 16:30:56,stocks,"How do you determine a flash signal?

Fwiw, I agree that a move close to or above 24 is likely in the next 6 months"
2021-05-30 17:40:41,stocks,"I don’t trust a word Cramer says. He’s a lying, cheating, scumbag. Like 4 days before Bear Sterns went to zero in 08 he was on his network pushing people to buy Bear...

Most people that are really keyed into the market expect it to crash here soon. Vix continues to spike meaning there’s extreme volatility in the market as a whole. In addition, the FED has released almost 2Trillion in Reverse Repos in the last week at 0% interest. There’s already inflation concerns. Add another 2Trillion at 0% interest into that now. Banks are buying treasury bonds like hot cakes because they have so much excess cash (liability) for banks on the balance sheet. So banks are starting to get very overextended at the moment..."
2021-05-30 17:56:19,stocks,I personally use the CCI for buy and sell signals and the Slow Stochastics for confirmation but I’m a short term swing trader. Most of my positions minus my longs I’m Selling Covered Calls against are 1-14 days. That’s why I only did a small position because CCI has hinged in oversold but hasn’t crossed for a buy signal but it’s a hair away so when it does cross over I will add to my Calls. Plus usually after dipping into oversold it likes to flatten out for a few days in April it took 9 days to flash a Buy Signal and obviously last year it was chopping sideways for about a month twice but typically after it hits oversold it bounces shortly after but like I said Sell it out a buncha months if your looking for protection and sell it out a couple weeks if you wanna gamble.
2021-05-30 17:45:50,stocks,"Yeah same but he jumps on bandwagons from time to time.  I’m just confused because people are bashing the person that linked the article, but the article is basically what people on Reddit predict...that there is probably something big coming up."
2021-05-30 19:40:41,stocks,Thanks for that - what is the full form of CCI?

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Is one share of AMZN arguably better than 6 smaller stocks? So currently own AMD, ALLY, TGT, PEP, V, SMT (a UK ETF), IAG, DIS, AAPL, MSFT and F to the value of two AMZN shares.

The rest is VWRP (VT equivalent) so not selling that.

Looking to long hold, so aside from the diversification argument is a greater ROI in one share of AMZN over these other companies?

Can actually hold AAPL, MSFT, TGT, DIS and V and stump up the extra few hundred for a AMZN share so really it’s sell off between;

AMD, ALLY, PEP, SMT, IAG, F for one AMZN.

Only own like 2-3 shares of AMD, ALLY, PEP whilst a few more for SMT, IAG and F but only to value of about £2000 so that’s the one AMZN share price. So $3,000.

Be interesting to know of what others might do with these shares for the long hold. Either keep the current portfolio and pay into VWRP or sell off half of the value and keep AAPL, MSFT, TGT, DIS, V and buy AMZN alongside the ETF instead.

Would not want to sell any of those six but is it too tech heavy? Personally think AMZN has the ability to increase share price more over 10 years than AMD, ALLY, PEP, SMT, IAG and F can do combined. The only one of those that could increase a fair bit is AMD but only own 2 shares at a value of £110.

Thanks all for any guidance and whether it’s worth doing.

Could also add GOOGL and AMZN at one share each but then basically own the top companies in S&P alongside a global ETF which top holdings are also those same businesses.

Bullish on US and those stocks regardless so the ETF is there for the 45 per cent outside US stocks and companies."
2021-05-30 09:04:28,stocks,"I prefer diversity on anything I hold long term. I also diversify the options that I swing trade. Those smaller priced stocks that you own are good, I wouldn't let them go. Especially if you bought at all time highs. Those fees are horrible, I feel for you."
2021-05-30 04:26:47,stocks,"I can offer you an example of what could happen if you don't limit yourself to the one Amazon stock by way of Ally Financial.

I got in at 18.00 a piece and bought 100 of them at the time. All of those Ally shares are now trading 54.71. That is a much larger growth over time than what the Amazon share will afford you."
2021-05-30 07:52:50,stocks,"Does your broker allow fractional shares? If so, just slowly buy up bits and pieces of an AMZN share to get some exposure to it without touching the other stock you own."
2021-05-30 07:07:12,stocks,In my opinion it's better to diversify
2021-05-30 10:11:46,stocks,I’d stick with what you have.
2021-05-30 12:31:22,stocks,"If you can shift to a broker which does fractional share as it much better. I understand IBKR allows fractionals even for people outside US.

In that case, it is about putting a fixed amount, say 400 USD in each company, irrespective of the share price, that gives very balanced diversification even with a smaller portfolio, and you don't have to worry about such question."
2021-05-30 13:54:24,stocks,"In what fashion? As diversification obviously not. If stock price is your concern delete that from your brain. 
It's the sum that matters. 

If it throws your portfolio out of whack or you are unable to afford it. Maybe grab am ETF that has a high weighting of it until you can.

But holding 2k worth of say Visa (10) @200 and NVDA (4) @500 doesn't matter. Both right now are strong long term stocks. Stock price itself shouldn't be your focal point.

However that being said on a compression or severe market move it could accentuate it.
Also more difficult to average up or down of course as well."
2021-05-30 07:06:50,stocks,"Sure you could argue either way about it, but in the end one of these choices will factually make more money than the other and it is nearly impossible to predict which one. If people who’ve dedicated their lives to security analysis can’t tell you with any certainty which one will do better then it’s just not possible to know which will do better. It’s much more important to focus on modifying your exposure to serious potential losses than it is to focus on picking the best possible stocks. Read Nassim Taleb’s Incerto series."
2021-05-30 09:11:49,stocks,"Can you do options? If you sell puts on them, you collect a premium, which may help with fees. Then, you can choose the strike price that's lower than current market price and if/ when it hits that price, you'll get assigned the shares, maybe without fees or at lower fees if you paid fees for selling the put option."
2021-05-30 09:20:50,stocks,"Agree - holding them and increasing positions will eat some of those commissions a bit. 

So purchasing say an extra 8 shares of AMD with the fees again has a better return than being sat on two shares. So AMD is priced at 80 dollars, owning two shares at that price is 160, but you need to earn back 20 dollars worth of commission to break even, so you would want about 14 per cent increase on that price to make back the fees.

Buy an extra 8 shares however at 80 you then own 10 shares at 800, needing to earn back two lots of commission fees at 40 dollars. So you would therefore require an increase of 5 per cent opposed to 14.

There is a selling fee so it’s the same buying fee and exchange rate but long hold so can if plausible switch providers to one that lets you sell for a lower fee 30 years away from the current purchases."
2021-05-30 04:32:05,stocks,"Think it’s more the fact that I bought those six I mention recently close to ATHs.

Also only own as said about two shares of each. So 2 AMD, 2 ALLY, 2 PEP, 8 F and about 50 for IAG and SMT but regardless it’s so expensive to add regularly in the UK unless using Freetrade. Use a platform called Hargreaves Lansdown which is brilliant for use and customer service but it’s 11.95 a trade (buy and sell) plus foreign exchange rate.

So as much as I could want to say add to AMD or ALLY for instance I would only be able to add maybe one position pcm, and even then I would need to earn back about 20 dollars worth due to the fact of the commission fees and exchanges.

Therefore buying one rather pricey share in AMZN means that commission fee and exchange could be earned back relatively quickly then can long hold. 

It’s interesting though to hear what you would suggest perhaps"
2021-05-30 05:39:39,stocks,"You’re comparing a $20B company to a $2T. Of course a smaller could have ”more room to grow”, but that doesn’t guarantee it. Amazon could also be $10T in a few years.

Come up with an investment strategy with good reasoning and stick to it. Share price or market cap etc should have little to do with it."
2021-05-30 08:26:43,stocks,They do not
2021-05-30 08:10:26,stocks,Amazon does the diversity for you.
2021-05-30 08:26:57,stocks,"An extra question, would you keep those smaller stocks and then invest one stock into AMZN or distribute the $3000 into increasing positions in AMD ALLY PEP companies.

Again, would need to earn back $30 worth of commission and fees on each of those trades if put an extra $500 into each.

So instead of

AMD $160, ALLY $110, PEP $297, V $455, DIS $350 could increase those

AMD $700, ALLY $600, PEP $800, V $900, DIS $900

Typing it out it actually makes more sense..."
2021-05-30 10:17:50,stocks,Yeah the consensus is to buy into the smaller holdings more to increase positions and actually require less push of value to earn back fees.
2021-05-30 13:13:37,stocks,"Yeah fractional ideal but has to be one of the others which is one AMZN share or increase positional of six others.

Speaking to others who comment it makes more sense due to fees to increase those six than buy into one. Allows diversity and also the increase of each stock needed to break even and gain on any fees is lower. Visa even adding two shares the increase to earn back two lots of fees is 3 per cent, whereas not touching the stock would need a 10 per cent increase."
2021-05-30 15:10:32,stocks,"Yeah other comments kinda said the best would be to increase positions in the smaller shares because they’re actually okay. Shares of AMD, ALLY, PEP,  and even V or DIS if splitting the $3000 so about $600 each would mean despite having to earn back two lots of commission fees and foreign exchange costs the percentile the companies in question would need to increase by is about 6 per cent compared to about 16 per cent. It overall makes more sense to hold these stocks long as was intended, add to positions and sit on those rather than put all eggs into one AMZN basket which would actually be the highest percent of the portfolio opposed to the global ETF which is VWRP.

So you would rather invest and improve the six smaller share positions than one other?"

2021-05-30 09:30:36,stocks,"Cannot do that but appreciate the idea, think as mentioned in reply to your other message increasing the positions in the smaller positions so everything except AAPL, MSFT and perhaps TGT the others would need less of an increase percentile to break even and gain than the current holdings. Visa for instance 2 at 227, so dollar wise it’s 454. 

The commission fees and exchanges need to earn back 20 dollars. So that’s an increase of 10 per cent.

Buy 2 more at 227 so then own 4 overall value 908. Fees combined 40 dollars, so would then need V to increase percentile of about 4 per cent, a while 6 per cent less increase needed to gain value."
2021-05-30 04:37:05,stocks,"Having one stock, you are going to be at the mercy of its demand. This is besides the fact that someone probably needs to reign in Amazon for its business practices.

The name of the investment game is long-holding as big of a spread as you can. Better off (risk-wise) paying your 11.95 per trade on an SP500 fund or Technology ETF than going directly at any single stock pick.

Alot of those are great companies but when I look at risk to upside and downside I personally wouldn't hold them all

But I own V, U, NVDA, FSLY, SQ and a few others. However I don't own less than 2500$ of any stock.

Fees are an immediate loss so that is a factor for sure. Commissions are eating your investing capital. So keeping these at a minimum has a direct impact.
In lower sum portfolios trying to build diversification immediately can eat up your cash.

Let's say 10k.
Even though you are concentrated picking your top blue chips at 2k is affordable and doesn't waste capital.
Maybe increasing your holding amounts to 1k? Find a comfort amount that reduces commission spending. That is also why I only buy longterm. But certainly buying a stock 4x to reach a position size is costly. Depending on your fee amounts."
2021-05-30 09:38:03,stocks,"Yep. What may also help you is to look at daily charts on each one to see when they dip down. Some have a dip during certain hours. Like F, before the last run up, it seems that it dipped right after 10am. The biggest dips were on Tuesdays and Friday afternoons. Get each one when it's at its lowest for the day/week. I never buy on Mondays or before 10am, unless I'm expecting huge upside from weekend news. You could also set limit buys if your broker allows."

But this might be priced in. They are both worth so much and the stock price has been stagnant for 10 months or so. Also, Exxon got kicked out of the Dow last summer. Personally, I wouldn't throw all my money into Amazon or Apple. A trillion dollars company would have sounded like a bad joke not even 5 years ago.

The only reason, I would put everything into AMZN is because of the exuberance in the market that could make the stocks gain 400b in value overnight if Jassy decide to do a stock split, like what happened to apple last summer."
2021-05-30 09:24:26,stocks,"It’s a good point you make, just said to one other poster it might actually make more sense to increase the smaller positions due to fees. So 2 AMD at 80 with the fees included works at about an increase of 14 per cent to break even.

Buy an extra 8 priced at 80 for 800 worth, yes there’s a second batch of fees but to earn back the fees and gain on the stock it would only need to increase by 5 per cent not 14.

Think the right idea is to increase the smaller holdings and VWRP as that does include AMZN regardless of owning one stock instead."
2021-05-30 09:28:17,stocks,"If you're holding for years, the fees you're paying will be a non-issue for anything you buy. This is of course assuming the stocks chosen are on a healthy, upwards trajectory. Partly why I strongly suggest your VWRP over anything else."
2021-05-30 09:32:57,stocks,"Yes the one major bonus of owning VWRP with the UK platform is the fees are tiny if you pay monthly into the ETF. It’s 1.50 pcm so nearly 18 a year so that’s not even a question need to answer!

More so there’s 3k here to invest that might actually be more beneficial to increase the smaller holdings now and sit on those whilst monthly investing into VWRP as the fees are so low instead."

You being young, the normal recommendation would be to take more risk.  That is, normally people that have a long time to recoup from things going bad, are the people that should take more risk with their investments.

But from your description, this appears to be your parents money, and they are probably in the mid to late 40s.  If so, they are within about 15 years of retiring, and should not take as much risk as somebody your age.

I think the ETFs, or mutual funds, are safer bets, but realize that nothing is totally safe (seems like a lot of people think we are in a bubble that is about to pop).  I normally invested in mutual funds until recently.  This way you don't have to monitor individual stocks, how they are doing, to decide when and what to sell, and when and what to buy.

On top of my value stocks I have 2 very small positions in companies that I believe in, in the long run, but that could turn out completely worthless.(Compass pathways for their development in psychedelics and Organigram, one of the many small players in the weed business)
In general I look for companies that grow their earnings at a reasonable pace organically, in industries that I believe have a good future ( that’s why I am not too keen on oil, even though it’s not going to go away in the near future). If the company has solid management and a good price point ( which I usually determine by using a combination of P/E ratio, forecasts, analysts price targets and general risk assessment) then it’s a buy in my book.

Why do we think we can beat the markets long-term? Like... these big banks and funds didn't have armies of analysts from elite business schools for any given stock. 

I don't doubt many ppl in here are profitable, do good research and are way better investors than I am. Same time, markets seem to decouple from many rules they teached in the books the last decades and even the biggest ships can sink for reasons, we don't know yet.

Short play: the markets are getting harder to make a buck off every year. 

Correct me if I m wrong but isn't stock picking an illusion to most people in here? 
Like even if your research was right, markets still can behave irrational af. Look at tech: crazy earnings -> stocks go down. Afterwards, everyone expected this of course.

If I bought two ETFs such as MSCI ACWI + Small Caps (or let it be MSCI World and Emerging markets) and kept 15-20% cash in the account to buy in market crashes ( no dips, I'm talking when sh*t hits the fan -25 to -40%), won't I ALWAYS have the better performance after 20-30 years?

Talking about the topic, when markets go off the book, they go off your books. Being adaptive is the most profitable thing around, doesnt matter if it's out right false or stupid by the books, or everyone will downvote you, making money is only thing that matters.

So when everyone is screaming end of the world in 2020, people that invested are very well off.

When everyone is pumping gme and AMC with the most stupid, false, cult like info possible, your only question should be can you adapt and make money off it.

I made tons of money because some black guy died in America and various companies like body cam companies and black owned businesses pumped beyond reason. Don't think about politics and morality, adapt to whatever crap is happening.

For example Apple and tesla been pumping past years like mad, time after time, people been saying for years fuck etf, books, everything just yeet your portfolio in apple, the fucking thing Warren buffet even did while quoting following the books to his followers. I got in late and both of these doubled my money in few years.

If you are going to pick individual stocks, stop dreaming, stop being emotional, don't get married to anything, be adaptive, see what works these days and go with it.

This crazy market is not going to last forever for the most part(although I think the advent of commission free trades on cheap mobile smart devices combined with massive forums like reddit are forever going to change how the markets operate to some degree. I think there will always be some degree of value in trading with a short term reddit trend if you want to put the time into watching it although it won't always be quite as explosive as now) and it will again get harder to find the long term winners and to make a quick buck swinging trades.

>Am I completely stupid or are we all victims of our wish to find that unicorn, that doesn't exist after all?

Depends.

If someone knows what they're doing then I think they should by all means look for the unicorn. They absolutely do exist and more come into the market all the time. You just have to have the discipline to buy and hold, trust your research and of course have the time to sift through hundreds of tickers to find the few you want to put your money on.

If you don't have the guts to stare at some red for a while or the discipline and time to actually do the research then you should ETF invest, your returns will be much better that way than dart board investing and selling the second you see red."
2021-05-30 15:33:43,stocks,"I think the reason for this argument is the unsaid conditions when this is being discussed.

Most in this sub are adamant you can't beat the market, which is true under the unsaid assumptions that you're looking at a very long timeframe (all sources people use to back this up are based on 10 years+). I generally agree with this and have no illusions that I would be able to do better than index funds in that time frame.

However, this ignores that under certain conditions it can be very easy to beat the market in a shorter time frame (a year or less). The bounce-back and bullrun since March last year is a great example of this. In 2020 you could almost pick any tech stock at random and beat the market by a considerable amount. I made 50% in 2 months from my 1st reopening pick in January, and am expecting another 50%ish (+divies) from my current 2nd picks (currently up 20% since early April), though these ones will take a bit longer.

So in a specific year there may be lots of people that do beat the market, due to the effects of external factors, supporting the notion that you can beat the market. But when this happens it's important not to develop a false sense of confidence for when market conditions change.

This is why I'm mainly in individual stock picks atm, but will switch to index funds once my recovery plays are finished.

Tl:dr - Short term people can/do beat the market under certain conditions, long-term they don't"

But this is also setting you up for mediocre performance. I don't think everything is a crapshoot and I think that there are companies/investments that are better than others, so I pick stocks.

Yeah, mostly on luck.

There are no retail or institutional investors that outperform the market consistently longterm. There are always statistical outliers that beat the market, because there are so many people playing the market. There is no one however that does it consistently, especially not in retail.

There just is no point in stock picking except fun. It costs time and there are no gains to be made. A passive index portfolio increases your return compared to stock picking longterm and, more importantly, decreases your opportunity costs with the time spent on these things, because time is your most valuable asset that is essentially wasted on stock picking and managing such a portfolio."

They're not a majority no and I don't intend on arguing that but arguing in absolutes like this is just straight unfactual and hilariously easy to disprove your claims. If you want me to jest a little then, well, Warren Buffet and Berkshire Hathaway exists. His existence alone disproves this claim. Jokes aside though lets look at some actual data:

[Data on the topic does not find the absolute results you're claiming.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports) They don't find that no institutional investors **ever** beat the market. Not even really particularly close to that absolute 0 finding you're claiming. [15 year get worse but it still quite a few percentage points off of zero](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-very-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-financial-professionals-cant-do-it/)

Retail investors also actually tend to beat the market at better rates than professional investors do. [Here's some data on RH investors over the last few years for instance](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/robinhood-investors-are-beating-the-stock-market-and-heres-the-data-that-proves-it-2020-08-06). I've read some articles that suggest insider information limits institutional investors and retail doesn't have such blocks as a possible explanation and I personally think retail's lack of knowledge of and access to more complex and higher risk investing strategies can be a contributing factor too.

TL;DR: You can be right that most don't succeed and I won't argue with you there but it's laughably hilariously wrong to walk in trying to claim that no one ever beats the market long term or that rewards in stock picking can't be worth it.

EDIT: Also side note on your luck comment, yes luck does have some role to play(Markets are irrational) but it seems to me you don't understand a lot of the fundamental analysis behind the businesses being invested in that fuels intelligent long term stock picking. If you think it's entirely luck then yes you should probably stick to index investing entirely.

Also untrue, you can't have a 15 year trend that finds a slew of funds periodically beating the market that's not quite how the data collection works, if there truly was none that beat the market over 15 years the data would reflect that. Year 15 isn't 'well by year 15 only 5% of this random assortment beat the market on this particular year' it's 'how many funds beat the market over a 15 year trend'. and again there you go again. EDIT: Moreover if your interpretation of the data was correct you'd see more or less the same results year after year more than likely. The steady decline more supports the common knowledge that **most** cannot beat the market in the long term.

Again to jest, Warren buffet exists. Your claim is false.

>There is extensive scientific research about this topic and it is not all that controverse. There are close to zero institutionals with active funds that can beat the market consistantly over a significant period of time. And there are no retails investors that will do that longterm.

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"questions : margin account terms & how they work Hello, so I am about to sell some securities I currently own in my margin account,  I do want to preface I rarely use margin and only do so when the entire market has gone down as it recently has.  the question:

looking at my position's information let's say I have a market value of 1000$ of ABC stock and the margin requirement is 300$.  for the example, we will say my account has also used more than 1000$ of margin and I do have cash available to borrow/withdraw.  If I sell all 1000$ of ABC stock, how would it affect my cash available for withdrawing?

I am assuming I might not be supplying the correct figure to look at if so, please let me know an easy way to calculate how selling that 1000$ of ABC would affect my cash withdraw.

*all number and market references are hypothetical and should are not real representations of my account.  Any information provided by myself or others should be considered education and entertainment and never considered as advice.*"
2021-05-30 10:36:24,stocks,"You're confusing terms.

*Margin* is the portion of account assets that is yours. *Margin debt* is the portion of account assets that you borrowed.

You have not really given enough information to understand your situation.

If you have $1000 in assets you can't have $1000 in margin debt because then your margin would be $0 which is below the 30% maintenance margin requirement.

If you bought $1000 with cash and then borrowed $1000 to buy something else you must have had 0 cash left, so you are at 50% margin.

If you did have any cash, you didn't borrow $1000, and your margin is above 50%.

But that's actually irrelevant  to the question.

Selling stock always improves your margin. The proceeds from the sale are immediately applied against any margin debt."
2021-05-30 09:46:24,stocks,If you sell all of ABC your margin available will be based on your other holdings and what you're trying to buy next.  ABC's margin requirements will be irrelevant once you sell it.

Note the cash needs to settle and other positions not be affected by increased margin requirements.    
    
If you withdraw the cash you will probably be using all of your remaining margin allowance on other positions also"
2021-05-30 14:33:42,stocks,"This is a simplistic example, so dont get too caught up in it.

Compare your margin account to a checking account. Any time you take money out, in any form, it comes from the general account funds. Any time money goes into the account, in any manner, it joins the general account funds. The account does not differentiate what is a car payment, what goes to the grocery store, what came from your paycheck, etc.

When you have a margin account and you buy something or withdraw money, you withdraw from the CASH available, even though you are technically buying in a margin account. Once that portion is exhausted you begin the borrowing of margin. The account isn't going to create a margin loan if cash is available. Then when you have money coming in, from ANY source, it first goes to pay down the margin loan. They will prevent you automatically from borrowing too much, however when your collateral (stocks you own) drop in value too much, then the brokerage might demand more collateral, meaning you either put up more money or reduce your loan exposure (sell some stock to satisfy a margin call).

Hope this helps."

I'm guessing you were only throwing out figures for information moreso."
2021-05-30 16:43:40,stocks,The $ I gave arnt exact but they are close to the ratio. I’m not looking at my account right now but I believe I had about 450-550$ worth of the stock and about 180$ as the margin requirement.

As far as ""objective"" valuation goes, if you compare it to the other sports/outdoors retailers (DKS, BGFV), ASO's PE is now in the same ballpark. If you assume ASO isn't doing anything game-changing in the retail sporting goods space, that makes sense.

That being said...the working theory is that outdoors retailers experienced a boom during COVID-19 because outdoors activities weren't restricted as much, so more people went camping more often than they usually would, because of a relative lack of recreational alternatives. Look at the FY 2020 YoY comps for DKS and BGFV.

It's the same question for RV manufacturers and sales:  will the 2020 earnings increases continue or not? The forward PEs are generally larger than the ttm PEs, so at least the analysts seem to expect it not to. Whether that means the price will drop or they'll just continue to trade at a higher PE is a guess.

This company is so poorly managed and with its massive existing foot prints and infrastructure it should be dominating in its space. But it is only merely competitive. I don’t think it’s a value stock, volatility is basically non existent, and the company is so poorly ran it’s unbelievable."
2021-05-30 09:39:50,stocks,"It’s weird the hive mind on here. This is exactly the deal T needed to make and the new company will be a growth player. There’s no logic to the stock trading below where it was when the sum of the parts will be worth more coming out of this. It’s mostly dividend investors feeling burnt that the dividend is getting cut while ignoring that they’ll be getting stock in a new growing company. 

I’d go with DISCA as the smaller company usually benefits more in a merger like this and sentiment is more on their side."
2021-05-30 09:02:43,stocks,"They both have pretty huge debt loads and if you look at the competitors for either one they have been adding on a lot of debt to be able to compete something neither ATT or Discover will be able to do much of because of how much debt they already have, just something to keep in mind."
2021-05-30 10:08:26,stocks,"They both have horrid management, VIAC is prolly a better bet"
2021-05-30 08:26:01,stocks,"Neither. ATT management makes dumb decicions 1 after another. This Warenr-discovery deal is just windowdressing its mistake. they want to get rid of warner but they basicly buy discovery with it, setting up another debacle. Discovery's content is horrible and disgusting and has basicly no vallue because it is extremely easy to replicate. The fact that Discovery management is going to manage it makes everything worse. Tribal warfare is going to happen at the top and Zaslav is going to rip the company apart sell it off and destroy the whole company so he can get a massive salary (he makes $150M at discovery already). So no the best thing for everyone is just to release Warner back in to the market with no merger."
2021-05-30 01:15:37,stocks,Neither
2021-05-30 05:32:07,stocks,"Neither, go for T mobile, Buffet bought at 120 and this is a type of cash flow business he is quite aware of"
2021-05-30 13:35:22,stocks,"Both GE and T blew 100’s of billions in horrible deals. Billions in commissions and legal fees. GE is barely getting out of it, but T has a long way to go. The day GE cut its dividends, the stock tanked. The day T dividends cut takes effect the stock will tank."

2021-05-30 00:28:51,stocks,"I agree with some of what you are saying but I guess what I’m asking is - if this new company can be a competitor against Disney plus and Netflix just given the size of its content library and what they are saying they are going to spend on content does it make sense to buy AT&T shares, discovery shares or wait for the new shares in the company?  Is this potentially a scenario where being an AT&T or discovery share holder is tantamount to being an early investor in a new company before it goes IPO?"
2021-05-30 10:29:14,stocks,Did you say.their isnt foing to be a dividend anymore?
2021-05-30 09:51:44,stocks,"growing company? discovery management is going to destroy the new company, have you ever seen the content discovery makes? They cannot combine the services because HBO MAX + warner Bros has all the good stuff and then combining it with the trash of tlc an animal planet will not make it better"
2021-05-30 09:50:50,stocks,I think this is my sentiment as well.  Not that it can’t happen but I don’t see how the stocks could trade much lower and would think that besides better returns from other companies the downside seems pretty minimal to both stocks and there’s potential growth in both AT&T and the new company after the deal is complete.  I appreciate your point about the smaller company benefiting more from these type of deals.
2021-05-30 07:30:26,stocks,Buffett holds $9B of Verizon and less than $1B of T-Mobile.
2021-05-30 01:12:25,stocks,"I bought into T recently (before the merger spinoff news) and plan on holding.

The new discovery/tw spinoff will be pretty interesting. 
I believe they are positioned well to take part in the streaming “wars” against netflix and disney.
Amazons purchase of mgm will make things interesting within that space but i like the discovery/tw spinoffs positioning better.

As far as increasing your position, i would wait till the terms of the deal become more clear.

I like that T is spinning off tw, i believe it will unlock value as a standalone company. Also like them cutting back their dividends to focus on their debt.

I am expecting a +4% yield, which will make it attractive vs a lot of other companies. Paying down their debt will increase their equity, so thats a major win."
2021-05-30 00:33:40,stocks,"I don’t think the new company will be a competitor to those platforms, so the rest of the question is not applicable."
2021-05-30 10:30:10,stocks,"Their cutting it, but they will still pay"
2021-05-30 09:56:54,stocks,I agree that Discovery content is not all that great and HBO max is what most consumers want.  The argument some would make is that HBO max does not have a great international audience and discovery does and this would be a means to increase subscribers domestic and abroad by sweetening the deal when someone is looking into a streaming service.
2021-05-30 07:32:31,stocks,True but he bought more recently T-Mobile.
2021-05-30 03:09:12,stocks,"I am pretty much in this same position and agree with this.

I think the new company will be well positioned in the streaming wars. This marketplace is ripe for consolidation, because consumers only have an appetite for buying into a few services, yet want access to wide types of content. Companies that can provide a large variety of content will do well at attracting consumers.

Bundled products will also do a good job of getting a few extra dollars/month from consumers on the monthly premium. What I am not sure about yet is how well these companies can offer tiered services successfully in a consolidated market with 3 or 4 main players. This will be key for making sure they can get consumers willing to pay more, to pay more, while marketing cheaper rates to the masses. It will be interesting to see how they market HBO.

Together this company will also have good negotiating power with existing with existing cable services in agreements to carry their channels and they will have substantial access to broadcast television via CBS and CW. It is possible, they might actually have the power to change how existing cable services operate and have some sort of streaming app integration.

Their media properties will include: Warner Bros. Film, DC Entertainment, HBO, Cinemax, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Cartoon Network, TCM, Boomerand, ViacomCBS, CNN, Turner Sports, and 50% of the CW Network, Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, Science Channel, TLC, 14 other smaller cable channels, and other media rights.

&#x200B;

As for T, post spinoff, they need to invest more in the 5G network. If they don't, they will be be exposed to losing consumers to competition.  What I'm still not sure about/curious about, is if the widescale 5G adoption can lead to more revenue by consumers wanting to directly connect more devices (ie. watches, cars, tracking, laptops, industrial uses \[logistics tracking, delivery vehicles, watching after remote employees, etc..\]).

This will be key in whether AT&T is just upgrading their networks to maintain customers or whether the investment can actually lead to sizeable increases in revenue for the money they put into the new network.

I don't believe we know the answers to this question yet. Most of the 5G network so far are the low-bands, which is closer to being an upgrade of existing 4G infrastructure and can work over larger distances. It is the mid and high bands that will offer the high speeds, higher device loads, and more overall bandwidth over shorter areas that still needs to largely be constructed. It is also this latter part of the 5G network that might open up more uses and more consumers beyond smartphones."
2021-05-30 01:46:19,stocks,I 100% agree with what you're saying. I just think paying down debt when debt is cheap is dumb. The leadership has done a few fast and questionable things recently. That may turn out to be a good thing to grow the company over all though.
2021-05-30 12:19:37,stocks,"A better bet on content wars is Viacom CBS which has one of the largest content libraries out there. That amount of content alone makes them a juicy acquisition target. Why buy something where the acquisition is already announced when you can buy something that almost certainly will get bought up and expose yourself to the potential upside?

VIAC over Discovery all day IMO."

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Apple’s massive success with CarPlay paves the way for automotive ambitions. 'Apple introduced CarPlay in 2014 as a way to integrate the iPhone and a car’s dashboard. Since then, it’s become ubiquitous in new cars.

Around the world, over 80% of new cars sold support CarPlay, Apple said last year. That works out to about 600 new models, including cars from Volkswagen, BMW, and Chrysler. Toyota, one of the longest holdouts, started including CarPlay in 2019 models.

It’s also a top feature for many drivers and car buyers. Twenty-three percent of new car buyers in the U.S. say they “must have” CarPlay and 56% percent are “interested” in having CarPlay when buying a new vehicle, according to a 2017 Strategy Analytics study. When Ford’s highly anticipated electric F-150 goes on sale, it will support CarPlay.

Apple was able to insert itself in between customers and car companies and make sure that its interface was the one that every iPhone user wants while driving. It’s an under-appreciated triumph for one of the world’s most successful companies. CarPlay doesn’t contribute direct Apple revenues or profits. But it ensures ongoing loyalty of iPhone users and gives Apple a pathway into the auto industry if it wants to expand.'

2021-05-29 22:56:49,stocks,"Full disclosure I own AAPL shares.  The first 'real' smartphone I purchased was an Iphone... simply because I'd been buying songs via iTunes and wanted to keep my music with me (and it looked cool).

So fast forward to 2021 and I've never had anything other than an iPhone... + my Airpods + my Homepods + my Apple TV + my iPad + my Mac.  And gladly so, because it just all works together so well.  

And I'm certainly not alone.  AAPL's loyalty once in the ecosystem is very strong.  And why I'm very bullish in AAPL's future, particularly once it starts increasing its automotive role/presence."
2021-05-30 11:12:24,stocks,"I still find CarPlay to be a frustrating experience. I don’t have anywhere near the same amount of issues with Android auto that I do with CarPlay. I like it, and I don’t want my next car to be without it, but it needs updates."
2021-05-30 06:56:20,stocks,"My problem with apple going into the car business is that as a shareholder i dont want it. It requires massive investment and the car industry has low margins and is very competitive, its not a cash making machine. 

I think the play for apple is to keep developing CarPlay and other similar software products"
2021-05-30 16:26:14,stocks,"Just remember that carplay is not a moat. Android Auto (which I'm currently using) is doing everything I wanted. It has voice recognition, google maps, texting by voice, everything you could want, really. I imagine carplay with Siri is just the same. Car manufacturers sell them as a single package.

Following the ""Kano Model"" this feature went from exciters to standard. Any mobile OS not supporting this would be at a disadvantage.

Hence, what it does now is simply not giving arguments to iphone users to switch to android, because the carplay does the same thing as android auto.

VW group (vw, skoda, audi, seat, etc.) dashboards all support both. Even Toyota went forward with implementation, because they were at a disadvantage. At this point 'connecting phone to car' is no longer a big thing."
2021-05-29 23:49:54,stocks,"I bought a used 2019 Chevy truck last year from Hertz last year right after they went bankrupt.  A major part of why I bought a newer vehicle was because I wanted something with car play.

Needless to say, I am a case example of your analysis.  Car play makes my life on the road far easier and safer."

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"What's the hype of going EV. I get the EV is the future. I love that car makers are finally going more and more EV. Moving cars to electric will make it easier to make them to use green energy as the power grid hopefully goes more green over time. My question is- why are their stock prices going up when they announce they are going EV? Everyone's going EV and to me it seems more like a requirement to stay relevant and not a sign of bullishness. I have a Kia Spectra from the 2000s- and the reason I'm not getting a new car is not because they arnt EV- It's because I don't need a new car yet (or a new used car let's be real here). That's a personal example but regardless- I don't think going EV is going to increase the demand for cars overall. People need cars when they need cars- EV isn't going to speed up the process. This is my besr case on EV I guess. I've been considering buying long term puts on Ford this past week but I never buy puts- I don't like rooting for failure (joke... kinda) 

Am I missing something? 

Position: I don't own a single car manufacturer stock outside of one's in mutual funds/etfs."
2021-05-29 21:18:30,stocks,Because of EV tax credits and government incentives.
2021-05-29 21:12:13,stocks,"I have the same question.  My only question is will people buy more often (maybe not a ton more, but like think of all the 20 year old cars out there.  Will the current EVs last 20 years?  Would someone even want them to?).

As a driver of older cars with zero payments I wonder if this will even be a thing in the future because we will need to upgrade more often.

Or will electric motors be more low maintenance and keep on going?  

I dunno..."
2021-05-30 00:34:40,stocks,"I think the problem is the price of Ford could've been low as investors were too afraid they were behind in a disruptive emerging technology that was a long-term threat to their profitability and well... their existence. 

Now that they have shown public signs they haven't ignored it and have answer for it, investors see less risk of disruption from new competition in the future. So Ford is now more of a viable long-term investment that might survive this impending technological disruption.

This is particularly noteworthy, because they've been behind the curve in EV. General Motors Chevrolet brand alone captures nearly 10% of the US EV market. Ford only had 2.5%.

Now that EV car sales is nearing 3% of all vehicles sold in the US and trajectory for prices to keep decreasing, signals of batteries getting cheaper and better, and large scale battery suppliers have made sizeable factory investments EV car sales are likely to be far larger than they are in about 5-10 years.

This means if an existing car company isn't ready for the change, they are at risk at losing market share and profitability.

One last thing, I think the fact they are doing this with the F-150 is extremely note-worthy. It's not just small, compact lightweight car. If they can pull off a good EV car with one of their best known vehicles that large and that mainstream, it says good things about their ability to survive 5, 10, or 15 years....

I suspect F-150 Lighting sales will be low, relative to their normal F-150 sales. It will likely still be too expensive for most consumers to adopt it. The important thing is that Ford can keep up and execute. Once battery prices come down from 3rd party manufacturers, they they are creating partnerships with, they need to be ready when EV cars are cheaper."
2021-05-29 22:11:50,stocks,"It doesn't seem far fetched to me. If US yearly vehicle sales are 19,000,000 units (they are) and the average new car/suv price is $40,000 then that is $760,000,000,000 of sales in the US per year. Just the USA. If the world is transitioning to EV, it might or might not, then there probably is room for current market caps of vehicle producers."
2021-05-29 21:29:41,stocks,"Most existing car manufacturers will try to transition to EVs. A few will likely fail in their attempt, some simply because they wait too long to start. When current automakers make meaningful EV-related announcements, it makes it that much less likely that they'll fail from inaction. It give shareholders more confidence in future revenue. With that increased confidence about the future comes an increase in the share price."

Put on top of the performance a car that will have at least some assisted driving & be better for the planet... well that's really the future.  And the fact that the legacy automakers are rapidly adopting that as their future core competency ensures that they'll still be players and possibly a new better life than they've had before with ICE.

This may read like I'm a TSLA head, but I'm not.  I actually held like 15 shares til it hit mid-400s then sold as I truly believed even back then the shares were overpriced.  Just acknowledging that EV is absolutely the future and one that I'm ready for."

2021-05-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Consider yourself an INVESTOR? Imagine the ""sell"" button doesn't exist for 5 years. If you want to swing trade, try to cash out on short squeezes, whatever, then fine: You do you. Otherwise, if you actually want to *invest*, then let me give you a trick to help you approach the market correctly...

**Imagine that the ""sell"" button is greyed out until a security is held for 5 years.**

* You'll be holding this for 5+ years, so the time and effort spent on research and DD is fully justified.
* You won't be ""missing out"" if you buy it tomorrow, or next week, or whenever you fully understand it and feel ready to commit.
* It's worth the commitment, so it's completely reasonable to increase your position gradually over time (DCA).
* Market dips are lame, but who cares? It's not the 5d chart, it's the 5y -- and it's a 5y chart that has yet to be drawn.

**There are only three situations in which the ""sell"" button becomes available.**

* During your research, you find something that makes you lose faith in the security (e.g., you discover something that makes you doubt the company's leadership during an earnings report).
* You discover a competing security that you wish you would have known about previously. In this case, *roll your investment over*.
* You absolutely, positively need the money for an emergency. You should have enough money on hand to be able to weather a storm, but there are some extraneous circumstances where you absolutely must liquidate investments. (If this happens more than once, it's a sign that you do not have a sufficient emergency fund.)

The spirit of the post, imo, is that you should expand your time preference, due your DD, and weather the short term cycles for maximum gains.

I think this is pretty solid advice. You don't say to be stupid about things (ie holding bullshit).

2021-05-29 21:20:25,stocks,"I don’t carry an emergency fund, nor have I had one in the last 12-15 years. It all goes into the market. If I need cash, I’ll sell to raise the cash I need. The opportunity cost of leaving five to six figures in cash doesn’t make sense to me

If other people want to keep their emergency funds in the bank, that’s their prerogative. But having invested for the long term, even if I had an emergency, job loss, etc at the exact bottom of the market last year, it still would have made greater sense for me personally to have been invested in the market all this time than to have held cash

Maybe it’s appropriate for someone just getting started, but to tell someone to keep 3, 6, 9 months worth of expenses in cash before investing will only cause people to put off starting their snowball for an unnecessarily long time. 

All of this is my opinion. 

New investors: do your research and determine what you feel most comfortable with, recognizing that stocks aren’t a rocket ship, just as they go up, they can come back down. There is always a very real possibility of taking a 30-50% haircut in the short term. And yes, if that occurs the economy will likely be having issues and jobs will be getting lost. 

But should that threat cause you to put off getting started on investing for the time it takes for you to build that buffer? I think for most new investors the answer is probably no, quite honestly."

Now, there are those companies that payback through stock buybacks.  I would consider VMW ($VMW) for that.

I have a dear friend who is a whizz at true buy-and-hold investing.  He insists on financially sound companies that pay at least 2%.  Using his style, I would look at:

* Hormel Foods ($HRL)

2021-05-30 10:20:59,stocks,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.

How to use it?

1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.
2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).
3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line
4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line
5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line
6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).

You can see example entries here: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/)

This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!

This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them

This should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).

If you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media. Just do your thing."

This only makes sense if a stock grew beyond your expectation, if it grew too fast and the valuation had become unreasonably rich or if it grew so much that you are no longer comfortable with the size it holds within your portfolio."

Another thing to consider is HELOC and lines of credit (including credit cards) can be cut or closed without notice. Oftentimes in history you'll find this happens during extreme uncertainty. It happened in March 2020 as well. You can't rely on credit as a stopgap before tapping into your brokerage. 

I keep our emergency fund in 3% APY checking accounts or for bank bonus churning. Combined return easily 5-7%. It's not entirely passive but it's also risk-free and FDIC insured.

**That's my entire point.**

If I don't have enough faith in a company to deliver on a 5-year roadmap, then it's a trash investment. (I defined an opportunity to get out if the company demonstrates a lack of capabilities in this regard.)

Think of the big FAANGs. If someone buys Apple with the intention of holding it for 5+ years, do you *really* consider that a dice roll? What about the company makes such a decision seem anything other than one of the safest ""bets"" you could place?

Why not approach any other *investment* the same way, regardless of market cap?

But for investors just starting out, for many the idea of even investing their money is a paradigm shift. Many aren't people who have been saving cash for years and finally decide to enter the market. They are people who have finally decided to start investing for their future, who come up with money to invest by forgoing immediate consumption. The ""extra"" money wasn't going into savings, it was being spent as it was earned.

For those people, embarking on their investing without that initial cash buffer STILL winds them up in a better position should calamity occur and they find themselves without a job with the market falling to recent lows. Had they not begun investing, the money would have been spent. Instead, because they began investing, they have something to fall back on. True, it wouldn't be as much as if they'ed put it to savings, but it's still more than they would have if they had continued the course of spend it as you get it/immediate gratification.

For those people, I will stand by my thought that if they've finally had the mind shift that caused them to want to start investing, they should just go ahead and do it, not delay that just so they can build up a cash reserve prior to doing so."

Every story that I've seen has to do with:

* A spec/hype play
* Overvalued securities

99% of these situations could have been prevented by proper research.

Think Nikola: Maybe it was a valid investment in the early days. But if someone is doing research and truly understands the company, it would have become apparent that this company was not delivering on their promises -- which I specifically called out as a valid reason to sell.

Or Tesla: Arguably a completely valid investment, with the right leadership and ability to deliver on the roadmap. But is the valuation fair? If one is willing to invest for 5 years, then reading a balance sheet, reviewing fundamentals, and considering the proper valuation of a company would answer the question of whether it's wise to buy at a certain price.

Maybe it doesn't work for you, because you were taught from memes and shit. But I taught myself from reading books and attending Capital Markets and Finance classes online.

The draw downs are brutal for you, not for me. You guys are all crying about your losses while worshiping some lucky dumbfuck that timed the market pump and dump accidentally, while Ive been making steady gains not giving a shit. You all downvote my advice when I decide to give it. But I don't give the slightest fuck how much I am downvoted by morons, when I am making sizeable gains.

2021-05-30 09:34:23,stocks,"That’s how I got started. I’d dabbled with investing prior to 2007, but 2007 was when I really got started. I worked for a firm that was helped manage client assets so I kept seeing everyone’s account statements with 7-8 figure account balances. What really got me was their cost basis. Like you’d see a position in XOM with a balance of 100,000 and the basis was in 3-4 digits. That convinced me to get started. My boss was actually like, don’t - build up your savings account before you start investing, but I disregarded that entirely and embarked on investing just as the market was crashing. 

I did have the confidence that my job would be OK, so that helped. But paycheck after paycheck the market kept going lower and lower, and so I was losing and losing. I just kept telling myself if the financial world collapses, it won’t matter if I kept it safe in cash or bought stocks, but if it wasn’t the end of the world and things got better, this was the opportunity of a lifetime. 

No regrets disregarding my boss on that.

Just last year I managed to get a 300% returns on 9 tickers which is complexly ridiculous.

Yes, you are wrong, and I will detail how and why you are wrong below. If you want a general idea of the full history that led up to this event there is a nice timeline going all the way to 2013 that details major events. It sounds like you know little about this event except maybe the recent rise in late 2020 and 2021. I'll give you a brief history of the most important events that you may be missing but know that the website I link below gives much more detail. Timeline of Gamestop major events since 2013: [https://gmetimeline.com/](https://gmetimeline.com/)

**Overall:**

A rise in the stock's price to $20 and even $40 in 2021 was very predictable. Anything higher you can quite easily argue is future prospect speculation+media+retail. I will not debate that.

**2016-2020:**

**Bear thesis:**

Gamestop has been struggling with losing sales to Amazon, and online/digital video game purchases. Their cash flow and profits decrease each year until 2020 when they actually began to have losses instead of profits.

**Bull thesis:**

Other than used game sales, Gamestop makes the most revenue, profits, and has the highest margins on new gaming consoles. New consoles (Xbox+Playstation) are being released in late 2020 which will cause a large rise in Gamestop's downtrending profits. Additionally, the new consoles will still have slots for physical games which Microsoft and Sony point out: ""Customers still want to physically own games. A lot has gone digital but people still want to physically own their favorites.""

Melvin Capital continuously profits by buying tens of millions of $ worth of Put contracts on Gamestop--betting the stock will decrease in value. They are also shorting the stock but by how much ($1 mil, $50 mil?) nobody really knows because short positions are not required to be reported. One of the largest bets is that Gamestop will not be able to payoff its bonds that are coming due in Q1 of 2021. Failure to pay those bonds would result in bankruptcy.

**Late 2018:**

Dr. Burry invested $7 million into Gamestop paying an average of $10-$15 per share. This is public knowledge anyone can find on his firm's 13f filing. This draws attention as Dr. Burry predicted the housing market bubble in 2008 which very few others saw coming and thought he was insane to bet on but profited his firm millions.

**2019:**

* Dr. Burry increases his stake in GME over the course of the year by \~$20 million and urges the company to do a stock buyback while the shares were under $4.
* Gamestop buys back \~$115 mil worth of stock are \~$5. Melvin Capital continues to buy increasing amounts of Puts.
* DFV posts that he spent $50,000 in stock and call options GME to the WSB subreddit. His post is ridiculed with comments such as ""You bought calls on a company that is almost totally irrelevant in the gaming industry and that conducts most of their business in store."" He continues to provide monthly updates on his position; none of his posts receive more than 100 upvotes and people keep telling him to cash out with the gains he already made.

**2020:**

* The Pandemic hits; Gamestop remains open as they have claimed they are an essential business that can provide hardware for employees working from home.
* Gamestop hits a new low of $2.57 a share.
* Dr. Burry buys another $10 mil of stock--he later then takes some profits by selling \~$15 mil of shares when Gamestop returns to $5.
* Melvin Capital continues to buy million of $ worth of puts.
* GME's 6.75% bonds that were due in 2021 are successfully converted to 10% bonds due 2023. This buys them time (at a higher interest rate) to return to profitability and almost eliminates any possibility of bankruptcy in 2021. Uh oh, looks like the original bear thesis is no longer holding...
* Ryan Cohen, founder of Chewy.com (online pet retailer worth \~$30 bil), buys \~10% of the outstanding GME shares and claims he can transform it into a more digital store.
* Cohen buys another 3% of the outstanding shares later the same year.
* Dr. Burry takes some more profits, selling around half his stake around $10, and closing out the position entirely when Gamestop nears $20 per share.
* Gamestop closes \~500 of their least profitable stores.
* Melvin Capital doubles down on their Put position (and perhaps their short position but again this is speculation).

**Late 2020-2021:**

The media madness, WSB craziness, tweets from celebrities, retail investing, trade halting, cause a massive short squeeze and large 'cult following' for GME among other stocks that squeezed up during the same event (such as AMC, among others). A lot of this is hype but has actually driven more customers and attention to Gamestop than could have ever been predicted years prior. 

Anytime I buy something gaming related I now look to see if I can do it through Gamestop first rather than Amazon or digitally (via Steam/Nintendo/etc.). I have spent over $500 there in 2021 which, if not for these crazy events, I would have spent $0 there this year. Many others have done the same."

I took a €60K loan in feb. 2020, and I was able to get to around €240K by the end of the year. I took out €100K to repay the loan and finish paying a mortgate for a house I have in Mazatlán, México. I'm left with €140K.

I have Realty Income, New York Mortgage Trust, AMD, Intel, Microsoft, Amazon, Good RX, Walmart and some MSCI All World ETF. I have sold all penny stocks I ever owned, and also most of the AMZN.

I was wondering if I could just sell the individual shares and just buy the ETF. I'm not planning to use that money anytime soon, or ever. I'm happy with the dividends from the REITs, I get around €800 monthly after taxes. I make a low 6 figure salary in Europe as software developer for one of the previously mentioned companies and they also give me stock options periodically.

2021-05-29 20:31:53,stocks,"You could simply buy shares of SPY and sell covered calls, or if you're into more advanced stuff, you could mimic the exact same thing, but on SPX, buying a 1 delta call, and selling weekly covered calls to make a decent income. I think SPY covered calls are far safer, since you're actually holding shares, but SPX has better tax treatment. You can make a nice income, and aim to buy your shares back lower than the price you sold them for. Rinse and repeat."
2021-05-29 20:19:39,stocks,"Not really, I just saw a video and trusted it.

It says that in the last 20 years we've had 7 pandemics and the markets have always reacted the same, with a steep drop at first and the rising above previous levels. 

It recommended not selling anything, and just waiting, but I figured if it was probably going to bounce back, I might as well dump the cash there.

I'm thinking about starting a family to keep me grounded and useful.

2021-05-30 15:30:33,stocks,I wouldn’t be where I am without family. When I got sick with Lyme disease I might have given up without mouths to feed. While I enjoy financial independence there’s more to life such as God and family. I’m never alone nor do I feel like I have no purpose. Sounds like you need to do some soul searching. Best of luck!
2021-05-29 22:17:49,stocks,Take on a new degree once you lock in a guaranteed safety net.
2021-05-29 20:49:42,stocks,"No need to panic, my friend. You had extraordinarily great luck. This is a big accomplishment and you should be very pleased with the results.

I’m a huge nerd and only invest in things I understand and fully support. for example, Delta  Airlines. I understand their business model and what they are looking to do in their industry and their potential. On the contrary, I understand certain companies have great potential, but I don’t understand how they are moving in the market nor their business model, so I stay away from investing in them because I won’t be interested in their advancements as a company. 

However, I’m an even bigger nerd and will disclose that most of my funds go into safety nets for long term investments; Growth, growth and income, aggressive growth and international."
2021-05-30 03:29:11,stocks,Just set new goals and work toward them. Goals on the future are way better to work toward than debt of the past.
2021-05-29 20:43:56,stocks,"I thought Degiro does allow options trading? Unless you're 21, you can't trade options on IB either. In fact, you're pretty much restricted to buying shares on IB as an U21."
2021-05-29 20:34:36,stocks,"Yeah, don't risk or spend what you don't have. The absolut best advice you can take. Also don't spend in what you don't absolutely need.

I took a 7 year loan, with a 2% interest (reduced interest due to good credit), I figured I could pay the loan with my salary even if the market went negative, so I was basically asking my future self for a loan.

Some risk is needed though, I've noticed that when I owe, I have the drive to keep going a little further to repay my debt. I think it's like how they say a little inflation is always good to avoid stagnation."
2021-05-30 18:34:59,stocks,"* advanced investors should note * the average S&P performs at 7-11% over last 8 decades, and margin rates range from 1-3%, and interest rates are at all time lows

2021-05-30 18:05:46,stocks,"You're right. I just think I've gotten used to working under pressure that I don't perform well without some form of stress. I need some kind of meditation, religion or something in my life. Best of luck to you and your family as well."
2021-05-30 18:07:30,stocks,"A degree like a career? Because I've wanted that for some time... I never finished university and I know my dad wanted me to, so it's not a bad idea. I don't know how much time I have left with my parents."
2021-05-30 18:39:44,stocks,"Extraordinary great luck that Vaccines rolled out; and the global economy recovered.

2021-05-29 20:54:37,stocks,"Great, I also have some precious metals ETF and Physical Gold ETF. I'm thinking about rotating from those to airlines and cruises. Is it a good time now? Gold is high so I'm eager to sell if it diversifies my portfolio. That's why I asked about selling everything and going pure MSCI all world ETF. I do enjoy picking stocks, I've learnt to do DCF, NAV, etc valuations so I'm having fun learning the ropes, but the ETFs were a no-brainer."
2021-05-29 20:46:21,stocks,"In DeGiro yu can buy European options, but not US securities. You can't short US securities either."
2021-05-30 18:37:40,stocks,"Good on you. 

Black swan events are rare. 

Be greedy when others are fearful. 

Take advantage of cheap credit. 

Everything comes with risk, and you managed to take advantage of some of the lowest risk highest reward scenarios that comes maybe once a decade."
2021-05-29 22:40:19,stocks,"Eh, airlines we remarkably low when you initially jumped in the market. Now, they are almost healed. I’m not too sure if now is the best time to jump in, but I am hoping delta airlines will be taking a decent jump this next quarter with their soon-to-be-record sales."

I call it “brovesting.” These channels are starting to flourish, and while I’m all for increased participation by non-professionals, YOLO’ers, and all other amateurs, I think some of them do more harm than good. It’s a lot like the flood of half-assed nutritional and fitness guys offering broscience on YT. These financial bros I’m not sure are a great help to educating folks new to this movement."
2021-05-29 20:08:14,stocks,I can make shitty decisions on my own thank you very much.
2021-05-29 21:06:39,stocks,"Exactly, also the amount of people on Twitter and also on this sub trying to sell people their ""exclusive"" analyses and perfect trading stragies with subscriptions to their websites is ridiculous. I've seen several ""famous"" traders just post tweets about stocks they think that are going to take off in the Morning and then delete the ones that turned out to be red. People are so gullible."
2021-05-29 20:40:18,stocks,All we can do is like the good videos and steer clear of the shit ones. There's a few content creators on YT who are really good and I try to avoid the brovestors

It's exactly the same among history YouTubers. A lot of people enjoy their content, but if you probe into what they say, a lot of them only have surface level knowledge. Sometimes they are blatantly incorrect about a topic or misrepresent history massively.

It's also a problem of the viewership. Some people just genuinely have no capacity to discern what is a qualified channel and what isn't. MeetKevin sells stock buying courses apparently - presumably it's just a guide on how to physically buy Tesla stock"
2021-05-29 20:06:24,stocks,"I'm a professional photographer. No YT channel. There are a million brotographer channels - either guy buys a camera and decides he wants to make a channel ""teaching"" people (which are all the lessons that he just learned from someone else's channel) or someone just really wants to be an ""influencer"", so they pick a niche and start a channel. Photography, dog training, trading... doesn't matter. Most YouTubers are wannabe YouTubers... and not really what it is that they do trading and cameras are secondary to their aspirations."

He of course had to divide the interest by 12 and multiple the compounding periods by 12. He did neither resulting in 100s of trillions in extra gains. 

The video had 80K views and 2k+ likes. 

Just terrible information."
2021-05-30 03:45:02,stocks,14 year bull market is bound to make a lot of people think they are experts. Let's see how many are standing after the market moves sideways or down for 3 years straight. Ignore the bros. Keep your head down and focus on your own portfolio.

Admittedly, I’ve only watched two YouTubers that talk about a couple of stocks I’m invested in—but what’s the difference between their DD (with a shit ton of views and likes) and the average Reddit stock thread (with a shit ton of upvotes and awards)? What’s the supposed bar or standard?

There was a time not so long ago where a lot of folks thought DFV was probably full of shit."
2021-05-30 10:48:45,stocks,Traveling Trader is definitely the best on YouTube. He makes fun of the YT gurus and keeps it real with his audience
2021-05-30 13:59:47,stocks,I couldn't agree more.  Just because someone has 75k followers doesn't mean they know the difference between AdA & Add. They just want clicks for money.  Be careful who you trust and what's in it for them. Not financial advice because i just pick coins and tokens by cool names. No due diligence or concerns if they have a usable project.
2021-05-30 14:40:26,stocks,Only suckers listen to these guys
2021-05-30 15:54:30,stocks,Same and it’s sad cause many new investors will spout what these people say but won’t do the time to watch an actual stock analysis from a solid channel.

2021-05-30 16:55:31,stocks,"My speculative $0.02, the reason you're seeing these now is the same reason r/wallstreetbets saw spam posts about dozens of different penny stocks and ""meme"" stocks back in December, January and beyond.

IMO, the same media companies hired by these billion dollar hedge funds that influence Main Stream Media and the boomer crowd, (no offense) are now doing likewise with younger generations that don't subscribe to cable tv.  Especially now when the GameStop saga continues to grow in popularity and intensity, there are specific HF's out there that would benefit greatly from diverting as much buying pressure as possible away from GME.  In fact, their very survival depends on it.

They've been most successful so far advertising a certain movie theater stock but it is not enough.  They know ppl in general like to diversify so here we are with these young social media influencers pretending to know what they're talking about and pushing specific stocks.  Personally, I fully expect they are pushing only those stocks that these Short HF's have positions in and can easily manipulate.  This trend may alleviate largely once GME causes an actual margin call with the involved hedge funds and they are subsequently bankrupted.  

I suspect other hedge funds will keep the trend going just as they do with MSM, in order to profit easier from manipulating the public into those specific securities they want to control in their favor."
2021-05-29 21:19:30,stocks,Kinda late but “thepopularinvestor” is a great channel that dives deep into growth and value stocks

2021-05-29 22:04:29,stocks,These stock picking channels popping up have gotten really bad over the past year. There’s a good channel called Everything Money that I’ve been watching and they focus on value investing. Really good job analyzing stocks. They’ve started reviewing videos from some of those stock picking YT channels and they basically tear them apart. It’s entertaining and eye opening.

2021-05-29 22:25:07,stocks,Watch Everything Money on YouTube. Very interesting approach to value investing. The main is a bit full of himself and has a bit of a Napoleon complex but the c content is excellent.

2021-05-30 12:14:04,stocks,"Where do you think gains come from? Someone has to lose money in order for another to make it. This is a cutthroat way to make a living, and any fool willing to trust some bro on YouTube opening up with “I used to work 9-5 for minimum wage; now I make $20k a month using techniques ANYONE can use,” deserves to lose a little money. Cut the crybaby bullshit and understand that the meek must learn the hard way like  many of us have, and there’s no better way to learn than to LOSE."

Its a fun hobby for me, if i wanna be a ""big youtuber"" ""influencer"" i wouldnt choose photography route as the competition is too fierce and not many top reviewers have over 1 million subs so its a lot of work for not much reward comparing to other industries."

Depending how long you are willing to wait for the stocks to move, there is always one of the portfolios in the plus, but none of them is a huge all star. Its mostly a mixed bag, which needs care, decisions and management. Personal skills. market experience and luck plays way more into trading success, then this whole fun thing *becomes work*. Work that needs to bring in financial results better than the regular job plus possible extra hours."

What the fuck did you smoke? Ofc the market will dip at some point. The market cnnot go only up indefinitely (only in the long run, like a decade or two).

The fact that there are people like you who have become so delusional they think it can only go up in the short to mid term makes me think another crash is imminent, something something ""sell your stocks if your taci driver startd talking about them"""
2021-05-29 23:04:39,stocks,"He's great. No BS with his channel. Too much focus on dividends though for my taste. Does he ever talk about M-Reits or Stocks like QYLD? Ses like he mainly invests in companies like Apple, Disney, & Microsoft."
2021-05-29 21:13:57,stocks,You say that but I’ve shamelessly watched 1-2 hour long videos on anime character power scaling and those dudes go pretty in depth. I’d probably watch a 1-2 hour DD tbh

2021-05-29 23:39:33,stocks,"TBF he was pretty early about NIO before a lot of youtubers & redditors got on board. I initially liked his channel, but I've gotten admittedly bored of it. Its nice when he talks about other companies, but he usually makes videos on the same thing over and over again. The last straw was when he kept talking about [meme coin I'm not allowed to mention by name on this sub].

What bothers me though, is that he seems to be more knowledgeable than your usual ""brovester"" type but he is trying to fit the mold of your typical fin-youtuber. He's an older guy who could really give more in-depth knowledgea and analysis on things if he wanted to, but is reluctant to do so."

2021-05-29 23:10:03,stocks,"He doesn't really give much substance, his personality is kind of obnoxious, and it's a daytrading channel. I can absolutely guarantee any youtuber/daytrader makes more money talking about daytrading than they do actually daytrading.

Daytrading tends to have a lot of appeal to inexperienced and new investors, but in practice is really not that profitable unless you are swingtrading option contracts or using algorithmic trading bots you've programmed and backtested."
2021-05-29 23:31:02,stocks,"Skimming through his past videos, looks like a lot of great content thanks.

I going to reccomend another channel, Kyla Scanton, she doesn't do stock picking videos, she just talks about Macroeconomic trends and news in a quick and easy to digest way that is entertaining. She's a bit quirky and has an oddball sense of humor I like. Her youtube channel seems to be her secondary focus, as she makes daily content on tiktok instead. I suspect her being on tiktok will be a hard pass to many redditors here, but she's not bad."
2021-05-30 07:22:47,stocks,"It’s hard to find anyone these days that aren’t tied into the GME/AMC craze, but there are a few that stand out with their TA, tradespotting, Trey’s Trades (has some decent strategy videos in his channel), AndrewMoMoney. I like Uncle Bruce and Andy Lee, they are great ASMR, feel good channels, but they don’t get into why. If you are looking for general financial advice, I found Doug Andrew - 3 Dimensional Wealth has some tips about retirement planning and stuff that i wish I knew years ago"
2021-05-30 07:15:00,stocks,"I mean, this predates YouTube... check the Cramer Effect... most retail investors want an edge, an inside track to making some quick profits without doing the work.

2021-05-29 21:23:10,stocks,"My favourite is slightly niche, covers mostly Chinese stocks: ""DONGXii - The China Opportunity"". I mostly just watch his Nio content. He focuses on fundementals (margins, sales, all that good stuff), he occasionally accompanies it with a bit of TA.

The Popular Investor is pretty good, he's very bull-headed and has high conviction in his beliefs. Fundementals based but does a lot of TA, big fan of Elliot Wave theory.

Chicken Genius Singapore - this guy is more in the realm of investing theory and advice. Investing strategies, big-picture catalysts, that kinda thing. The closest guy on this list to being a Brovestor but he doesn't make any crazy claims and is very wise imo.

In The Money. Mostly deals with options and shit which I barely understand but I've started learning via his videos. Covers current events in the market from time to time. His thumbnail game is one point, but once again, he speaks factually and doesn't bullshit or make grand claims. Probably my favorite along with Marcel."

But if they were good at investing, why are all of their videos essentially 101 type topics with no reviews of sec company forma or just videos of spreadsheets.

A great example of someone who knows investing but really liked to teach, Martin Shkreli. His investing YouTube videos are boring because it's real information about investing. Not regurgitation from another YouTuber.

Edit: Yes, Martin is scum and did some unethical things. But he's still massively intelligent about what he does."

Many forget that the dot com boom was fueled by yahoo forums, today we have wsb, digital/CCs, yt. The worst part is that hundreds or thousands of shill accounts and voting bots have been created so I try to take everything I read on reddit investing forums with a huge grain of salt. Whether its bots, shills, or people who’ve spent 1000 hours in forums thinking they have become economists, there will be an awful reckoning."
2021-05-29 20:28:12,stocks,"Ironically, your complaint represents the inherent basis of the investment strategy. The intentional production of persistent market dislocations is the foundation of the meme stock, HODL, and short squeeze techniques. You want a simple answer? Don't short those stocks. That seems easy enough to realize. 

The notion that the new levels of coordinated retail trading in specific names = the perversion of an underlying priori ""true value"" of assets is total bullshit. Everyone knows this. Trading multiples fluctuate wildly over time. Central banks have pumped untold trillions of liquidity into backstopping the markets. Commodities exchanges are caught on a regular basis manipulating futures contracts, reference pricing on metals, or LIBOR rates.

Learn to adjust or at least quit crying."
2021-05-29 21:04:59,stocks,"So don't buy puts in them. It's not that hard.

Imo this is a great movement. The whole idea to bankrupt companies to make money, is pretty disgusting. Retails stepping up where laws don't work, is imo a great balance that was needed.

I don't care for puts or shorting, however I don't think they are bad in itself, however when shorting is used to manipulate the market where it becomes 1 of the main causes of a company going bankrupt, then yes that's an issue.

These hedge funds took a massive risk with a huge payout if it (bankruptcy) had worked. However it didn't, and this movement will make sure it never works again, because if anyone dares to do this again, this will be listed as GME/AMC v2 and people will just keep holding again."
2021-05-29 20:41:48,stocks,"The issue is, that there is no real way to stop an anonymous motivated person doing something stupid, that is completely legal. Most of the stonks don't even move much with retail traders involved, with a few exceptions. So its not even ""participating"" in their supposed misery, its just how this thing works.

I mean, there are people who still send the nigerian prince money. Because there are real people who think other people *don't write dishonest mails*. Or recommend them meme stonks at all time high."
2021-05-29 21:02:16,stocks,I think that ship has sailed bro. Fact is retail investors are now investing and have easy access to the markets. Theoretically could make things easier as well. FOMO followed by panic sales all day.
2021-05-29 21:31:12,stocks,This is baloney. The people jumping in following these guys are not going to have enough money to properly sway the markets.
2021-05-29 21:24:55,stocks,"I don't know why people are bothering with puts on the meme stocks. Looks like quite a few people lost by doing that with GME and AMC right now. But it's the same with calls. With that said it didn't stop me from making a quick turn around last week on an AMC call option, but I only did one because I'm not dumb even if doing more would have given me a nice premium it's almost not worth the stress."

I also believe we’re in the minority in terms of interests of YouTube. 

Viewer count is important for content creators because viewer count is what drives their ad revenue. You won’t get a high view count if you speak about technical stuff and long videos. Our generation is all about quick and concise info which basically is the reason why these “finance gurus” succeed over actual financial info. They keep their videos short, quick and flashy, it’s what draws attention of viewers."

My personal favourite is at 5:42. It's always been bullshit when 'smart money' goes on a rant about fundamentals, and they know it. Here he actually admits it.

Cramer: [explaining why and how they manipulate the market, getting Research In Motion (now Blackberry) to tank and getting Apple to drop prior to MacWorld]

Interviewer: You're talking about the mechanics of the market-

Cramer: Well the mechanics are much more important than the fundamentals

Interviewer: **Okay, well, but in terms of fundamentals, you've even been writing about how you've been-**

Cramer: **Who cares about the fundamentals**, Research In Motion just blew out the quarter, but look what people can do. I mean, that's a fabulous thing. **The great thing about the market is it has nothing do with the actual stocks.** Now look, maybe over two weeks from now buyers will come to their senses and realize that everything they heard is a lie. But then again Fannie Mae lied about their earnings for about 6 billion dollars. So, you know, it's just fiction and fiction and fiction. **And I think it's important for people to realize that the way the market really works is to have that nexus of hit the brokers houses with a series of orders that can push it down, then leak it to the press, then get it to CNBC- that's really important, then uh, you have kind of a, get that vicious cycle down.** and it's a pretty good game, and it can pay for a percent or two.

Interviewer: Then you get long before MacWorld and the expectation of the iPhone [inaudible speaking over each other]?

Cramer: Well yeah because you've drove it down, so still gotta use the other side. And there is the case where I'd say the January 80 puts are justified, because when I've knocked it down I can buy a lot of common and play it right into MacWorld where they'll probably introduce the phone and Verizon is going to take it."

2021-05-29 21:55:56,stocks,"I could write you an essay cus I've researched to the tits but I'll try and keep it short ish.. 

- China is the single biggest EV market in the world, and will be for the foreseeable future. Right now, Nio has a formidable share of the Premium sector, specifically premium SUVs. They've also started pre orders for their first Sedan model, the ET7, pretty exceptional car by all accounts.

- Battery swapping. This is the love-it-or-hate-it part of Nio. A lot of people think the concept is redundant because it only works if there is no one in the queue ahead of you. However it has several really cool advantages. Firstly, Chinese cities are very dense and most people, even the upper class, don't have homes where they can install chargers, they live in high-rise apartments. They can commute to work and only have to swap their battery once a week, twice at most. Then the obvious advantage is on long journeys, you can 0-100 charge in <5 minutes with no queue. The third advantage ties into Battery as a Service...

- BaaS. You can save money upfront when you buy a Nio because you RENT the battery, as opposed to buying it. Why is this beneficial? The upfront price is less. If you want to upgrade car in the next 2-3 years you save money (Premium sector, nio customers can afford to upgrade every few years). Resale value is not tied to the battery. New battery gets released with more capacity? Upgrade your rental scheme to the new one. Tesla's do not offer any of these benefits, in fact no other car company does because it cannot be done without battery swap tech. Again, some love it, others swear by it. The entire battery swap and BaaS is in my opinion what makes nio so unique whilst also being the thing that scares investors. 

I said I'd make it short (lol) so I'll skim the rest. Several strategic deals (swap stations in Sinopec service stations Nationwide), insanely high customer referral rates, very good outlook for scaling (don't have the numbers on hand), recently launched in Norway which has one of the highest rates of EV adoption worldwide, very good self driving tech partnerships (mobileye). Government subsidies which only apply to cars with battery swap tech AKA only apply to Nio. They've bought back most of the stake that they had to give up when the got bailed out. Very healthy vehicle margins. Consensus seems to be that the vehicle quality is exceptional, superior to the equivalent Tesla's.

If I had to be honest and give you some cons: a lot of their success will rest on their conviction in battery swap. The possibility that legacy makers like Ford etc swoop in and dominate (general consensus is that they will struggle to do so, they are very far behind and consumers seem to prefer sole EV makers so far). In terms of the stock price, China comes with some risks.  Arguably their market cap is priced in for years to come. 

IMO it's an amazing buy right now, off the top of my head I think $50-60 is fair valuation

EDIT: wrote this on mobile at 3am and probably didn't do each point justice. Go watch videos on battery swapping and battery as a service (BaaS). If you are sold afterwards and believe in it, consider investing. If you think it is doomed to fail, don't touch Nio. It's very intrinsic to why they are unique and why some people think they could literally be the Number 1 EV maker in the world in a few years. If they ever decide to admit they were wrong and abandon it, it would be disastrous, but I'm a believer in it"

The short interest exposure in GME, as the prime example in this case, is theoretically infinite, to the extent that it actually does exceed the float; but also even just from the perspective of a coordinated retail bloc that actually refuses to sell. 

The hedge funds *are* losing. Read their financial statements. GME and AMC shorts are losing billions and billions of dollars.

The only structural advantage that institutional investors have is the ability to manipulate the system behind the scenes. Like in the case of the excessive naked shorting that produced the initial GME short squeeze thesis to begin with.

2021-05-30 14:12:33,stocks,"Companies will die out if they can't manage, it's that simple. If they keep posting red numbers, people will sell, sell means the stock goes down etc. That is natural behaviour.

Buying and selling shares in it's basis is very normal. You invest in something you believe in, and sell when you either want to use the money for something else, or because you got worries about the future of the company.

Stock helps the company when they are doing well, and doesn't help when they are doing poorly.

Options are simply betting on a company with others. 

Shorting is betting with a companies assets that you don't even own.

Now in the stockmarket people look at numbers, not people. But now imagine this is your buddy who has a small business.

You got friends who invest in it.
You got friends who have a wager on whether he will make it succeed.
And here you are, you don't believe in his company, and aren't just betting on him losing it, but you are making it worse, benefitting from constantly undercuttint his business.

Dick move right?

Would AMC be a dead (or within say 2-3 years) company if covid hadn't hit? No clue. The fact is they raised a lot of capital, so who knows right. 
Would AMC be a dead with covid hitting and no one shorted? No clue either, would hwve hurted for sure.
Would AMC be dead if retails didn't jump in to save it from shorters? Yes.

The only thing we know for sure, is that shorters probably would have been succesful manipulate the stock so much that they would bankrupt it.

If people want to bet against a company, go right ahead, buy puts. But actively shorting, especially that much to bankrupt, that's messed up.

AMC wasn't doing well, but they had a ton of capital left, all the money raised, was stock they held for like 10 years I think, if covid hadn't hit them, or been shorted that much, they would be in a much stronger position. Atm they are solid for at least 2 years, this could have been 5-10 easily if this didn't happen.

This is seeing someone in a tough fight, get knocked down, and you plaxe your bets against them, jump in the ring and start kicking them while down.

If you think this is fine, then that's sociopathic behaviour.
I know this is quite common in the stock market, not giving a fuck what happens to someone else. But that's where this movement is different, people giving a shit, people not being ok by this small group fucking us over, having no consequences when things go wrong, but taking profits when it works.

2008 was the result of a very small group being extremely greedy and fucking over the rest of the world.

This movement puts a stop to that. Every time they pull this shit again, they will get fucked."

NIO is not a good company to buy, but that separate from it’s not a good company because it probably is a good company from my understanding. It’s severely overpriced and any growth has been priced in already, all of the growth for the next 10 years probably if not more. Talk numbers first then we can talk the moat."

Sales projections are very good, currently on track for 22,000 per quarter and they haven't missed a beat on earnings so far.

In china especially, there will almost certainly not be another battery swap capable brand, and if their is they will use Nio's infrastructure and/or battery.

Think about it this way. You go to a boxing match, you bet on the outcome of the fight, you are sure boxer A is gonna win. So instead of betting of just betting on that boxer, you step in the ring and use a baseball bat to make sure boxer B will lose.

Gamestop will never reach 500 you say? Guess you have no clue then. This ran up that much without these big hedgies covering, guess what will happen if it does.

You claim the people buying this stock, are malicious. For doing what? Buying a stock that people disagree with being worth nothing, because that's what's happening here. They shorted, could have covered ages ago but wanted it down more, instead they kept fucking with the stock more and more in the hopes to bankrupt those companies.

AMC has enough money to run for at least 2 more years assuming we don't get another covid type situation. So why should this company go out of business? Because the shorters are so greedy that they want to bankrupt?

They are causing the squeeze, they overleveredged, they have kept shorting the stock with no success, and instead of covering, they are playing with money they don't have because they don't want to give up.


This is not taking advantage of a failing company, this is seeing a company at risk of failing, and doing whatever the hell you can to make sure they fail.
Even the reported numbers put them at 1/3rd of the shares on loan, and trust me those numbers are way higher. This is pure market manipulation.

\- competition is several times larger as new companies pour into the market to get share of it  


the real growing markets when it comes to cars are large dometic markets which lack behind in vevicle saturation and population buying power: china, inda, africa, south america.

Unfortunately it seemed like I never made any money off of it, and more often than not I was 2 or 3% down. Sure, it seems like impatience considering I didn't wait very long, but I was making healthy gains in BMO, RY and TD (all bank stocks, so they're pretty safe). So can I get some advice, or explanation, as to why it looks this way?

I don't really want to spend a lot of time worrying about stocks, and I believe I'd be better off indexing 80%+ of my funds, but I don't really know how it works. Is VFV just a bad buy? Would I be better off going for VOO or VTI instead - but considering I'm buying with Canadian dollars am I losing money in conversion?

I've also looked at VGRO as another option but I'm not sure whether it's a good choice.

For clarification, I'm investing quite a small sum (because I'm quite young and don't have a lot of money) and I don't really need it for the foreseeable future.

Another similar one is Canadian Portfolio Manager, which uses basically the same strategy. [They have other model portfolios with 3 or 5 funds for slightly less MER and better tax treatment](https://www.canadianportfoliomanagerblog.com/model-etf-portfolios/). You can tweak the individual ETFs based on your assumption (e.g., if you think Canada will outperform US or emerging markets will, etc.), giving you more flexibility than a single asset allocation ETF like VGRO.

Also, have you checked out /r/personalfinancecanada. They have lots of excellent content geared towards Canadians, such as financial planning, asset allocations in TFSA vs RRSP, other tax incentives or programs you can take advantage of, etc.

profit taking is always good. yes it might bring tax reduction with it and all that. but in the end, profits beat losses no matter what. 

for me it depends ont he asset type: 

\- long term investment (dividend stocks, etf´s) I never sell unless   
   \> the dividend gets cut or the current world econimics situation makes sell inevitable.   
(example oil stocks. I am happy I got them. in 25 years I probably do not need them anymore)  
\- short term trades: > my goal is to make 5-10%. If I have that, I usually have mentally checked out. and react on a whim. sometimes I hold longer and sell for 7 or 8, instead of 10.   


I trade nything for short profits that offer an opportunity. FAANG dipping, established companies dipping, anything. if I see somethign and according to my superficial analysis it makes sense that the privce would recover (basically if news influenced short term price swings but underlying financials have not change in any way shape or form)   


\- pure gamling shite  
sell when I am up, depending on what I bought into. and if I ever reach that stage.   
I am guilty for trading in some extremely meme-esque stuff and so far it either   
 \>locks up money (looking at that gandalf orb)

I like to cover the principle ASAP if possible.

IE simple math:

I'll buy 4 calls if it shoots up 50% I'll sell 3 and let the last one ride bc it's a runner.

Or I'll buy 10 on something low volatility high liquidity and if it hits 10% I'll sell 9 and let one ride or sell all 10 and take the profit.

I've missed some big gains doing this, UPS Q2 2020 still haunts me, but I didn't lose money either. And honestly if something rockets up 50% profit I'll usually cash out.

Just gotta pick your poison and trust your research. If you're expecting a catalyst might be ok to hold or maybe you need to hedge in case that catalyst is a flop or it never comes.

Cutting your losses short should already be a win for you because you followed your plan. Either employ a stoploss when it goes below a certain MA or i.e. it goes above 400, then comes back below 400, you could sell there (think of it as u opened a new trade at 400 and it went -5% and u cutloss there or something like that.

in germany (my home country), taxes are automatically deducted from every trade. you have a tiny tax free amount per year (801 euro) but that´s it.

so any profit up to 801 euros is not taxed.you sell for profit after that: ->  tax hit (at the minimum its 26,3750 %)dividends -> tax hit (foreign tax of 30% for US stocks. the rest of the dividend net sum of  70% is hit again with the 26% from above. so 100 dollar dividends end up being about 51 dollars in our pocket after taxes)

even if your gains are automatically reinvested, they are taxed.you sell for a loss -> no impact unless your losses mitigate your 801.

still:   
in germany I would say if your trades are not hit with taxes because you haven´t reached net profits of upward of 801 euros / year, you are doing it wrong.

I'm mostly wondering if it's still a good idea to have 11% of my portfolio in AAPL.  My MSFT is about 9%, but I see more potential in MSFT I guess."

You cut down on apple to get more risk (for more reward, on more speculative plays), not the other way around. Apple is as safe as it gets. And for that reason it won’t get you a 10x."
2021-05-30 15:14:43,stocks,I would take some profits and put them somewhere that will grow over the next few months. Maybe XLF. If apple dips sell the xlf shares and buy more apple. Financials look primed to keep growing in the short to medium term.

Ever since COVID-19, I’ve been interested in medical biotech companies. The vaccine race was at its peak in February, with many companies looking for funding and commercializing their vaccine.  I was in Inovio at $15 dollars and managed to make 6k, but I managed to lose almost all of the gains. 

I’m looking for advice because I’m looking to do my research on different biotech companies and swing trade them. There are plenty of catalysts like healthcare conferences, funding, release of data, buyouts, fda approval, etc. that can drive the stock. But at the end of the day I just want general advice about biotech companies and what I should look for. Also, how I should swing them. Ex.

I don't think May CPI is going to be good either, but if it turns out to be as bad as April was, the reaction will be interesting. May 10th-12th was pretty ugly as a whole in stocks (and not just in one sector) but as of right now it's just turned out to be more of the same story of 2021 (SPX drops 3-4% or so quickly and then snaps back quickly) instead of something different.

Honestly...is it going to be as ugly? If it does end up being as ugly, then stocks, bonds, and commodities have all been in denial the past couple of weeks (the Nasdaq found its footing around 13k, the bond market has been fairly calm outside of that stock/bond rout on May 12th, and commodities have apparently cooled off of late)."

Pretty much everyone, without exception, printed money and flooded the system with liquidity.

I have used Apple computers for over 15 years but plan on switching to PC for video editing and other work because the latest versions of OSX broke many of the programs I used for blu ray authoring and so on. It's a hassle and just annoying to use my 7 year old macbook because my brand new one can't run any of the programs I bought and there are no new ones to replace them with.

I also don't like the new iMacs, macbook airs, etc...too few usb ports and requiring dongles for SD cards and more usb ports, etc....only making the new macs good for web browsing. Alienware PCs just seem like a better value right now when upgrading, and have VR compatibility.

I haven't used an iPhone in years as got tired of 3G and switched, and very comfortable with Android since 4G. Apple hasn't done anything innovative recently to get me to even think about switching back to iPhone. 

As for iPad, Kindle paperwhites made me stop using my iPad for ebooks and I gave it away.

There may come a point when Apple loses the 'cool' factor and from there it is downhill.

The more people that switch to PC, Android and Kindle due to a lack of innovation and consumer friendly practices over the long-term, the more they will lose money on services/app revenue."

If no one sell lighters and you have the technology to sell to everyone, you are the most important person in your village.

Set your 10yr price chart to log and draw one trend touch AAPL's lows and another touching it's highs.  That creates a band of the average long-term growth rate.  You'll see that today's price is about 30% above the high end of the average LT growth.  

That might be appropriate given the recent earnings blowouts but since growth is expected to return to it's pre-pandemic rate (for all companies, AAPL included), it makes it hard to imagine that the stock is going to rise substantially and permanently in the short term unless they beat estimates by a wide margin for the current quarter."

2021-05-30 12:07:28,stocks,"I think the people who pointed out how much the shares are up over the past year to 5 years are spot on.  Do you really think the growth opportunities for Apple have increased that much over the past 5 years?  Sales of iPhones peaked in 2015 -- why are you paying 27x earnings not when you only had to pay 13x earnings in 2015?

&#x200B;

The shares are up 5x in 5 years -- half of this is from multiple expansion.  What can you expect over the next 5 years?  Is there any reason for the multiple to expand from here?  The operating margin has not increase since 2015, so you are buying sales growth only.

The market capitalization is now over $2t!  I think it is much harder for Apple to grow from $2t to $10t over the next 5 years than it was to grow from $400b to $2t.  It doesn't appear possible to grow to $10b selling cell phones and services -- they will have to create multiple new (unknown) products to do this.

It’s only a matter of time before they have to pay they’re debts. They thought amc would go under so they irresponsibly let the computers go nuts because once it hits 0$ they don’t owe any fees and they can cash in all the profit. It’s fucking up our economy. People should just research sometimes and not write us off as get rich quick scheme. Now we are popping out of no where.

I sold 4 of the contracts for a profit because I got margin called as PLTR started tanking. Over the last few months I bought 2 more contracts at a higher premium because I want to exercise for more shares at that $120 per share price.

They apparently ""don't know"" how much it costs to run the app store (which is a comical answer). 72 billion is even more than the 60 billion though.

I wasn't talking about a 15% reduction, I was saying if the app store payment costs were reduced from 30% to 15% (50% reduction).

15% is still huge, the triopoly of credit cards charge 2-3% for transactions and have to deal with with a huge amount of fraud globally.

The honest truth is Apple probably has around 70-90% margins on the app store. They likely don't spend more more than 5 billion a year to maintain, which is why they ""don't know"" how much it costs to run."

2021-05-29 20:26:52,stocks,"Some would argue buybacks are not that positive because it means the company is artificially keeping their share price up, rather than using that money productively to progress innovation."
2021-05-29 21:56:49,stocks,"Just as sitting on cash is bad for regular people like us, it's also bad for businesses. This is especially the case for companies like Apple who have massive amounts of excess cash on hand. Buybacks are a way for companies to overcome inflation by also betting on their stock to perform well. 

Also, well established companies who don't depend on equity anymore see buybacks as a way to reduce expenses. Apple pays a dividend so if they buyback x amount of shares every quarter, that's billions less in dividends they have to pay. And like I mentioned in my original post, buybacks lead to the growth of the stock price so it's also a way for Apple to appease their shareholders with price growth."
2021-05-29 20:45:55,stocks,"The idea being to generate cash selling calls, and if AAPL is relatively stagnant/down, pocketing the premiums.  And the risk would be that if it spikes above strike price, the excess is lost.

Is that right?  I've invested for years, but I've done exactly nothing with options :-)"
2021-05-29 23:25:27,stocks,You're welcome. I edited to add a bit more detail. It was definitely a light bulb moment in my options trading once I realized the power of LEAPS to buy now with a downpayment and pay later. I can see how having a lot more money and playing multiple LEAPS really opens up possibilities without overcommitting my resources.

Biden changing tax rates on corporations is a systemic risk. All asset prices would crater when/if that happens. So if you expect that, then sit on cash. I'm much more worried about inflation though.

Seriously though, if you think taxes are why Apple is trading at the ratios it is, you are legally disabled."

Apple has tons of selling pressure at 135 and dumbasses like you think it’s going to be 150 lol. last time I check, When meme stocks went crazy (feb) we saw a correction in growth

Apple got lots of shit priced in, expect for those taxes that just got announced this past week. we’ll see if apple gonna go to 150 stupid ass"

Apple isn’t going to 2x or 5x within any reasonable time.

There are thousands of companies that will within the next 5 years...

If you are a millionaire or just want some stable growth apple isn’t bad..great company that is priced at a premium..

But any good investor knows the potential is fixed and if you want to scale your portfolio you likely aren’t going to achieve that with apple..

Even the greats like Buffett and Charlie note, smaller companies will get you more profits...but once you get to a certain wealth you can no longer invest in them simply because the amount of money you are handling is to large...but if you want to grow wealth, the average person has a lot of potential in smaller caps."

Some of the stuff you are saying is factual and some of the stuff isn't. What you are imply above is that you have to YOLO to become wealthy which is not the case. Stocks that 5x + are short term are very rare. Your perception of the market is clouded due to last year's gains. The stock market hasn't always performed like it did recently. 

Remember preservation of wealth is just as important as the gains. This means risks being sound and calculated and not ridiculous.

2021-05-29 23:45:56,stocks,Yes options are flexible that way and I think the vast majority of options are bought and sold before exercising comes into play.  As long as it's above $120 I can sell it at a profit and that's why I quickly flipped 4 of them when I needed to cover my margins. If I sell it below $120 it's a loss but not a total loss unless the stock goes to zero.
2021-05-29 23:52:25,stocks,The original plan/hope is by January 2022 I can sell a few of the contracts for enough profit to cover/offset the cost of exercising them to then own shares at a deep discount.

Not really sure what point you're trying to make, honestly. All I've said is that Apple has underperformed compared to other blue chips this year and now you're saying that I'm irrational. Very weird.

The biggest challenge I'd have w MSFT is their share price is already quite large so the options w be reflective. MSFT is about 10x the price of AAPL so the options will aslo be 10x the cost. Just a heads up.   
  
NVM, just looked and was thinking of Google's price. Scratch the 10x cost. Search the options chain for a year out."

All i knows is actually most electric car companies like Nisan Leafs or merecedes actually buy there battieres from samsung and LG... Those companies are responsible for much of the EV batteries, and of course tesla has their own giga factory making there's. although those companies i mentioned are not on the NYSE lol.

and remmber lots of EV battiery comanies do go bust... i remember buying some recycled LiFePo4 cells from a company that was one of the first to use some nanotechnology crap in their battieres with help from MIT and they are bust i think, no longer around, their batteries were used in lots of hybrid busses i think.

i think making batteries is tough, and i would think the big players who make lithium battieries already if they thought solid state was a good idea, would have done it already. i mean im always skepitcal like SPCE is like idk 10 years old and their commercial flight is now, its been delayed for god knows how many years and that technology already exists and is proven. something brand new like solid state and unproven idk 20 years??

Pick an industry you feel you know a lot about and learn everything you can about its three largest market cap companies.

Heres what allows me to hold through a downturn

1) I understand and believe in my investment, I’m confidant this company will continue to do great things, I understand what threats exist to it and I believe its going to come through whatever difficulties are currently suppressing its price.

2) If I missed something I still got in at a reasonable enough cost basis that I won’t lose money if my thesis doesn’t play out.

3) If I missed something AND my entry point was bad my position is still sized appropriately so I can afford to be down on this investment. In the grand scheme my portfolio is still performing well and I’m nit going to obsess over the red parts.

Try and imagine running through that list with the next thing you consider buying, if you can’t comfortably imagine holding in that scenario then maybe this is too risky for your tolerance and you should either:

>Buy less of it

>Wait for a better price

>Look at a different investment

My last piece of advice is to really think about your time preference for your money. Obviously if a company plummets and then never comes back time preference is kind of irrelevant, but if you believe they’ll bounce back then who cares if you mistimed your entry?

Spend a few minutes and really look at [this](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/stock-price-history) chart and the accompanying data.

Specifically look at how the *yearly high* and *yearly low* trend from one year to the next.
Ask yourself how many years it takes for it to essentially stop mattering if you invested at the yearly high, or yearly low.

Ex. 2017 High: $1195 Low: $753

It would feel pretty damn bad to be down $400+ and 30% per share. But if you believed in the business, were comfortable with your entry point, and had sized your position appropriately for your risk tolerance, you held.

Today if you bought at the high you are up about $2000 and nearly 200% per share

If you bought the low sure you’re up by more but who is going to argue with you for nearly tripling up in 4 years?

Now look at the highs and lows from 10 years ago... see what I mean?

Take your time, pick a great business that you believe in, at a price you think is reasonable (do math here ffs this can’t be a gut feeling) and size your positions appropriately so you can sleep at night when they go down."

#1 The market will move in the direction of max pain (whether you have a position or not. That you bemoan seeing the market do what you thought it would do is an example of the latter).
#2 Always take the other side i.e. the uncomfortable trade must follow the comfortable one, or simply hedge all trades.
#3 Don't sell anything naked.
#4 Keep position size small.
#5 Don't predict the future..anticipate instead.

Since I’m new to investing and am not a financial advisor, I can’t give you any advice on how to recoup your losses, but I can tell you what I might do in such a situation (and I say “might” because I haven’t experienced a monetary loss like yours before).

Usually, whenever something this emotionally distraught happens, I step away and try to focus on something else (assuming it’s appropriate to of course; can’t step away when that “something distraught” is losing a loved one). Time away can heal some of the worry, and I won’t return to the source of my worry until I’m actually ready to (if it ever happens). It can be difficult at first to not think about it, but the old saying “time heals all wounds” is absolutely true in many ways. Once time has erased the sour taste, I re-enter slowly, mostly to make sure my emotions are under control and not running wild. If I find myself getting too emotional, I’ll pull back a little and hit a soft reset before approaching further.

I hope this helps. Good luck to you!"

2021-05-30 10:27:31,stocks,"Yeah, sure thing. I never said that a company can't change and improve exponentially, it happens, it's rare but it happens. It takes a lot of money and time to change a company for it to invest in the current trends or ideals. The main problem is hype stocks, when a company stock doesn't reflect it real value so it rises to a overvalue and then when it reaches a peak it falls to a more correct level. Many people enter in the wrong time and sometimes lose 50% or more of the value it's invested, some others are lucky and enter before the hype so it's life-changing money. For those who lost, diamond hands don't solve an overvalued position, that's what I'm saying, sure the company can value to the same level, but it will take a very very long time to reach it. 

I don't like hype stocks because of that, people trying to get in the train only to fall flat on their faces, losing huge amounts of money and hinder their lives and plans. But that's investing, there are a lot of strategies and a lot of people that lose more than win. It's needed a risk assessment and some math and sometimes luck to see it changing lives."

Id like to know how exactly? US has some of the top companies in the *world* and the us dollar is the world reserve currency. In the event that the US stock market permanently crashes your international stock is not going to help you much either at least not initially. Things will reset eventually internationally yes but you are going to be in for some **rough** shit and you probably are pretty fucked especially if you live in the states. 

Hell the 1929 stock crash was widely recognized as a significant contributing factor to the great depression and that was before the US was as nearly as significant of a world player as it is today.

EDIT: i do disagree with 100% index being bad all the time. Younger folks with lower net worths should absolutely be almost all in stocks if not close to it. They are significantly hampering long term growth by going with bonds and they don’t have the capital to meaningfully hold real estate. 

Bonds are for maintaining wealth you already have and are never particularly great wealth generators. Real estate can be good but isn’t likely to remain unscathed in the event of total economic collapse and again isn’t an option for everyone. Owning real estate outright is more for survival at that point than it is for serious wealth preservation."

2021-05-30 07:27:07,stocks,"No, not disagreeing that the US is *the* cornerstone of world economy.  But this is changing.  Look at China.  Look at the massive debt the US has.  Look at how the Fed basically must monetize it.  We're facing unprecedented times and the US's hegemony is being challenged.  I don't think it's going anywhere anytime soon, but it's not going to hold the same role it held since post-WW2 and especially since post-Cold War.

Look at the Capitol storming.  The US is no longer this safe-haven beacon of democracy and freedom that we once thought it was. This is important.  There's a lot of uncertainty.  Look at how Covid was bungled.

As you mentioned, of course everything is tied together, global stock markets will go down with the US market, this is absolutely true.  Even so, I'd rather not have all my eggs in one basket.

I agree that bonds suck especially for young people.  I am a young person and mostly in stocks, but I hold some commodities and foreign exchange because I'm betting against the Fed's promises of transitory inflation.  I also think two plus decades of ultra-easy monetary policy may have unintended consequences. It's something I'm researching right now.  (Ex-British central banker William White talks about this [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf).  He also predicted the 2008 crash.)

Basically I don't think that US equities are the safe haven that they once were.  Still a really good play, but a boomer who held equities since 1980 or whatever probably had a better run than any of us millenials or gen Z's are going to have.  This is my hypothesis, and of course I could be wrong.

On top of this even if we assume that China overtakes the US in say the next 20 years(and ill be frank with you China overtaking the US is far from guaranteed and the country has more than its fair share of political violence as well, just look at Hong Kong) its unlikely that the US economy crashing permanently will not fuck over the world economy. Again the 1929 crash is largely considered a contributing factor of Great Depression. Long before the US is where its at now. Its unlikely that the US will become as insignificant of a blip as japan right away even if china overtakes it.

EDIT: also want to point out that the stimulus was not at all a bad or catastrophic idea. Some economists have even advocated that perhaps a permanent stimulus would be great for the US economy. Heck if it weren’t for the stimulus we may not have had the economic rebound we saw in 2020.

Moreover as long as the USD is the world reserve currency and holds some of the largest international companies a permanent market crash will absolutely destroy the world economy.

Pretending it wont be just because you have international stocks would be sticking your head in the sand, things will be very very bad if this happens.

>bassically i dont think US equities are the safe havens they once were.

Any equity is not a safe haven. If they were people wouldn’t recommend loading up much more heavily on bonds and real estate once you have significant wealth. 100% stocks would have always been the way to go whether you had 1000 dollars or 10 million dollars. Why bother with anything else if something that returns more was ever a safe haven? Bonds are safe havens. They return less but their point is more to preserve high degrees of wealth with a higher degree of safety than they are to give high returns. Pretty much the safest thing to put your money into as if treasury bonds ever disappear or default well, then you’re **REALLY** fucked and it insinuates the US is no longer really a thing as we know it today. So again not really something to bother worrying about.

My point isn’t that US stocks are or they’re not it’s that if we ever do see a permanent US crash you are very very quickly going to have much bigger issues to worry about and you’re probably fucked anyways unless you live in somewhere thats not the US."

Did you know that the Fed kept has been running easy monetary policy continuously since 2008?  When they finally decided to tighten, they barely made it a year before reversing course and introducing easing again.  [Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-01/fed-move-ends-the-short-era-of-global-quantitative-tightening).  How about in September 2013 when they said they were going to taper [but didn't](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-instant-idUSBRE9980ZU20131009)?  Or when Bernanke infamously said in 2007 that [""subprime is contained""](https://www.forbes.com/2007/05/17/bernanke-subprime-speech-markets-equity-cx_er_0516markets02.html?sh=19cfb71d10e1)?

There's a few points I'm trying to make here, in order as they pertain to the links:  1. The Fed claims they will reverse course and tighten as soon as the economy is back to full health, but they've been dovish for 12 of the last 13 years now.   One begins to wonder if they are ever really going to taper at all.  2. What the Fed says they will do doesn't  always match what they actually do.  3. Sometimes what the Fed says is completely out of touch with the reality of what's going on, ie, prior to the financial crisis.

Furthermore, debt to GDP has [more than doubled](https://www.macrotrends.net/1381/debt-to-gdp-ratio-historical-chart) from what it was at the start of the financial crisis.  Can the Fed really afford to raise interest rates, or are they just bluffing?

In addition, by comparing these two charts you can see that the Fed owns a substantial portion of US federal debts.  You can see an increase in total debt of about [$5 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN) from Q4 2019 to Q4 2020, and at the same time the Fed's holdings of federal debt have increased by almost [$3 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FDHBFRBN) in the same time period.  That means the Fed is monetizing about 50% of US debt at the moment.  Note also that this is prior to further stimulus and the infrastructure packages in 2021, so it's safe to assume that the Fed has been taking on even more of it.

How is this possibly sustainable?  Yes, once Covid is over we'll get ""back to normal"".  Perhaps.  But the trend has been one of growing federal debt, keeping ultra easy monetary policy despite economic recovery, and the Fed continuing to monetize the federal deficit at greater and greater percentages.

Note also that the whole point of loose monetary policy is to bring future spending into the present. So while these policies may certainly be helpful in the short-run, if you're talking about how the US will be fine in the long-run, one could actually argue that these temporary recoveries are entirely based on decreasing prosperity going forward.  William White talks about this in the paper I linked before (page 19 [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)).

>EDIT: also want to point out that the stimulus was not at all a bad or catastrophic idea. Some economists have even advocated that perhaps a permanent stimulus would be great for the US economy. Heck if it weren’t for the stimulus we may not have had the economic rebound we saw in 2020.

Yes, I'm not necessarily opposed to intervention!  Mr. White even talks about the importance of jumpstarting the economy in these sorts of cardiac arrest situations.  The issue, however, would be going too hot for too long.

>Moreover as long as the USD is the world reserve currency and holds some of the largest international companies a permanent market crash will absolutely destroy the world economy. Yes; your international stocks will not be safe if the US permanently crashes. And if you live in the US you will absolutely not at all be in a good position and will have much larger things to worry about than your international stock holdings anyways. Pretending it wont be just because you have international stocks would be sticking your head in the sand, things will be very very bad if this happens.

I think this is all speculation on your part.  I don't deny that the whole global market is very intertwined... obviously it is.  But you don't know that international markets, or Europe, or China, or Japan, won't outperform the US in any given period.  Or that the US might have a slump and that one of these other markets won't.  How about the US during stagflation in the 70s?  Japan fared much better.  You never know.

>Any equity is not a safe haven. If they were people wouldn’t recommend loading up much more heavily on bonds and real estate once you have significant wealth. 100% stocks would have always been the way to go whether you had 1000 dollars or 10 million dollars.

I'm not necessarily saying that there's going to be a permanent US market crash.  There probably won't be, and even if there is, even Japan's market crash wasn't permanent.  It's taken about 30 years, but they're almost back to where they were.

All I'm saying is that you never know what's going to happen. Black swan events happen.  When you put your money in the markets, it's not a 100% bet you'll get it back, no matter what instrument you're in.  Not even putting it under your mattress or in gold is a guarantee.  Nothing is a guarantee.  Some plays are better than others, IE, the US market.  But you never know.  That's why you diversify.

The stuff I shared about US debt as well as prolonged ultra-easy monetary policy only make this argument more pressing, IMO.  I could be wrong about any of this, but hey, that's why I don't put all my eggs in one basket."

Other industries have other protections, for example the 2008-2009 bailout of America's banking industry.

The first is size, fund managers are limited to buying only in large amounts which drives up the price leading to a bad average buy and then the reverse happens for selling. They also have to be very conservative because if they drastically underperform for sometimes even one year they might lose their clients or job, this means they take very very little risk. Then most obviously, they have management fees. Between all of these the retail trader actually has more in his favor. Whether he is skilled enough to do anything about is a different point."

2021-05-29 23:35:55,stocks,Dividends are cool but when you’re young you should be into growth. I’m 29 and I’m into growth because the gains you see in a short period would take years to get in dividends
2021-05-30 00:19:45,stocks,"I haven’t read every reply here but I want to do a bit of explaining on why dividends are bad if you’re young. A dividend is paid out to the investor usually from company profits. This sounds good on paper because you get money, however, companies that pay high dividends rarely grow. Companies that take that profit and invest it back into themselves will almost always grow at a larger rate than the dividend was. You can find quite a few companies paying 3-4% dividends, but their share prices never move. I will choose a company with zero dividend that gains 7-10% per year any time. Dividends only real use is for people who are nearing retirement and have enough money that they don’t need the increased returns and can live off of the more modest dividend payment. Unless you plan on learning about stocks and particular businesses in great depth, buy index funds. Something like VTI, it covers so many stocks that you will always get the same growth as the whole market, which has averaged about 8% per year for the last 100+ years. This will compound on itself the same as a bank account or the dividend stocks but at a much higher rate with essentially no more risk in the long run."
2021-05-30 10:37:28,stocks,"I tend not to like dividend stocks very much. I like to borrow from Warren Buffett's ideas and methodology. 

Every penny going to dividends is a penny that gets subjected to Mr. Taxman and that does not benefit fully from compounding effects. 

Every penny that is paid out in dividends decreases retained earnings and hinders the ability of the company to use those revenues to expand, buyback shares or make aquisitions. 

I like dividends when they are paid out with a low dividend yield. I like dividends when they are paid out after the firm has already taken one of the aforementioned actions. 
Dividends are nice when the company pays them as the cherry on top. My only dividend stocks are MSFT and AAPL. 

If the financial statements look good and they meet my criteria, dividends are welcome. If they don't I don't even touch them."
2021-05-30 19:00:22,stocks,"OP needs to read this, and then read it again. If they plan on chasing dividends in a retirement account; whatever just make sure to set it to reinvest, no harm no foul. 

But chasing dividends in your early 20's in a taxed account is costly mistake in the long run. 

Lets say, in an IRA, you buy a stock worth $100 that pays a yearly dividend of $10. You set it to reinvest that $10 dollars so you end up with 1.1 share. In 25 years, you'll own ~10 shares -- 10x the money!

If it was a growth stock that just grew 10% a year, you end up with 1 share bu that share will be worth ~10x the money. Same cash equivalent. 

In a taxed account though the dividend itself is taxed. That means for every dividend you get, you owe the government $2. Over the 25 years, you end up paying $50 in taxes. That is $2 you couldn't reinvest, so your value only grew at 8% -- instead of being worth ~1000 dollars, you are worth ~$650. If it was just a growth stock, you don't pay any taxes until you sell the stock; so even if you immediately sold the stock you are left with a little over $800. 

Here is an excerpt from a somewhat famous Warren Buffet letter:

> Imagine that Berkshire had only $1, which we put in a 
security that doubled by yearend and was then sold. Imagine 
further that we used the after-tax proceeds to repeat this 
process in each of the next 19 years, scoring a double each time. 
At the end of the 20 years, the 34% capital gains tax that we 
would have paid on the profits from each sale would have 
delivered about $13,000 to the government and we would be left 
with about $25,250. Not bad. If, however, we made a single 
fantastic investment that itself doubled 20 times during the 20 
years, our dollar would grow to $1,048,576. Were we then to cash 
out, we would pay a 34% tax of roughly $356,500 and be left with 
about $692,000. 

> The sole reason for this staggering difference in results 
would be the timing of tax payments. Interestingly, the 
government would gain from Scenario 2 in exactly the same 27:1 
ratio as we - taking in taxes of $356,500 vs. $13,000 - though, 
admittedly, it would have to wait for its money."
2021-05-30 00:25:04,stocks,"It’s stupid to apply yield on cost to only dividends, it works on literally any stock. If I paid $10 for something and now it’s $1,000 and it has a 10% gain year you don’t see people saying they grew their investment by 10x this year because what you paid in for something does not matter and should not be used as any kind of comparison."
2021-05-30 04:20:17,stocks,"The OP was posting about dividend, is an admitted newbie, is young and so can think about divi growth stocks. We all know how clever we are, but sometimes it's about trying to offer something new to a poster than go about preening.

The vast majority of stocks trade in cycles, some on shorter, some on longer cycles, and yes, the good ones over a long enough time horizon trend up, but with lots of dips along the way.

Now if you want to put in the hours and make those trades is another question, since over the same long time horizon the returns all average to about the same, and an all-market ETF saves you having to do that work. Any outliers are just sheer dumb luck, and not an investing strategy."

2021-05-30 09:52:19,stocks,"I can agree with this but you are missing the point and haven’t read the DD. When a stock goes to $350 you can borrow a share and it goes down and you make money once you return it. We all know this. This happened with GME. Here’s the problem. When you don’t return it and there are shares just floating around that are synthetic. GME went to 140% shorted which is the legally allowed limit in the US. In Europe you are allowed to rehypothicate shares to a unlimited amount. Infinite. When Lehman Brothers crashed in 2008 they couldn’t even find the shares. I would think there is a lot of synthetic shares floating around for AMC and GME. Now something has to happen as a catalyst to get those shares recalled. Such as a proxy vote, merger, Etc. There is also a good chance that Citadel owns S3 partners. Either way I agree they are corrupt. Time will tell. Just for scale in the Barclay had 80million synthetic shares floating around at once(not GME or AMC) but still crazy. I think they were fined $140,000. Which is why they do it. Hedge funds print money. GME has less shares than that in total."

2021-05-30 14:41:46,stocks,remindme! 3 weeks also when Palantir is still >$25 so I can laugh at these guys who are thinking it's going to produce huge gains
2021-05-30 00:01:48,stocks,"According to my broker it is costing me $1.27 per day to hold my 200 shorted shares at $14 each, so I'm not too worried about the borrow fees. I bought cheap $20 calls to cover my position just in case it did actually go nuclear, sold them at the peak on Friday and bought into puts instead. So far I'm actually not in the red on this position due to risk management and good bets, but I am a bit exposed now and out of hedges, and the IV is so high that buying calls is not an acceptable cost for me.

The main thing that has me concerned right now is the amount of buying power/maintenance excess this position is eating on my account with the ridiculous margin requirements on AMC for an uncovered short position.  I will probably choose to cover my position and accept a bit of loss if it looks like it's going to take another run up next week. If it goes back up to $30 per share I figure it might cost me another $1000 at most before I can exit the position, but I think it's more likely that it pulls back on Tuesday so I'm willing to take the gamble."

What we saw last week was in large part caused by a gamma squeeze with so many call options being written by the MM. The open options for calls next week is significantly less, open puts are way up, and the MM has already hedged those calls to a certain degree by buying shares. It will require more and more capital for newer investors to push the price up if they want to force a second gamma squeeze.  If the stock starts to decline it may be a rapid feedback loop as the MMs dump their hedged shares into the open market. At this point I don't think that there are enough retail investors sitting on the sidelines with huge cash reserves to continue to pump the stock. One way or another, we will see what happens on Tuesday."

I never do that when I'm down, but I do try to get out on major runs with a least a portion of my gains.

2021-05-30 11:10:48,stocks,"I’ve got a small position with a cost basis per share of 18.70 and definitely grabbing another 30 shares if we open near the same price of 27. My friend and sister are also grabbing shares next week, with that being said there is plenty of hype building up for AMC because we’re hoping for the same GME results. Yes I’m fully aware that there are so many different factors but AMC has so much support after that drop from 36 thats it’s hard not to picture people buying with everything they have if it continues to come down, nobody seems phased by the volatility yet."
2021-05-30 11:22:14,stocks,"I'm not going to tell you what to do but getting in now would be like getting into GME at 250 per share earlier this year. Yeah it might go up to the $30 or $40 per share range, and that is a BIG maybe, but because of the number of shares available for AMC there would need to be a lot of buying pressure to get that high. At least with GME there is some hope that the company is changing and innovating to become worthy of a higher valuation than pre-covid, with AMC the company was already dying before the pandemic and they have zero plans to change their business model. The business was actually underwater several times in the last year (where total debt/liabilities was greater than total assets), with a business model that hasn't yielded positive cash flow in over 4 years that is basically a death sentence.

This is one big pump and dump scheme, and while it's possible that you can make money if you dump before others do but it comes at the expense of other bag holders because there is no long term value in AMC. If you like money, don't be a bag holder on this company."

Or are you telling me fishing for stop loss limits, the flash crash of March 10th and the time AMC was forced to be 11.99 for nearly an entire trading day despite over 100 million in volume is natural?

Roaring Kitty had some class and actually invested in GME, not just pumping it up with the intent to sell. This new generation of short squeeze fanatics are just a bunch of con artists who don't actually understand financial markets, and are preying on people who understand the market even less to make a quick buck.  As soon as this pyramid runs out of people willing to dump their life savings to buy shares and lay more bricks to prop up the last round of ""investors"", it's going to collapse because AMC doesn't have the business fundamentals to support anywhere near it's current market capitalization.

The amount of conspiracy theory nonsense that is getting thrown around in the last week is ridiculous. If the big hedge funds were actually naked shorting stocks they could easily generate 100 million shares of AMC overnight, tank the price and make out like bandits tomorrow."

A stock growing \~200% in 2 weeks isn't a pump and dump. It's insanely bullish growth but it isn't a pump and dump. Those occur over the course of a day or two. Not weeks.

But yeah, it's totally a conspiracy theory when the fine for shorting a stock into the ground is just seen as the cost of doing business on wall street. Where there is smoke there is fire. But you do you dude, I appreciate your money."

2021-05-30 15:34:47,stocks,"That is one way to play the real estate angle if you want to be hands off. Problem with REITs however is you dont get to enjoy the inflation directly. Generally speaking, REIT valuation is reflective of their cash flow, not equity. Equity is important for operations (getting loans and such) but not as impactful on valuation per se. But inflation does usually result in higher rents as well so you might see increase cash flow.

I do have REITs in my portfolio especially healthcare and preferred stock (though I may be trimming those soon). For residential I hold actual properties but I will diversify into residential REITs once the eviction moratorium is done and we see where we land. I am avoiding buying any more residential properties myself due to the mad real estate rush.

I actually think that commercial might be making a comeback soon in the form of quality entertainment venues especially family oriented, which are sparse. I am considering a family based resort but I am having a lot of trouble finding the right land for it.

2021-05-30 15:24:05,stocks,"fantastic, I'll refer you to this post I made the other day, and if you don't have different thoughts on it then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree - https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/comments/nmg6pj/growing\_massively\_and\_goal\_is\_to\_be\_the\_central/gzq5j02/"
2021-05-30 15:47:23,stocks,"I agree with some of this post but you’re missing why defense giants are that way. It’s because of the governments policies. The more PLTR works with the government the more they will have delayed contracts due to funding, hoops to jump through, etc. 

As you said they pay like trash. Which means they simply will not be able to hold themselves to the standard of Google, etc forever. They will be at the whim of the government like all the other contractors. By the way the government will begin claiming ownership over everything IP worthy that is done on the governments dime which will mean they can’t just go sell their products to the private sector or even to other arms of the government because that’s how that works.  This will be a problem because the government rarely accepts anything off the shelf which makes it hard to develop a product on your own dime and sell it to them.

In your post you just said what the defense industry is typically and that PLTR will be different. You didn’t say a single thing about how they are actually able to do that.  And that’s the piece that has always been missing for me. Everyone says they are different but I only hear things like look at these contracts they are winning!?! As evidence of that. As I said they are already nearly the size (market cap wise) of major OEMs that do compete in the space PLTR does and that have almost a century of track record, well oiled lobbying machines in Washington and way way more assets. 

Their short term growth is cool but I’m not seeing the long term theses as an investor this will not be a trillion dollar company. The government simply doesn’t award enough money."
2021-05-30 15:54:25,stocks,Also the defense industry does not get worse engineers.  Big tech doesn’t hire the same kind of engineers. There are more challenges than software engineering in aerospace and defense. And we also get top engineers that are patriotic or that simply don’t want to have to work 70-80 hours a week.
2021-05-30 16:09:33,stocks,">As you said they pay like trash. Which means they simply will not be able to hold themselves to the standard of Google, etc forever.

I'm not sure my original post was clear - I meant the typical defense contracts pay like trash comparatively to big tech, PLTR is paying big tech salaries, unlike the rest of defense. 

>In your post you just said what the defense industry is typically and that PLTR will be different. You didn’t say a single thing about how they are actually able to do that

The way I (personally) believe they will do that is by attracting top talent with their high pay caps. And thus pumping out more product faster than anyone else in the industry - This I (personally) believe will make them a much bigger and better competitor in the space by simply being able to push quality product faster. 

If they start lowering their pay bands, stop being tech first and keeping up with the times, lower their hiring bar, etc... Then I believe they will slowly lose 'tech first' value and lose top talent that makes them competative. That's not to say that other people in defense are working with bleeding-edge technology - I've interviewed with teams that are doing some cool stuff but there seems to be very few."
2021-05-30 16:16:17,stocks,"I agree, by no means is everyone in defense a low tier worker, engineer, or person, its just that the bar (generally speaking) is much lower in defense. Which really slows down innovation, a software engineer can be ousted in big tech if they decided to take a 2 year mid-career break simply because employers will think they're rusty and not up to date with the latest tech (which isn't true all the time), but I've worked with 'software engineers' at my old role in defense that quite literally hadn't written a line of code since they graduated college. 

This wasn't just an edge case, this was the majority of my entire team (Honestly I don't even really know what they did during the day most of the time). 

I know this isn't the case for ALL defense but for its just the reality of the situation for many people that are in the field. 

&#x200B;

But yes you point is very valid in the sense that people don't wanna work 80 hour stress weeks and a lot of people in tech are left leaning and have moral issues with it, PLTR being no exception to that. So the pool for defense in general is just a lot smaller, and then you have the clearance gateway to hell as well which makes the pool even smaller. So being selective can be extremely difficult for many. I've definitely met many smart people in my time in the industry though."
2021-05-30 16:27:31,stocks,"Yeah to the first point, i did understand you, I am suggesting the PLTR will not be able to continue doing that forever because of the business they are in. The reason defense contractors don’t pay like Google and have employee policies to attract top talent is not because they choose not to but because it is infeasible with all of the government regulation."
2021-05-29 23:12:42,stocks,"It can look bad in the cash flows during transitions though. Adobe and Autodesk are huge Software businesses that both had ugly years in the switch from license to service model. Turned out great, and I think the same can happen to PLTR"
2021-05-30 16:34:51,stocks,"Gotcha gotcha okay, I didn't understand what you were saying before. But yeah I think if they don't keep up their pay bands they will end up just being another defense contractor as you've stated once/if that happens - which is a very real scenario to consider."

I'm aware of what happened in the final minutes in the last couple trading sessions but that probably was just institutions rebalancing, based off what I've seen, they apparently save it until then when they do it. 

Next window for it to get exciting is likely going to be around June 10th through FOMC, although considering that I think some of ""they"" get buddy's previews to information, watching the way the Nasdaq behaves is going to be interesting.

2021-05-30 01:54:24,stocks,"A fund manager I know said that he has clocked 50% CAGR over the last 10-15 years due to leverage. He explicitly mentions 'blowing up his capital' 2-3 times, and then goes on to say that it was due to leverage that his returns improved.  
  
But doesn't leverage not change the percentage return, only the dollar amount? Meaning that 100 USD to 150 USD, or 1000 USD to 1500 USD is still the same CAGR? Because capital put in via borrowing would still be counted as capital put in and used for calculating absolute return, which is used for getting CAGR.  
  
So if the percentage return of the investment does not change, how can the CAGR change? Am I missing something here or is the fund manager trying to show a higher rate of return than he has?"

I guess the question is if you thought the stock was going up would it be potentially worse to hold till day of expiration due to decay or better to just take profits on Thursday?

Public key cryptography is used for almost everything nowadays. The first sentence in that wikipedia page states this. The sentence you are referring to is speaking directly to the transfer of meaningful data. Public key cryptography is computationally expensive so after a connection is established, computers will offload encryption to a symmetric algorithm that is used for all encryption going forward. Similar to public key encryption, doubling the key size of the symmetric key is also robust to QC improvements"
2021-05-30 13:38:52,stocks,"I didnt say QC wouldn't do it faster. I said there are mechanisms that circumvent the improvements. It goes without saying that a computer that can decrypt faster can similarly encrypt faster. Hence making extremely large key sizes a possible, yet not ideal, mechanism.

The standard, as your article mentions, is 112 bits of security, but i think you may be underestimating the time it would still take to break most common algorithms given the current state of QC. Sure they wouldn't require a runtime of billions of years, but most people/orgs/etc replace their public key certs yearly which would force the attacker to restart the entire process before being able to crack the key."
2021-05-30 13:04:19,stocks,I think we’re actually talking about the same thing just using a different tool kit to describe.
2021-05-30 13:51:30,stocks,"> Hence making extremely large key sizes a possible, yet not ideal, mechanism.

Hey can you add my 3GB public key to that server? -_-  
There are things a quantum processor will do better than current processors. That has to be factored into whatever our standard becomes. You cant simply keep throwing key length at it. The complexity was designed for current processors. There are other things that a quantum processor will suck at. Mix the two together, and you'll have the algorithm we need.  
  
If key length alone was an acceptable solution, then less secure algorithms wouldnt have been removed from openssl, and there wouldnt be default policy requirements in RHEL8(and its derivatives) that enforce both key length AND algorithm.  
  
State sponsored attackers have quite a bit of resources at their disposal. We dont want it to just be hard, we want it to be stupid to even try."

It's also cannibalizing beer sales, so whatever TAP sells in seltzer is likely lost from Coors Light sales.

If Topo Chico was an indy brand talking about adding hard seltzer to its lineup, that I'd buy into.

But it's not. It's a post-trendy brand buried in a literal mountain of other IP, being rented out to a desperate brewery.

2021-05-30 14:02:00,stocks,"No. You end up owing 0 tax total.

The way people end up paying taxes due to wash sales is if they have a gain on one sale, then take a loss on a sale but rebuy that ticker in the 61-day window and hold it through the end of the year, then *attempt to deduct the loss against the earlier gain.*

The wash sale will be disallowed and they'll have to pay the taxes they were trying to deduct.

But they're paying a tax they already owed, they're just not being allowed to kite part of their portfolio on the public nickel.

Meanwhile, when they do sell the shares they held through new year's, the basis on them will be increased by the amount of the prior loss. That reduces the taxes on gains from the final holding, maybe even keeping the original loss.

The new shares also get the basis date of the old shares, so they may be long-term shares by the time they're sold. Which is bad if they're still taking an overall loss, but good if they end up net positive."

It was far far worse. It was the greedy banks."
2021-05-30 14:27:58,stocks,"Do you know how mortgage REITs like MORT work?

How they buy those mortgage-backed securities with nine times leverage?

How when the FED inevitably starts unwinding its massive balance of mortgage-backed securities the price on those is going to drop?

And at nine times leverage it's going to drop 10 times as fast in the assets of the MREIT?

Which means that their margin can drop to zero if the price of mortgage-backed securities drops only 10%.

This almost destroyed that industry when the feds started unwinding its balance sheet it built up after the 2008 crash.

I don't know if MREITs have found a foolproof hedge for that. But it's pretty certain that it's sometime in the near or midterm future the FED will be unwinding that balance sheet.

So if they aren't hedged and you aren't hedged you're looking at the likelihood of 30-50% losses in a matter of hours. And you won't see it coming. The pros on Wall Street are going to arbitrage it down to that the moment there's an inkling that the Fed is starting to empty its box.

But enjoy the fat dividends until then."
