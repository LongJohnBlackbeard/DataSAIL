2021-04-21 19:51:41,stocks,It’s a buy and hold forever stock for me
2021-04-21 19:55:15,stocks,"Keep in mind some institutions MAY be on margin calls and sell off their positions.... like we’ve seen with VIAC, NFLX, DISC, etc....."
2021-04-21 19:53:13,stocks,I would sell before earnings. Even if they beat earning. It would move as much. Just like last time
2021-04-21 19:51:45,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-21 19:52:39,stocks,Probably will go down after earnings in this market. Sell a covered call before hand if you plan on selling.
2021-04-21 19:52:40,stocks,"I’m buying puts. After seeing Netflix get slashed, this confirmed me that companies that over performed during the pandemic are about to either underperform or have done nothing special since reopening. I’m going to retest my theory with snapchat as well"
2021-04-21 19:57:07,stocks,Same here. I can’t see big movement unless they absolutely crush earnings
2021-04-21 19:28:12,stocks,"So what you are suggesting is called Hedging!  And that’s technically the proper use for options.  As insurance against your stocks!

It won’t specifically prevent a margin call, but because you are hedging your shares against downside risk with a put, then technically it should Help Prevent margin calls!  It does add safety to your trade."
2021-04-21 19:31:20,stocks,"Your basically hedging your position buying that put.  Unfortunately it will not ""protect"" you from a margin call if your account values goes too low.  Buying the put will help mitigate losses if the stock falls but ultimately your account values is what matters for margin calls in this scenario."
2021-04-21 19:23:51,stocks,"Your account value should go up depending on theta decay which would avoid a margin call, unless the underlying security tightens margin requirements."

2021-04-21 18:43:51,stocks,Literally only you can answer that question. Risk tolerance? Long term investor or trader? It’s your call
2021-04-21 19:46:36,stocks,Safe route is take initial investment and hold the rest..or sell half. Up to you
2021-04-21 18:53:36,stocks,Def a great long term hold but a lot volatility. Love the software
2021-04-21 19:01:34,stocks,they won't turn a profit until 2024 right? it's going to be a long tough road there. I'd sell if i were you with turning a profit from this buy so quickly.
2021-04-21 18:46:10,stocks,What was your intention when you bought? Did you have a % gain when you were going to take profits or was it a long term buy and hold?
2021-04-21 19:03:57,stocks,"Take all your profits home,  I only see one green candle rest of them down. Let it go sideways first. Chart price is at bottom,"
2021-04-21 19:55:43,stocks,"Do you think the company's worth a higher value? Do you think their teams outputs and quarterly results are enough to drive the price higher? Are you fine with potentially holding at a lower price in the short term? If yes to all, hold."
2021-04-21 18:43:37,stocks,Well depends whether you belive in the company. Could skim off the top and then if it goes lower you average down for long term. Or if you don't then sell and leave just the profit in as its a free ride...
2021-04-21 18:44:43,stocks,Skim G
2021-04-21 19:04:06,stocks,Its going to be a while until they start making profit. I might sell it now (or maybe push for slightly higher profits tomorrow) and maybe buy back when they drop back down.
2021-04-21 18:54:12,stocks,"I was thinking in the perfect world I could double my money by the end of the year, but I don't know if that will happen so I am hoping for at least a 40% gain."
2021-04-21 18:49:51,stocks,I think the company could possibly have good potential for the future....I mean they do Ai which is a growing industry.
2021-04-21 19:26:00,stocks,good choice
2021-04-21 19:04:11,stocks,Based on your 40% minimum it sounds like you should hold. You can always skim profits if your sentiment has changed but if you believe in your target price then you’re just giving up future profits
2021-04-21 18:52:25,stocks,Yeah them and every other company... Gotta weight up the pros and cons. Just for the simple reason you're asking on here sounds like you didn't do enough dd to fully know the company and if you don't know why you own a company you shouldn't own it
2021-04-21 19:05:34,stocks,"I would be giving up on future profits, but I can always buy back when they drop back down to 60 - so making a bunch of short-term profits"
2021-04-21 19:00:35,stocks,"I made a huge mistake of not doing enough due diligence.....I was initially buying puts and selling calls because they were going down a lot and did not seem like they would go up anytime soon. But, a few days ago, I thought, maybe they will start going up again.

Nonetheless, big mistake on me for not doing my dd"
2021-04-21 19:22:52,stocks,You're vastly overestimating your ability to forecast prices.
2021-04-21 19:02:48,stocks,Well yeah but you're up now so can easily sell for profit but think what would you have done if it went down 30% would you still hold?
2021-04-21 19:55:23,stocks,"What's stopping you from doing the DD now?  

PS:  Asking strangers on the internet is not DD."
2021-04-21 19:39:27,stocks,Link wouldn't work for me
2021-04-21 18:22:24,stocks,Your specific question about return over months you can do by pulling in those prices from a data provider (I think Yahoo Finance has an API) just pull in historical data for a list of tickers into excel and you can go from there
2021-04-21 18:18:24,stocks,Get yourself some tarot cards
2021-04-21 18:14:07,stocks,Nothing. It's all just noise.
2021-04-21 18:23:18,stocks,"Nothing, because who cares if you’re a long term investor."
2021-04-21 19:12:00,stocks,"You should read a random walk down Wallstreet. Its a pretty entertaining book,  but will have you think differently when you think about reading charts."
2021-04-21 18:37:20,stocks,"This sounds promising, thanks!"
2021-04-21 18:43:49,stocks,Yeah!! Because no one need to do a proper DD when investing long term! /s
2021-04-21 18:40:28,stocks,"Ignore the apes in the comments. While this might not be the only thing you should use it’s still a good tool! And it could give you some perspective as well as flag names with huge losses/gains you might not have otherwise had on your radar. Keep asking questions!

All Wall Street traders have multiple screens with just this on it - monitors and lists of names and attributes so that they can know if something big happens in a name and have an idea of their universe as a whole."

2021-04-21 19:56:17,stocks,"Making europian countries more capable of self defense, making sure they don't get energy from russia, and making them be more protective of themselves was more a trump thing."
2021-04-21 17:21:07,stocks,"To alleviate your concerns if there is a downturn, look up Bob the worlds worst investor. A theoretical man who invested at every worst moment in history."
2021-04-21 17:20:27,stocks,"Since you mentioned the man, Warren Buffett makes excellent reading. I read a selection of his letters to BRK partners. Educating and entertaining.

Few people have mentioned buying BRK as their worst investment mistake."
2021-04-21 18:25:08,stocks,"TLDR, but I think I got the gist. 

Depending on what you want to do, but my recommendation is have 1/2 or more of your portfolio blue chip stocks and don’t trade them. Slow but you don’t have to stress and grow at a nice clip no matter what. 

Also, don’t try timing. Buy in small chunks to establish a position."
2021-04-21 17:24:37,stocks,">Somebody recommended ""The Intelligent Investor"" as a must-read for a new investor. This book was not an easy read and made me even more confused. There are literally no stocks, that would fit Graham's criteria in today's market.

It's hard to find undervalued stocks right now using value investing principals. You might try reading The Little Book that Builds Wealth to learn about moats if you want to focus a little less on value ratios. Or you could wait until market conditions deteriorate or earnings go so high that company ratios start to align more with value principles. 

For me, it's easier to just have the majority of my portfolio in etfs and only speculate a little on a few stocks."
2021-04-21 19:44:44,stocks,"I’ve been reading a ton lately. My favorite books so far are “The Little Book on Common Sense Investing” by Jack Bogle, “One Up on Wall Street” by Peter Lynch, and my current read, “The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life” by Alice Schroeder. 

I personally like the Boglehead philosophy as the main centerpiece of building a portfolio. I believe a lot of people could follow that forever and do well. But I’m also interested in individual stocks. That’s where the Peter Lynch and Buffett biography have been interesting and beneficial. 

I love the learning process. Best wishes to you."
2021-04-21 19:39:03,stocks,"You can also read Peter Lynch who has a slightly more aggressive and realistic approach to investing.

A big correction probably is coming. But it’s been scientifically proven that the average investor is better off not trying to time the market, as you usually fail to do so and miss out on profits more often than not. 

You’ll have to be more specific. Weed stocks and tech stocks could be anything. BlackBerry is a tech stock, and Apple is too. Only one of those is a decent investment. 

I’m personally not a believer in most weed stocks, though there are exceptions.

Other than that, without knowing your specific company choices I can’t really say much, other than recognize your own tolerance and comfort levels. Don’t invest money you need or can’t handle losing."
2021-04-21 17:19:07,stocks,No real correction until the prime rate gets raised. Then there will be an overreaction.
2021-04-21 19:24:36,stocks,Simple path to wealth. Its blog version is available online.
2021-04-21 17:39:17,stocks,I enjoyed the little book that beats the market and the Dhando investor

2021-04-21 18:53:05,stocks,Why have stocks been trending downwards ever since March/April?
2021-04-21 18:24:34,stocks,"It’s funny you mention few people buying BRK as their worst investment mistake. BRK was Warren Buffets first purchase and he mentions it being his worst investment because he took the investment and company personally and has lived with that mistake his whole life but has also learned the most from it. I have a sizable amount of BRK-B and it’s never going to be the largest % gainer, but it’s always going to be ⬆️"
2021-04-21 17:55:32,stocks,My plan is to transition all my risky investments over to BRK later this year. I have great confidence in them to over performnthe the market in the coming downturn.
2021-04-21 19:49:39,stocks,"I’m reading “The Snowball” biography about him right now. So interesting. Highly recommend. BRKB is my second biggest individual holding in my portfolio. That’s what got me interested in reading about him. Kind of an ass backwards way to read about him, but no complaints. The stock has performed well and the book is excellent. I want to read the BRKB letters too"
2021-04-21 19:54:05,stocks,You may want to check out r/Bogleheads if you have not already
2021-04-21 18:15:18,stocks,"Yeah, don't do this if you value your money."

2021-04-21 18:41:54,stocks,Bahaha.  Your about to realize what FOMO is! Selling super cheap right now.
2021-04-21 19:53:08,stocks,Good thing any money that is invested is play money.
2021-04-21 19:40:30,stocks,"Not going into a hyped meme stock is the literal opposite of fomo, even if amc does moon."
2021-04-21 17:24:11,stocks,Your thinking is a little flawed. You don’t want to lose the shares on stocks you think will go up the most so you want to buy crappy companies just got sell covered calls? Why not just buy more of the good company?
2021-04-21 17:55:04,stocks,"Don’t forget, you’re stuck with the stock until the calls expire. What if you had an emergency and needed the money, or decided you must sell because of some impending disaster."
2021-04-21 18:45:32,stocks,"This post is missing a critical piece of information for it to be properly discussed. $1k profit off of how big a portfolio? How far out are your calls dated? If you have a 10k portfolio and are selling CCs that will tie you up until October then that is a lot if risk being taken on for 10%. You're assuming your stocks will go up and hopefully not hit the strike but if they go the other way you're stuck until they expire or you roll out, which could amount to losses in multiples of your 1k collected premium.


I would recommend heading over to /r/thetagang if you're looking for actual guidance."
2021-04-21 19:17:23,stocks,"You have to keep in mind,  that part of the beauty of being long in a stock is that the most downside is what you put in,  while the upside potential is unlimited.  By selling covered calls,  you are creating a limit to your upside.... now I'm not saying that you shouldn't sell covered calls,  but depending on the company you want to think about this.... high risk, high reward companies that can fly in after hours news you could be limiting that high reward while assuming the high risk."
2021-04-21 19:50:05,stocks,Check out r/thetagang
2021-04-21 18:30:21,stocks,"The best investment strategy is one where you make very large gains when you are right and you lose not much when you are wrong.  If you sell covered calls, you give up your very large gains that really move the needle on your portfolio value."
2021-04-21 17:28:04,stocks,"I bought my shares in companies thinking they would go up, but with the mentality that I would buy and hold for maybe a decade. I’ve held for just over a year, and I’m ok with trimming my positions and taking some profit. The method I am using to do this is covered calls. If they sell at my strike price, I take a nice profit. If they don’t, I just collect premiums. I would definitely like to now build out a portfolio of short term options based holdings"
2021-04-21 17:58:15,stocks,You buy back the call at a profit and sell your shares...
2021-04-21 17:59:10,stocks,you can buy the contract back. it just costs you the current premium amount.
2021-04-21 17:58:01,stocks,Excellent advice but thankfully I think that is extremely unlikely. I keep a pretty hefty cash buffer against any emergency liquidity pulls and then I also would use my S&P fund as an additional buffer against selling my individual stocks in a major emergency
2021-04-21 18:55:20,stocks,"Fair enough. I sold:
3 WEN 6/18/21 $25 (initially bought at $22.50)
1 VWO 6/18/21 $55 (initially bought at $44.50)
3 VWO 12/17/21 $60 
1 MS 1/21/22 $100 (originally bought at $55)
1 CVS 1/21/22 $90 (originally bought at $73)
10 ISBC 12/17/21 $20 (originally bought at $8.50)"
2021-04-21 18:55:56,stocks,I’m assuming the stocks will not hit the strike price. However if they do I am comfortable having sold them at that price
2021-04-21 19:19:56,stocks,"I totally agree. The ones I have sold so far are in pretty stable companies that don’t tend to have huge fluctuations. For them to hit strike they would have to gain pretty significantly and outside the norms of their standard movements. But you are absolutely correct the downside is the limit I have put on my upside. That is why I picked the strikes, dates and companies I did. All were companies I am ok selling, at the price points I set. The dates I feel make it unlikely the high strike will hit, but if it does I am ok with it and still happy with my gains"
2021-04-21 18:35:31,stocks,"I do agree that is absolutely the downside of the strategy. You limit your upside. But at the same time, I feel that if the lowest limit of my downside is a 50% gain, I’m pretty happy with that risk to reward ratio. Because the worst that happens is I sell at a significant gain from my initial investment, or continue to hold the stock"
2021-04-21 17:34:11,stocks,"Yes I am aware of how covered calls work. 

You might as well just daytrade single stocks if you are looking to build a portfolio for just covered calls."
2021-04-21 19:09:43,stocks,"So you're at roughly 5k in your portfolio? (sorry if I'm off just did quick head math with the numbers) With 1k in premiums you're making 20% but it's scattered over the course of 9 months. 20% definitley beats the popular ETFs, but this is assuming stonks only go up, and your portfolio isn't that diversified to begin with. If a major correction or (pls no)crash happens you'll either have to buy back your options to sell your stocks and limit the damage or ride out the storm. Basically it comes down to risk tolerance and how comfortable you are riding the market for the foreseeable future.


Personally I only sell CCs that are 2-3 weeks DTE with <100% IV. I'm not buying meme stocks just to write options, I'm writing options on stocks I don't mind holding for the long haul and buying back if my shares get called away."
2021-04-21 19:23:18,stocks,"If you're having success with it,  i trust you are calculating everything to suit your needs and there's never anything wrong with a profit.  Don't take my original comment as a knock on what you're doing.  I like to provide thought perspectives that you may anyway have or may not have thought of."
2021-04-21 17:50:48,stocks,"This feels like a misunderstanding of the benefit of selling calls in this case. OP is basically saying “I think I can make 80% profit off this stock, but I’m willing to settle for only 40% profit by risking my calls getting exercised if it means I can further increase my profits if it doesn’t get exercised.” They’re basically betting on that stock’s growth being slow enough to add several % to their profit. This is objectively riskier than Graham-ian longterm investing but a far cry from day trading"
2021-04-21 17:46:58,stocks,"So for example I bought Wendy’s and Morgan Stanley in February last year. Wendy’s has been up and down but today sits 1% above where I bought it. So I want to trim this position. Selling a covered call allows me to potentially sell up 5-10% of where I stand today and collect a premium while I wait for that to happen. I feel like that’s a huge win.

 Morgan Stanley I bought at $55 and today stands at $76. I have huge faith in the long term prospects, but I’m also ready to trim my position if I can sell at $90 in November. If that call is in the money in 7 months I’ll gladly sell and take my 60% profit on those 100 shares. Otherwise I got to collects a premium for the prospect"
2021-04-21 17:36:36,stocks,"I think there’s room for both long term growth stocks and short/medium terms holds. I think it’s a legitimate choice to buy a stock you have confidence in, that would you plan to hold long term, but to also have a price in mind you know you would sell at. And once you’re at that point you might as well make a premium while you can"
2021-04-21 19:13:52,stocks,It’s more than $5k. The positions I listed add up to ~$55k if they sell at the strike prices. That represents about 20% of my portfolio. I’ve had solid gains over 2020 I don’t mind locking in and then using the capital to start up an options portfolio and tuck some away for dry powder
2021-04-21 19:15:48,stocks,I agree with not wanting to buy stocks I wouldn’t otherwise want to hold just to write CCs. I don’t love the idea of selling CCs only to then buy the share back. For me it’s more about taking gains from profit and then deciding where to reallocate that
2021-04-21 19:37:14,stocks,I appreciate it. I’m still figuring out my investment strategies. This is my first foray into options so I was excited to share. I am very risk averse so I have a tendency to limit upside in exchange for a stronger guaranteed return. I like the idea of eventually having a dedicated options portfolio which turns over regularly and in the meantime I think covered calls to take profit is a great way to get my feet wet and gain more familiarity
2021-04-21 18:15:41,stocks,"This is exactly correct, thank you for stating it so well"
2021-04-21 18:22:15,stocks,"I have certain stocks I would not use this strategy on. For example, I would not put my TGT or BRK shares at risk. But for a company where I feel enough profit has been had and I’m less convinced of the imminent additional growth, I think it makes sense with my generally risk averse investing strategy"
2021-04-21 17:43:08,stocks,Not something I would do but I wish you luck!
2021-04-21 18:27:14,stocks,🤗

2021-04-21 18:43:56,stocks,Currently up 20% I am not complaining
2021-04-21 19:10:40,stocks,"I like it solely because of the acquisition of Red Hat and the spin off of the legacy IT consulting business. 

Cloud revenue was up massive last quarter and that's where they're taking the company. I think they have a competitive advantage over AWS or Azure with their hybrid cloud approach. Honestly, I doubt they ever get to be a real threat to Azure or AWS for market share but that cloud services market is huge. You don't need to directly compete with the giants to be successful.

At the end of this spinoff, it'll basically be Red Hat rebranded as IBM"
2021-04-21 17:06:25,stocks,Having worked in that company I can tell you it’s because they have no structure inside. Everything they think of usually is awesome but then their own internal politics get in the way of any of the idea becoming feasible.  Every deployment of product we did the customers dumped it shortly after.
2021-04-21 19:44:57,stocks,I think IBM Quantum Experience is amazing
2021-04-21 18:34:25,stocks,"IBM is coming back, or they are trying to with the acquisition of Red Hat.  It's a huge acquisition so they are probably just now getting ldap/ad integrated so everyone can be cc'ed on emails.  Red Hat is king of OSS and they have core linux distros in RHEL plus IBM's enterprise mainframe and various cloud offerings.  Red Hat is very strong in on-prem so this move was supposed to bridge the gap.  

As anyone who works in the business will tell you, IBM is definitely worth keeping an eye out for now.  Red Hat's board will not allow itself to get acquired by just anybody.  They passed on microsoft and amazon for takeover."
2021-04-21 19:19:51,stocks,"The company simply cannot compete with most modern tech companies as they did not innovate and keep up with modern tech.  In the past they were able to get away with this since they were printing cash from customers using their older legacy mainframe systems and other contracts.  I know a few people who work there but the company is starting to develop a bad reputation in the software industry because of pay issues, low morale and frequent layoffs, which has been leading to a talent drain.  They are currently spinning off parts of their company into ""newco"" in order to shift their focus toward cloud, AI and Quantum computing but they have a lot of ground to cover up versus their competitors.  I think the company will turn itself around but will probably never be able to compete against the modern tech giants that are way ahead in the space."
2021-04-21 17:49:19,stocks,"IBM is old tech, they are not good anymore. They are no where near competing with faang and they haven't released anything interesting for a very long time. Im not even sure if they are even involved in open source contributions - an apache project with IBM involvement? haven't heard of any

Some mentions...

google - Android, Go, Angular JS, apache hive.. the list goes on

linkedin - Kafka, Samza

Apple - swift

Yahoo - Pig"
2021-04-21 18:10:43,stocks,"IBM Cloud simply isn’t a player. Nobody really thinks of IBM for cloud ops as they’re too small and expensive, with few people having skills in them. They like Windows Phone OS - irrelevant.

2021-04-21 15:19:18,stocks,">influencer marketing and eSports space will soon be dominated by professional corporate agencies

Doubt it, pretty much every major YouTuber/Streamer got that way through some serious consistency and a lack of payoffs for the first few years. By the time they would be profitable for the agency they wouldn’t need them anymore and I don’t see how a marketing agency would do anything for a streamer that a streamer couldn’t have one of their mods or viewers do. 

They’d have to generate profit by taking on a shit ton of new talent in the hopes one blows up similar to how Barstool does with Podcasts. 

But twitch already does this, streamers can create their own orgs without paying 10% to some agency. Look at any of those orgs, even though one streamer in it may average 70k viewers, the others all cruise between 200-500 because they are boring. 

Assuming eventually one of their recruits blows up, they’d have to hold onto them to generate profit, except if they blew up they wouldn’t need the agency anymore because it’s not like acting, sports or music where they are going to move through roles. 

Also seems like there’d be a shit ton of red tape, Twitch banning people for simple TOS violations is one of the biggest grievances most streamers have with twitch. You really think profitable streamers are going to want more red tape from sponsors they don’t choose because said sponsors are contracted through the agency? What games they have to play, what they can and cannot do, when they have to stream, etc. sounds like a really good way to either burn out from producing content or die out in profitably from selling out.

Which leads to the next issue, selling out. If there’s anything viewers hate, it’s sellouts, look at ninja, guy made more money than any content producer in history but he sold out, signed a shit ton of contracts, lost touch with his viewers and his average viewer base is a fraction of what it once was.

I just don’t see it being a sustainable business model

2021-04-21 15:56:28,stocks,">Joe Rogan

Jaime does it, worked with the guy for years, trusts him and Joe doesn't take orders from him. To my knowledge the only umbrella that Joe Rogan has over him is iTunes and then Spotify which are more so platforms than they are agencies. I'd compare spotify and itunes more to twitch and youtube than I would some talent agency.

>Ben Shapiro

Yeah but he owns the company that does it for him.

>You are kidding yourself if you think influencer marketing will be the first industry in modern capitalism is that isn't dominated by mega corporations.

As a splinter from the previous comments I'm pretty sure podcasting isn't dominated by major corporations and most of the large podcasters - Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, Howard Stern, all own their own IPs so that they are free to produce content that's entertaining and in their own best interest.

There was actually a very similar controversy over this exact thing back in May 2020, Call her Daddy, worked through a similar platform you're talking about (Barstool) to get big, however as soon as they did they got into a huge contract battle with Barstool over trying to gain control of their own IP.

>But if a streamer is a soloist who is going to line up all their business deals for them?

Generally its between the sponsor and content producer, if the content producer is big and profitable sponsors reach out to the content producer to advertise their content. But it has a very negative relationship with viewers because the second some streamer plays a mobile game for 40k an hour or talks about Raid: Shadow Legends for 2 minutes they lose about 80% of their viewers.

>Also, isn't it handy to have someone manage all of your social media ads, your website, your video editing, filming and comment moderation?

Yeah it's already being done by independent third parties, usually close associates of the content producer that are trustworthy and not authoritative in anyway. Jaime for example."

That said, I really like the stock and I don't really see a world where they don't continue to grow and dominate the coffee/drink market. I think as the world starts going back into offices, it can really ramp up performance, but it's just an opinion, obviously not a financial advisor."
2021-04-21 16:35:10,stocks,"The bull case for Starbucks is their main competitor in China got wiped out. I think they will continue to grow steadily. A high margin, consumer staple  product with excellent brand loyalty, its fair to say they are a high quality company."
2021-04-21 15:53:25,stocks,5% discount off the stock is a very nice deal.
2021-04-21 15:52:25,stocks,Anybody think it's weird a coffee company has a 205 P/E ratio?
2021-04-21 16:46:08,stocks,"Apparently this is not financial advice, but...  


... the employee stock purchase plan that you get as a partner- I have a recommendation:  


Enroll!

&#x200B;

A 5% discount, yum. Also, it's deducted straight from your paycheck and purchased at regular intervals giving you automatic mindless dollar cost averaging.  


Sure- the stock could tank, but you would presumable be buying more through the tanking. You're essentially forcing yourself a side savings account in the form of accruing stock.  


We took advantage of it in my household when one of us was a partner at Starbucks- it helped us out immensely when we needed it!

&#x200B;

I have a lot of faith in SBUX as a company. I'm not actively purchasing shares now but I am planning to hold even if it dumps for a little bit. They've always been a forward looking company and seem to have integrated with people's lives in a really vital way (""I need my $7 coffee!"").

&#x200B;

That's my two cents."
2021-04-21 16:46:54,stocks,I just put in 5% into sip. I got bit by the gamestop bug and got into stocks. It's a solid discount to have a great stock in your portfolio. The old timers told me how great the stock benefits use to be and it makes me a little sad. Use to be 5% off the lowest price of that quarter and before that was even more insane.
2021-04-21 17:00:06,stocks,"I'm apart of our purchase program, allot about 2% of my check, and get about 1 share per cycle would recommend."
2021-04-21 17:09:25,stocks,"A general tidbit of information you may want to keep in mind, something thats helped me in the past with employee stock plans - The 5% discount is great, but remember that if you hold the shares you receive for less than one year, youll be paying capital gains on the profits, vs long term (which is about half as much)."
2021-04-21 17:58:15,stocks,"I've been holding since the $60's, and don't plan on selling anytime soon.

2021-04-21 19:26:13,stocks,"If this is ESPP, if you can afford to, just max it out. They get purchased at the best price within that time window and it comes at a discount. Since there’s usually no vesting time, you could sell right away for the 5% gain."
2021-04-21 14:04:48,stocks,Thanks for your input. And the way the plan works is that I set a contribution % that they deduct from my paycheck every 3 months.
2021-04-21 17:19:40,stocks,"The refillable cards are honestly sort of a subscription model in and of themselves. I got a $3 gift card through Verizon Up, went to use it, and apparently the app doesn't let you apply the card balance and then use debit/credit for the rest. You have to refill the card. So I fuckin' did that, like a dummy, since I 1) wanted to use that $3, and 2) was getting Starbucks anyway. Then I realized I'm basically stuck in an infinite loop until I get the card balance to exactly $0. Managed to do it after a few drinks with the help of a fairly healthy tip to kill it off, but then my dumb ass *accidentally refilled it* the very next time I ordered, instead of just paying for the drink with my debit card as intended."
2021-04-21 13:58:32,stocks,"Ah, I’m glad a (former) partner caught my post!

2021-04-21 16:51:01,stocks,"The problem is that when you get it you don't sell. You're gonna get smacked with a high short capital gains tax. If you wait a year it'll be less steep. If you're a store partner, you're also eligible for bean stock which vests after 2 years. I've been foolish and pulling it way to early and regret it come tax season."

2021-04-21 15:00:43,stocks,"100%. I'm not a coffee drinker but I've come across a lot of interesting drinks and snacks during my time at the drive through with friends or family. 

And I suppose I didn't answer OPs other question. just gonna do it here. ESPP programs are a no brainer, as long as your cash flow is manageable. i.e. my paychecks drop by a pretty large chunk at the start of every year because I load 25% of each paycheck into my program, meaning I have to be really aware of what I spend money on until about May or June, when the program is maxed out. I have that figured out and will always recommend maxing out what you can buy as long as your essentials (food, rent/mortgage, utilities) without being forced to sell stock."

2021-04-21 16:28:34,stocks,"Thanks for your input. I also think SBUX will keep growing, especially as their mobile options and UBEReats evolve.

On another topic, Dunkin’ has also been ramping up their mobile services, but it was bought by Inspire Brands, which isn’t a publicly traded company."
2021-04-21 18:54:11,stocks,"Yeah. The only (kinda) coffee-related chain I could think of is Dunkin Donuts, but... hoo boy, different clienteles."
2021-04-21 18:22:04,stocks,Yes. Even better if you plan to hold forever but short term capital gains vs long term taxes are dramatic. If you want to take it out asap you're better off not buying it.
2021-04-21 18:55:47,stocks,"Ah, I gotcha. Yep, my intention was to hold them for the long term."

Gawdamn that is exactly the kind of thing that concerns me / that i’m skeptical of. What the fuck is the point in a broker if they’re not going to let you buy and sell when you want?!?! Or mysteriously start getting bugs...

Any brokers that **didn’t** do this during that whole fiasco?"

2021-04-21 14:10:35,stocks,"No. Not brokerages like Fidelity. Also, Fidelity doesn't practice PFOF for stock buy/sell meaning unlike Robinhood, Fidelity doesn't take some of your money on each trade.

Vanguard is the other option."
2021-04-21 17:55:53,stocks,No they do not.
2021-04-21 13:49:45,stocks,"Vanguard didn't restrict.  I've heard Fidelity was good as well, but I'm only on Vanguard personally so that's all I can speak to."
2021-04-21 13:48:00,stocks,"From what I saw, most of the GME crowd were transferring their assets to Fidelity or Vanguard. Personally, I have accounts in both and Fidelity has an interface that's easier to understand and great customer service."

I'll ride or die with Fid."
2021-04-21 18:31:53,stocks,"Fidelity has almost 8 trillion in assets and vanguard has close to 14 trillion. They will never limit buys or sells because they are literally their own clearing houses.

2021-04-21 13:28:51,stocks,Why? Is it a secret or something? This is a stock forum where people talk about stocks.
2021-04-21 14:25:42,stocks,So you're saying the stock price of lumber companies will continue to go up well into next year without a single correction?

2021-04-21 14:00:18,stocks,"I own a construction company, we have been super busy. There’s a housing shortage and builders can’t keep up with demand. If anything the market may plateau in a few years, but I doubt it will fall."
2021-04-21 13:34:51,stocks,"Lumber shortage is gunna last for a few years at least, until housing prices level off atleast."
2021-04-21 15:57:28,stocks,"Not necessarily, but I dont think this is a good fire to play with. I dont know how the lumber pipeline works, but I would expect supply to eventually bounce back but not sooner than the end of this year.

I've only done options on paper and my results are so abysmal overall that I just stay away, so take that how you will."
2021-04-21 13:54:21,stocks,No
2021-04-21 14:07:59,stocks,"Maybe so but I'm not trying to short these companies, just buying puts. The lumber prices drop off every summer. Unless of course you changed your business model away from seasonal and will build well into the winter."
2021-04-21 13:40:52,stocks,"The lumber shortage is artificial, they're just jacking up the prices while building an excess supply of lumber on the side. Kind of like what debeers does with diamonds.

And even if there was a shortage there won't be when construction slows in a few months. It's a seasonal business. Lumber prices will drop off in July give or take a few weeks."
2021-04-21 16:03:47,stocks,"Yeah I hear that, I almost got burned on NOK options a few weeks back. It's definitely a different beast for sure."
2021-04-21 14:27:48,stocks,"I'm referring to lumber being three times as high as pre covid and yes, it damn near is."
2021-04-21 14:11:32,stocks,I live in Arizona. We don’t stop building.
2021-04-21 15:34:05,stocks,"No it’s not artificial in the slightest. The amount of mills that went under right at the start of covid and the ones that stayed open scaled back massively. 

You have multiple states with housing start mandates IE California and New York. You have contractors having to que to buy rationed lumber units, fencing is non existent at the moment nor will it be. 

Mills are not easy to start up again or apply scale as it’s largely limited to saw blades and facilities to hone the raw lumber into rough cuts.

This is the biggest boom in lumber since Japan had their tsunami it took years for supply to catch demand.

Source lumber broker we are rolling in bonuses and cash, it’s absurd we also sell crane Mats for large builds we are back ordered over a year out."
2021-04-21 17:59:05,stocks,I've read and seen the same.  Lumber yards full yet plywoods is still $40 a sheet because people will pay it.
2021-04-21 14:28:29,stocks,"Oh I see, my bad. Yeah it sure is."
2021-04-21 17:57:56,stocks,"I work in SoCal.  There is no off season to framing, ever."
2021-04-21 14:17:26,stocks,"I think higher interest rates this summer combined with the construction labor shortage in the western states will change some of that. 

Lumber companies are also sitting at 52 week highs so a retraction is basically a sure thing."
2021-04-21 15:36:31,stocks,"Ok but there are also tariffs in place on canadian lumber and canadian saw mills were shut down due to covid-19. What's going to happen to American lumber when those mills are up and running at full capacity and tariffs are eased? Then there's the rent moratorium expiring in June, which will cause an influx in housing. Stocks don't always make sense but with lumber mills at all time highs they are a prime target for the big funds rotation of shorting stocks. They just haven't moved away from growth stocks just yet."
2021-04-21 16:21:57,stocks,"None of this relates to lumber as a commodity especially the rent moratorium. We have clients drive to central Oregon from the Bay Area daily to buy as much direct from mills as possible(clearly there is plenty of money to be made where it’s more expensive not to work than to spend more on logistics). The tariff has always been there so that not really an issue it was 19% then got bumped to 24% now back down to 19%.

Commodities don’t trade like equities I think you are looking at this in the incorrect context. Mills are margins are absolutely fantastic with no outside competition set up why would they make life harder in themselves? Also the hurdle of legality to open up lumber sites to clear and the rights already allocated 50 years out.

All available mills that can run are running at max capacity globally.

The money mills are making is held in cash mills are sitting on piles of cash so equate that to their NAV. There just isn’t much room to drop, there would have to be a prime lending fiasco to topple the mills current market."
2021-04-21 16:41:30,stocks,"Canadian sawmills arent shut down, infact there is a ton of small ones only operate seasonaly (in the summer) and they are booked for the entire season already."
2021-04-21 16:31:12,stocks,"I'm not counting on a fiasco, just a correction that's bound to happen. The stock only has to drop a couple bucks that's all. If the companies are still doing good, the price will naturally move back up after correction.

There's no rhyme or reason to stocks. Despite of how well the company is doing the mills being at all time highs make them a prime target for hedge fund shorting. Look what they're doing to solid growth companies."
2021-04-21 16:45:31,stocks,Do they stay open during the winter or will they shut down/slow down during the off season?
2021-04-21 16:49:01,stocks,"No they close in winter, also another thing to point out lumber prices are up like 2.5x at least, the logs they make into lumber arent even up 1.5x.

Mills are making BANK right now."
2021-04-21 16:56:48,stocks,"Oh I'm not doubting they're doing amazing now, I'm just betting on the fact that during the winter their books will doing a bit less amazing compared to the profits they've been showing now."

If you do not borrow the shares you have a naked short and naked shorting is illegal.  This is how the market has worked for decades it is nothing new.  Borrowing the share does not reduce the risk of the short at all.  The risk of the short is that the stock goes up and if it goes up too much they can be margin called because the cost to maintain the proper margin balance also goes up with the price of the shorted shares.

Shorting is not slowing societal progress or murdering it.  It is people betting that a bunch of stocks are going to go down and possibly to zero but it doesn't actually cause the company itself to fail.

The only new thing is that new people jumped on the hype train and are listening to a bunch of conspiracy theories and don't understand how the market works."
2021-04-21 12:41:46,stocks,"\> Industries/commodities like vertical farming and graphene. In the last few months a few of these companies recieved spikes of higher short interest than GME at peak.

2021-04-21 15:16:43,stocks,">Essentially companies can short their competitors without risk of being locked into the short & becoming illiquid. All they do is call one of the offering brokerage firms and pay to borrow the shares. **They can then buy out their position with these and fidelity returns the shares to the owner whenever at their leisure.** Their goals accomplished both matter if they earn physical dollar count or not.

How can Fidelity return the stock to the owner if the short seller used it to close out their position? Closing out their position means they returned the share they originally borrowed to short the stock to the person they borrowed it from, which means it's not available for Fidelity to return it to the owner.

I think you're misunderstanding very basic ""Hey guys you can borrow shares from us for short selling"" language as some sort of nefarious scheme between brokerages and short sellers."
2021-04-21 15:48:46,stocks,This is how it has always worked but now you are actually getting a slice of the profits that brokers get. Brokers used to do this behind the scenes and pocket all the borrow fees while you got nothing.
2021-04-21 12:22:10,stocks,"You make it sound like a company can short another company and it’s win/win. For people that shorted Tesla, how’d that work out for them? If you borrow shares, you take on risk. Most companies are not out there shorting stock of other companies because they either hold inside information which is a regulatory risk or they risk large sums of capital engaging in an activity unrelated to their business. Imagine how long a CEO would last if the reason their company was unprofitable is because they shorted their competitors stock. 

People can control if they lend out shares. Short selling is integral to integrity of markets. There’s risk reward to everything."

In the past the broker just kept the interest on these loans themselves as part of their profit for providing you a margin account.  The only new part is that now some brokers have started allowing you to actually get part of this interest.  It is just a sign of how brokers are getting more competitive.  This is actually good for you because now you are getting interest for the shares that are loaned out when in the past you were not.

2021-04-21 14:12:23,stocks,"They're making two assumptions here, which are pretty common misconceptions:

1. That short selling significantly reduces a company's stock price

Yes this can sometimes occur, but it takes a huge amount of capital  to short and distort, it doesn't happen nearly as much as people think. However sometimes there can be a sort of ""short"" bubble just like there can be a regular bubble, like what we saw with Gamestop. In reality shorts are just that, someone thinks the price will go down so they short the stock, the shorting doesn't really have a significant impact on the price.

2. A company's share price affects their operations. 

Again this one is only partially true, if a company is looking to issue new shares then yes a depressed share price can affect their ability to raise capital. But for most companies, on a day to day basis their share price has essentially no impact on their ability to do their job, why would it?

But combining those two misconceptions they're essentially trying to say ""What if short sellers depress the stock price for so long that the company can't function and their competitors get ahead?"""

This is rich. So there is no problem with borrowing money to “artificially” inflate a stock to punish short sellers, but all of a sudden there is a problem with short sellers “artificially” deflating a stock price to force margin calls.

2021-04-21 14:59:20,stocks,"You are giving a blanket statement to address short selling, but have assumed the account is a MARGIN account. Majority of passive investors are not investing through a margin account, and don’t even understand shorting. I think the general thought, is that ALL accounts hold the securities as derivatives, and regardless if it’s a margin account those derivatives may not contain the underlying stock. Understood that margin accounts lend often and that is OK. THAT makes sense because it could also be seen a a hedge by the broker against the chance of the security tanking and recouping the cost of the ‘loan’. 

The discussion is on short selling securities where the holder has 100% ownership.

Maybe they put it in the fine print that it’s “ok”, but the OP and the discussion is surrounding the thought that the securities should be physically in the brokers possession, but they have elected to hold derivatives in lieu of the physical security. You’ve only addressed a small portion of what the OP is trying to get at, I think. How would you address brokers lending the shares out in quantities HIGHER than would be reasonable to hedge against margin positions their customers hold?

Edit seeing as you continually mention that is common practice for margin accounts. A quick google search can show you the difference.

“The two main types of brokerage accounts are cash accounts and margin accounts. Cash account requires that all transactions must be made with available cash or long positions. Margin accounts allow investors to borrow money against the value of the securities in their account.”

Typically, cash accounts are what is used by retail when taking long positions. Margin accounts are usually used when trading options, or when operating as a business. Obviously not limited to those points - but I suggest you research it"

It sounds like they don't realize that short selling is borrowing a stock, selling it, then buying it back and returning it.

1. $NDRA- They have created a machine by the name of TAEUS which really changes the Diagnosis industry. TAEUS would be 50 times cheaper than MRI and nearly as agreed. They are awaiting FDA approval and the price target after the approval is $6. As of writing, the stock is at $2.2.
2. $ATOM- This company has extended Moore's law. They have quantum engineered a material which is like silicon. This material would be used to make microchips which increase transmission of data by 33%. They have already struck a deal with Qualcomm. They have a price target of $56 and the stock is currently at $20 (as of writing).
3. $CIDM- This company is basically targeting the small portions of industry of streaming left behind by the giants such as Netflix. They have had a lot of acquisitions last year. Currently, the stock is valued at $1.15. I believe it can go to $3.5.
4. $OEG- This is a solar energy company. They have a market cap of 200 million. However, they have struck a deal for 725 million dollars. They are also partnering up with Akon (rapper) for his solar city project in Africa. The stock is currently at $4.14 and has a target of around $15.
5. $PCSA- They have several drugs for cancer in the making and each can rake in $1 billion for the company. The company has a Market cap of just $51 million. The stock is currently at $8.56 and has a forecast of $17
6. $EDSA- This company focuses on developing and commercialising clinical stage drugs. The stock is currently at $5.06 and has a market cap of $61 million. The forecast for this is $18. However, I feel that it could reach around $25.

I'm still debating if I want to mess with penny stocks but if I do it will be through them and not Fidelity.  I would basically keep my Fidelity account as my primary and have an Etrade account on the side with a small amount of settled cash available to gamble on penny stocks.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Why P/E ratios are not as high as they actually seem   

If you take a look at average P/E ratios of stocks you will recognize, that most of them seem pretty high right now. When I started investing years ago, I learned some rule of thumb that a P/E over 15 is where a stock starts to get expensive - I know it depends on the type of stock, as growth stocks always have higher P/Es. But I want to point out where the 15 came from: 

&#x200B;

In times with normal interest rates (e.g. year 2000) you got 5-6 % interests on your bank account – risk free. So if you would have put 10.000$ on your account, after 15 years (by compound interest) you would have gained about 10.000$. So in the world of stocks your bank account would have had a P/E of **15** (!). So there was some good reason needed to invest in a company that gains less earnings than your bank account could do. 

  

At the moment my bank account has a P/E of 278, but we still asses P/Es the same way. In years with QE and a something like 0.25% interests this doesn’t makes too much sense for me anymore. Therefore all that comparison of the P/E of the 2000 bubble doesn’t sound very plausible while taking interest rates into account.  

&#x200B;

So maybe we should keep in mind that cheap or expensive has also something to do with the alternatives you have (and actually there are almost zero)."
2021-04-21 12:38:26,stocks,"You are spot on! The term “cost of capital” is the cost of the “alternative” in most economic theories. 

Also, you will be very interested in the Fed Model: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_model, which states what you are saying -> P/E should be compared to the interest rate of the economy (they actually use inverted P/E, called earnings yield)

Best!"
2021-04-21 12:36:49,stocks,This is true however that also makes these valuations even more sensitive to interest rate rises which we know are coming.
2021-04-21 16:24:12,stocks,It’s amazing how many people don’t consider this concept; that P/E’s should be taken in the context of the risk-free rate. Totally agree with your take.
2021-04-21 17:06:47,stocks,"
>In times with normal interest rates (e.g. year 2000) 

2000 was 21 years ago."
2021-04-21 11:40:12,stocks,"Thats an interesting take on it. I’ve always just considers price multiples to be compared to the history of the stocks multiples or its industry. But you make a good point that compared to other options of where to place your money, a p/e of 30-40 isn’t bad right now."
2021-04-21 17:42:55,stocks,You're exactly right. Both Schiller and Buffett have made this point on separate occassions
2021-04-21 12:29:46,stocks,"Yeah definitely. Also not just short term interest rates (such as a savings account or treasury bills) but long-term rates too (the 10yr treasury was 6% in 2000 vs 1.5% now).

But there is also the concept of ""equity risk premium"", and you could argue that this should go up, when rates go down.

I still personally use a ""hurdle rate"" of 6% ie I don't invest in anything that I don't believe will return 6% or more on an earnings basis (no matter how ""safe"" the company seems to me).

Also, here's the thing... interest rates could be at 8% and a basket of companies with average P/E of 30 could still be cheap (or vice versa). All that matters is what the combined earnings of that basket of companies will be in three, five and 10 years from now."
2021-04-21 12:42:09,stocks,"High P/E is ok, if a company grow into it, the problem is when every company has ratios like they will dominate the industry, when in the end only a few will end up having significant market share. What will end up happening is a lot of companies will not only fail to grow into their price, but will end up failing. The few that do succeed have their growth already priced in and don't appreciate as much."
2021-04-21 14:46:15,stocks,"More simply, lower rates means a discount factor closer to 1 for future cash flows. That means present value of those cash flows is worth more. 

Also, like you say, bonds and savings interest rates are anemic. People with the same expectation of IRR (let’s say 10%) are going to have to push out further on the risk spectrum to get that rate of return. Since equities have been that haven, you see that reflected in prices."
2021-04-21 14:07:02,stocks,"yes low interest rates = high pe ratio, but high pe ratio = low rates of return"
2021-04-21 14:03:13,stocks,That’s a fair assessment. I was hoping I’d run into something like this sooner.
2021-04-21 13:28:52,stocks,"What people also forget is that the P/E ratio of Nasdaq 100 was above 200 at the height of the dotcom bubble. For reference, right now we sit at a measly 40 in comparison. I've never thought about it the way you do, but even so, we're so far from bubble territory."

2021-04-21 17:39:44,stocks,"You’ve explained how lower yields translate into inflated asset prices. That doesn’t mean that there PES were seeing are any lower than they are, just explained why. 

The thing is it’s all but certain that these yields are not last forever. JPow has assured the world that yields will stay low for the immediate future, but what happens after that is anyone’s guess. We’re all basically stuck playing a game of hot potato. Buying stocks hoping for gains before the inevitable rise in rates brings multiples back down."
2021-04-21 17:53:46,stocks,Stocks can go down though. Bank accounts have a fig leaf of interest because that is what people expect but the main reason people use bank accounts is that they are good for safely holding money and pooling money as it gets payed in and out.

2021-04-21 13:13:13,stocks,"Banks were really giving 5-6% interest in 2000? That seems high to me. Maybe bonds were paying that much, but I can’t image interest on cash in the bank being that high."
2021-04-21 12:18:08,stocks,"Yes, but interest rates have to go up over time. This means we have to have a PE discount on these companies as well."
2021-04-21 13:11:55,stocks,You're basically banking on earnings growing faster than short term interest rates.
2021-04-21 18:00:17,stocks,If you had 5-6% earnings in your bank inflations was probably higher. There was never a time in history where you could earn money through your bank account
2021-04-21 14:11:50,stocks,You  might want to look that up.
2021-04-21 17:14:19,stocks,"To be clear though, just because other alternatives are expensive does not mean that higher valuations relative to fundamentals do not imply lower future returns."
2021-04-21 12:29:09,stocks,"A p/e multiple is a growth metric, the higher the p/e the higher the expected growth. The problem is there is no way that an average of companies in the s&p have a growth rate of 37%, what you are saying is p/e ratios don't matter because rates are low, but a p/e ratio shows expected growth, and the fact the market is discounting that makes p/e ratios high."
2021-04-21 19:27:30,stocks,All of these dated metrics continue to prove useless in evaluating disruptive business models.
2021-04-21 13:31:24,stocks,"Do we really know that high interest rates are comming the next years (more than something like 1.x %)? Market is fearing inflation and higher interest rates for the last 10 years, but fed and ecb in fact are fighting deflation the last 10 years."
2021-04-21 18:21:29,stocks,"Most intelligent post and comment today. Doesn’t exactly explain why Telsa P/E was 1700, but the theory is solid."
2021-04-21 18:59:06,stocks,"So 10 year bond yields in 2000 where 6%. Today they are 1.55%. If we are saying PE ratios are comparable now to the dot com bubble that is a ton of room in interest rates before PEs are impacted. Yes super forward looking, I.e. we need to project out 10 years to get to income, are going to be sensitive, but the overall market should not be."
2021-04-21 15:33:56,stocks,But the interest rates are already being priced on despite being two years away. This shouldn't change anyone's strategy if they are under the age of 60 or so.
2021-04-21 11:47:01,stocks,Thx for the flowers 😉
2021-04-21 18:03:47,stocks,This. The p/e for the s&p is 40 right now. That’s bonkers.

2021-04-21 12:39:43,stocks,I don't think they will until the boomers have died off.  They are just too big of a voting base.  I see massive currency devaluation before I ever see interest rates ever going back up.
2021-04-21 14:21:50,stocks,"Why short term rates? Stocks, especially when looking at them in aggregate, are something that don't expire in a short term when you get all your money back. They are more similar to long-term bonds that you have to sell to someone at the price related to the current yield."
2021-04-21 14:56:02,stocks,"Keynes predicted the euthanasia of the rentier class almost a century ago.

His logic was, that as the supply of capital becomes abundant relative to the demand for capital, the price of capital (i.e. interest rates) will give down.

After 7 decades of peace in the western world, we have accumulated insane amounts of capital and we have exploited all the good business opportunities.

I might be wrong, but I think it's very likely that risk free returns will be lower than inflation for the future of most of humanity, barring wars and such, which destroy capital."
2021-04-21 15:15:35,stocks,"It also matters how you calculate inflation. For example house prices went up a lot over the last years due to high demand because of cheap loans. The stock market went up aswell (which can count as a sort of asset inflation).

We did see prices rising, not just in the basic baskets used to calculate inflation. The people that benefit from the increase were asset owners. Shareholders and landlords. At some point the money will have to be returned to working class people (too much inequality is unsustainable) which will likely spend it.

A lot of money - epsecially during the last year - got into the market. Inflation will happen once this money gets spend and into circulation instead of being locked up in assets.

Ontop of that, the Fed even said that their goal now is to get to a long term average of 2%, thus targeting 2.x% for the future.

We don't know anything for sure but it seems likely by now that the money printed over the last year(s) will get into circulation at some point. If not then we might have even bigger problems at hand, because it would mean that the tools of the central banks dont work."
2021-04-21 17:48:30,stocks,Tech bubble? No. EV bubble? For sure. You're forgetting that most EV are not in the Nasdaq 100

2021-04-21 10:59:51,stocks,"They track the same index so should have all the same companies at the same weightings but they have different expense ratios so they will diverge over time as the expenses eat away slightly at the number of shares of the underlying company each share of the fund represents.

For example lets say I started a fund that tracked two stocks and on day one one of my shares was equal to one share of company A and one share of company B.  Assuming there were no stock splits or expenses after 10 years one share of my fund would still be worth 1 share of company A and one share of company B.  However I need to make money for my fund so I have an expense ratio.  I can't send you a bill for the expenses so instead I take it out of the value so now one share of my fund might be worth 0.99 shares of company A and 0.99 shares of company B where that 0.01 shares of each was sold and eaten as my expense ratio.

That is not to say the price of fund will tell you which one has lower expenses because they were started after different times and the newer fund will start out priced closer to the underlying average but if it had a higher expense ratio it would still diverge quicker."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"I've watched this scene before as the market bails on growth and dives into utilities and defensive names Keep in mind at times like these that everyone on Wall Street is a whore.  There is zero chance they will stay safely cloistered in defensive safe names.  Many growth names are back to their 200 day moving average in the hard hit sectors.  Recovery names which got way ahead of any actual recovery also pulled back.  So only one of two things is happening, either there is or isn't a recovery.  Maybe there is no recovery because India, Brazil and France are not doing a good enough job.  Maybe the soon to have heard immunity countries like the US will do nothing with it?

I fucking doubt that.  More likely semi's supply issue will resolve more quickly than feared.  Because most of it was caused by hoarding and recovery names needed to pull back because they got way ahead of reality......as they always do at the start of a recovery.  Also while lockdown names just did and are posting excellent earnings it's a group of names that you should move on from.

So the recovery is still on  bargain hunt the airlines, the oil drillers, construction  companies , materials companies,  casino's, hotels then consider selling your semi stocks into the next solid rally,  I think we are in for a season of misses."

2021-04-21 12:23:59,stocks,I’d say the negative news and experiences about the vaccines is more damaging to that end goal. It’s hard to convince people to go take time off work to get a shot and then have a good likelihood of getting sick that day missing further work. And then go do that again in a handful of weeks. And then the news that they may need to do that all again a third time. And then potentially repeat all that every year.

2021-04-21 12:30:49,stocks,Your attention during biology class or lack thereof has no  bearing on whether or not we achieve herd immunity. This is reached by two simultaneous routes: vaccinations and infections. Everyone contributes differently lol.
2021-04-21 13:58:56,stocks,"This isnt my argument, but the argument is that you are still a carrier. My kids got covid, it did almost nothing to them, but it still infected me and the wife. Luckily it didnt do much to me (despite being a fatty), though my wife, who is 29, perfect weight and runs everyday, was miserable for a week.

Dunno. I want to agree with you but then I think of this way. If I had a chance to get vaccinated to protect people I love, wouldnt I? The answer is yes. Question then becomes does this also apply to strangers? I think the answer is still yes. But I understand your position and I wouldnt force you but do note, it is very selfish unless youre a hermit.

That said I think its also about personal barometer. Is covid dangerous in general? To me, the answer is yes. But ask me about the common flu and I would say no. So I could care less if you didnt get a flu shot, but I think its uncivilized to not get the covid shot with some exception to the rule."

Everyone either gets sick and gets some immunity, lasting hopefully a decent chunk of time with subsequent exposures causing a progressively milder illness, or gets vaccinated. The virus will mutate and the vaccine will also need to be given repeatedly. I'm not sure why you making it personal lol. This ain't nobody's fault. Our understanding of the immunity from infection and vaccination is evolving and maturing as we speak. Thats how it is."

They have shown that there are instances of people getting re-infected but not stated that this is the rule. Also the rate of reinfection is low so there is absolutely no way for them to say something absolute about how long one is immune. The only people saying that are talking heads. Doctors have just warned that its possible. 

There are always exception to every vaccine. It just depends on the individuals immune system. Some keep anti bodies going a long time. Other dont."

It's not anyone's fault the virus exists, it is many peoples' faults that people reacted in the entirely inept and willfully obstinate manner in which they did. As I said, covid doesn't leave lasting immunity, just organ damage if you're unlucky enough. So far the mRNA vaccines have persisted in usefulness through several mutations. So, you're wrong, as are the many millions in this country who have and are willfully endangering others because they don't want to be temporarily uncomfortable."

2021-04-21 13:43:45,stocks,"For full disclosure I'm vaccinated by Moderna as far back as I think January. I love how the mRNA vaccine technology turned out and they are going to potentially change our world (cancer vaccines etc). Not against vaccines here and I'm by no means promoting ""natural immunity"". But the rest of the world does not have the vaccine and WILL eventually reach herd immunity by getting repeated infections. Now in the future we will be able the compare outcomes from different counties and regions and see how they fare. Odds are they will be fine. Vaccines is just the more humane way to reach this end goal. But like all respiratory coronaviruses this will eventually weaken and pass."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Remaining questions I have on blue chip stocks, and EFTs.   Sorry if this isn’t allowed, I will remove it if it’s violating rules.

I just started investing this year, and so I’ve been trying to better my knowledge of trading, and I’m looking to build my portfolio for longevity. A little about me: I’m 22, work full time at a decent paying job, After my monthly expenses I have about $100 for saving, $100 for stocks, and some play money left over but I get paid every two weeks.

  So far my portfolio is about 80% crypto diversified amongst BTC, DOGE, LTC, ETH, and ETC. I’m only in about $1,050 before everything I’ve made from them. And trust me I have a good idea of this subs position on crypto, and more specifically Doge lol, but it’s been a fun ride, and I’ve enjoyed it.
  The rest of my portfolio is sunk between Tesla, and a energy company - SWN which is about $300. Also 2 shares of a $8 stock I bought back in 2016 I never sold and the company went under.

  Now I plan on starting to go more into blue chip stocks for longevity, so I’ve been watching AAPL, WMT, and HD for a good time to buy in (Roku has kinda peaked my interest too).
  This sub has convinced me that EFTs are something I should been looking more into though, but after doing some of my own research I still don’t understand them. Like I don’t exactly understand what they really are, or what makes an EFT work putting money into? Why are there 15 EFTs that all start with the same company name, and because of that how do I know which one I should be buying?

  Are reoccurring payments a smart decision when it comes to longevity, if so say $10 a month for a example stock (let’s say Amazon) on top of the money I already invest?"
2021-04-21 10:21:43,stocks,"ETF is just an investment fund, you can read up on those. ETF in particular can be bought and sold like a stock, which is very convenient. A fund is any collection of peoples money that tries to make profit by following a strategy.

Many companies offer similar funds. If you don't know where to start (and maybe even more so if you do), you could start with very broad market funds. More diversity is more stability. A total market fund, or one that tries to replicate a very broad index, such as S&P500 or a world index. Look for funds that have relatively low fees (well below 1%), as those add up over time.

Reoccuring investment is a great strategy to invest, and probably what most people here do. But because shares have to usually be bought one at a time, it's hard to invest in a chunk of 10 dollars. Some non-ETF-funds allow that. Or you could save up until you can buy a whole share. Choose a fund that has been split into cheap shares to make that easier. (Some cost 40 per share, others 700. There is no fundamental difference.)"
2021-04-21 14:11:49,stocks,"1st I highly recommend you learn the right way. Buy individual stocks...

Why? Because it encourages you to research their business and sector. This is how you learn. When you buy ETF's, you learn little to nothing aside from maybe sector behavior if you do those type of ETFs.

Always invest yourself 1st and by that I mean your knowledge. I lost $5k when I started. It was the best education ever. I made millions in the financial crash. Education, applied.  


Side Note: I am against recurring investment or DRIPs. But thats not the worst thing you can do. I just prefer to buy things myself. I perform better than an automatic algorithm."
2021-04-21 10:13:48,stocks,"Etf have the same company name because the company different funds will have different ratios of stock/bond that can fit your risk tolerance. You’re young and many years from retirement, I would find an etf that is 100% equity and no bonds."

Are ETFs a decent route when I’m starting to build a portfolio, or should I first grow through blue chips and then ETFs."

2021-04-21 10:45:56,stocks,"When you buy 1 share of an etf, you’re basically buying a fraction of share into 100s of companies all at once. So even if you own only 1 etf, your portfolio is diversified automatically for you. Some etf diversify in 1 sector other diversify into the whole market, others track the s&p 500, etc."
2021-04-21 12:04:00,stocks,"Just read up, there's good articles. Investopedia is a good place for definitiona.
S&P500 is an index. It's a weighted list of 500 companies listed in the USA. Used to follow the development of the stock market.

Many investment funds invest in the same stocks, in the same proportions, as listed in the index. That way, the value of the fund should change the same as the index. Sans fees.

It's a very diversified way to invest into the whole stock market, and is very popular nowadays."
2021-04-21 10:41:18,stocks,For a long investing horizon? TQQQ
2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Two options - 1) liquidate everything and wait for the market to calm down a bit 2) DCA like hell I recently sold my apartment and now sitting on some good cash (almost 200K). And I won't be needing the money for at least a year (then I may want to buy a new apartment).

A part of me is really tired of this randomness/craziness of the market this year and the bandwidth of my time it is taking. Even though I am down like 60K of unrealized gains since mid February, I feel like just liquidating everything (or keep only some solid names like MSFT, APPLE, GOOGL) and come back in a couple of months or after the summer and start putting things in indexes/ETFs only. 

However, looking at how much oversold some stocks seem to be I want to unleash some of this cash (say 50K) and DCA to a good level. For example some of my top holdings are IQQH, TDOC, BAIDU and BABA, and currently I am at these levels:

IQQH (-12%) (about 7k down)

TDOC (-7%) (about 3K)

BAIDU (-9%) (about 3K)

BABA (-2%) (about 1K)

I also have some stocks where I didn't invest as much but seem to have entered at almost their ATHs out of FOMO and been bleeding a lot, like EXPI, where I am like -44% down (-3.5K down),  butterfly (-42%, 2K down), OPENDOOR (-33%, 1.8K down). Though it will be easy to DCA these down considering the amount of money I have invested, I have no idea if they will recover soon (or ever at all). So I would rather take my bet on the likes of tdoc, baba and baidu rather than on these ones. 

which option would you go for if you were me?"
2021-04-21 09:58:21,stocks,"Patience is your biggest asset as a retail trader.    

Generally speaking market timing strategies don't work, you're looking to sell things at a 25%+ loss, and then use DCA to time your way back into the market: But without the ability to predict the future you're just gambling that the market, does what? Goes down slowly over whatever your DCA period is? Otherwise, it is just a 25%+ loss with no real way for DCA to make up for it.  

My advice is:   

 - Do nothing.    
 - Set limits or alerts to auto-exit these positions at **break-even**, since you clearly have no DD/story/plan for the positions (likely months from now).    
 - Invest in low fee index funds since you are bored with actively managing stuff.    
 - Stop pretending you can predict the market. Stop trying to time the market. Stop making rash decisions with no plan or DD."

If from 200k you'll need the 150k for sure, then you could invest 50k in stocks, but if you're planning to use the 200k, don't invest it. Would be better to put it in a money market instrument, get 0.5% for the year and use that to buy the new house.

In general, the more certain you are that you will need the money, the less risky you should be with your investments. Good luck!"
2021-04-21 10:00:54,stocks,"You need to start basing your buying of stocks on research that the company in question supports a higher stock price from where it is today.  Do that research on all your positions, form an opinion about the stock's value today and a year from today.  If there is significant appreciation available, and you would still buy it today, buy it. If not, sell it or sell part of it to buy the stocks you think can appreciate.

If you don't have the time or inclination to do that, then you are better off liquidating it all, putting the capital losses aside to defer future gains, and putting it in some fund family's equivalent of SCHB/SCHF"

NIO is a bet on luxury EVs and battery swapping tech. Good growth in the fastest growing EV market in the world. 

XPEV is a software bet. Their self parking in better than Tesla's. Great growth as well.

2021-04-21 14:59:57,stocks,"As others have stated, there are a lot of new companies in the eV space and a lot of old companies who can compete. Not everyone can survive. Some will need to fold. Question is who? Some randomish thoughts follow..

Tesla is likely ok but their valuation is lunacy. 

Rivian is probably going to be the 2nd biggest due to backing by Amazon and time frames. Their truck is almost here. SUV early next year I think. They also had a lot more time to develop and test so odds are, these guys will make it.

F will be ok because aside from legacy stuff, they own a chunk of Rivian which, ironically, might be worth more than their own company in time.

RIDE - Trashy CEO paid contractors to place pre-orders. Constantly makes lofty statement without basis like 1st truck to market or the 1st ""fleet"" truck. Both are statements are BS and add the fraud and I would avoid this. Its Nikola 2.0.

GM is throwing darts a board hoping to get lucky. 1st it was Nikola but that didnt pan out. Now they sort of have some connection to RIDE but look what those clowns did... GM is cursed (lol).

Canoo - Interesting. Solid engineering group. Pretty open about tech. Stock took a beating. I bought some this morning... should have bought more. Up about 10% already. But I am not trying to steer you, this is still highly speculative.

Lucid - Interesting. Solid team but the stupidest car coming to market... they are making a luxury sedan to compete against the Model S... which already doesnt sell well. /sigh

Volkswagen - Fallout from Emission fraud is still lingering. Basically bunch of liars and thieves who make cheap cars for the masses. Still, they are popular and they are all in on eV but their stock has already climbed a lot so probably not worth it.

Toyota - Late to the party but has eV hybrids. The RAV4 seems nice.

Fiat - Crappy company but I own a Crystler Pacifica PHEV... and its freaking awesome and basically cost $23k new after rebates and write offs (qualifies for Hummer writeoff lol). Never thought I could like a minivan... But anyway, they have some eV plays.  


Charging stations are problematic for a couple of reasons.

1 - They are cheap to make and install. Very simple tech. Its basically an electrical outlet with a meter... practically no barriers to entry.  
2 - Many charge far too much and they have to do that to be profitable. Problem is, most of the time, this makes them parity or even more expensive than octane... people wont go for that. I almost never charge my PHEV outside my home for that reason. I rather just use gas. And long range eV's will probably skip if they can make it home."
2021-04-21 14:44:02,stocks,"I’d like to clear some confusion up that currently surrounds PLUG. The “shady shit” you’re referring to isn’t actually shady, it’s just been spun that was by people who don’t fully understand what they’re reading. 

First, the accounting error: 

Plug has been using KPMG as an independent auditor for 25 years. As a practice, independent auditors rotate the auditor that works with a company every 3-4 years. In Q4 2020 KPMG decided to rotate the auditor working with plug. This auditor that came in to audit the Q4 and Year end results found that he had a different interpretation of the SEC rules for how certain things were accounted for over the past 3 years. Upon consultation with all appropriate players to include Plug and KPMG it was agreed upon that the revelations of this auditor was the correct interpretation. This does not mean that Plug or anyone did anything wrong in the past, and KPMG as the independent auditor has blessed every quarterly and yearly report over this time period. Plug has been very clear that the revelations do not affect Plug's cash position or business relationships. The company recently stated that they are optimistic that the financials will be restated before their ER in early May. 

Second, CEO selling shares:

As for the CEO selling his shares: this was a pre-determined sale in accordance with SEC rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Essentially most executives of publicly traded companies have share sales built into their compensation packages. This sale was scheduled a long time ago, and therefore was not Andy participating in insider trading. He did not sell for any reason other than it was built into his contract to execute on that day. 

Also, there was definitely shady shit going on with plug and GE pre-2008, however Andy Marsh stepped in as CEO in 2008 and turned the company around. 

I hope that sheds light on some of the FUD that has been going around. Plug has a bright future as the leader in a disruptive industry. It seems like every week there is another new, major PR announcement about a partnership or new project developments. 

If you’re still concerned about the future of hydrogen because the infrastructure isn’t there. Well the big oil boys are going to take care of that for us! Shell and Toyota are now forming a plan to develop a hydrogen infrastructure in the US.  Europe and Asia have already begun developing their green hydrogen infrastructures. So the ducks are lining up nicely for plug to succeed.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"$12.3 Trillion in Stimulus Killed the Debt Default Cycle CE Bank of America index data show. Investors have raced one another to lend billions of dollars to cruise companies and airlines even as they bleed cash. The amount of U.S. junk-rated debt included in the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield bond index has surged to a record face value of $1.53 trillion from $1.2 trillion in October 2019.

“Ratings agencies have become comfortable with higher and higher leverage, thus companies are more and more happy to take advantage of it,” Noel Hebert, director of credit research at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a recent article. “There’s an incentive to hold leverage at elevated levels because there’s no real mechanism that’s punishing you.”

It’s easy to look at these valuations paired with more leveraged balance sheets and say risk is being mispriced. Some companies will default, perhaps unexpectedly, even if credit seems priced to perfection now. And yet these yields and low perceived risk of default make perfect sense. In fact, there’s a case for some of these bond yields to go lower.

First, cheap borrowing costs help companies stay alive longer and more easily. That’s a big part of the reason Fitch Ratings just dropped its expected U.S. junk-bond default rate for 2021 to 2%, the lowest since 2017, and doesn’t see it rising much more from that in 2022. About $90 billion of distressed debt was trading as of April 16, down from almost $1 trillion in March 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Second, government officials have flooded the global economy with cash at an unprecedented pace. Monetary and fiscal stimulus for just the U.S. could have amounted to $12.3 trillion from February 2020 through March 2021, according to Cornerstone Macro Research data posted on the Wall Street Journal’s Daily Shot.

That’s a lot of money, leaving a lot of cash sitting in savings accounts and looking for assets to buy. Perhaps some investors feel it’s better to invest it with a company that actually makes something or provides real services than, say, a cryptocurrency started as a joke. 

The more important question perhaps isn’t whether this is a bubble that will pop soon but rather what are the consequences of this era of free-flowing cash. It prevents the dissolution of businesses that perhaps shouldn't exist, creating so-called zombie companies. And it leaves corporations leveraged to old economies, paying back debt incurred in a past era when they perhaps would rather invest in new technologies amid a quickly changing world.

This debt buildup makes central bankers’ jobs both more difficult and easier in the years to come. It makes it harder because any withdrawal of stimulus, or raising of rates, would be exponentially more painful given the amount of corporate leverage. But it also makes it less likely that conditions will require Federal Reserve officials to raise rates all that much going forward. More debt will pressure longer-term growth and inflation. It reduces economic dynamism. 

All this isn’t to say that the lowest-rated bonds can’t lose value in the near term. They can, and according to some investors, are likely to do so. As Oleg Melentyev of Bank of America Global Research wrote in an April 16 note, investors may start to push back after buying a record amount of triple-C rated debt in February.

Funding for these companies “is still wide open, however we think more investors are now struggling at putting their dollars at risk into cap structures levered 14x on a go-forward basis while being paid 650bps to do so, an all-time low,” he wrote. “At some point the reach for yield reaches its limit, and we think it’s here.”

2021-04-21 12:25:49,stocks,"To be honest, I know little to nothing about the airline or cruise business except for one thing: it is insanely expensive to keep these companies running even in the best of times. 

These companies have to invest billions of dollars in planes, boats, fuel contracts, maintenance, etc, just to keep the lights on. They also have to manage vast numbers of employees spread across the globe, deal with insanely complicated regulations in every jurisdiction on the planet, and maintain a physical presence in dozens of locations around the world.  Further, any number of disastrous events, well beyond the control of the company, from disease or accidents, to geopolitical events, or oil prices fluctuations can wreck their investment assumptions and destroy their revenue.  

Further, for airlines, they know they are vital businesses, and the government will keep them flying at, basically, all costs, so they have less incentive to manage their risks.

I have never been a fan of investing in airlines, and currently cruise lines, for these reasons. The businesses are extremely capital intensive, relatively low margin, and susceptible to pretty much every piece of bad economic news."

2021-04-21 14:32:56,stocks,"I think Discord is playing with the IPO idea to increase a future buyout. Their public valuation could end up being huge but realistically based on their business model it would be more of a hype based than performance based stock. And I don’t know why anyone would think the experience would be worse with a Microsoft acquisition than if they push forward an IPO going solo. 

If Microsoft purchases Discord they can immediately allow Discord into the console space via Xbox - an area that Discord has yet to penetrate on any of the major consoles. Microsoft can enjoy whatever monetization already offers but rather than push Discord itself as a main money maker they can instead use Discord as a tool to increase the value of what it already offers (think not only using Discord to improve their gaming communities but also offering a Nitro bundle of GamePass Ultimate). Discord also receives a huge investment from Microsoft into further enhancing their platform (and Microsoft seems to be very hands off with their recent acquisitions focusing instead on making it seamlessly integrate with everything else). 

If Discord goes public they retain more control over their destiny sure, and that can be very good for consumers. On the other hand, Discord is now beholden to the will of the shareholders and will face having to reach certain revenue/growth targets - which may be difficult as it is if they continue to be locked out of the console space (and surely Microsoft will explore a competitive platform instead in this case which, even if it isn’t as good, is still competition and unlike Mixer vs Twitch, Discord doesn’t have sugar daddy Amazon in its corner). If anything Discord will start to explore monetization in this case which could drive away people to other platforms as, like others have said, people aren’t married to Discord. 

Just my two cents, I think it’s smart on their end to try to get the best deal possible but I think going public would, outside of initial hype, be a worse long term decision."

2021-04-21 09:27:45,stocks,"Investing in discords long term future is a horrible idea. Regulations can easily wipe their company off the face off the earth. 

Them being owned by a large company like Microsoft that could afford to automate moderation and other things could cancel out the risk but as their own independent company I don't they could weather a major government regulation crack down like youtube is experiencing

Even then, discord could be here today and gone tomorrow. Its not a very unique idea they have and lots of other companies with large shares in the gaming world could easily do a better version of discord. 

Sure in the next 5 years im sure they will be fine but can you honestly tell me ""I think that I will still be making profits from my discord shares in 2030"""
2021-04-21 14:35:15,stocks,"If you want Discord to become MS Teams, then by all means let the agreement move forward.  Embrace, Extend, Extinguish.  I hope they stay independent..."
2021-04-21 17:12:53,stocks,"Discord is amazing. As a person who’s used it since it’s advent and even wrote simple bots for my channels, the new stuff they come out with continue to amaze me. 

Discord started out as a smooth gaming chat software and continued to grow. I never would’ve thought discord would come out with video, and then they did. Never thought they would come out with streaming, then they did. Now disc can do so many things that even I have no idea how to use, but some person will. They will become a competitor to big social media like Reddit. Perhaps not insta or FB, but big."

2021-04-21 11:03:09,stocks,"I don't really get discord. They've never made an effort to branch out into the enterprise world and make some revenue. Even the exact same product they have now with enterprise licensing and SLAs could bring in a decent amount of money, and with a bit of effort they could easily compete in the Slack/Teams space."
2021-04-21 15:34:13,stocks,">who just got into stock market due to lockdowns.

While that sounds bad the lockdown created some crazy buying opportunities so  it would have been silly not to for some sectors e.g. shipping"

2021-04-21 11:03:51,stocks,"As a not-new but definitely infrequent user of Discord, I feel the program is like a big iceberg with a big chunk under the water. I'm the person who sits on the above surface part; I join VCs with my friends when playing games, and message friends or groups. I've seen what can go beyond that, but boy do I not always understand it.

There's all these bots that people somehow create and utilize. Each group can have a massive hierarchy of...control? Admins, mods, sudo, manager, words that just seem randomly applied as a title (ex: someone can be classified as a lemon?!)

...maybe I'm just getting old?"
2021-04-21 19:39:53,stocks,"Why not, how on earth would they monetize otherwise? Nitro and the games store?"
2021-04-21 12:55:31,stocks,What's this based on?
2021-04-21 14:52:52,stocks,"Or maybe they’re hoping to become a new form of twitch? They are growing rapidly and I don’t know if they’re making that much money. If they wanted to try and compete with Twitch that might’ve been a viable long term option, but I’m sure Microsoft threw a lot of money at them, they’re going to need a real growth strategy if they want to remain independent."
2021-04-21 16:51:54,stocks,If they turned down $10b I'm curious how much Amazon would have to offer.
2021-04-21 15:23:07,stocks,Then mtx the hell out of it. Would probably have to buy bits to post gifs and emotes.
2021-04-21 19:40:30,stocks,That’s what a lot of people thought when twitch bought curse. Then twitch did absolutely nothing with curse.
2021-04-21 19:41:17,stocks,"Yup. That makes a lot of sense. Twitch chat or something.

Is it just going to be impossible for Discord to be anything other than an app for gamers?"
2021-04-21 19:41:31,stocks,Sure hope not
2021-04-21 12:22:24,stocks,Xbox is coming to laptops announced this week. This is huge
2021-04-21 10:16:21,stocks,"It's not even just gaming anymore, although that's obviously still its core user base. It is the go to live chat platform for any interest group though. It's the live chat version of Reddit. Whatever niche interest you have, there's a discord for that somewhere. I'm in discords for the games I play, sports I follow, car and bike I have, and on and on. For someone to challenge them at this point would be a steep hill to climb"
2021-04-21 18:38:13,stocks,"Oh, you're a ""gamer?"" Then name every game. I'll wait."
2021-04-21 10:25:03,stocks,"I just wish teams would let me work on an excel sheet live, but within excel itself. I'm doing some work in excel, and I hate how slow excel is when I just wanna copy data over and view other tabs."
2021-04-21 11:08:47,stocks,"That's not how software works. You don't just smash two software products together. The issues with teams isn't technical knowledge its prioritizes and choices about what is import made by MS. MS isn't just going to look at the way discord is constructed and change their business priories for teams. What they would do is slowly force MS business priorties onto the discord user base. That's the value to MS, the users of discord not the software."
2021-04-21 12:43:27,stocks,Or! All the problems that Teams currently has could easily be transferred over to discord with the way MS likes to handle things *cough* skype... I for one am glad those acquisition talks ended.
2021-04-21 13:15:33,stocks,MS would have killed teams and discord together and presented you with a turd.
2021-04-21 14:07:28,stocks,Skype is a different age of Microsoft tbh. It was bad already and eventually got shuffled into a kind of “it is what it is” category without big attempts to make something big again (though it’s surprisingly popular still in some countries). Current Microsoft I have more faith in how they would take advantage of everything Discord is and could be.
2021-04-21 16:54:44,stocks,My dad had worked at Microsoft for years and was super pissed when they acquired Skype because they had an in house product they had been working on for years and was overall better than skype.  Turns out that in house product was just teams.
2021-04-21 09:43:31,stocks,Exactly. They could be zoom but less overvalued.
2021-04-21 11:05:43,stocks,Nothing happened to skype. It was always bad. Teams is fucking amazing though.
2021-04-21 12:19:30,stocks,"Hmm, maybe. Wonder if they looked at what happened to Slack as a different version of a less-than-ideal future."
2021-04-21 17:31:15,stocks,What are you on about? Skype was shit to begin with.
2021-04-21 09:28:08,stocks,"Wdym bad? Time to round out my lot of MSFT lmao

Edit: it's not dropping lmao"
2021-04-21 09:44:13,stocks,lol.  its never bad to be a MSFT holder.  there is good news and buying opportunities.
2021-04-21 09:29:51,stocks,It's currently up in premarket
2021-04-21 10:15:41,stocks,“Bad for being a Microsoft share holder” - said as the stock nears its all time high.
2021-04-21 08:48:49,stocks,"Discord is doing so well because it hasn't been acquired, so this is great for Discord and their users. Even as a Microsoft holder, Microsoft would have found some way to turn it to shit like they did with skype."
2021-04-21 16:37:20,stocks,I don't think Discord is going to do shit to Microsoft. Enterprise cloud solutions are worth WAY more than anything Discord could ever bring to the table.
2021-04-21 14:50:14,stocks,I think the corporate take over history of Microsoft is what turned people off initially but yeah Discord is growing faster than it’s making money and they’ll eventually have to go in the way of Slack. Microsoft having such a presence in gaming would’ve been a smart integration so I’m interested in what they’re long term strategy is.
2021-04-21 17:38:11,stocks,"On top of that, it would be guaranteed to be stable and funded for the foreseeable future. The devs could then completely focus on making a better product instead of how to pay their wages."
2021-04-21 18:08:53,stocks,"This is the Microsoft way.  Then they will insure Discord is not compatible with Xbox or their gaming services.  Anti-competitive as fuck and this is the only way they can ""innovate""."
2021-04-21 14:35:24,stocks,Does discord actually have many customers?  Or just lots of users?
2021-04-21 17:24:58,stocks,"Some people truly enjoy their work and don't want to hand it over for someone else to potentially take in a different direction.

I mean don't get me wrong, I'd take the offer with no hesitation. But I can see how someone who is already well off financially might not care about the payday as much."
2021-04-21 18:10:19,stocks,"They could have simply been testing the waters to see what their actual value is in terms of dollars. They've pretty much got their niche cornered and I don't think it would be possible at the moment to unseat them.

If Microsoft wants Xbox to truly be a platform agnostic service where you can jump from PC to console and back again, as it stands they need Discord, not the other way around. If you're the CEO then you know that full well and don't need to take the first offer they throw at you."
2021-04-21 19:49:39,stocks,"Probably since he's already a CEO he's wealthy enough so more money would necessarily mean more happiness. 

While on the other hand selling Discord to Microsoft and seeing it being driven into a wall might not be worth even that much money. Not saying that Microsoft would trash Discord, but well that's what they did with Skype."
2021-04-21 11:44:40,stocks,"Not really. They can just IPO for 30 Billion and in this market everyone and their grandma will shove dollars in their face. Hell, they could probably try to IPO at 50 Billion, I mean why not?"
2021-04-21 14:16:09,stocks,I think Amazon added a lot more value than its being given credit for. Twitch prime coming with Amazon prime creates a tremendous ease of entry for a lot of people and also is a constant piece of advertising for Twitch. Plus it helps kill competition - why would someone bother migrating to Mixer (outside of being a die hard fan of a streamer) when they already have the premium version of Twitch by default? Twitch wouldn’t be what it is today without that acquisition as it likely would have seen more competition arise in that time that could actually compete.
2021-04-21 11:44:47,stocks,My thoughts exactly
2021-04-21 17:48:21,stocks,Just a touch? They are miles better than the previous boomersoft
2021-04-21 17:43:41,stocks,It would have allowed them to bridge the gap between console (xbox) players and PC players communicating with each other and help people on both systems transition to gamepass.
2021-04-21 12:25:11,stocks,That's what I thought when they announced interest initially
2021-04-21 11:10:05,stocks,"That was a different Microsoft back then. Their recent acquisitions such as Github have gone perfectly fine, and they've added some technology that would've been unthinkable a few years ago to their main products such as WSL."
2021-04-21 12:34:20,stocks,Who fucking cares about skype though honestly. Microsoft doesn't ruin shit literally almost everything is run on microsoft...
2021-04-21 16:40:55,stocks,"Microsoft is VERY different especially since Satya took over as CEO. His future for Microsoft is almost the opposite of the old. Open source, AI, cloud computing, all available to the masses. The only thing that is still super enterprise is Azure."
2021-04-21 11:45:11,stocks,I only use skybe for business in work. Other than that I can't stand it
2021-04-21 12:23:47,stocks,My stupid sister who ditched WhatsApp and FB and lives overseas. Uses it for messages!
2021-04-21 10:26:17,stocks,"Honest question, what kind of government regulation could harm Discord?"
2021-04-21 17:52:54,stocks,I think you miss the point of why they would want to acquire discord. It's a solution to allowing PC gamers/communities to be able to easily talk to their friend on consoles. Its incredibly frustrating to do that atm. On top of that they could bundle in gamepass with discord nitro.
2021-04-21 17:53:17,stocks,Like what?
2021-04-21 17:53:47,stocks,Creativity doesn't pay bills. Look at slack
2021-04-21 16:30:28,stocks,"Microsoft did not kill Skype. They gave it terminal tumors, cloned it into a degenerate offspring Teams, and left it to die slowly, unloved."
2021-04-21 17:54:27,stocks,Skype was shit to begin with
2021-04-21 11:00:55,stocks,I feel sorry for all the suckers who stayed in gamestop for any long decisions. Everything is GME and I'm sorry but it's not a good company and has very very little chance of changing it's fortunes.
2021-04-21 09:01:18,stocks,Lets play 8ball 😃
2021-04-21 07:58:32,stocks,Happy Cake Day!
2021-04-21 11:16:04,stocks,What if MSFT buys all the shares?
2021-04-21 09:10:47,stocks,"Discord missed a great opportunity here. Microsoft will build its own discord or integrate key features/capabilities into Teams or some O365/Xbox service. Then Discord will regret not being acquired by Microsoft, just like Slack did."
2021-04-21 10:20:38,stocks,"Eh, they have a few options, sell, public, or fade when the next app comes along. I don't see Discord making it the long, longhaul. but hey, I've been wrong."
2021-04-21 10:56:58,stocks,"> all in the name of increasing their profit margin

Source on Discord being profitable? As I understand, it runs at a loss."
2021-04-21 14:46:13,stocks,"Literally this. If they go public, Discord goes downhill fast. It would become a shit service"
2021-04-21 10:52:23,stocks,REALLY GREAT platform. Way faster and better than Microsoft teams. So glad they didn't sell.
2021-04-21 11:30:15,stocks,Oh right.. they are to miss out on payday just so they can keep the purist users warm and cozy
2021-04-21 16:23:43,stocks,"Discord would just be the consumer version of MS Teams, which is heavily b2b focused."
2021-04-21 16:24:35,stocks,Well I mean they are a company. That’s a tall order
2021-04-21 16:28:32,stocks,They already do dumb shit every time a smear article gets released about its users in a certain server.
2021-04-21 18:45:17,stocks,They need the money though. Aren't they losing money every year?
2021-04-21 11:11:31,stocks,"I guess I’m the opposite , discord is great in a lot of ways yes, and still really infantile in other ways too.

Just a nice surge of money would’ve fixed 90% of problems they suffer from right now."
2021-04-21 11:04:52,stocks,"I assumed they sold access to our information and ""talked about topics"" to ad providers plus nitro sales?"
2021-04-21 09:46:04,stocks,Thanks. Edited.
2021-04-21 11:19:49,stocks,You can assign ranks to people and each rank can have designated controls that you set regarding their access to the channel. You can create specific channels and voice chats where only ranks that have the designation can join. It's a really nice system to use.
2021-04-21 16:43:00,stocks,"> ...maybe I’m just getting old

Brother I feel it more every day. It’s not us, it’s them!! They’re the problem!"
2021-04-21 16:44:36,stocks,Right at the beginning they said “think” which generally means it’s an opinion; the basis for which was subsequently provided in the form of reasoning why the company might do this. It’s all speculation but it’s not outside of the realm of possibility.
2021-04-21 18:29:33,stocks,"It would be great to see a new streaming platform that might not fall through. It's gonna be hard to compete with Twitch all on their own, though."
2021-04-21 19:58:57,stocks,$10.1b
2021-04-21 10:36:10,stocks,"Agreed. There's a lot of utility in it. I'm in a stock alert discord, that has bots that give me a notification every time there's new stock for PC parts. I'm in a couple investment discords, a university program discord, friend groups, random hobbies, etc. It's just the perfect platform for so many use cases."
2021-04-21 13:58:33,stocks,"It's really popular with school aged kids just to generally talk and send stuff to friends, not even playing games"
2021-04-21 14:39:48,stocks,"As someone who walks the line with being an old internet user, it's really fascinating to see the resurgence of IRC esque chat rooms and communities. Like you said, even things outside games have big real estate in discord now. No real point to this. Just sorta musing as how the internet centralizes in to fewer websites the niche communities explode in certain platforms"
2021-04-21 16:39:15,stocks,"Yea, but the general audience I find there is either toxic or immature. I think the barrier with things like Slack help alleviate that."
2021-04-21 11:09:09,stocks,You can? The open in desktop app button on the ribbon lets you work on it in excel
2021-04-21 10:30:46,stocks,Yup. Also I received an update recently. They removed the setting to keep my teams as one window while on a conference call. Now I get a new window every time and can’t just click my chat button and video thumbnail to go back and forth.
2021-04-21 17:29:38,stocks,Why would they have done that? When have they done that in the past?
2021-04-21 12:08:47,stocks,"I mean thats sort of the problem. Skype should have been improved over time, but it never was. It stayed the same forever. Audio quality and performance has greatly improved on discord, a lot of subtle changes have helped improve the visual appeal, and the amount of customisation you can have in a server is way better than skype. A few of my friends and I have a server with a joke voice channel entitled “Skype”, where the bitrate in that channel is set to the same as skypes. When we join it and try to talk, we’re reminded just how poor the audio quality was. 

Discord’s base quality is already better than skype, but for anonymity, customisation, and ease of use, it’s miles ahead of anything skype ever hoped to be."
2021-04-21 12:24:11,stocks,What do you like about Teams? I have to use it for work now and I just hate it. What am I missing!
2021-04-21 10:15:19,stocks,That was a different Microsoft from back when Ballmer was the CEO (2011). Look at the LinkedIn (2016) and GitHub (2018) acquisitions. Things are going great. I'm sure MS would handle Discord just fine. Nadella is much better than Ballmer.
2021-04-21 11:07:16,stocks,Skype was literally always shit. It was the only free option.
2021-04-21 11:51:57,stocks,"Everyone says this but Skype is really the only big example where Microsoft has done this. They honestly usually back off when it comes to forcing changes on companies they acquire. For example, LinkedIn, Mojang and Github"
2021-04-21 14:49:35,stocks,I feel that Microsoft is more interested in how well Discord can do video chat and screen sharing vs their user/customer base. That’s the main reason anyone uses discord. It’s really easy to just pop in a room and share your screen and video without having to “call” anyone or set up a conference meeting deal.
2021-04-21 11:43:48,stocks,That’s fair I haven’t used anything in recent times of anything they’ve acquired but I just remember before like 2015 they ruined pretty much everything they touched
2021-04-21 11:52:51,stocks,Unless you have to use it for stuff like that i understand. I haven’t used it since probably 2013 because of how bad it was discord is great on the other hand.
2021-04-21 18:18:39,stocks,"Anyone can post anything to discord. If the government starts holding companies liable for content posted on their website [which could definitely happen in the coming years unfortunately] than discord couldn't keep up with moderation well enough to be able to stay afloat when paying fines for all the fucked up shit people could be posting on discord

During the trump administration legislation like this was almost passed, it could harm a lot of [relatively] small social media websites that cant afford to keep up with moderation.


People can downvote all they want but they are down voting specifically because they don't want to hear that, but it's a very real concern and as someone thats worked in social media moderation for 5+ years i can tell you its a concern a lot of people in the industry have. This is a thing that companies will eventually have to deal with, and the amount of work that it would take to comply with these regulations could easily eat up most of discords profit, they will have to either hire a massive squad of admins, centralize discord into fewer communities or some how create an AI that can moderate discord effectively"
2021-04-21 18:06:33,stocks,"I'm definitely not saying Microsoft couldn't stand to benefit.  I've just seen so many of Microsoft's acquisitions turn into nothing more than short term support before they band-aid their own similar solutions with inferior copycat functionality, then discontinue the original service or application.

I think Discord is a great service and would like to see it continue to succeed and thrive.  I fear an acquisition by a big corporation would soon lose sight of the original value the company offers (and the objectives it serves) and become a watered down version of its former self."
2021-04-21 12:13:57,stocks,Bless your little delusional heart.
2021-04-21 09:01:59,stocks,Thank you!
2021-04-21 11:18:42,stocks,"I really hope they won’t, but definitely a possibility. We will have to wait and see. But good point.:)"
2021-04-21 09:20:48,stocks,"Don't get me wrong, I think they definitely could create their own discord, but I think it would be very difficult to convert discord users to microsoft users. Only time can tell of course, but I feel like discord has to strong a reputation to fall to a microsoft look alike."
2021-04-21 09:49:23,stocks,"Teams has an enterprise flavor and built for work, no one is gonna use teams for personal leisure. Microsoft really doesn't have a product to compete against discord."
2021-04-21 09:23:03,stocks,"The major difference is that Slack is a much more business-centric platform than Discord is. It's easier to compete with Slack because there was still some untapped market to obtain - some companies were still on Outlook - and to compete on price and bundles. On the other hand, Discord is already free, so Microsoft cannot compete purely through price. It is also much different than Teams on an usage basis. 

In addition, it has become a platform for interest groups more than communication - niche programming languages, foreign music, local community activities - that is difficult to replicate. MS wants its platform along its community, as the platform itself isn't worth much."
2021-04-21 09:35:08,stocks,"I think Discord will be _fine_ in terms of what they are now, but I agree with you generally. A lot of Discord's growth opportunities are in business, and I think MS would have really helped them break in there, whereas now they're going to have to compete with Slack, Teams, and a bunch of other stuff that's already better integrated with all the other stuff businesses need."
2021-04-21 10:04:46,stocks,Yes I would agree. Discord is great but it’s not un-recreatable.
2021-04-21 10:39:44,stocks,"I agree. 10bn is a lot. There’s no way they can achieve that public or private. 
On the other hand, I applaud them for sticking to their guns and not being another big tech buyout."
2021-04-21 11:13:39,stocks,"Yeah wtf is so awesome about Discord anyway? I'm a software guy so sometimes I'm like ""Zoom at x billion? I don't get it, I can already video chat, how many billion is that beach background worth now?"""
2021-04-21 12:22:49,stocks,Is slack regretting it? I could be wrong but I thought they were doing pretty well after being bought by Salesforce
2021-04-21 12:44:57,stocks,Or they could go the other way and push security. Become the only secure chat platform with the level of functionality they currently have.
2021-04-21 19:03:53,stocks,"Yeah, they will get killed.  Look at how much Slack lost value when MS decided to build Teams instead.  Slack is a terrible stock market investment. They got acquired by CRM (Sales Force) and this stock still hasn't recovered.  Microsoft is on a roll."
2021-04-21 10:00:20,stocks,"Remember when Groupon turned down $6 Billion from Google?  How’s that going?  Look at how Microsoft destroyed GitHub.  Oh wait, they didn’t touch it.  Discord made an error, I think."
2021-04-21 11:48:28,stocks,"Skype has had a steady decline in active users after Microsoft bought it. It had a resurgence during the pandemic but was easily outmatched by Zoom and Discord. 

Microsoft would toss some money into a Discord/other Microsoft apps integration project, release updates that only half work, and eventually just take the aspects of Discord that work and put them into Teams. Discord would still be around but with only half the attention and money put into maintaining it."
2021-04-21 12:12:52,stocks,Remember when microsoft absolutely destroyed twitch with mixer?
2021-04-21 10:14:49,stocks,">Then Discord will regret not being acquired by Microsoft, just like Slack did.

How did this work out for Skype?

Microsoft has billions, if they wanted to make their own Discord, they could have by now. Microsoft tends to ruin social / communications platforms they acquired."
2021-04-21 09:45:19,stocks,"No one is gonna move to a Microsoft voice platform. discord is too versatile and frankly loved by so many communities. Microsoft may make their own console version, but on PC, there really isn’t a contest. Plus most discord users I know really weren’t happy about the idea that discord would be bought out. It’s enjoyed a lot as is."
2021-04-21 10:01:27,stocks,"MS has failed much more than they have succeeded recently.  
Zune, Internet Explorer/Edge, Skype/Teams... people don't have faith in them like they used to.  
Can they make a comparable platform... sure, but will people use it? Ask google how their FB like platform worked out (google +)."
2021-04-21 10:58:13,stocks,"Ideally, Microsoft could just allow integration of discord on their Xbox platform while discord will still have the opportunity to offer integration across all platforms. I prefer discord as their own entity because their reach is endless"
2021-04-21 11:00:46,stocks,"I, selfishly, am really happy here. Discord is phenomenal and I am not worried about Microsoft teams catching up to discord anytime soon. Teams is a disaster"
2021-04-21 11:07:16,stocks,“Skype for Gamers” anyone?
2021-04-21 11:09:39,stocks,Or they could have just treated their new toy like stadia or any other number of projects they take on just to abandon because they got bored...I think this would have been an absolute disaster for discord in the long run
2021-04-21 12:18:35,stocks,I agree with you
2021-04-21 12:27:56,stocks,Build their own like xbox live chat? Lol.
2021-04-21 12:33:53,stocks,What did Microsoft do to replicate slack?
2021-04-21 12:38:42,stocks,"Microsoft will make a milquetoast version of Discord, not promote it past the first six months, then axe the idea two or three years later. 

I doubt Discord is missing much."
2021-04-21 13:04:11,stocks,"But did you forget that its microsoft we are takking about? You know, the same company that ran skype to the ground?"
2021-04-21 14:01:33,stocks,"Microsoft can make a shittier Discord, it doesn't mean people will leave Discord in a meaningful number."
2021-04-21 14:35:09,stocks,teams is hot trash
2021-04-21 15:11:06,stocks,"I think you’re not properly analyzing the situation.  Teams is different.  Everyone is forced to use teams at work now... then people get used to it and may continue to use it in their personal lives.  No one is going to choose to leave discord just because Microsoft builds a competitor.

Microsoft’s relationships with business is what made teams succeed and that was a no brainer."
2021-04-21 15:20:47,stocks,Unlikely. Discord users will almost definitely not switch to another similar product from Microsoft.
2021-04-21 15:21:36,stocks,"In terms of money they can squeeze a lot more from a public offering. As far as what’s best for consumers of course Microsoft is favourable, but in the eyes of the investors they can definitely squeeze more."
2021-04-21 15:27:28,stocks,"They tried to do that with Skype but discord overtook them, precedent would suggest that microsoft would find it very difficult to overtake discord"
2021-04-21 15:31:46,stocks,"Pft, no way. Microsoft has been on a downward trend with mainstream popular products, e.g. the miserable failure of Skype.  

Also, I'm certain Slack isn't regretting getting acquired by Microsoft, Slack is constantly being integrated in different areas of work, e.g. universities, and is being called ""The Discord for professionals"" and it's not going away anytime soon. 

Plus the only reason why Windows is around is because businesses/corporations use it. Microsoft's been emulating Linux features lately to try to keep up with that market but I think it's a little too late for that move."
2021-04-21 15:33:38,stocks,"Because Microsoft totally did all that with Skype despite it being their plans to do so, everything they bought turn into shit to accomodate normal and business users. Discord is not going to be beaten by Microsoft, which was why Microsoft wanted to buy it instead of spending giant R&D fees to build one from ground up."
2021-04-21 17:03:53,stocks,"Discord has an incredibly loyal customer base. I highly doubt microsoft could compete. Very similar to twitch. Microsoft tried to compete with that, but you just cant beat some of these companies once customers get loyal to them. They dont need microsoft. Only reason theyd take that offer was to retire and let discord go to shit under a different company."
2021-04-21 17:49:08,stocks,"They might have, but they can do better on there own.

Discord has taken over anything related to gaming and chatting with other gamers.

Discord has captured the market, and I dought there is much Microsoft can do about it. Yes, they can make their own version, but I think most people who use discord know Microsoft is basically just spyware at this point. I wouldn't switch. Not without a SUPER compelling reason."
2021-04-21 18:11:42,stocks,Not sure how much Microsoft was offering in 2016 but Slack got bought out by Salesforce for $27.7 bil so I think they're chillin now
2021-04-21 18:14:49,stocks,They could begin with a fuckin push to talk button in teams ...
2021-04-21 10:32:02,stocks,"Nah, Discord has its own culture.  Most people in most of the servers I'm in were very opposed to the acquisition.  I think it will be hard to move established Discord users to a new service."
2021-04-21 11:12:49,stocks,"They have brand power. They are the ""cool"" way to talk to your friends. They can only grow and expand into new demographics. Microsoft could easily ruin their brand and platform, like they did with Skype. 

Who's to say that microsoft's alternative won't be a hokey ""hey fellow kids"" mess? They failed with a twitch alternative. Slack is a poor example because it's an office platform and that's a market that Microsoft ahem excel's in..."
2021-04-21 11:21:38,stocks,"> Discord missed a great opportunity here. Microsoft will build its own discord 

\^\^ Found the MS fanboy.

MS isn't going to do shit. And even if it does it's going to end up like Mixer. PEOPLE HATE MS. Nobody uses MS products by choice."
2021-04-21 11:30:33,stocks,"They will try, but fail. Teams is awful software. Why wouldn't their Discord clone not also be?"
2021-04-21 12:10:19,stocks,"have you used any microsoft based UI in the past decade? its all awful, the xbox companion app and social crap that clutters the windows pc gaming experience is too much of a headache to deal with and this is coming from someone with atleast 6 different game launchers on their windows.

sure they could do something on xbox but who cares whatever it would just be another microsoft exclusive thing"
2021-04-21 12:50:06,stocks,What makes you think users are going to swap to microsoft's from discord? Not many will switch their community to a new platform. Xbox players probably but lets not forget discord is not merely for gaming.
2021-04-21 17:27:53,stocks,"Going public will probably mean aggressive monetization that may kill the platform. It's very much a move that benefits any existing share owners.

Does discord really need more investment to turn profitable? 

To me it sounds like they to rethink their monetization model - now is the perfect time to do it because they still have the reins."
2021-04-21 19:35:04,stocks,"They already have an intertwined user base, the hardest part would be to pay streamers the same rate as twitch partners"
2021-04-21 17:34:33,stocks,Would you mind sharing the pc part stock alert discord?
2021-04-21 19:11:51,stocks,I’m nearly 30 and keep in touch with hs friends via discord
2021-04-21 18:11:04,stocks,"I’m a teen, can confirm."
2021-04-21 12:39:42,stocks,I think it depends on your IT department. Mine won't allow me to
2021-04-21 16:30:18,stocks,"Maybe I'm a dummy, but I actually like the fact that they aren't updating Skype every 3 seconds.  It's annoying to have to learn new features and layouts and stuff.  I use Skype all the time and have never noticed a problem with the quality, but I guess I would if I compared head to head."
2021-04-21 12:29:05,stocks,"I guess it depends on how your office organizes it. Dropping into a call instead of needing to use the phone, calendar organization and meeting set up is seemless between it and outlook, taking notes within a meeting then saving that to your project team, pretty much every aspect of it is great imo. Our office used to use slack before hand. There are some nuancey things missing that make it more customizable but it's only like a year or two old at this point, sure it will come around."
2021-04-21 15:17:12,stocks,"We have ai bots that automate a bunch of tasking, emails, and follow ups. 

I also like pinning documents to channels for easy access and collaboration."
2021-04-21 11:20:50,stocks,TIL Microsoft owns LinkedIn and github
2021-04-21 11:38:06,stocks,The only way Microsoft can stay relevant is by acquiring other companies. LinkedIn might be worse than facebook in managing user data
2021-04-21 16:35:12,stocks,"Github is great, but LinkedIn feels like a spamming platform most of the time."
2021-04-21 16:38:47,stocks,"LinkedIn has always been meh and GitHub hasn't changed much since it was acquired. Free private repos is the only big change I can really think of, and BitBucket was already doing that."
2021-04-21 15:46:27,stocks,"Bullshit lmao. Skype at its prime was the voice chat software to use, they fucking killed RaidCall and XFire. Even TeamSpeak couldn't break Skype's monopoly, which was why Microsoft decided to acquire Skype. But then Skype was murdered by Microsoft and became a complete joke while TeamSpeak was still dog shit, how did you think Discord managed to break in and completely dominate the market space?"
2021-04-21 12:17:23,stocks,Nokia didn't go to well either.
2021-04-21 12:20:40,stocks,"Okay friend, it's your money not mine. If you think I'm delusional then for your sake I hope that's true"
2021-04-21 12:25:15,stocks,You think he's delusional for not thinking GameStop and Discord will merge? What?
2021-04-21 09:31:13,stocks,"Discord users and microsoft users are not mutually exclusive.

if they offered a better solution I don't see why discord users would refuse to switch.

Now, do I think they'll offer a better solution.  No, not really."
2021-04-21 11:32:19,stocks,"Dude. Dude... my dude. You have no sense of the economic power of Microsoft, if you think they couldn’t turn this around."
2021-04-21 10:03:46,stocks,The likelihood that Microsoft builds a competitor good enough to steal their market seems slim to none.
2021-04-21 10:24:24,stocks,"Discord users have no loyalty. It's just a chat/call app. Teamspeak, skype, hangouts, discord, slack, irc even. All used in my circle. People, especially gamers which are discord's primary demographic, will use whatever to communicate. In a few years a new player will come and wipe the floor with discord and everyone will move there."
2021-04-21 10:00:37,stocks,Only way it works is if Xbox users can party chat with PC users for cross platform games.
2021-04-21 11:39:45,stocks,"More than likely what would happen is whatever Microsoft develops, it will be their new native chat app that they integrate into Xbox and PC, so they'd be guarentee'd a user base, it wouldn't necessarily be stealing from discord, but it would create that one more app for people to have use"
2021-04-21 14:14:22,stocks,"Everyone moved from Skype and Teamspeak to Discord virtually overnight because Discord has so many great features tailor made for gamers and was totally free. If Microsoft wants to build their own version, as long as they have some killer features, I think it would be a relatively swift transition. Krisp noise suppression is going to be really hard to beat, though. Such a nice feature."
2021-04-21 10:21:59,stocks,"There's a ton of gaps in Discord. Much like how so many people moved from teamspeak to Discord, people would quickly move from Discord to Microsoft-XYZ if it were better"
2021-04-21 10:22:19,stocks,"75% of Americans have a windows PC, and thus, almost certainly a Microsoft account. a few more have no PC, but have an xbox, again..."
2021-04-21 14:55:11,stocks,"Xbox chat on Windows is pretty terrible too. For example my girlfriend and I play Sea of Thieves together and it almost always joins us into a 2nd party chat when we join a game even though we're already in a party.  The voice quality is meh, the UI is basically non-existent, and the text chat is worse than 2002 MSN messenger.  I honestly thought it was a smart pickup for Microsoft but always up for more competition."
2021-04-21 16:11:05,stocks,"They said the same thing about Ventrillo, TeamSpeak, etc. We all switched in the end."
2021-04-21 16:47:34,stocks,"> discord has to strong a reputation to fall to a microsoft look alike.

So is Slack. MS Teams will crush it handily. It's already taking over in my country. I've interviewed at least 60 times earlier this year and all companies used MS Teams."
2021-04-21 17:43:02,stocks,nah that's a segmented base and people like me who are not fans of discord but want a tool with the same capabilities will flock to the MS option.
2021-04-21 19:01:22,stocks,That depends on how accesible and convenient their platform is.
2021-04-21 19:03:00,stocks,Actually with the amount of cross-platform play now it's a huge drag that Xbox users can't join a discord with PC users so I feel like they would actually have a pretty easy time getting people to at least use it when they're playing cross-platform with their friends who don't have PCS
2021-04-21 11:22:48,stocks,">very difficult to convert discord users to microsoft users.

Nobody chooses to use Microsoft products that is under the age of 50."
2021-04-21 09:33:18,stocks,A lot of Discord's growth opportunities are in the business sector though.
2021-04-21 12:46:04,stocks,"Slack wanted to be the enterprise chat/collab service. Now that Salesforce has them they are limited to that Salesforce customer base. O365 is prolific in mid to large enterprises and state, federal and education verticals. Slack will have much less exposure now."
2021-04-21 11:06:28,stocks,"Working with GitHub Enterprise (cloud version, not self hosted) since the takeover has been a massive PITA. We lost all our discounts since we don't have a Microsoft Service Agreement, few new features have been released and those that have are behind new additional licensing costs. They also cut the costs of the non Enterprise tiers.

GitHub has also been less reliable than since I've been using it."
2021-04-21 19:16:17,stocks,Was scrolling down looking for that comment
2021-04-21 10:45:38,stocks,That's Microsoft 10 years ago you're talking about. They've been doing a great job with Github so far. I would be much more worried about Discord going public than being acquired by MS
2021-04-21 10:47:53,stocks,"Microsoft bought Skype, re-architected it to be cloud hosted and got business adoption. Then they took the code for Skype and made it cloud native and called it Teams. Not a bad evolution."
2021-04-21 10:37:26,stocks,"That's what makes me think MS was just interested in Discord to remove a potential competitor from the market, and absorb whatever user-base they could in the process. 

""Discord - A Microsoft app"" would have only existed long enough to migrate everyone to some other MS product."
2021-04-21 15:44:42,stocks,"Slack current market cap is 24.59B, the Microsoft acquisition target was 22B

Yeah I think Slack is fine."
2021-04-21 10:43:29,stocks,"> Zune, Internet Explorer/Edge, Skype/Teams

By what metric are you using the term, ""recently?"""
2021-04-21 10:54:09,stocks,I think if you compare their failures to Google it's quite a stark contrast. Microsoft goes all in before they shelf a product. Look at how Google abandons platforms or projects so often. At least Microsoft provides a migration path for customers. Google just posts an end of life update and well wishes to their users. They move people's cheese like it's nobody's business.
2021-04-21 10:51:40,stocks,"Tell that to the Cisco Jabber aka WebEx Teams, Adobe Connect business users who migrated in droves to Microsoft Teams. Teams is the largest UCC business messagging platform in the world now all because Microsoft made it cloud native and free with their enterprise M365 licenses."
2021-04-21 17:37:30,stocks,"It's specifically for availability in Canada, so DM me if you're in canada and I'll send it to you."
2021-04-21 15:23:30,stocks,But that’s not a Microsoft issue then. Most people who complain it’s because they want a user friendly way to do this imo. Don’t blame them but most features are enabled it’s just difficult to find/use
2021-04-21 16:51:03,stocks,"Discord releases changes gradually, and in doing so the changes are much less noticeable and easier to adapt to. They aren’t foolishly redesigning their UI for no reason every other month. There’s minor improvements which have made administrating servers vastly easier. The audio quality is noticeably better on discord. It’s improved to match the improvements made with other VOIP systems over the years. The use of dedicated servers for call hosting also means that one person with bad internet cant ruin the call for everyone else, which was a running problem we had with skype."
2021-04-21 12:38:00,stocks,I guess some of it is team integration. No one in my org uses teams for calls (webex instead) so I can see that it would be nice if we actually used it. I find a lot of microsoft products to be more clunky on mac than they are on windows too so for all I know it could just be a worse experience for us. Thanks for your perspective!
2021-04-21 15:39:58,stocks,"Because Microsoft leave it alone and let the dev teams do their thing, that's why most people don't know they were acquired. They learned their lesson after forcefully intergrating Skype into Microsoft house brand during ~~boomer~~ Ballmer era. The subsequent change of devs within the Skype also lead to the Skype hacking accidents which completely killed the userbase."
2021-04-21 15:33:09,stocks,"LinkedIn has its own enterprise revenue streams, it doesn't rely on user data in the same way that Facebook does."
2021-04-21 16:57:26,stocks,That's not the only way but it is one way to use their big finances. Buybacks would be another.
2021-04-21 15:53:43,stocks,"....it was the shiniest turd of the turd field. Me and my friends would use skype religiously for gaming. Dating back to pre-LOL beta so whenever that was. It always had issues as far as I could remember. Discord broke in because it's light weight and has server channels, which is completely different than how skype worked."
2021-04-21 13:56:01,stocks,The problems was being more of a bad acquisition than them actually ruining the products
2021-04-21 13:23:11,stocks,Probably right but then again aren't we all. Perception is reality.
2021-04-21 13:25:10,stocks,Never said that. Don't put words in my comments that do not exist. Misquoting comments is how crap gets twisted. Bless your little twisted heart.
2021-04-21 09:49:01,stocks,"Microsoft already has the chat system integrated into Xbox and Windoes 10 (and mobile?) for gaming. While Console players use it (because Discord isn't easy to use with console), everyone I know on PC uses Discord. Most gaming communities for streaming are on Discord. Most companies have support channels on Discord. 

Discord users would refuse to switch simply because everyone they chat with is already on Discord. The same thing happened when Mincrosoft tried to compete with Twitch by creating Mixer. Microsoft even bought out the top streamers and nobody from the community followed. They ended up shutting Mixer down because they knew they couldn't compete with Twitch. 

The same thing would happen with Microsoft Gaming Console Chat if they tried to compete more with Discord. Discord holds the majority of users for gaming chat, and they know this. Microsoft know this which is where the offer came from. That's probably why Discord refused the offer. 10bn? Naw Discord can make that in revenue in no time at all. Especially since Covid hit any everything was forced to move online. 

TL:DR Even if Microsoft offered a better solution, people wouldn't switch."
2021-04-21 09:43:39,stocks,This right here. If Microsoft had bought Discord they would have killed it with ads and a terrible user experience. Discord is an amazing service right now and there’s no way it would have improved if they sold. People talking about how Microsoft will just make its own discord don’t realize just how good discord is right now or aren’t thinking about all of Microsoft’s failed ventures that they threw billions at just because they could. Discord remaining independent is the right move.
2021-04-21 09:54:33,stocks,"Discord users and Microsoft users definitely overlap. Unfortunately for them, just because I use Windows 10 doesn't mean I like Microsoft.

To add onto your point that they will not offer a better solution, I often look at the Microsoft Store and their Xbox Console Companion apps for reference - they are very, very bad. While Microsoft Store isn't a direct comparison, it is notoriously and needlessly troublesome for its users.

Xbox Console Companion is very close comparison, and it allows Microsoft accounts to function across PCs and Xbox hardware. It has been in beta/dev stage for its entire existence, and the worst part of the system is the most important part of the system, the voice chat.

Convenience. Familiarity. Their friends are still on discord. The communities they like are on discord.

2021-04-21 11:06:06,stocks,Xbox party chat has been on PC since Windows 10 came out. Phil Spencer has been really pushing for PC-Xbox parity and they 100% have the potential to make a strong Discord competitor.
2021-04-21 09:49:33,stocks,"I don't see a good viable strategy in the business sector personally. It's saturated enough with Zoom, Teams and Slack. The functionality Discord can fetch can be implemented by its competitors. Maybe it can try to get some revenues off it, but I don't see it getting that much of a market share. 

A Discord that goes full-on towards monetization would do better as a social platform than as a workspace tool."
2021-04-21 09:54:53,stocks,"Against what? Slack? Google Cloud/Azure bundles of Google Meet/Teams respectively? 

In terms of going from B2C to B2B, the closest comparison to Discord right now is actually Facebook Groups/Messenger which, to the best of my knowledge, FB has been trying to push as a potential work/collaboration app.

B2B is a totally different beast from consumer, and I don’t really see why Discord offers something more than any of the already existing enterprise communication tools like Slack, Meet, or Teams. Saying it has the biggest growth potential in that area is probably true from a market penetration standpoint, but Discord’s current model seems to be more social media/content subscription (I.e. nitro vs Twitch.tv) than as workspace. I can’t really see them being interested in going B2B."

Small correction, Microsoft bought Beam and renamed it to Mixer.  My friends and I still miss Mixer - it had the lowest latency streams out of all of them, by far.  We basically played games in real time with each other.  Discord is close, but still has a small delay."

I play DnD on discord with friends every week because we can have video chat, text/image sharing, and a DnD bot to facilitate gameplay. And while sure, Microsoft could copy Discord, to actually match it they'd need to convince the community developers to also move over to their platform."

I don't buy that. It's like refusing to download TikTok because everyone you know is already on Instagram. These kids like trying new things if there's hype around it.

2021-04-21 09:52:03,stocks,"Microsoft already has a Discord'ish product with Teams. They didn't want the tech they wanted the customers. 

I use Teams every day at work and it is very akin to Discord. The big difference is a few features and the fact Teams is stylized and marketed towards business interaction where Discord is where you go to hang with friends while you game. 

I don't see MS getting the Discord user base without buying Discord simply because the opportunity to switch is already there and clearly people are not making that move."
2021-04-21 09:58:05,stocks,Agreed. Microsoft would just fuckup discord. Its already a great product that doesn't need to be changed in anyway.

2021-04-21 14:01:53,stocks,">If Microsoft had bought Discord they would have killed it with ads and a terrible user experience.

They bought LinkedIn and GitHub recently and haven't done that.  Granted those are enterprise facing and not consumer facing, but I think they just wanted to fold it into GamePass, giving you Nitro as part of a GamePass Ultimate subscription.  Some targeted ads eventually, but that's going to come regardless.  Sooner or later all companies have to make money."
2021-04-21 10:23:57,stocks,I figured they would add Discord to the Xbox and get rid of “party chat” to bridge the gap between their console and PC players- being that Xbox apps on the computer are awful.

The point is that discord is not in a unique position and it would, in no way, be the first massively popular messenger service to be replaced by one that offers something more.

> Saying it has the biggest growth potential in that area is probably true from a business standpoint, but Discord’s current model seems to be more social media/content subscription (I.e. nitro vs Twitch.tv) than as workspace.

I think you drastically underestimate the amount of growth potential/revenue in the business sector. Discord's revenue in 2020 was $130M. That's pretty small compared to the business market. Zoom and Slack for comparison were in the $600M range."
2021-04-21 19:01:46,stocks,Yeah functionally it is fine. Except for the outages. Working with them in a business to business relationship has become hard.
2021-04-21 17:40:17,stocks,"Ya that was probably a stretch. 

I mean, this is definitely not my area of expertise,  but seeing thier revenue almost double (Sometimes more then double) ever year would put them at a hefty amount in let's say 3 to 4 years? I know the trend won't continue forever (or maybe it will, lol) but even making 500M$ in revenue a year will put them at 10BN$ in 20 years. I would like to think these companies think in long terms like that so it's not farfetched. 

I know that's not ""no time at all"" but I wasn't crunching numbers when I wrote this."
2021-04-21 14:01:44,stocks,"True, I remember streaming on Mixer for a bit and feeling like it was a really nice platform. The low latency thing was awesome as well as the costreams. It's a shame that it didn't work out."

Discord is not only better now, but has one of the best video call features on any app I've used. Ever.

Not to mention setting up a server is super easy, adding friends, sharing media, everything that TeamSpeak lacked"

2021-04-21 10:39:19,stocks,"You're correct. But I think Discord has reached a point that TeamSpeak never did.

2021-04-21 16:49:20,stocks,"They didnt ime, the community in the past was always very split, some on vent, some mumble, ts probably had the most but it was always annoying having 5 different voice apps for the different groups/games i played. Discord has a monopoly like never before."
2021-04-21 12:43:30,stocks,"Discord servers develop history, there is a big difference."
2021-04-21 12:36:36,stocks,"In another comment I already stated that TeamSpeak (or any of those services) weren't anywhere close to being as big as Discord is now. There's a certain level of popularity that, once gained,  is hard to kill. So many things being integrated into Discord have kind of sealed its spot as the number 1 Gaming Chat. 

Don't get me wrong. I don't think it's completely impossible for a competitor to come up and steal the number 1 spot, I just think it's highly unlikely because 2 things need to happen for that to take place. 

1. Discord has to make a change in its software that users consider ""bad"", thus driving people away.

2. Another company needs to come along and create a software that actually competes with Discord. 

While both of these things can happen, the likelihood of both happening at the same time is very low. Discord's Dev team is amazing and they actually listen to the community. So it would be really hard for number 1 to happen. 

Number 2 has yet to happen, and with companies trying to make thier own software left and right, more people are trying to stick to 1 thing. I don't want to have to download 7 different apps to talk to my friends. I'm pretty sure a competitor (even with a better interface) couldn't compete with Discord. But again, this is just what I believe. Doesn't mean it's true."
2021-04-21 12:55:52,stocks,"You're right, I shouldn't have made it sound like that's the only reason. 

TeamSpeak is to MySpace as Discord is to Facebook. Even though Twitter came along, Facebook is still around today and well used. I stated this in another comment, but a company can reach a certain level of popularity that's hard to kill. I believe Discord has reached that popularity and isn't going anywhere. The Dev team is awesome and they know how to stay relevant by listening to thier users."
2021-04-21 10:30:51,stocks,"I don't think that analogy translates well because Discord is mainly meant for communicating and not so much consuming content. A person can have a Tik Tok AND an Instagram and watch content on both, but if me and my community have a Discord, and you are on Skype, there's no way for you to communicate with us. 

You would need to convince whole communities to switch en masse and that doesn't work well (or really at all) as proven by Mixer trying to compete with Twitch."
2021-04-21 12:39:26,stocks,"Nothing Microsoft makes will generate enough hype to take significant users from discord. Discord has an extremely strong feature set and loyal user base.

That’s not to say they can’t lose their users, but if they do it will be because they fucked up their product or started charging for it. If they remain on their current trajectory, no one is abandoning it for some Microsoft clone."

2021-04-21 10:24:16,stocks,"I don't mind teams at work, in fact I prefer it over several other platforms. But if my friends asked me to hop in teams to play some WoW I would vomit a little.

2021-04-21 15:34:53,stocks,"Microsoft actually had Mixer latency better than it ever was before, the only reason Microsoft killed it was because they thought it would turn a profit in less than a year (which was just an absurd estimation) so when they realised it may be half a decade before it pulls Twitch levels of profits they just dumped the whole project"
2021-04-21 12:35:33,stocks,"people are just used to it, but their software is trash, office 365 is so bad compared to Google workspace, skype and teams are garbage, windows 10 is so buggy and inconsistent, the ui is all over the place, there's no windows update that doesn't break something, I have to wait a couple of months for the known issues to be fixed, the Microsoft store is horrible, what keeps Microsoft afloat is their cloud infrastructure (which IMHO is the worst of the big 3) and that people refuse to change their OS and also there's a lot of compatibility with most applications"

2021-04-21 15:11:36,stocks,You do realize that Mixer had lower latency because it had fewer users right? Meaning if Mixer actually got big it would face the exact same latency as twitch.
2021-04-21 11:19:14,stocks,"This. 

Vent and teamspeak were only ever used because they were the best options available at the time. Being the best doesn't mean it's not still garbage. 

They made some cheap software with low effort then threw it out there for people to set up on their own or pay. 

Discord came along with an already polished bit of software ever since beta, they have continued to improve it leaps and bounds, and they listen to the community. 

Great software. Free for most users. Amazing UI. Devs who listen to the community. Microsoft couldn't replace this if they tried. 

I care about these things so I may be biased though. Someone who literally only cares about a chat program they use once or twice a week/month may not."

Discord took over because it offered an experience so vastly better than TeamSpeak that they got enough people to switch. If Microsoft can do that with Discord (doubtful, but you never know) then they'd get people to switch eventually."
2021-04-21 14:07:58,stocks,I think only way MSFT takes over Discord is if they don't cap upload sizes. Having to pay to send my friends a video is the only negative I see with Discord.
2021-04-21 14:07:55,stocks,"ok, you are getting confused.

The statement was made that no one will switch away from discord because they're too attached to it.

I replied pointing out that people absolutely will switch if a better product is offered

Now you're arguing about whether or not the next product will be better or whether MS can create a better product.  This is a totally and completely different argument than what was originally stated."

I personally prefer slack over teams for communications but can live with teams, and windows has gotten quite a bit better in recent years.

The point I'm trying to make is if you set aside fanboyism of whatever given ecosystem you prefer, they...by far...have the most popular sets of software out there.  I call bs on the argument of ""all their software is trash"".  If that were the case they would not literally be the touchpoint that other companies judge their success by.

2021-04-21 16:53:23,stocks,">two days later

>Microsoft in talks to buy PornHub"
2021-04-21 15:13:33,stocks,I did not realize that. But it makes a lot of sense.
2021-04-21 16:13:00,stocks,How would you know the reason.. Did you work for Mixer?
2021-04-21 11:33:37,stocks,"Same here, I feel a bit of fervor and brand loyalty to them for providing me with many years of amazing service for free. 

Many of those long night gaming sessions would've been shit without discord.

trying to change servers for the umpteenth time hoping this one has an empty room like on ts was an absolute pain"
2021-04-21 14:03:45,stocks,"> Vent and teamspeak were only ever used because they were the best options available at the time. Being the best doesn't mean it's not still garbage.

and if the next ""best software"" comes along, people will move to it.  

Again, the point being made is that the argument that ""people won't leave discord"" is bs.  You're trying to argue that MS won't make better software, but that wasn't what I was responding to originally.  If you read my original comment I even said that I don't think an alternative created by MS would be better, I was just saying that if it is better people will use it.

I do think it's POSSIBLE they will create something better, I don't think it's likely.  They've done it in the past but I think it's unlikely here."
2021-04-21 18:49:26,stocks,No one really had any fun experiences at all on ts neither hosts nor participants
2021-04-21 11:27:41,stocks,">If Microsoft can do that with Discord (doubtful, but you never know)

Would you like to make a bet MS will screw it up? MS doesn't make original products, it makes mediocre knockoffs, buys up other companies and then abuses its monopoly power to try to force everyone into the Microsoft ""ecosystem"". You use one MS service you wind up having to get an MS account, then use Edge browser, then MS 2FA installed on your phone, maybe even an MS vaccine passport just to chat with someone. LOL

Companies to avoid like the plague: Microsoft, Google, Facebook."
2021-04-21 14:04:35,stocks,"Thank you.  

People made one argument (no one will ever leave discord), then when I pointed out that that's not true they're trying to make a completely different argument (MS will never create something better than discord) while pretending it's the same argument."
2021-04-21 14:35:16,stocks,"Discord is actively fixing this with integrated compression options. Now when you upload a photo that's over the specified limit, you have an option to compress and send it. It's only a matter of time until they make this better and everything including video sends flawlessly. Like I said, Discord listens to thier community."
2021-04-21 14:31:15,stocks,"I'm not confused, maybe I just didn't express what I meant well enough. I also stated in another comment that I shouldn't have made it sound like thats the ONLY reason people wouldn't switch. 

I argued that even if a better product is offered, people would be inclined to stay on Discord because pretty much everyone is already on Discord. But also as a server owner,  why would I want to take the time to recreate my server, reprogram my bots, reinvite the entire community to the new server, just to be met with a loss in members once the switch happens. It's just not worth it to me and I'd be willing to bet that most of the content creators who connect with thier community on Discord feel the same way. 

I do understand what you're saying though. That's all assuming that the competitor offers the same amount of customizability as Discord does and allows me to do the same things that I can on Discord. A competitor coming out with a better gaming/community chat app then Discord would definitely have a shot, but in order to get the communities to move all together, a competitor would have to pray that Discord screws up in some way and drives its competitors away. 

These are the 2 point I made in the above comment."
2021-04-21 14:31:00,stocks,"I never used teamspeak, I do use discord. If Microsoft releases a product better than discord then sure I’ll check it out but how would it ever be “better”? What service would Microsoft need to provide to make it THAT much worth it to swap? A Clubhouse type thing that everybody and their mother is doing? Godspeed to Microsoft but if they dive into this space they have nothing going for them. They can’t even get their console voice chat to function properly let alone a universal one to be used across all platforms"
2021-04-21 12:43:03,stocks,"That's a good point and kind of furthers what I'm saying. Even though people could have both a Twitch and a Mixer account, Mixer still failed because people wanted to stick to what they know and where the majority of the communities are. Unless a competitor can get the communities to switch en masse, there's really no hope to beat Discord. 

It's not impossible to steal the top spot from Discord, I just don't think any of these big tech companies could pull it off given what we've seen in the past, especially from Microsoft."
2021-04-21 10:56:38,stocks,Maybe work should feel like DnD?
2021-04-21 10:54:23,stocks,"I know this much, I hate using it. Even if it has features I can't get anywhere else I still wouldn't use it on my own volition because it's an unenjoyable user experience to me. I've never felt that way about Discord for any reason"
2021-04-21 14:53:20,stocks,Yup
2021-04-21 18:35:13,stocks,RemindMe! 20 years
2021-04-21 17:00:22,stocks,"It is not the reason _at all_.

Mixer used and developed FTL, their technology to handle streams. It was absolutely insane for latency, but it did reduce quality, often made streams unstable (when compared to other protocols), and had some issues with the video shitting out if you got really unlucky.

Twitch and almost every other streaming site use RTMP (created by Macromedia in _2005_) to receive the stream and HLS to rebroadcast. This is what's causing the vast majority of delay.

Dacast is _much_ smaller than twitch. It also uses the combo of RTMP + HLS. It has a stream delay of ~10 seconds on average."
2021-04-21 15:13:10,stocks,"I literally wasn't arguing anything you said, I was responding to a response to your comment. Sorry if you felt it was pointed towards you for some reason. I also pointed out I'm biased because I care about discord more than I care about just using a voip program to chat rq but others probably wouldn't be as loyal."
2021-04-21 16:38:32,stocks,"Making it better doesn't mean people will switch to it. You're missing that both Ventrilo and TeamSpeak (and Skype) had a terrible interface along with other annoying stuff. Discord improved massively on this and added a ton of extra features.

Whatever Microsoft can create, I don't see how it's going to be the same massive improvement as Discord was. Discord is the solution to the issues with TeamSpeak/Ventrilo. Which issues would Microsoft fix with their version?"
2021-04-21 13:31:50,stocks,"Modern Microsoft has been way better than they used to be though, they've made improvements to products like Github"
2021-04-21 12:18:02,stocks,MS Teams is great though
2021-04-21 12:20:35,stocks,I'll bet you a dollar with 1:100 odds that in 10 years more people use a Microsoft chat client on PC than use discord. 1% chance feels about right...
2021-04-21 13:05:12,stocks,"Apple too, as long as we're talking about getting pulled into the 'ecosystem'"
2021-04-21 11:40:18,stocks,"I wasn’t gonna jump in and defend msft here, because youre spot on about them abusing their monopoly-like power, but you started trash-talking one of my babies so i have to now. I actually love the Edge browser. Its identical to chrome in every way that i needed it to be, theres a few extra features that i never know i needed and are super convenient (collections is one i can name off the top of my head), and to top it all off it uses less memory than chrome. Also ive heard their phone is amazing and all its lacking is apps on the app store. They do some things right. Its hit or miss with them tbh."
2021-04-21 12:15:28,stocks,No mention of apple?
2021-04-21 13:58:27,stocks,I'm okay with fighting bosses in either tbqh as long as I still get money in the end.
2021-04-21 14:49:01,stocks,"(different person)

I agree about the teams user experience.  I have to use teams and slack at work.  Slack is WAY better.

That being said, I also dislike the discord user experience."
2021-04-21 13:32:59,stocks,"Its called Skype. Different niche to discord tho.

Edit: technically teams exists as well"
2021-04-21 14:05:04,stocks,"I hate edge, but I upvoted you for defending something you like :)"
2021-04-21 14:48:04,stocks,"""Hey RossTheRed, I hear you and boss disagreed on how to complete project x.  What ended up happening?""

""oh, I killed him."""
2021-04-21 14:06:34,stocks,my bet is teams at some point out competes discord.
2021-04-21 15:44:50,stocks,"Skype competes more with things like Facebook messenger for private and group messaging, more social media stuff. And Teams is for professionals primarily like Slack is. Sure you can use them all for gaming and you can try to use Discord for productivity/professional activities as well."
2021-04-21 18:08:12,stocks,Haha thank you i respect your opinion too <3
2021-04-21 19:00:38,stocks,Welcome to the staff meeting. Roll for initiative!
2021-04-21 14:26:12,stocks,"Teams has 75 million users discord has 300 million according to the first google result for both.

However I don't think they have much overlap in terms of target users. Discord is social/gaming while teams is work."
2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"ARK just bought ton of Palantir, Coinbase and Draftkings Cathy wood are her ARK firm are not holding back as they bought over a million shares of Palantir, half a million shares of Draftkings and ton of Coinbase. Ark also bought Robolox and JD.

What are you thoughts on these trades? I think if they succeed here they will remember as one of the greatest firms ever. Either way these are interesting trades.

2021-04-21 08:03:05,stocks,ARK creates its own weather
2021-04-21 07:32:10,stocks,"ARK seems to load up on Palantir when it dips below $22. Any idea how many total shares they have now, or the funds average cost?"
2021-04-21 10:58:45,stocks,Cathie confirmed redditor
2021-04-21 07:54:07,stocks,ARK reminds me of that South Park episode where they cut of the head of a chicken and throw it onto a surface with labels of things to do.
2021-04-21 08:02:04,stocks,"All good buys imo, fit with their strategy. Getting them while most people have no faith in them as you can see in this thread means its the best time to pick them up."
2021-04-21 16:51:18,stocks,"Let's Go, Coinbase BABY!  Let's GO.  You got this, Kiddo!  Come on, that's it, learn to ride that bicycle, or hit that ball outta the park, Slugger."
2021-04-21 09:28:06,stocks,"Man, when ARK funds were doing nice, they were hyped up so much. Now that growth has slowed and her funds are down, those same people are shitting on her cause they lost faith. The ones that never believed think this is proof they are right. She has a 5 year time line guys, start talking shit then."
2021-04-21 08:01:31,stocks,"That’s no news. ARK is buying DraftKings, Palantir and Coinbase every single day. Cathie just needs her dose of Palantir to feel alive!"
2021-04-21 10:00:01,stocks,Speculative ETF buys shit loads of speculative stocks. In other news...the essence of water is wetness.
2021-04-21 07:33:43,stocks,"Tbh I'm not a fan of how ARK Invest has traded in the last 3 months.

When I was with them in 2018, they felt fresh and felt like they were actually doing solid DD and investing in companies that were relatively unknown. Fast forward to 2021 and they really seem to have lost their way with all the money they have to manage and it feels like they're just chasing reddit darlings because they have to put the money somewhere.

Just my opinion, but I'm really not feeling how ARK Invest does business since about fall of last year."
2021-04-21 07:52:19,stocks,ARK are just gambling with other peoples money
2021-04-21 09:11:36,stocks,"PLTR and Draftkings have both huge potential long term.  

PLTR has that MOAT that everyone who understand it believed it’s a game changer and remarkably scalable but need that marketing clout.  Commercial sales will catapult them into juggernaut run.

Draftkings can become that BRAND on a growing industry that only allowed by 12 states so far.  They have a head start even before that NFL deal and that exclusivity Daily Fantasy Sports will take them to another level.

Not sure about Coinbase because it looks like it’s too one dimensional for saturated market.

These are definitely high risk high reward but will go through volatility short term.  Most will most likely does not have the risk tolerance to go through that but these stocks are ahead of the game.  It’s just a matter of execution ."
2021-04-21 13:05:48,stocks,"ARKK will always make money because a horde of Redditors follow the moves Cathie makes. Thus if she buys, the stock goes up. If she sells, goes down. Smart business plan"
2021-04-21 07:50:19,stocks,ARK has too much money and not enough ideas for what to do with it.
2021-04-21 08:35:50,stocks,ARK is a meme at this point lmfao
2021-04-21 09:08:32,stocks,"prolly just buying dips, all 3 will go back up. esp coinbase, which is maybe the best midterm of these."
2021-04-21 10:42:14,stocks,"Is she just another memeinvestor at this point?

She is probably a mod on /stocks"
2021-04-21 09:35:57,stocks,"They aren't trading, they are looking at the long term. They know what they are doing and all of those listed on their daily transactions except Roblox are solid companies in my opinion."
2021-04-21 07:49:47,stocks,Their recent purchases of Coinbase has been worrying especially when they're buying when BTC is at ATH
2021-04-21 12:15:04,stocks,Personally picked up more PLTR @21.45. It’s a good buy for the next for year IMO. Coinbase is profiting from the crypto boom and draft kings from everyone stuck inside.
2021-04-21 10:02:32,stocks,"I'll make a prediction here:

ARKK is going to underperform SPY for the rest of 2021.

Speculative stocks / unprofitable stocks are going to underperform for the rest of 2021.

Valuations matter again ( and they're buying the wrong stocks )"

2021-04-21 09:13:11,stocks,crazy Cathie no longer having clout in the market.  What she buys is getting pummeled.  I still believe she becomes the greatest meme of all time
2021-04-21 14:50:27,stocks,Cathie Wood lauds Christianity yet invests in gambling (draft king). Yikes!
2021-04-21 09:22:31,stocks,The questions that is important - what did they sell and at what price?  did they take a lose on those sales?   or is this new money?

2021-04-21 15:52:57,stocks,"Roblox can be great due to NFT, JD is certainly a great value growth buy for the autonomous sector. DKNG probably great for the short to mid term. She also bought some WKHS for gambling lol. COIN is the one I'll never understand, such a crowded field, perhaps just because her btc target is 500k so COIN will survuve no matter what."

2021-04-21 17:10:28,stocks,"Bought me some DKNG too. I don't hold Palantir as I don't see their value as justified. While I've been huge into Bitcoin and crypto since the early days, I think other financial services are getting into crypto trading/services making Coinbase less palatable at its valuation. Their moat is disappearing fast."
2021-04-21 19:00:45,stocks,not really interesting trades if uve been paying attention to her trades in the past. these have been common names that they've been buying/selling in a day...
2021-04-21 19:58:12,stocks,She'll launch ARKR (reddit) soon. That would be a interesting fund for sure.
2021-04-21 09:13:41,stocks,Draftking seems like an odd bet for a tech focused fund.

You're just salty that you bought near ATH just before a rotation out of tech and growth stocks. I swear, the average redditor does no research and just follows headlines.

Once they started buying companies in my area of expertise, I started to really doubt their picks. I didn't like many of the SPACs that they bought. Coinbase is a good company with a terrible valuation. I dislike Palantir for a number of reasons, including valuation. I had 6 figures in ARK, but I'm thinking of cutting as soon as meme stocks reverse."

*head explodes and tendies fly out*"
2021-04-21 10:33:06,stocks,"PLTR & Draftkings are great companies, especially for the long term. But there is something that always comes back to my mind, and that is what Peter Lynch once said, he's one of the best investors that has ever existed & he said that you can buy a great company, but if it is too expensive, that can still count as a truly bad investment. I own both PLTR & Draftkings, but neither of these companies have come far enough to even have a PE ratio, so we can't calculate how expensive/cheap their share price is, especially in this market where everything is expensive and overvalued. Microsoft was a great company in the 2000s, but if you bought it in the year 2000 when it was overvalued, you'd have to wait 16 years in order to not be in the negative & finally get your money back. PLTR & Draftkings are great companies, especially for the long term, I see continued growth and I believe these 2 will dominate long term considering they are 2 special companies in my opinion, but the question is, are we buying them when they are too expensive."
2021-04-21 19:11:58,stocks,ive owned PLTR since opening day but i wouldnt exactly say they have a moat. they are high tech AI/data analytics firm that can do analysis that no other company can do. however im not sure how long that technological edge will last.. i am a little concerned.
2021-04-21 09:25:00,stocks,Data analysis is hardly a moat.
2021-04-21 10:07:16,stocks,"Palantir is a consulting company pretending to be a tech company. They will never get the revenue/profit per employee leverage to justify their valuation, IMO."

2021-04-21 14:57:25,stocks,I think the bull case for draft kings is less ‘everyone’s stuck inside’ and more ‘sports are coming back’ at least that’s why I’ve been adding to my position.

2021-04-21 08:16:05,stocks,"I mean yes, you have to do some mental gymnastics but they align.

My issue is more with how they're investing now. For example, let's look at PLTR. PLTR DPO's and sits around 9 dollars a share and ARK Invest does nothing. Sure PLTR is new to the market, but they're well established in the private market and I'm sure ARK knew about them and what they were about prior to listing.

Fast forward, PLTR pops and ARK dips it's toes in PLTR at 17 dollars a share. PLTR continues to pump and ARK starts to double down throughout. Recently it has been up and down and ARK has been buying the dip driving their current cost average up to 25 dollars a share.

Now I'm not knocking PLTR as a bad company, I'm not knocking ARK Invest for buying dips (that's how it's done)...what is really questionable to me is...if they're really so awesome at finding diamond companies, why did they choose to ignore PLTR at 9 dollars after the DPO, but as soon as it's pumped 200% they're going to make massive buys. To me it just seems like they're chasing social media FOMO now.

I feel similarly about DKNG.

Now with COIN it's like they're doing the opposite...inflated DPO almost $100 a share above where it was tracked to list and ARK is all in? Why COIN but not PLTR or DKNG?

I dont know man, from an outside perspective it all just seems like they really aren't doing any sort of DD anymore and are just trying their best to manage their massive AUM in any way possible."
2021-04-21 16:14:08,stocks,S&P is up 20.85% in the last 6 months.

I'm not saying I timed it right, but I hopped out very happy back in mid-Feb. I lost my conviction for personal reasons non-connected to the market performance"
2021-04-21 13:10:28,stocks,Not that far fetched really. As DK scales up the data sets will be truly massive. Palantir can help them gather more meaningful insight from that information. I’d love to see any customer in the gaming space engage with Palantir.
2021-04-21 10:59:17,stocks,"Hard to put dollar value on Palantir.  They are kinda unique , way ahead of the competition (well no competition really) and most does not really understand what they have and there’s only few actually do.   Investors who are not well verse on this sector maybe more wary about their forward PE which is over 100 , that’s way overvalue considering their commercial sales is still work in progress.  But my vision tells me that they have something special, a game changer and I am not grounded on their fundamental analysis to be validated for my convictions .  Short term wise, their stock can go sideways and even down but I’ll keep buying the dip."
2021-04-21 12:53:37,stocks,I’d rather buy them now at high valuations and low share price than low value and high price. I have pretty confidence that both are going to do well in the long term.
2021-04-21 19:45:31,stocks," An MOAT is a distinct advantage a company has over its competitors which allows it to protect its market share and profitability. It is often an advantage that is difficult to mimic or duplicate (brand identity, patents) and thus creates an effective barrier against competition from other firms.

Since PLTR does not really have competition on what they can do and offer all together, I considered that a MOAT.

What PLTR has is something like a code , which is like a WHOLE that is greater than the sum of its parts .   they are not just a big data company or a services company. They offer visualization, deep analytics, machine learning, and increasingly powerful artificial intelligence capabilities."
2021-04-21 10:04:11,stocks,"Large scale data analysis and cross platform builds are insanely hard and time consuming to do. To build something you can plop and have it interact with everything is insanely complex and the reason snowflake is so huge. 

You can also charge unreal rates for anything data related. I know consultants who have charged 50k for a report that took me a day or two to complete (company asked if I could do it vs paying consultants)"
2021-04-21 09:32:05,stocks,True but what they have is truly game changer.  It’s like putting a truly scalable data analysis and predictive modeling on one mofo code.  I am not well verse to explain it in detail but it’s like a specialty within a specialty of data analysis.

Also, you seem to basing your opinion of ARK solely on their entry points into their stocks. Obviously ARK's research involves more than just price points and they don't base their picks on what's popular on social media. Both PLTR and COIN have huge potentials for growth.

2021-04-21 11:24:54,stocks,Every new commercial deal their sales team signs requires them to hire engineers and analysts specifically for that deal. Most of that headcount doesn’t move to other deals; just new projects under the same deal.

Tesla at $198 in June 2019 as it seemed like a revolutionary company with lots of bad media. Didn't think investors would let them go under.


NET and PIN IPO's. Strong leadership, high growth industries, great companies.

I've never touched options. I mostly invest in trends I see becoming popular as I have no business background. Its worked out very well.

I switched to more growth things, but mainly now use margin to buy the dips, and use options to pay it off. Be patient with options and stock, and buy actual good companies that have some earnings. Options are powerful but be patient and don’t be too risky. The last pull back I put $12,500 into two different options and they both went up 500%+ so $75k x2=$150k I paid a lot of margin off with that and now I’m holding for the long term. Also I don’t go too heavy in margin, maybe 25-40% if things are really cheap. Without the options trading my account would maybe be around $350k so that helped a lot and I sold my options when they got to my price target, even tho I could potentially make more money. Recently I sold my square options for 31.25/per when they expire at the end of may and it went up and I got depressed and then square went down and I bought them back for less than half that."

2021-04-21 16:21:24,stocks,"DCA wins every time. That and compounding interest is like never mentioned anymore lol.

You routinely contribute to a mixed and well diversified portfolio, every month, through thick and thin, through bulls and bears, through booms, bubbles, and crashes....and after 30 years....Holy shit you'll have a shit ton of shares and lots of zeros and commas.

Just from my own experience with accounts like my Roth and 401k. Once you break the infamous 100k mark, the numbers start climbing fast (compounding is such a beautiful thing to see).

And it takes ALL the emotion out of your analysis and any moves you make. I don't care what the price of a stock is on any given day, week, or even year. Idc. All I care about is how many shares I snagged up over 30 years of consistent buying. This is essentially how all retirement funds ""think"", because it's a 100% guarantee. The only time this doesn't work is if you are right at the cusp of retirement and a crash hits. But even then, you should be repositioning towards less risky investments and essentially have phased out of the stock market around those ages.

Like...if people invested monthly starting at 18...and invest until 55. That gives them an extra decade of buffer before they retire around 65, for them to move to much safer routes. That is almost 40 years of continuous investing. And you can bet you'll have seen some recessions/bubble crashes throughout all of it. Doesn't matter. That's 40 years of nonstop buying. Anywhere near the age of 55 and the market is ""green""....you'll easily be a millionaire/multiM. You don't have have be a whiz. Just consistent and dedicated.

Everyone should really treat their ""wealth management"" investments just like a retirement account. Be aggressive at younger ages, but don't tinker too much. Go growth stocks, sure. But keep contributing, regardless of momentum or swings.

Everyone really should ask themselves, ""am I here to make money or to grow wealth."" Neither answer is wrong. But where people get tripped up is when they say they want to grow wealth but employ a ""make money"" strategy that tries to capture momentums and swings and they totally miss the big picture.

For us (the small guy) the market will chew me up and spit me out. The market isn't for me to make fast money. It's a casino if you think of it that way. But as a little guy, it is definitely the best vehicle for me to grow wealth (along with other investment vehicles like Real Estate and appreciating physical property).

This is just my 30,000 foot view as to what I've experienced as a middle aged investor who has been lucky with consistent cash flow from gainful employment and I've (so far) avoided insane medical bills and accidents."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Contradictory definitions of revenue and income Confused about the difference between revenue, income and profit

[Investopedia says](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/122214/what-difference-between-revenue-and-income.asp#:~:text=Income%3A%20An%20Overview,to%20the%20company's%20primary%20operations.&text=Income%2C%20or%20net%20income%2C%20is,company's%20total%20earnings%20or%20profit):

>Revenue is the total amount of income generated by the sale of goods or services related to the company's primary operations.   
>  
>Income, or net income, is a company's total earnings or profit.

But [easieraccounting differentiates income and profit:](https://easieraccounting.com/difference-income-profit/#:~:text=The%20terms%20%E2%80%9Cprofit%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9C,is%20the%20top%2Dline%20revenue.&text=Income%20is%20commonly%20referred%20to,the%20expenses%20have%20been%20paid):

>Income is the top-line revenue. This number is calculated by tallying every penny that came into the company during a given period.  
>  
>On the other hand, profit is the amount that is left over after the expenses have been paid

This is defining income as what Investopedia defines as revenue. Which is correct?"
2021-04-21 07:10:50,stocks,"A company has income and expenses. One form of income is revenues, which is generated from selling products/services, another form is interest income. Examples of expenses are cost of goods sold, salaries etc. Once you aggregate all the incomes and remove all the expenses, you are left with the net income or net loss (if expenses are more than the income). Usually there is a specific sequence to get to net income."
2021-04-21 06:48:55,stocks,"They’re both correct! Investopedia is calling revenue income and the second is calling income top-line revenue (same as revenue) it’s called top line because it’s the first line in the income statement. Revenue = top line = sales = income = turnover (UK) depending on what you’re looking at and in which country. Revenue is the actual sales made (If I sold 10 cups of lemonade for $1 each, my revenue/income would be $10 - but my PROFIT would be revenue minus costs because I spent $5 on lemons and cups and sugar and labor and taxes so I’m only taking $5 home from that $10 in sales) Net Income = Profit."
2021-04-21 10:59:17,stocks,"Sounds like a tomato, tomatoe problem, right?

You start with the ""Revenue"" part. That's your gross ""income"" level and you go down the books, accounting in your ""Costs of Revenue"", ie. what you need to spend, operating expenses which include payroll, marketing, costs of production, etc. and factor some other things like pesky taxes, depreciations and the like.

The *Revenue itself* usually is purely derived from *sales of products or services to whoever your business partners are (ie. B2B or B2C).* 

There are other kinds of income, like long term interest, leases billed etc. - *unless* leasing or renting out space is your main model of revenue. Think REITs. They only have Revenues derived from letting living/office space.

It's complicated until you arrive at the EBITDA line.

Once you have EBITDA, you factor in any write-offs (""Depreciatons"") and taxes (credits) etc. 

And then you're a certified accountant if you carried all the Zeroes properly and can show your Big Head Honcho (CEO) who usually is very interested in the ""net income"" part, ie. the margin.

Look at the NFLX finance sheet to see how it's accounted, from top (Revenue) to bottom (EBITDA and further down):

I know DCF considers cash flows, which (ideally) factor in for overall money supply and inflation in an economy. 

But what I'm looking for is any model that considers the increased propensity to invest due to growing financial education and more accessible avenues like mobile apps."
2021-04-21 07:04:38,stocks,"a DCF model is not an economic model; it's a company focused model where you discount the future cash flows to their present value.

2021-04-21 08:29:25,stocks,"To the best of my knowledge, there's no such model. Furthermore, a DCF should be used as a complement to your deep dive; spending too much time to build an extremely detailed model is not advised, because that additional detail may not offset the additional accuracy a DCF model may provide. Like you spend days find data and build the model, only to gain 5% in accuracy isn't really ideal. If you still want to go ahead, then good luck with your adventure :D"

* the high before the ""correction"" in tech/growth looks more like a mini-bubble now. looks like growth stocks are going to remain depressed for a long time - lots of bagholders at 20-30%+
* Companies lowering overall compensation/reduced or flat salaries due to Covid Impact
* Inflation rising: there was an article showing major retailers will be increase prices in the low to mid single digits soon. 
* Asset prices rising like crazy (housing)

&#x200B;

So yeah, why don't you just take your stocks you are down 30% on, after heading home from your job that you lost compensation on, when inflation is actually increasing, to go to the store to buy your groceries that went up 10%. oh yeah, and those houses you were looking at...pipe dream..up 20%

2021-04-21 08:50:24,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are going to be painful today, but they should start getting a bit easier by the end of the week.

**Bear Case:**

* After two red days that [I've argued](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mumlqw/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_apr/gv75383/?context=3) were most likely caused by market makers and banks liquidating positions, we're likely to see fear trickle into retail investors.
* Netflix missed earnings significantly, which might spread more fear and anxiety over how well other big pandemic winners will perform when their earnings come out.
* Procter & Gamble have announced they're [raising prices](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/proctor-gamble-raise-prices-september-inflation/), providing a little validation for all those inflation fears.

**Bull Case:**

* During March, the NASDAQ repeatedly struggled to get above 13,600, which you can [see visualized here](https://i.redd.it/flyjet2kpiu61.jpg). It's very likely that 13,600 will work as a support line on the way down, as well, which should slow the bleed out.
* When we break below 13,600, we have support from the 50-day moving average, the 100-day moving average, and the [trend lines](https://i.redd.it/vxyjkx3pk5u61.jpg) not far below.

If this really is nothing more than a slow-down in momentum, we should see things get less painful either tomorrow or Friday and probably even start seeing a bit more green than red by the beginning of May.

Note the ""if"" there, though.

For today, though, get ready for another **red day** with a **NASDAQ high of 13,786** and a **low of 13,600.**

2021-04-21 12:45:32,stocks,"If the S&P doesn't decide to sell this afternoon (and by that, I mean if you got a nasty reversal and it closed down half a percent), bears are going to be down to 4 to 5 trading days to cause a pullback in price, or else it's not happening here either. 

The 20 day will be the line in the sand here and I think we will see more weakness but it looks less likely now that the pullback in price happens.

My guess if it doesn't happen here is you'll get a brief, nasty dip sometime in June, which happened last year. June is a big rebalancing month, and we had gone up so fast early that month, it likely triggered rebalancing early (that's not to mention the negative comments from Powell) and it got nasty."

Overleveraged investors had to close positions to pay taxes on gains. So at the moment  Finra Margin Debt is at an all time high (813.68B). And it seems like the speed of which margin debt is increasing is slowing down. Tax Day is pushed forward this year, from April 15 towards May 17. I know you can't time the market or a crash, but does this sentiment feel familiar to people who were caught in the crash back then?  Will we correct heavily going towards Tax Day and could the extreme margin + gains + taxes combo be a catalyst into a much tougher maybe even bearish market? Or, am I talking nonsense here? I figured I might have to cut down on my aggressiveness in buying till after May at least, before I DCA off a cliff."

They've been around for quite a while. Their earnings however are aweful, but that isn't to say they don't have a future. There has been strong levels of resistance at $10, realistically it shouldn't drop below that in a worst-case scenario. It's shown on multiple occasions in the past year that it can bounce back, and usually does so very well. The question is, is this the exception? You should also ask yourself whether you'd be ok with seeing your shares sell at $10 as a worst case scenario. If you're not, sell, and buy something safer. At this time, the play seems to be growth companies with earnings."
2021-04-21 09:55:54,stocks,">a friend in finance

Have a look at their balance sheet. Figure out if they're likely to go bankrupt - and what would be needed for that to happen. If you don't know how to read a balance sheet, learn. Remember, theres money on the line.

Make any decision logically, so that even if it goes back up the moment you sell, you'll know you made the logical decision with the information you had and you can't control market reacting against what makes sense.

Do your own research and DD please. Don't buy or sell anything based only on your friends advice.

ALSO - pretty sure they got a launch coming up and that usually makes the stock rally slightly."

VR is one the *rightish* path with what Sony & Oculus have done: Sony with the relatively inexpensive PSVR & Oculus again with the relatively inexpensive standalone units. But again - it'll be a few generations before that becomes more mainstream. 

The other factor you have to consider is that the more expensive VR setups have been somewhat failures in some ways: my understanding is that *most* multiplayer VR games have largely empty lobbies, indicating potentially slim userbases."

2021-04-21 06:36:46,stocks,It will be rather bad than good. As not all companies will be able to rise their prices as high as inflation grows their margin will decrease.
2021-04-21 06:34:17,stocks,"Value stocks perform better in high inflation periods and growth stocks perform better during low inflation. When inflation is on the upswing, income-oriented or high-dividend-paying stock prices generally decline. Stocks overall do seem to be more volatile during highly inflationary periods."

That being said, it seems like only a matter of time before people start catching onto the broader implications and use cases for VR. People have started doing work meetings in VR, concerts and performances are starting to happen in VR, I've been doing my workouts in VR, my parents want to start doing in-VR movie nights with my brother and I since we all live apart from each other. I think that the public consensus is that VR is a ""gaming thing"" and it's not nearly as limited as that. But that will take time to overcome. We'll have to see with AR. I think it's kind of a crapshoot as to when/if it'll take off, especially since there's some significant hardware hurdles that have to be cleared, but I see a lot of these bigger companies (Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc) hiring like CRAZY for their AR/VR R&D divisions, which tells me they're envisioning a big future for it."

2021-04-21 11:36:34,stocks,Then what’s with all the comparisons between GME and AMC? I mean GameStop is a joke of a company and they had a squeeze over $400. Why would this not be possible with AMC? I mean I don’t really think anybody believes AMC is a sound long-term investment but it would appear that most individuals who are all hot in the biscuit for it seem to think it’s gonna blowup and then crash and I guess they hope to capitalize on the blowup.
2021-04-21 12:17:13,stocks,"Honest question from someone that isn’t in GME at all but has loosely followed along with everything

There seem to be two common talking points on this sub that I see almost daily 

1) GME is extremely overvalued and the only people still in it are college kids and idiots that think it’s going to make them rich

2) Everyone overestimates the impact that retail has on the market and retail alone doesn’t really have an effect on share price

To me these two statements seem to be at odds with one another. GME has been on a slow decline for a while now, but it has also been above $100 for 2 straight months which to me (and most people on this sub) seems to be way too high. If most of the people still invested in GME are young/stupid retail investors but retail investors don’t have a real impact on the price of a stock then why hasn’t GME plummeted back to $20-$40/share?"

I think that Monday and Tuesday's redness were the results of Wall Street wanting to wait until the verdict comes in before staking any serious bets because they feared that a not guilty verdict could create civil unrest that would be reflected through turmoil in the markets.

Chauvin was found guilty. There's no civil unrest. All the bullish investment Wall Street held off from doing on Monday and Tuesday is happening today."

Single: $32,500

As far as amending it really depends on the cost/benefit. How much do you have to pay to amend the return? If you're doing it through turbo tax I believe you can play around with the numbers and see how much/if any you would get back. If you owed taxes and you qualify, you would get a refund back if you qualify. 

If you had a refund already you might get a bigger refund. If your refund is say $200 and it is only going to cost you $20 to amend the return, Your net gain is $180, that is the way I approach it with clients. You would file a 1040X and it cannot be e-filed you would have to mail it to the IRS as amended returns are not eligible for e-filing. Does this make sense?

2021-04-21 13:41:02,stocks,"My opinion? ABSOLUTELY. Here's why: they own the BEST intellectual property in entertainment, meaning the best brands (Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar). They are world-class managers of their portfolio. They've created the first true competitor to Netflix and have achieved their 2024 goals 3 years early. Streaming is the future as they capture 100% of the revenue generated (vs. traditional movie theaters, where the studio only collects MAX 50%). DIS is still (unfairly IMO) judged as an old-school media play. To me, that is insanity. Yes, theme parks are a drag on the stock right now, but of course once the world opens back up, they'll all go spend their money at Disney Parks -- and Disney absolutely is a world-class collector of tourist dollars :)

I'm not a pro. This isn't advice. Just my observations being a longterm holder and believer. A great stock for a noob because you can buy it and forget it. It's not a meme, it's not going to double by next week, but it will grow in the double digits for years and years to come."

2021-04-21 10:57:47,stocks,"> you missed out on jk Rowling being ""cancelled"" for her transphobic comments

No, I've been around for all of that. And I agree that she's a piece of shit.

But that's twitter drama, that's not real life. The books still sell an incredible amount and I would bet 99% of fans have never heard of any of that.

Fantastic Beasts 2 underperformed though because Fantastic Beasts 1 was boring and 2 was terrible. Although, $655m gross on a $200 budget is hardly a failure. And franchises have recovered from weak entries plenty of times before. The bad reception of The Rise of Skywalker didn't stop Mandalorian from being a hit."

Not in your case , but in general I do think it's a mental game for some folks with fractionals. Some people like quantity over quality.  Yeah it's ""cool"" to have 500 shares in a company  about to go bust, but I'll stick with my boring ETFs and fractionals in well established companies, but to each their own."

Numerous actors from the movies with tons of fans have talked about it. Stephen king with tons of fans has talked about.  They made jokes about it on SNL. You really believe 1% and it's just Twitter drama?"
2021-04-21 12:12:11,stocks,"Very doubtful to happen. There'll never be a rush with AMC like there was with GME - I really feel like that was just a once in a lifetime kind of thing.

What percentage of people who pay for something would you consider ""real fans""? That's not how the world works.

Almost all consumers just buy the thing and enjoy the thing and that's it. Fandom is and always has been a microcosm of mass markets.

I do like healthcare REITs. Senior living and other facilities arent going away. But I dont keep up on funds that hold these. I just buy the stocks. Been holding VTR but also like WELL, OHI, NHI, MPW and a few others."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"These last couple months have been a lesson on diversification Like many of you, my stock portfolio is overweight on high growth stocks, especially in tech. And like many of you, I've watched my portfolio bleed day after day. 

A few weeks ago I was talking to my dad and he was saying how his portfolio has been killing it. Well, his portfolio has oil stocks, Industrials, and other ""boring"" stocks. Much more old school than my portfolio. He had shifted his portfolio to be more focused on the traditional  high performers during economic booms. I didn't have the foresight to do that. 

I looked at the YTD performance of all the S&P500 components and realized my portfolio has hardly any of the top performers. While my portfolio definitely has a higher weight in growth stocks, I still had a car manufacturer, a retail stock, an airline, some sector ETFs and some other reopening plays. I felt I was decently diversified. But the huge blind spot in my portfolio happened to be with the highest performers YTD.

Can't make myself buy oil stocks, but I ended up putting some money into an industrial ETF (I don't know enough about the industry to feel confident in any single stocks) and a Financials ETF. I also averaged down my cost basis in several of my tech stocks I'm confident will come back strong. This has all helped counterbalance my portfolio and the bleeding has been mitigated since shifting my portfolio.

Gotta be agile! Been a good lesson in (real) diversification. Hope you guys are learning and evolving as well."
2021-04-21 02:54:00,stocks,"About 90% of my portfolio is SPY, SCHD, and AAPL, and I won’t sell out of those any time soon. The remaining space is for speculation. 🤙🏻"
2021-04-21 03:49:35,stocks,"It’s all about risk tolerance, and patience when you make those decisions. 

Being diversified is great. It’s great at balancing risk but it’s not without its disadvantages either. 

Key thing is, stick to your investment strategies and don’t let emotions dictate your direction."
2021-04-21 04:34:13,stocks,"Yep I learned this in the .com crash. Also there is no such thing as old school and new school. All the ""new"" nonsense today is not new. It happened 20 years ago and 100 years ago as well. Both led to major crashes due to speculation in future tech. 

Fact is this, not all these tech companies can survive. There isnt enough money for all of them. Half of the new companies will fold, a few will get bought if they have a unique tech (most do not), and only a few will be wildly successful. Thats just the truth of it.

And to be more specific. All these software companies coming out claiming to provide security tech for cloud and such wont survive. They are blowing smoke. Their tech is easy to duplicate. The only thing they offer is a temporary contract with someone which may or may not be renewed in the future. 

We also dont need 10 new eV makers, at least half will go under. We dont need more streaming services, the market is already saturated. We dont need more cloud services, that isnt even really a new tech, its a rebrand of the word ""internet"" service lol. We dont need more plant based meat, weve had that since the 90s and it hasnt changed. We dont new companies that claim they are innovative because they attached a screen to a fridge or bike... double lol. 

We are in a tech bubble. There is no doubt about it. Too much speculation and even ""old dogs"" are currently pretty pricey but at least those guys will likely survive.

Definitely diversify and dont under estimate the value of dividends and dividend growth. Stocking up cash makes you a king when markets crash. The dividends add up. Do NOT auto-reinvest divs! Save them and buy dips and crashes."

2021-04-21 05:25:41,stocks,"So many value investors throw the dot.com crash around. I think it scarred a whole generation of investors from touching anything with a pe above 10.  As a result they missed out on the 2 decades of great performance for growth.

2021-04-21 06:49:34,stocks,"There's a reason it gets called *potential* returns and a *risk* premium though. With hindsight, we can name the big names. At the time it was obviously much less clear who would win big or even survive long-term, and holding a big position in just one ""sure thing"" might have seen you lose big as well. Your risk premium doesn't always materialise, sometimes you get hit with the risk end of the stick.

 In the current market generating outsize returns has been unusually common, and often enough people seem to ignore the downside potential of going for big positions in the next big thing."
2021-04-21 10:25:08,stocks,Hindsight bias lol generating outsized returns means there’s more risk of not having any returns at all.
2021-04-21 14:43:42,stocks,"High concentration = complaining about your portfolio getting hammered for weeks/months while the overall market is at all time highs.

2021-04-21 14:45:08,stocks,This is why I averaged down my cost basis significantly in most of my tech holdings. And bought into some sector etfs that will help counterbalance until the tide turns back to high growth stocks.

Valuations and market behavior is why I say we have a tech bubble. Like I said above, there isnt enough money to feed all the startups. Its just not going to happen. How many eV related startups have we had the last year? Like 20? Car makers, motor makers, battery makers, sensor makers, and the list goes on. None have real revenue nor any real meaningful partnerships that can sustain them. Half are lying out the wazooo hoping they can get away with it and sell more shares into hype to keep things going. The other half are real but thats not always enough either.

There will be a correction. We have seen then come down a bit already. Most are back down to IPO range but thats just eV stuff. We also have tons of new startups with lofty valuations."
2021-04-21 12:24:09,stocks,"Sure, but in fairness, AMZN was one of the survivors of the .com debacle so its easy to say that now. At the time, you had 30 startup stocks to pick from and everyone swore by their favorites. You sure you would have picked Amazon? The company that sold books online? Instead of Hotbot which was going to replace MSN and Yahoo as the #1 search engine? ;-p Ironically if Google didnt come around, Hotbot would have succeeded. They were the 1st no-nonsense search engine if memory serves me. But google had the catchy name and insane marketing campaign so they won.

Tesla is different. They went public in a down market and no one was competing. They were speculative inherently but there was no reason to avoid due to competition or bubble."
2021-04-21 11:47:59,stocks,"Timing? Not really. I simply dont assume that a stock is always worth buying. Sometimes they are overpriced. So I rather do the buying myself.

2021-04-21 04:42:40,stocks,"There are a lot of reasons. For one, the current pro-business policy greatly harms younger generations. Its great for establishment, but horrible for future since they will need to pay a lot higher valuations to buy the same stuff and odds are their wages will continue to not meet inflation of investment vehicles.

Further, risk of major economic collapse increases by leaving interest rates super low. Why? Because how you convince people to spend during a bad economy if you cant lower interest? Negative interest? Who will buy treasuries if interest is negative? How will the government fund anything if no one buys the treasuries? Print without issuing bonds? And so on and so forth until you end up bankrupt. This is what happened to the USSR."

2021-04-21 08:45:22,stocks,"I agree with you. I don't think that the US will see real inflation unless somehow the bottom half of earners have a significant increase in their wage or income. The wealth gap has been widening for decades and the wealthy tend to save. Increase in wage or income is possible only if the US gets universal basic income that the bottom 50% don't have to pay back, and/or $15/hr minimum wage, and/or and economic overhaul where good jobs are created, not just 20% of the US economy is service sector and working for tips and 20% or more working for $10/hr.  Absent those conditions, I don't see how we get to inflation and given the current political landscape where senate democrats shot down $15/hr and nobody wants to do infrastructure, it's not happening. Ironically, UBI started under Trump with PPP.

If you look at the 10yr yield, it's actually off of it's recent peak. I know that there's a lot to that, but I don't think that we're going above 1.85% on the 10. If we do, I'm buying bonds."

2021-04-21 09:11:29,stocks,Im saying $15/hr minimum wage. The median wage for your state is something like $18/hr. Median salaries have not really budged for decades and they've jumped in the last 5-10yrs solely due to salary increases in the upper 25% of earners who save anyway. I don't know what the median income would need to be for real inflation but it's not there yet. Time will tell. It was interesting that 2wks ago yields dropped on strong retail and jobs growth.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Do you include your cash when determining return? I was wondering if you factor in your cash when determining your portfolio wide return. I mean it really isn't contributing to your return ... Or is it?

Also when figuring what percentage a particular stock is of your portfolio, do you add the cash allocation to the total portfolio amount or leave it out since it technically is not invested?

I guess though it should be counted because it is technically an asset and part of your portfolio.

But then would I also include the cash in my piggy bank or pocket 😆?"
2021-04-21 04:44:46,stocks,"I do, yes. Because its part of the portfolio and its there for strategic reasons. I dont count the money I have in the bank that I use for day to day stuff but I do count the cash in the broker account."
2021-04-21 01:53:38,stocks,"I just include the cash from dividends and minor change that I can’t invest because it is too little. If you close out a position, and haven’t found a way to invest the cash from proceeds, then you should include that cash, because cash sitting in your trading account is an opportunity cost. But normally, you don’t include ALL the cash you have everywhere! Or you can, if you feel all your economic activity needs to be measured for a return on investment. :)"
2021-04-21 03:43:07,stocks,"Of course you should include cash.

At the end of the year I divide my gain/loss by the portfolio value at the start of the year + any change in net cash. So the percentage gains would be lower when factoring in a larger starting value."
2021-04-21 08:57:34,stocks,"As others have stated, yes you should include the cash you have earmarked as part of your investment portfolio when you calculate your return.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"How do triple leverage ETFs (such as TQQQ) have time decay on trading platforms like Robinhood, where the 5 year return is above 1000% Hello, I just had a question about ETFs and Robinhood. Robinhood claims to have almost no commission fees but I know they do charge some but it’s so minimal it feels like nothing. I have also traded with ETFs on Robinhood and have had enough information to tell that any management fees are taken from the stock’s daily return. So my question is that I have heard from professors that triple leverage ETFs are not good long term investments because the management fees are higher than normal and that it causes time decay. Well how are they not good long term investments when QQQ (the unleveraged version of the ETF) is up 203.7% for the past 5 years while TQQQ (the triple leveraged Version) is up 1097.04% in the past 5 years? Cause isn’t the management fee taken out of the daily return therefore making 1097% the amount after they took their fees out?"
2021-04-21 01:34:04,stocks,"Decay has nothing to do with management fees and everything to do with the nature of leverage. For example, if you had $100 in QQQ and it drops 5% in one day and rises 5% the next, you’d have $99.75 and be down 0.25% overall. With TQQQ, you’d end up with $97.75 and be down not 0.75% but actually 2.25%. So when markets are very volatile, leveraged ETFs experience this decay and that’s why they’re not recommended as a long term investment."
2021-04-21 01:30:01,stocks,"I don’t think most people have a clue what they’re talking about.

They will say it’s meant to be held short term, that it’s meant as a backup plan for other failings, that it’s increased risk due to magnifying volatility.

Here’s the reality - if you’re comfortable going from $58 to $20 in like 12 days and then being up to $83 4 months later, it’s not a bad idea.

The problem is that when you buy and hold it your whole portfolio will jump up and down like an acrobat on a trampoline.

If you don’t need to take the money out and you can keep holding through the down periods you’d be fine with it.

If you’re fine having to always buy and cash out using limit orders because it’s too volatile to do a market order you’re fine.

I’ve thought of doing it. I still might do it. The only problem is that if there’s any sort of a correction you can be down 90% in a matter of days and have to wait years to get back to normal. But that’s the same problem with any index fund.

However I’d also want to caution that a ton of people recently had the same idea you did and hopped into those funds because they aren’t sure what the **** else to do with the crazy market right now.

And when things go back to normal they will cash out and it will cause a massive dip.

Edit: not financial advice I don’t know anything"
2021-04-21 05:20:50,stocks,"Realistically, any stocks have decay. It's just maths as explained by other comments. The decay is less noticeable on other stocks/ETFs that have less beta, normal index ETFs like SPY/QQQ have a beta that is close to 1 (they react the same as the market), TQQQ have a beta of around 3 as per the name. It's just that - amplified gains and losses. Fortunately indexes generally go up, so TQQQ amplified gains are more than enough to offset that decay. That decay will be very apparent when the index goes sideways for a while."
2021-04-21 02:14:15,stocks,"Cuz volatility chews you up.

1 * 1.10 * 0.9 < 1

2021-04-21 08:42:06,stocks,There is time decay built in to achieve the leverage because of interest expense.  For TQQQ though its growth well outpaces it's decay.
2021-04-21 06:00:15,stocks,"I think it's easier if you take a bigger price change.
Imagine QQQ loses 30% one day, TQQQ is down 90%.
Then QQQ gains 50% the next day, TQQQ is up 150%.

QQQ: 1\*0.7\*1.5 = 1.05    
TQQQ: 1\*0.1\*2.5 = 0.25

So QQQ is up 5%, while TQQQ is down 75%."
2021-04-21 01:50:37,stocks,"Agreed. 99% of ANYWHERE you bring up leveraged ETF they will scream ""BUT WHAT ABOUT DECAY!? DO YOU KNOW IT WILL DECAY!""

Okay, but backtest it. They work. But they're extremely anxiety provoking if you actually have it in you to hold long term. And that's the thing, you really need to hold 10+ years for the strategy to work. And DCA helps a lot as you'll be buying it at bottoms.

2021-04-21 05:39:31,stocks,"You can't backtest TQQQ far enough back to get meaningful data. It's only been around 9 years and was created after 2008, 2000, and the 70s crash. No decay but definitely not something I'd pick up before a major correction or crash. 

If QQQ goes down 60%, your triple leverage gets you a 180% drawdown, which is impossible, but will be corrected by the fund with reverse splits. I read somewhere here that if you bought it in the late 90s, you'd still be down. There isn't a good way to back test past 2011 tho because of the splitting. It's not a schedule, it's based on liquidity and the fund avoiding bankruptcy.

Edit: when there's another major correction, I will absolutely pick up a metric shit ton of TQQQ."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"$AMD Fair Value of $101 per Morningstar recent Analyses, up from $77 Morningstar Analyst, Abhinav Davuluri, raised his Fair Value price of $AMD to $101 recently on April 14th \[[https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amd/quote](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnas/amd/quote)\], from the $77 that he had set back in Jan 27th, when the stock was at $89, made a run for $94 two weeks later, before plunging down the depth of hades shortly thereafter...  I hate that the guy was right, but he was right...  So, maybe he's right about his new target, as well.  Also, AMD has tons of price targets in the $100+ range, and all the rumors and news points to a gangbusters Q1 earnings ($WDC, $MU, $IBM, and $TSM, all major players in the PC and data center space has had huge revenue beats), it's crazy that the stock is still under $80 just a week before earnings!

Personally, from my own attempts at TA \[[https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png](https://i.imgur.com/rpDaio0.png)\], I believe $AMD is at the bottom of it's current price channel, and the stock is going to start recovering towards Q1 earnings; my hope is that AMD will experience a Parabolic jump like it did on July of last year, the situations are similar, where it spent long periods of trading sideways, while the rest of the tech sector was booming, AMD being flat then didn't make any sense, nor does it now.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Whats the difference between Limit Price, Stop-Limit Price,Stop-Loss Price? Are all able to be used for both buying and selling?

From what I know, limit pricing for buying means you set a price and if the market price falls to ur limit price or below, it will help you to buy the stock. As for selling, if the market price rises to ur limit price or above, it will help you to sell the stock? Assuming there is enough liquidity in the market.

Stop-Loss Price is to set a price whereby if the market price drops to that level, you will want to sell the stock no matter what. So let say I set it at $90, and the market price plummeted to $85, and there is only liquidity at $85 but no one wants to buy at $90, it will help me to sell at $85? Does this mean no matter how much the market plummet to, as long as the market price drops below $90, at a price with enough liquidity, it will help me sell? How does Stop-Loss Price apply when buying?

Stop-Limit Price is just Stop-Loss Price with a limit pricing? So if I set my Stop-Loss Price at $90, at any price below or at $90, it will trigger the Stop-Loss Price? But can I put my Limit Price both higher or lower than my Stop-Loss Price? So if I put my Limit Price at $92, once the market rises back to $92 or above from $90 and below when the Stop-Loss Price was triggered, it will help me sell my shares? What if the price never goes back up to $90 and above? Does my stock never get sold? So shouldnt I set my Limit Price at $88, whereby once the Stop-Loss Price is triggered at $90, it will help me sell my shares at $88 and above? Also, how does this apply to the context of buying?

Thank you!"
2021-04-21 00:20:09,stocks,"Stop loss orders when selling are a way to prevent loss. The addition of limit just prevents you from selling a very low price in case the stock gaps down on open. So in your example if the stock opened at $50, and you just had a stop loss to sell at or below $90 the stock will sell at $50. This is where a limit will help, you can say sell below $90 but limit at $70. In this case the stock won't sell.

In case of buying, it's the same concept. Let's say you want to buy a stock when breaks out of a trading range, you can set a stop loss to buy a stock once the stock moves out of that range. So for example, a stock XYZ is trading in $90-$95 range but you want to buy if it breaks $100 resistance. You set a stop loss order to execute if the stock trades above 100. If the stock trades above $100, your order becomes a market order. A stop limit will protect you in case the stock gaps up and opens at $150 but you wanted to buy above $100 but max at $120.

In case of buying stop price can only be higher than current market price and limit needs to higher than stop price.

In case of selling, stop price has to be lower than current market price and limit needs to be lower than stop price."
2021-04-21 01:36:37,stocks,"A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock when it reaches a certain price (the limit).

If the current price is $50, I can place a buy limit at $49 (bid), and my broker will complete the trade when the ask goes to $49.

If the current price is $50, I can place a sell Kim at $51 (ask), and my broker will complete the sale when the bid goes to $51.

These bids and asks are what constitute the market.

A stop limit is an order to create a limit buy or sell when the price passes a certain mark. This mark is called the stop. A stop loss is a type of stop limit where you create a limit sell order when the stock falls below a certain mark. The purpose of a stop loss is to set the mark below which you take your money and run.

While stop losses are a good way to limit your losses, they are also a way to solidify your gains. You can place what’s known as a “trailing stop loss,” where your stop price will rise as the stock price rises, lagging a specified percentage behind, but the stop price does not fall as the stock price falls. This way, you are increasing your exit price as the stock price rises, but you will never miss your chance to sell high if the bottom drops out."

2021-04-21 10:52:05,stocks,"Just limit orders are used to buy or sell stock at a price lower or higher than market price, respectively. 

For example if a stock is trading at 100 but you want to buy at 95. You set a limit of 95. Order only executes at or below 95. If you were to set the limit higher than 100, then it’s just a market order."

The closest thing i can find is this - [here](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/)

Which states that 95% of **finance professionals** can't do it, nothing said about average retail trader what so ever. It measured fund performance.

Why does that matter ? Well for one fund managers are bound by rules, companies interests and possibly wants to attract a lot of investors paying the fees for them to manage it all. For one thing you will never see a fund yolo his entire life savings into GME stock. You will never see a fund believing in Tesla from start to finish with their entire life savings etc. there are also going to be stock picks based on common sense, math, fundimentals more than someone just reading and liking a reddit post, retail traders/investors and finance professionals are living in 2 different worlds.

&#x200B;

Second statistics that goes around endlessly - [80% of day traders lose money](https://www.curiousgnu.com/day-trading)

Especially on reddit this gets spinned to as ''80% of traders lose money'', but honestly there was nothing said about an average trader/investor. So if someone says that 80% of investors lose money, it is **false**

'' Day trading is a form of speculation in securities in which a trader buys and sells a financial instrument within the same trading day, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. Traders who trade in this capacity are generally classified as speculators. Day trading contrasts with the long-term trades underlying buy and hold and value investing strategies. Day trading can be considered a form of gambling.\[1\]\[2\] It is made easier using day trading software.\[3\] ''

Here is the definition from wiki. So unless you constantly decide to buy and sell the stocks in the same day, you are probably not a day trader.

Why do day traders lose money though ? You might want to take a look at day traders competition - high frequency trading - [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/high-frequency-trading.asp)

The third statistics i often see cited was made in 90s, sadly i can't find the source upon googling, but i wouldn't really rely on 90s studies to begin with, because at the time retail investors probably read about stocks on news papers and internet wasn't even a thing to begin with. Different times, different mindsets.

Am i saying that average retail investor beats the market ? **Absolutely not**

The general conscious is probably in the right ball park, but everyone loves to cite statistics that has nothing to do with retail investors which makes the saying that this many % of investors can't beat the market fundimentally **false**.

If someone has more studies and actual studies on retail traders, throw them in comments, what i mostly see everyone citing is their inability to understand titles."

> We argue that the combination of simplified information display and inexperience exacerbate attention- driven buying by Robinhood users. Heightened attention-driven buying leads to more concentrated trading by Robinhood users than other retail investors and contributes to buy-side herding events that are usually followed by negative returns. **For example, the top 0.5% of stocks bought by Robinhood users each day experiences negative average returns of approximately 5% over the next month.

If that isn’t enough there’s [this too. ](http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20Skill%20110523.pdf) I think this one shows day trading is a more positive light. 15% profit however it doesn’t say how many fail to beat the market. 


> In an average year, 360,000 individual investors day trade, **but only about 15% of this population is able to profit** after a reasonable accounting for trading costs.


> In aggregate and on average, **trading is hazardous to one’s wealth.** However, the performance penalty associated with trading is not borne equally by all and is not confined to trading costs. Some traders are consistently dismal stock pickers; for a select few, trading proves to be a profitable endeavor.


Edit: 


[Heres another interesting one. ](https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/odean/papers/Day%20Traders/Day%20Trading%20and%20Learning%20110217.pdf)

> We test predictions of models of learning by rational traders and **find clear evidence that the decision to continue or increase day trading is influenced by previous day trading returns.** Nevertheless, rational models of learning do not explain all or even most day trading. The most experienced day traders lose money and **nearly 3/4ths of day trading can be traced to traders with a history of losses.** Persistent trading in the face of losses is inconsistent with models of rational learning. So, too, is the decision to try day trading when ex-ante expected lifetime profits are negative. **For prospective day traders, “trading to learn” is no more rational or profitable than playing roulette to learn.**"

What about the times they did it and lost everything? Even on GME some people got burned badly depending on when they bought in. 

Also, retail investors are still susceptible to biases and psychological quirks just like anyone else. You will always find a subset of funds or retail investors who can beat the market. It’s irrelevant to use them as examples because we should only care about the average cases. It is not reasonable for people to read your post and assume they will be one of the very few to beat the market over decades. 

All you need to do is read the research conducted into total market returns to completely remove the retail vs professional element from the debate: a paper found that a large majority of stocks end up underperforming treasury bills over their lifetimes. Roughly 4% of all stocks explained the market’s return from early 1920’s until now. 

I’m sure a good number of people can pick winners for one year. Fewer can pick winners for 5. Stretch to a decade, quite a bit fewer. Multiple decades? Statistically very, very few. And if they did it, you would know it. They’d be very famous and fantastically rich."

* People who claim they make 1000% a year are up voted to the top and therefore seem more common than they actually are.
* Survivor bias - the people who tend to visit these communities are those who're still trading, so presumably, they're the ones who actually made money trading, which is mostly new people.

I have an account that's worth a little more than $25k and typically trade about 1-2% per trade--it's small.  This helps me avoid making highly emotional decisions.  If I blow a trade, it doesn't fundamentally threaten my base whereas I may act irrationally if I have $5,000 on the line (I don't trade to get rich--I trade because I enjoy it and I can make $100-$250 a week to fund going out)."

Hard to say really. I think the reason people look to day traders is because they’re the easiest to define and find. Not to mention when you hear “stock trader,” the average person thinks of day trading. 


I think the general sentiment is “the more you trade the worse you do.” Hence day traders do the worst because they do the most amount of trading. So I’d imagine a swing trader’s returns are somewhere between day trader’s and a long term investor’s based off the number of trades they do per year. 


There’s a few studies that look into long term investors and their consensus is that the average investor will fail to beat an index fund. There are a few reasons why that is, and it has mostly to do with investor psychology. People tend to sell winners and keep their losers; and they panic sell. 


> The Robinhood study says that herding events will lead to negative short term returns. Probably people buying infamous hype stocks at their peak. So there has to be a condition of herding event and small time frame. Still doesn't translate to ''95% of traders lose money'' general statement.


I know. That’s why I said I thought it was interesting and included it. I said it didn’t apply. The herding events are thought to be trigged by the access to “top and bottom movers.” A group of novice traders just buy these stocks after they shot up by a huge amount and then get burned."

It would be interesting to see how retail investors’ returns stack up based on which brokerage houses they used, what they invested in, etc.  It’ll never happen though.

I’m old school and truly believe that the “average” person would be better off buying the whole market (index investing) than trying to pick individual stocks.

The stock market has already discounted the news into the price and the reality is normally never as good or as bad as the market anticipated."
2021-04-20 23:06:38,stocks,"Because stocks are speculative and a binary event like that tends to have lots of speculators betting in one direction specifically. Whether or not they're right is irrelevant because as soon as that event ceases to have speculative value there is no reason for these speculators to remain in those positions or for more of them to join in. Closing those positions adds price pressure in the opposite direction obviously. 

Let's say lots of traders expect a bad earnings report. Many speculators start to short the stock. Earnings come out, it's bad. The speculators were right, but now there's no added pressure from the bears piling in to trade the binary event. It's juiced. So the bears close positions, and the stock shoots up. The opposite is common too, and this applies to any binary event whether it be merger news or earnings or new execs or share lockup expiry or whatever.

It could just mean that there was a market crash, or that there was wild speculation, etc.

But back to the point, it depends on the situation. Red doesnt mean much. A lot of companies go red because they invested the money into new location or products. Amazon, for example, was red for more than a decade but their top line was growing rapidly so their stock took off.

Bullish sentiments:
Thinking about financials 62b in debt, but continue to have orders come in. Deferred orders from southwest to 2022 and 2023 was also announced today. 

New chinook orders for Britain, and 100 new planes ordered by SW airlines. Iran looking to revive orders though not sure if the geopolitical issues. 

Stock plummeted at the announcement of the CFO retiring at 54 years old and some FUD about it being a precursor to earnings since he did it just before earnings. I’m not familiar with the intricacies of management changes and how they affect stocks so maybe someone with more trading experience and fill me in? My theory is he intended to step in as CEO, but given his age and Calhoun getting an extension on CEO time frame he won’t really have a timeline to act as CEO, or he simply wanted to retire. Boeing isn’t in the verge of bankruptcy. 

Stock has been bludgeoned since owning it, but I’ve not let my emotions get the best of me as I feel conviction that it can hit $300 in a year or two just sucks to have to wait. 

Balance sheet wise they also have another loan they haven’t drawn down on and may not need to tap into. Likely negative cash flow this quarter, but near term CEO Calhoun expects a return to positive cash flow. A large back order of planes at around 4,300 and military side of the business.  After hours news today that the transportation committee is doing a third audit into the approval of the max return (yeesh seems a bit like overkill, but ok)

Boeing has ramped up hiring according to a few sources I know. They’ve also liquidated unnecessary real estate holdings to save cash, pushed voluntary retirements to bring in fresh cheaper labor, and have maintained their dividend halt to help with cash flow. 

Boeing has had so much heat I think it’s leadership understands the gravity of the QA problems that need to be addressed. I actually like that they’ve stayed pretty quiet and mostly focused on working through the problems. Sometimes silence is better than opening ones mouth especially with the sentiment and brand damage they’ve been dealing with. As they say actions speak louder than words. 

Bearish sentiments:
Vaccinations nationwide around 20% fully vaccinated and 40% on their first shot. Europe, Middle East and Asian markets are dealing with their own issues of vaccine distribution. 

There’s some talk about another financial crash happening this year due to defaults from zombie companies raising on debt and historically large margin borrowing. 

Interest rates rising could affect profits.  

SpaceX and LMT are competitors and who knows what other market spacex could try to tap (ahem consumer aviation?)

Is it possible they could do a share offering to pay down debts further diluting the stock? No one knows, but could happen. Seems ramping production and deliveries could help avoid this. 

Boeing definitely has a culture issue, but it could be foolish to think management doesn’t recognize some of these issues as they’ve had their feet held closest to the fire, still the issue remains. 

Don’t overlook the political issues with China. Lots of materials sourced from the region to manage costs. Really gotta bank on relationships improving over the next few years. 

What are your thoughts? For the record I’m down about $15000 unrealized YTD. Talk about “diamond hands” as they say.  I owned Boeing for 12 years prior before selling earlier in the year. Rebought at a bad timing.

Update: things evolve fast. Sounds like JJ vaccine approved again in Europe. 

My price target is $285 end of year. I think that’s realistic in a forward thinking market and assuming no more plane crashes or catastrophic events that hamper Boeing’s ability to profit."

2021-04-21 03:06:37,stocks,Yeah I guess I interpreted the move out of real estate to move toward a work from home work force as that’s the main work force that left office space similar to my work which is in tech so I saw it as more of an innovative move to save money on unneeded facilities. There are plenty of talented young engineers who want to take a stab at aerospace and sometimes fresh skin in the game can help a business innovate and change its culture for the better.
2021-04-20 23:16:24,stocks,Very poorly. Back to mid to low 100s fast. Stop loss is probably ideal here.
2021-04-20 22:42:55,stocks,"Really just holding out for a run up, and I actually just recently entered the position at the last run up. Just made a poor decision on my timing. 

Charts seem to show consolidation though the future is unknown and the market is very frothy right now. That’s the only thing that has me uneasy. Reason for not touching those securities for me personally is I see more strength in industrial and more risk in hotels. Not familiar with any 5G plays. Boeing’s current valuation isn’t as frothy compared to the overall tech market in comparison when looking at PE. The hope would be if we do see a larger correction Boeing would hold a bit stronger and only drop moderately on sentiment.

I had Boeing for 12 years and rebought back in during the late March early April run up so really less than a month. I’ve had little success hopping from one trade to another so I’m focusing on having a winner and more mid term, short term as in a year or two timeline."
2021-04-20 23:16:04,stocks,I didn’t downvote you by the way. Not sure who did.
2021-04-20 23:24:05,stocks,Yeah don’t get that. Is the 3rd audit so I’m not sure the market will react much to it specifically.
2021-04-21 03:19:09,stocks,"I read it as, ""Selling off assets to generate cash, replacing employees with institutional knowledge for new cheap labor, and withholding shareholder value when there is technically none to begin with.""


The engineering problems with Boeing have 0% to do with the talent of Engineers, as is often the case. Bringing talented young people into a bureaucratic hellscape doesn't make the hellscape any prettier."

2021-04-21 03:39:20,stocks,"Let's check out the numbers comparing it to one of the maddest gambling countries in the world: UK - a country where online betting is legalized and they gamble much more than other European countries. 

&#x200B;

 **47% of Brits** have gambled in some way in the last 4 weeks. 

 On average, Brits spend **£2.60 per week** on gambling, totaling over **£135.20 per year**. According to Businessfirstonline online gambling accounts for 38% of the total gambling market. However that is the total gambling market including casinos, sport betting etc. Exchanging the currency would result in 180$ per person and now the % results in around $68 per person.  In 2015 sports betting made 45% of all online gambling in the UK, so we now have around $30 per person. 

The US has around 320 million people. Multiple $30 with 320 and we get 9600 million spend in the US on Online Sportsbetting. 

Which would be 9.5 billion for the whole industry in sales. In the UK profit margins are:

William Hill 4.5% and Playtec is negative but has around 5% operating margins. These have several offline branches as well, so we say 12% is profit which is extremely generous. 

Taking the theoretical size of 9.5b of online sportsbetting and applying 12% (which is very generous) would result in around 1.14b in revenue. 

Average P/E ratio of InternetB2C betting sites was 15.6 according to Credit Suisse, that would result in an industry that should be around 16b for online sports betting. 

Draftkings is valued at 22b so in terms of online sports betting it is bigger than the theoretical industry of mad gambling Brits. So while the opportunity seems to be there, the price is already ahead of itself."
2021-04-20 22:17:19,stocks,"My experience with draft king.  I bought around $64 I think.  NY legalizes gambling, stock goes down. Announce deal with PGA, stock goes down, announce deal with NFL, stock goes down a lot. I am sure that as soon as my meager call options expire next Friday it will race to the moon!  😜🤘😜"
2021-04-21 00:21:09,stocks,I this DFKG is a win win stock long term. The NFL deal is gonna be way bigger that people think imo.
2021-04-20 22:25:17,stocks,"I took a quick glance at their statistics, and I believe that they have a lot of room for correction.

Their market cap sits at $22B, but their revenue is under $1B. They have about $1.8B in cash. Their deals with the NFL and other organizations are worth quite a bit, but I still think that this price is very speculative.

I do like the company and the prospects, but it looks overpriced.

2021-04-20 22:58:06,stocks,"Short term is murky and depends on overall small market cap stocks success.

* No Free Cashflow

&#x200B;

I found it hard to evaluate this company, to be honest. If I had to buy one company that is around 20B market cap, I would go with Logitech, Inc. $LOGI"
2021-04-21 00:33:28,stocks,"I think it's a great perspective in the long term, but I definitely think it is overpriced right now. The money could be used somewhere else for a return (assuming the market is rational, which is not... so not much of a point there). You also have other potential risks... if something is valued so high, any small hiccup can cause a very large pull back. That's my 2 cent."

2021-04-21 00:12:35,stocks,"ARK bought some today, if that means anything for you."
2021-04-21 00:38:50,stocks,its a good long term play. if you are expecting results in the short term you will be disappointed as a lot of their future revenue will come as more states legalize online sports betting.

2021-04-21 19:22:04,stocks,I like to see stocks I own used in real life. Many friends bet on sports. They all use draft kings. They all like and enjoy it. The market is only going to get bigger with more legalization. I think ill buy a little more soon here.

Fanduel is not as well managed and seems to always find a way to generate ill will with their customers. Draftkings will crush them at sports betting just like they did with daily fantasy. Anyway, that's my take. Very expensive but in my opinion this could be a $100B company in 5 years."
2021-04-21 11:01:30,stocks,The margins just aren't there. They burn money now and even if they were to capture the entire market in the US there's simply not enough of a market to justify the current valuation at well established margins in the industry. They'll be a successful business but they aren't worth 22B
2021-04-20 22:20:01,stocks,Hoping to hold for realistically 3-5 years
2021-04-21 09:36:01,stocks,What exclusive?
2021-04-21 12:40:04,stocks,"I understand the argument but I'm not a fan of comparing the US and UK. They are very different betting markets. I think you can get an indicative figure just look at the early US revenue numbers. 

Last 6 months of 2020 has roughly $1.2B in revenue from the sports betting market. Even though Jan-Mar normally has strong revenue too, its a fair assumption the second half would have strong numbers than the first so conservatively we'll say that annual revenue right now for the market is $1.75-2B. That's with less than 30% of US residents having access to sports betting and less than 20% having access to full mobile wagering (which in a lot of states that have it accounts for roughly 80% of betting revenue). Based on this your revenue number of $9.5B doesn't look too far off but here's the thing, several of these states only legalized this past year and are going to see heavy immediate growth to their revenue numbers. Even in established states, revenue numbers are increasing at large rates:

Nevada that's been established for decades saw roughly a 15% revenue increase from 2018 Q4 to 2019 Q4 and over a 25% increase from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4.

New Jersey saw over a 50% increase from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q4. 

Where the US revenue figure lands is anybody's best guess but I think $9.5B is incredibly modest. Also, more states are moving towards in-venue betting and some places (like FUBO) are working towards betting integration for live viewing (I'd expect books to follow that and DKNG has already worked a deal with Dish).

Also people keep labeling DraftKings as a ""US Only"" sports betting play. Canada is close to legalizing single game wagering and I feel very confident saying DKNG will be in the forefront of that market and will be an added boost to revenue.

Also, don't be shocked if DKNG expands beyond sports betting. There's still plenty of revenue opportunities available in:
- DFS
- igaming
- esports

I don't disagree with you that DKNG is aggressively priced but I do think there is some justification behind it. I still think the long term outlook for this company is very good and there is growth opportunity beyond current levels for people with a long term outlook. To each their own if they believe it's worth it at these levels."
2021-04-20 23:31:39,stocks,"I think we bought in at the exact same time. Every day is the same, 

Me: ""why can't you just be normal?""

DKNG: *screams*"
2021-04-21 00:49:57,stocks,Means people are selling the news. And it is just news cause the company has a bear monopoly and is losing 250mill a quarter. Sports betting also isn’t quite a lucrative as everyone hear thinks. Go look at some of the uk online betting sites they do 1000x more biz than dkng amd have a tenth of the market cap. That’s ur 3-5 year future.
2021-04-21 03:40:44,stocks,I quickly wrote up the potential market for the US based on UK numbers (which are mad gamblers). Draft King is already higher valued than the whole theoretical online sports betting industry.
2021-04-21 00:26:41,stocks,Yes but does that factor in sports betting becoming a larger industry after increased legalization? All of those metrics are in a different market; the new market will surely grow as more states legalize. Just a thought.
2021-04-21 09:16:05,stocks,she is out of control and will get torched in a prolong downturn and be forced to sell it all
2021-04-20 22:22:39,stocks,I think its a good play because of all the sports returning. Sports betting is only going to get bigger and bigger

I have a different investing style by buying better and well-established businesses that have a better fundamentals and value for my money. Like I said, if I have to buy one company that is worth $20B, I’d go with Logitech since it has better fundamentals and I understand its industry.

What I provided is just a tool to take consider. Either you take it or leave it."
2021-04-21 00:41:19,stocks,Thats what a lot of people analyzing them based off previous results seem to leave out. of course the profits are gonna be lower when they are structuring themselves for the future when more states begin legalizing sports betting. its a long term play that has a lot of potential.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"My holdings...for the most part Wanted to share my portfolio without having to explain every position but this is what I'm holding. Once I buy something it's there for 5 years or more. Selling calls on my positions. 

DKNG (Draftkings) - adding more as often as possible, lots of growth potential here, been adding and holding since under 40

TSLA (Tesla) - was in at 420 and out around 620 then got back in at 699 just recently and plan to hold for the long haul 

RKT (Rocket Companies) - love being able to own stock in this company, adding and holding edit; had to sell some on the big squeeze but got right back in, was truly a blessing 🙌 

CHWY (Chewy) - great company taking over the pet product game, great buy/add zone rn in my humble opinion, been buying shares since 55 and sold some around 90-100...added some back last week and won't be selling anymore for awhile

SPOT (Spotify) - love this app for music and podcasts, pretty much the only thing I use for music anymore (and this goes for all of my friends and family members), probably not a bad spot to buy or add some 

PYPL (Paypal) - was going to add some SQ awhile back (still want to and probably will), but wanted to add this one first, not going to give a big spiel on this but I like them a lot in the crypto/fintech space obviously and believe they actually have a leg up on SQ 

AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) - honestly I like NVDA better than AMD but I love the way AMD is lagging NVDA right now - added this one for a longer term swing as I'm expecting a nice push back to highs before long (might keep some long term as well after trimming profits), highly technical play but this company is obviously a good company with a lot of good stuff in the works

DOCU (Docusign) - I just can't not have some of this in my portfolio, they were a big player during the covid shutdown, largely due to the fact that they have an excellent service that was well positioned to capitalize on the situation, and they have a service i believe will remain relavent and a company that will continue to grow so I bought some (not a bad spot to add or get in, just look at the weekly!)

LOW (Lowes) - material prices rising as well as home improvements in general (I own a small remodeling business and I can tell you first hand we are busier than ever), I got some around 160 and wish I had bought more but probably will keep what I do have for awhile 

DIS (Disney) - liking the company for reopening plus they made bank during the shutdown via a number of different new revenue streams, solid long-term play here imo

ABNB (Airbnb) - let's see where this one goes, im certainly not one to buy every IPO to hit the market but this was one I had a feeling about, seems worth owning some and having some exposure to this business 

SPLK (Splunk) - holding a small long-term position here, they deal in machine data/automation

NVTA (Invitae) - like this company for the long-term, they are in the genomics/gene therapy space 

And im holding crypto (BTC/LTC/ETH) 
***Litecoin is currently my favorite crypto and I have been adding it every chance I get"
2021-04-20 22:57:21,stocks,I love litecoin too! Why is it ur favorite. I know it may not have as many developers or projects.. from what I have heard/read... but it just feels right to me

2021-04-21 00:45:21,stocks,Just shares. Honestly I'm not incredibly versed on that sector but wanted exposure and I know splunk is a legit pick. Maybe not the best pick but I feel like it's a safe play. Arkk is holding it and I think Cathy did a write up on them. I don't really follow her like some do. I just keep track of what she's doing from time to time due to the effect she can have on the market. I know she likes splunk. I did some dd but it was awhile back. I just buy and hold so haven't really looked at it since.

2021-04-20 22:08:21,stocks,"It’s a gambling game and you know it. 
The very day you sell is the day the stock could go up and lose even more. 

If you are so heavily invested why bother with short term outcomes. if this is a long term investment just forget about it and stop timing the market and rather see it as time in the market 

Popular phrase there. 

Now if you are just swing trading then you should know better. Like I said above you are just gambling. Now given the circumstances of this market. it seems shy and has been shy for a while. The positive consensus will happen when most investors believe that the very negative stocks will have hit a bottom and when that unspoken agreement happens then it will bounce up aggressively if your stock is heavily being shorted. 

If I were you and your investment is actually pretty large where 4K is in the single digits percentage wise then I would try to carefully pull out my money observing the market behavior tomorrow. If my investment loss is much greater I rather leave it in and look at it a year from now. Granted I believe in the company and their financials. Otherwise this investment was just pure gambling

And lastly, you're probably not going to be able to guess the bottom. Every time it hits a new low, you'll think, well, it could go lower! And then it will jump 5% in a day, never to fall below your sell price again and you'll be kicking yourself.

Dont sell unless you're moving the money into something else you like more, and then don't look back."

For example say you have $10k capital gains and $10k capital losses, they both offset each other and you have no tax implications that year

In another example say you have $0 capital gains and $10k capital losses you can claim up to $3k of losses against your regular taxable earnings, and carry forward the remaining $7k into future years to offset capital gains or taxable income in the future.

This is for US, Canada has different rules regarding capital losses"

With that being said, I learned quite a bit analyzing these tickers and how they add to the intricacies of our financial market
$UVXY, $SDS, $SRS. These tickers are *short* on their respective counter ticker. For example, SDS is short on $SPY. If $SPY drops a point, then $SDS should go up 2-3 points in theory. 
These tickers are exchange traded funds that are opposites of something else. You can go short on any currency, ETF’s, futures, etc. 
So, hypothetically speaking, if the SPY does poorly due to a market-wide sell off, then the money you’ve invested into an inverse ETF will go up. 
Again, educational purposes only! Definitely worth looking at. 

P.S - This is how Michael Burry made money off the arrogance of banks and institutions during the 2008 crisis... He went to banks and asked for a credit default swap on, *I believe*, a 20:1 Leverage.

Long term dividend yield as they rebuild the book, and nearly all the assets are currently agency backed so Big Uncle Sam is on the hook for delinquent payments. 

I would add IVR for the same thesis, with more growth, and more risk. 

For additional context: these companies buy mortgages (at a small premium to par) using a combo of debt and equity (usually 6 to 1 leverage). Profitability is the net interest margin, or difference between their interest payments and their received mortgage payments. The short duration spectrum of the yield curve is where they can see short term risk since mortgages are generally fixed term over long horizons these days. If rates ever ballooned, this would be bad for mREITs (but look at Japan's rate history since their fall from grace and it should show you what will happen here). Obviously they also hedge interest rate risk but this is just added risk in itself.

The growth catalysts center around  a few things: rising home prices (tied directly to book value of assets in turn tied directly to share price, which usually is BV per share); the inflection in refi dynamics (they lose money on refis because the premium they pay for mortgages is priced based on the receipt of all the expected interim payments) which won't happen if rates don't trend lower (and they really can't at this point); and the unleashed liquidity combined with WFH motivating new home buyers to propel fresh issuance.

2021-04-21 13:38:01,stocks,"It's not the buying power, but general influence that sometimes occurs when there is a good foundational backing. In this GME example, it initially started off by some redditor noticing the insanely leveraged naked shorts with the stock GME. I think they were so leveraged that not even that much stock of the company was in circulation. yadayada ... short squeeze ... we know what happened next. Point being there needs to be that foundational support if its ever gonna be something in similar magnitude to the GME squeeze."

2021-04-21 00:34:02,stocks,"Instead of looking at the company the deal is with or the “good news” sentiment, look at what the deal is worth in relation to their yearly profits. 

People hate the numbers but thats where the valuation and stock price are coming from.

People like PLTR and BB get a lot of “good news” because thats literally how they make the small amount of revenue that they do. So for investors, thats more like, business as usual, but to new investors, it looks like an opportunity."
2021-04-21 01:21:44,stocks,"PLTR is overvalued. People want good companies that are also overvalued to keep climbing. They have to prove themselves to big money to justify more upside or they will just go sideways. News like a 50 million dollar contact is not nothing, but that’s not helping much to justify a 40 billion valuation. It pays be a skeptic, buy dips, sell rips. It takes companies some time to prove themselves.

Even Facebook was in the dog house a while before it proved itself and started to trend up regularly. Even though people were hyped about it for a year of crap price action."
2021-04-21 03:19:58,stocks,"Yeah moving down 😂

2021-04-21 04:56:28,stocks,"Thank you.  Ive felt like a broken record with this. There are many who don't understand the valuation.  They also assume they are great at growing when the reality is they've been in business for two decades and have done almost nothing unless it was a government contract.  When news hits for an 80m contract,  at face value of the sale is like 8 cents a share, but I constantly see people crying how they got a contract and it didn't go up. They don't realize those contracts are expected just to be able to hold 40b in value,  not increase.  Anyhow,  not trying to turn this into a pltr bashfest, just wanted to acknowledge I appreciate your take."
2021-04-21 11:51:33,stocks," nothing about the meme volatility changed what the company is. 

 I honestly don't understand why BB is a meme stock but I also put zero weight on the ""moass DDs"" and whatever voodoo people are on about because they wanna make a quick buck. I've had it since around $6 CAD and holding 2025 or later when we see if their partnerships bear any fruit"

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing strategy Please let me know if this theory makes sense. 

In reference to investing in the S&P 500 over 30 years. There are two main variables when it comes to investing the amount that you invest dollar value and the amount of time that you leave your investment invested.

Scenario 1 
I invest $10 a day over the next 30 years in the S&P 500

Scenario 2
I invest $300 a month at The beginning of every month

At the end of 30 years well I profit more if I invest small amounts every single day in comparison to invest in one large sum once a month?"
2021-04-20 21:01:50,stocks,"Try another scenario, invest $1 every hour. 

Stop worrying these little details in trying to time the market. How big of a difference do you think it will really make 30 years from now?"
2021-04-21 00:43:11,stocks,"in theory yes.......if each day is a net gain then your compound return is higher. Look at a 10 year return daily vs monthly

annual return = 5%  
Period = 10 years  


    		daily	        monthly
    rate	5%	0.000198413	0.002380952
    Period	10	2520	        210
    PMT	2,520	-10	        -120
    PV	0	0	         0
    FV		32,691.43 	 32,646.18

    return		29.728%	         29.548%

You made a whopping extra 0.18% by investing daily

spreading out your entry point does have some benefits where it smooths out the volatility of the position. You're balancing out your eagerness to get in and watch it grow....well what it if drops? spreading out your entry over 3 month will net you a lower cost basis should things go south."

Maybe you should think about investing 50$ everyday the market is red.

2021-04-20 21:13:39,stocks,"Well most examples of DCA shows someone putting money in every quarter. I assume the benefits are minimal once you go monthly or daily.

2021-04-21 02:59:14,stocks,Dips are relative. Buying a dip could mean buying higher than if you bought when you first had the money. What if the market goes up 2% before dipping 1%? You would've been better off putting the money in sooner.
2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Trailing vs leading P/E of S&P 500 If you look at Barron's MarketLab today, it says that the trailing P/E of the S&P 500 is 50, which is a crazy valuation for the S&P 500.

On the other hand, if you read Zacks' research reports, they claim that the leading P/E for the S&P 500 is about 21, which is a bit high, but definitely not crazy.

This difference between the trailing and estimated leading P/E's would seem to indicate that analysts are projecting the earnings of the S&P 500 to double in the next year. Why would they think such a thing???"
2021-04-20 20:32:12,stocks,"Because of covid earning are depressed, because of stimulus and vaccines earning are expected to rebound, big time"
2021-04-20 20:39:48,stocks,"Because we just passed the one year anniversary of the Covid crash.   Earnings everywhere got unnaturally low, so looking at the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) doesn't give you a realistic estimate the way it normally does.   The stock market is forward looking and anticipated this so prices for stocks are up, but it will be a year until the TTM Earnings are adjusted back to normal. This year (I pray) isn't going to be like last year or we'll all be sitting on big losses!"
2021-04-20 20:48:03,stocks,">Because of covid earning are depressed, because of stimulus and vaccines earning are expected to rebound, big time

If you look at the S&P 500 EPS chart on YCharts, you'll see that the earnings have already pretty much rebounded to pre-Covid levels:

[https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp\_500\_eps](https://ycharts.com/indicators/sp_500_eps)

There were two down quarters in the trailing 12 months. If we add up the trailing four quarters, we get an EPS of 94.13. If we double this, we get an EPS of 188.26.

If we add up the four quarters pre-Covid, we get 139.47.

Consequently, it seems that analysts are predicting single-year growth of more than 35% over pre-Covid times. That seems mighty optimistic. The economy was booming pre-Covid.

If we divide 50 over 21, it seems like they are predicting a 60% single-year growth rate, not just 35%.

It is true that the Fed is printing money like there's no tomorrow and there's another $2 trillion federal stimulus package. But still, the economy usually grows these days between 2% and 8%, not 35% - 60%."
2021-04-20 20:55:57,stocks,"I showed the math above. To get from a PE of 50 to 21 requires a 60% growth rate in earnings from pre-Covid times, when the economy was booming. Or so it seems to me from the data I have at hand.

60% growth in earnings compared to the year before Covid just doesn't seem realistic to me. And even if it were realistic due to pent-up desire to spend, it doesn't seem like such earnings would be sustainable once everyone has spent their saved-up cash."
2021-04-20 20:50:29,stocks,"Economy is different, but related to, corporate earnings. They very well could be high. The average American has more cash in their accounts than before covid and less debt. This means the capacity to spend is therefore higher. Once people feel safe to spend and restrictions go away the economy should hum pretty good.

Also adding the last 4 quarters includes one covid recovery quarter"
2021-04-21 07:11:54,stocks,"I'm not saying a 60% growth from previous covid,  that would indeed be ridiculous.   I was trying,  perhaps ineloquently, that the Trailing 12 months is entirely covid time earnings and the future 12 months will be (hopefully) more like the no covid numbers from 2019."
2021-04-21 10:42:35,stocks,Did you get rid of all the corporate write downs and one time charges that everyone rushed to take using the Covid excuse?  The trailing earnings are anomalous.   Markets look forward.
2021-04-20 20:58:46,stocks,">Also adding the last 4 quarters includes one covid recovery quarter

But in that case, the trailing P/E of 50 reported by Barron's includes one Covid recovery quarter too."
2021-04-21 00:08:32,stocks,"That “less debt” is also due to people that are yet to be evicted not paying rent. Once that rent and eviction protection is gone, you are going to see the real carnage."
2021-04-21 15:06:39,stocks,"Well, if we look at this another way, the price of the S&P 500 is 22.5% higher than it was at the high before Covid hit. And even back then, the S&P 500 was priced at a rather high P/E, due to very low interest rates.

Expecting a 22% increase in profits over the pre-Covid high seems mighty optimistic. Especially when interest rates are bound to go up due to inflation caused by all the money being printed.

On the other hand, who knows how long the money printing party can last? It might take quite a while before the loan shark shows up and asks for his money back."
2021-04-20 21:00:37,stocks,But we’re nearly 4 months into the year (new data)
2021-04-21 05:42:13,stocks,"It’s possible, but I doubt it. Unemployment went from 3-4% to 14% to 6% in a few months. Unemployment was expanded, direct payments. As mentioned previous, the average American has more cash on hand (not wealthy American, the average American) despite going through a rescission"
2021-04-21 15:20:13,stocks,22.5% gains in a year and a third isn't necessarily an indication that the premium now is wrong... and who knows.
2021-04-20 21:04:11,stocks,"Trailing P/E is reported as trailing twelve months, not what it was for year 2020.

Consequently, the trailing P/E of 50 reported by Barron's should include all earnings for the last twelve months. In theory."
2021-04-21 15:30:35,stocks,"Well, yeah, who knows!  


But it's certainly a worrisome time to be pumping more money into the stock market. E.g., the Buffet Indicator is at an all-time high. On the other hand, trying to time the market is a fool's errand, and Buffet isn't out of the market. On the other hand, 35% of Berkshire Hathway is in cash. (Or at least it was a couple of months ago.)"
2021-04-20 21:06:30,stocks,"Correct, but you said if you double the TTM earnings, which includes 1 quarter of 2021 earnings. Not 4 quarters of 2020 earnings"
2021-04-20 21:13:27,stocks,Realized the data doesn’t have Q1 in there yet so it does have any interference. I would be wary of aggregated data on different sites with different comparisons though
2021-04-20 21:18:03,stocks,"The 1st quarter earnings for 2021 aren't out yet. But if they are being included in the TTM used by Barron's, then things are even worse for the prediction of such a high leading growth rate compared to the TTM."
2021-04-20 21:28:02,stocks,"Well, yes, I'm wary, but I don't know of any one source for all the data. But I'm just trying to get ballpark figures, and a leading PE of 21 seems highly optimistic.

I mean, look at it this way: The stock market is up 22% since the market high before the crash in March of 2020. The market was already at a fairly lofty P/E before the crash. (I.e., higher than 21.) So, a year later, things are now looking at least 22% rosier for profits than the previously booming economy?"
2021-04-20 21:30:32,stocks,The previous economy seemed sluggish. This seems to be much more vibrant
2021-04-20 21:37:44,stocks,"I don't know about ""slugglish"". There was record employment and a stable growth rate for about a decade.

On the other hand, we ***are*** printing money now like there's no tomorrow, so perhaps we're ready to party hard until the credit card is maxed out."

https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvenkqTxBF38hHgxU34JaWNAK1kw?e=0UgB0y

I'll list some of what I believe to be the big changes for those who don't want to spend time looking through the chart:
- NZD Cash accounts for 7.7% of the weight, which may imply holdings will be increased, or more stocks are yet to be bought.
- New holdings ENEL, NEE and XCEL now account for about 13.4% of ICLN.
- Verbund AG, closely followed by Meridian Energy took the biggest hits, having 3,000,000 ($222,767,000) and 50,100,000($195,255,000) sold
- PLUG had it's holding decreased by 4,000,000 shares, reducing the total weighting to 3.55%
- Notable additions, in my opinion are BLDP and FCEL (I have a bias for hydrogen fuel cells/hydrogen in general)

2021-04-20 20:45:46,stocks,I think most are happy about the PLUG weight reduction
2021-04-20 20:40:54,stocks,This makes me happy. Finally that expense ratio is coming to use. Glad PLUG % went down and NEE is in. Vestas is solid too.
2021-04-20 20:55:22,stocks,"Finally, I may actually cost avg down now, avg cost 33.47...ugh"
2021-04-21 00:00:57,stocks,I’m thinking 🤔 of adding another 100 shares
2021-04-20 20:56:27,stocks,Thank God they finally came to their senses
2021-04-21 07:43:08,stocks,Thank god they've finally given wind power a fair shake!
2021-04-21 14:06:52,stocks,Hopefully people will now stop talking about this like PLUG is the only thing in it.
2021-04-20 21:30:55,stocks,"I'm bullish on PLUG long term, but I think it's smart to put focus towards companies that have proved that they can show results with positive net income at this stage. NEE releases their earnings tomorrow. I don't think poor earnings will do much damage, but good earnings may push ICLN up quite a bit. The stock has been rallying for quite a while now, which makes me think there may be a positive earnings whisper going their way"
2021-04-21 03:53:06,stocks,Exactly my thoughts
2021-04-21 02:59:20,stocks,"Its a huge company, one of if not the biggest on wind. Had a good run up. Has a stock split in a few days too. Its a good bet, have both iqqh/icln and a few vestas shares myself"
2021-04-21 03:19:47,stocks,"How so? Nothing changed. They're just tracking the [index](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/esg/sp-global-clean-energy-index/#overview), same as always."
2021-04-21 05:08:08,stocks,"The index changed. Holdings were increased from 30, they will supposedly increase to 100, which means that there's probably some more stocks to be added"
2021-04-21 05:53:20,stocks,I'm fully aware. The fund management however changed nothing. They're just continuing to track the index.
2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"In theory, would a high percentage of shares held by institutions be a bullish sign? Like many here, I've just recently started investing in stocks the last few months. I'm not looking for stock picks here, I'm just purely wondering if a stock having a large percentage of shares(>75%) held by institutions like Vanguard, Blackrock, etc. would generally be a bullish or bearish sign? Or would it be more indicative of low volatility?"
2021-04-20 20:00:43,stocks,"No.  Not necessarily.  I would look for large passive funds (who see inflows) who have holdings in the individual stock.  This will create much more stability.  What you want a Vanguard Fund, who is price-insensitive,  buying up stock XYZ to always keep a floor under it.  You always want to have a buyer of last resort.  Let's use Gamestop as an example.  Not only do they have ETFs from Invesco, Wedbush, SPDR buying up their shares in the event of new share creations but they have HUGE  Target Date funds (like Vanguard) continuing to buy it at 165 (or whatever the price is now) because they are price-insensitive.  They do not have any discretion to look at price before buying.  So your dad or aunt or even grandpa who is still working contributing to their 401k which is 100% allocated to a target date fund of XXXX year, a small portion of that will go to buy GME at whatever price it is at.  That is just one example.  Can always discuss more!"
2021-04-20 20:42:58,stocks,I would generally consider this a bullish sign and usually results in a stable price. Institutions have analysts and risk teams that have vetted these holdings so that's usually a good sign.  Low or no institutional holdings can be a red flag. But I would take the percentage with a grain of salt as I don't think it's a real-time statistic.  At least not on the retail side.
2021-04-20 23:11:10,stocks,"""Held by institutions"" like Vanguard and Blackrock just means that the stock is a constituent of one or more ETFs offered by these companies, so they are buying it on behalf of other people (ETF holders), not for themselves. So ""institutional ownership"" by itself is neither positive nor negative sign, unless it's direct ownership, or the institution is not an ETF vendor."
2021-04-20 21:28:10,stocks,You are assuming institutions aren’t run by complete morons. I see you like to live dangerously
2021-04-20 22:12:29,stocks,Does who holds the stock rly matter?
2021-04-20 22:26:45,stocks,"You’ll start to notice that there’s a massive % of institutional ownership for practically every stock listed on the NYSE. 

Is it a bullish or bearish sign. I mean idk. If a stock has an unusually high amount. Sure maybe lots of investment banks have confidence in it. A stock has very low institutional ownership. Sure that could be good. Maybe if it gets more mainstream attention those buys could provide a lot of upward momentum. 

I think it’s something to consider sure. But it’s not extremely high on the list of things to consider."
2021-04-21 00:12:52,stocks,"No, institutions could be wrong and can invest into crap stocks on the wrong valuation too. A stock that is mostly held by intuitions doesn't mean jack shit if it's a good or bad company."
2021-04-20 20:58:35,stocks,"It's mostly just Bill Ackman and friends. I find it incredible that Bill gets so much praise for his ""acumen"" while all he does is buy popular fast food chains."
2021-04-20 21:09:56,stocks,"Interesting, so in the end you would say it's mostly dependent on which specific funds hold the stock, and if they're more prone to rebalancing their holdings?"
2021-04-20 22:07:41,stocks,"Would you say, in your opinion, that the period between which they raise their 5% or greater stake in a company and when they report their 13D/G you're too late? I'm trying my luck with a couple tickers that BR increased their stake on based on their filings, 1 I would say I'm 50/50 for short term gains, the other I feel more confident about. Just curious what you think. Please ignore my post history, I came to the sullen conclusion that the one big meme stock is just pryed from its fair value and will continue to consolidate so I closed that out for a decent gain. No more QAnon stuff anymore."
2021-04-20 23:21:27,stocks,"Yeah I suppose those two are bad examples, index funds wouldn't really mean anything, but more profit-focussed funds could be a better sign"

2021-04-20 22:27:20,stocks,"I'd feel more comfortable knowing most of a company's shares are held by funds who are in the business of making money, compared to retail investors who might sell after the first red day"
2021-04-20 22:28:56,stocks,"This is mostly what I was asking, obviously everything is situational but I was just wondering if it was a worthwhile indicator, so thank you"
2021-04-20 23:07:44,stocks,"It's probably not a bad strategy.  I don't think it's too late but there might be a point of dimensioned returns. Also, depending on the size of the position a 5% or greater move could amount to a lot of shares. Usually, big moves like that are done over time in multiple blocks, likewise unwinding will follow a similar pattern."
2021-04-21 03:02:15,stocks,"If you trust the judgement of whatever active fund manager is holding that stock, why not just give them your money to invest? I wouldn't trust them though, since most fund managers can't beat the market over long periods of time."
2021-04-20 21:41:22,stocks,"Institutional ownership means people that want to make $ own it. That’s it. I put $ on CELH last year. 4 bagger. Before it was on their radar. Now it’s on their radar, it has a sort of price floor because they value it. Sometimes their morons. Some of these stocks are so overvalued. AMD they’ll hold if they think it’ll make $."
2021-04-20 22:46:45,stocks,Won't the performance of the business be what matters long term. The only thing I care is that if there's a lot of insider selling that's a red flag but otherwise it shouldn't rly matter as long as the business does well
2021-04-20 22:46:53,stocks,"Np. I’d say that it paired with other significantly more useful information could prove useful.

Like many have explained, once an institution takes a considerably large position in common stock in a company, they can’t just sell it.

So say they buy into a company and the price starts to dive. It was trading at 20 and at that time Goldman Sachs owned 30% of the shares. Okay so now after everyone started selling and Goldman didn’t sell much of anything for fear of SEC involvement, that stock is now trading for 5 dollars and Goldman Sachs owns 90% of the shares. Now maybe to break even that entire time Goldman was shorting the stock and using their own shares to collateralize that or selling calls. Now they can wait till the company gets delisted and claim the commons as a loss. At one point in time that company was a 5 dollar stock with extremely high institutional ownership but is in fact worthless and on the verge of a delisting.

The point is Black Rock owns a whole lot of basically every stock listed on the NYSE. What sort of trading is going on beyond that, you have zero way of knowing."

2021-04-20 21:46:47,stocks,"That's basically what my thought was, they're in the business of making money so of course they think it'll make them money. I was mostly curious if there was a sort-of diminishing return effect if the stock has like 97% institutional ownership"
2021-04-20 22:53:37,stocks,"When it comes to small caps, I'm definitely more comfortable knowing funds believe in the company as opposed to retail traders who could cash out at any given moment.

2021-04-21 07:57:38,stocks,It’s run by a board of directors. Institutions own over 92% of shares.
2021-04-20 21:47:22,stocks,I’d agree
2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Trying to understand the bear case in general markets without it being too oversimplified. TLDR: saying stonks only go up is as dumb as saying stocks have to go down just because they've been going up?

I swear when I look around reddit the only thing I see is either people trying to squeeze a stock, or people saying that everything is about to go bearish. I'm sorry but the mean reversion argument BY ITSELF seems incredibly dumb.

 In the last 5 months more money entered the stock market than the entire last 12 years combined. Why should long term averages be so heavily prioritized without evidence for any specific catalyst when the moving averages include a covid crash that estimated a pandemic lasting 2-5x what it's going to take us to get everyone vaccinated, probably more stimulus than anyone expected, and huge demand coming back much faster than analysts forecasted originally. Why isn't the current high valuations being looked at through the lens of we actually artifically suppressed stock prices during COVID and earnings rather than they truly deserve to be this low. Unemployment is only high because benefits have monstrously ballooned and people aren't going to go back to some shitty job that would probably pay less when the government is literally going to give them money to do whatever the fuck they want. 

The Fed absolutely has to keep rates low and they've said many times they will even if prices rise they're not going to change anything. They've already said they're going to focus on employment which will be very slow to change as previously mentioned and there's actually other reasons too but they've got more than enough justification to keep rates low and all the motivation in the world because markets represent everyone's retirements and no president is going to suffer people losing their retirement money on a rate hike its literally akin to reducing social security at this point. Inflation won't actually mean higher interest rates because the fed will keep them low forever.... 

Tax focus has so far been them mentioning a global minimum... so fucking what and yeah fucking right good luck. 

The US is like 1 and a half months from being at herd immunity and red states are already fully open and getting rid of mask mandates and it's big fucking nothing burger. 

Average savings are still historically much higher than normal in US as well last I saw or heard...

So stocks have to go down during a time when lots of industries have already corrected because some of the larger indices are so well averaged that they benefited from lockdowns and now they benefit as reopening gets more realistic. What gives with the bears I realize people feel things are overbought but they can literally remain over bought for entire 12 month periods.... I actually get ready to puke when people mention the buffet indicator as if it doesn't take just looking at stock videos on YouTube for a few minutes to get exposed to it. Stocks are forward looking into the future and there's been record amounts of money put towards propping them up Why is it such a given that they must drop without any actual negative events occurring. Just because they're hitting high on charts for like a month. I haven't seen anything about record levels of margin market wide maybe in a few meme areas but still. Maybe there is a lot more margin than I realize propping up the indices? Doesn't seem like it. 

Record stimulus, record low rates, high savings still, herd immunity being reached in 1st world countries, Unemployment certainly under no real dire threat of greatly rising. 

I'm not a permabull but I really can't understand the bear arguement just for the sake of it hit overbought for a week or a month. I actually feel like the only reason the more mid size companies not in the indices are doing poorly is just retail got super fucking bored and decided to start only throwing money at random squeezes instead of random stocks. Sure it hurt some companies but it's kind of done and over and it actually made a lot of valuations more reasonable. 


I would gladly go net short the market if I thought there was a reasonable upcoming catalyst to time but I look really far and wide wide don't see anything. Even the J&J blood clot issue looks like it's not going to have any real impact and real or not they're not going to let it hamper distribution apparently. Are there any legitimate catalysts to look for for the bears? Anything besides just stocks being above moving averages that are artificially low because the pandemic was priced to last 2.5-5 years instead of the 1-2 years that it's going to? 


Love you all no matter what plays you're into I get aggravated by some stuff sometimes but I really wish the various WSB/stocks/investing communities could get over the various differences in culture and priorities and just share information better because we really are better off when we all gather in the same place and can absorb the most arguments/information."
2021-04-20 21:46:21,stocks,"There won’t be a COVID level crash anytime soon, not till 2023 the earliest because the FED is real and very powerful.  I think these 10% corrections and occasional sideways action is the worst we will see for the rest of the year.  We’re too bullish overall"
2021-04-20 23:32:30,stocks,"I see a lot of people like this with a fallacy that stocks lag the economy. No. Their value hinges on speculation of the state of the economy. It moves ahead of and often ahead of the truth. If everyone is expecting the economy to open up and boom, they will buy stocks. This means there will be no buyers left by the time it actually happens. Arguably this could end up as a bubble (think like when everyone piles into a stock before earnings and then the stock crashes even with a beating earnings report) though due to the more nebulous time frame of ""reopening"" this won't be a violent bubble if it is one. But we may see stagnation in the markets even with strong economic growth."
2021-04-21 00:38:54,stocks,"Stocks are forward facing. Last year they were busy pricing in 2022 earnings. If the economic recovery is not as robust as expected by the market, there will be pain. A lot of the general bullishness is that vaccines are rolled out smoothly (they’re not, as evidenced by geographic lumpiness), consumers are willing to spend down their pent up savings en masse (tbd, but encouraging so far), and an infrastructure bill/other legislation gets passed that could juice important jobs and get people back to work (also tbd). 

And that’s just high level domestic in US. Investors are also paying attention to international developments with vaccines and reopening so there are a ton of moving markets that kind of need to march in unison to keep this train going."
2021-04-21 01:14:49,stocks,Yes I think this is reasonable and has been a concern of mine since last year
2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Netflix shares fall 11% after reporting a large miss in subscriber numbers Netflix shares fell as much as 11% in after-hours trading after reporting a large miss in subscriber numbers in its first-quarter earnings report. The company also said it only expects to add about 1 million subscribers in the current quarter.

* Earnings per share (EPS): $3.75, vs $2.97 expected 

* Revenue: $7.16 billion, vs $7.13 billion expected  (up 24% YOY) 

* Global paid net subscriber additions: 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected

“We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big Covid-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to Covid-19 production delays,” Netflix said in its letter to shareholders.

When asked about their view on competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix responded: “We don’t believe competitive intensity materially changed in the quarter or was a material factor in the variance as the over-forecast was across all of our regions,”

“As we’ve noted previously, the production delays from Covid-19 in 2020 will lead to a 2021 slate that is more heavily second half weighted with a large number of returning franchises,” 

Netflix also approved a buyback program to repurchase up to $5 billion in common stock, beginning in 2021 with no fixed expiration date. That’s expected to begin this quarter, the company said.

Plus, I can’t see them ever beating Disney. Once the new marvel universe comes into play. Disney with all the in-house media is going to kill Netflix as their content becomes progressively more expensive."

2021-04-20 23:53:46,stocks,"I don't see any situation where Netflix finds sustained success over the next several years. Their existing quality content is getting gutted by competitors like Peacock and Hulu, for custom content they get boat-raced by Disney+ and HBOMax, they have no live TV option like HuluTV or YouTubeTV. On top of this they continue to raise subscription prices."
2021-04-20 20:28:04,stocks,"I haven't bought any Netflix ever, I'm planning on buying in another three months or so, anytime between the second and third quarter earnings announcements.

Here's what few people understand.   I live in rural Georgia (the US State), and like almost all rural people in the US below the southern border of Montana,  I don't have any high speed internet options.  I can't stream movies,  I download games for my kid on Steam at 7 KBTS per sec, yep, that's right,  slower than dial up i had in the 90s from the AOL disks.  

I've pre-ordered Starlink and gave them $100 deposit and they said are ""targeting the second half of 2021""  for availability in my area.  So far, based on everything I've read on the Starlink sub they are under-promissing what they are doing.  People are reporting much higher speeds than advertised. 

When Starlink is available there are a lot of rural people in the US, and other countries who haven't had the opportunity to get any streaming service before.   After that happens,  you should see a ""surprise "" jump in subscriptions to all the streaming services,  since Netflix is the largest,  most well known,  it should benefit the most.  

Delays in Starlink availability might push this to the fourth quarter,  I think that's unlikely since they successfully launched four rockets last month and one so far this month and have almost filled the first shell of phase one.  Just need some time (up to three months) for the satellites to get in position.   Other possible risk is dish production and delivery delays. 

Anyway,  good hunting and God speed."

I've heard they cancel shows before season 3 because that's when more royalties and contract renegotiations happen.

2021-04-20 21:37:28,stocks,"Years ago I prescribed a way for Netflix to avoid this.  Netflix's problem(s) at the time were multiple.  One was the cumulative loss of the kind of content that kept people contendedly hooked.  Loss of Disney, loss of Marvel, loss of Friends, loss of The Office, etc.  Another was their profligate spending without discriminating for quality or effectiveness of the spend.  There's others, but these two are a good place to focus.

What's crazy is a solution and chance to thrive is obvious, and I've been pitching it for a long time.

Netflix should have rushed to offer an open door and platform to content creators, then take a chunk of their wonton spending and repurpose it to variable reward payments to those creators based on popularity and potential, as measured by Netflix's strong business intelligence systems.  

They have/had all the difficult parts of that already.  Money to pay creators, sophisticated digital popularity tracking, and the mother of all distribution.  

It solves their biggest failings: lack of content, lack of ongoing freshness, lack of knowing what content to buy, lack of knowing what to pay for given content.

It would gave turned Netflix into a sort of cross between YouTube and American Idol and OnlhFans, where the ""best"" content gets rewarded, and where fans of artists can make the platform succeeded by supporting their favort creators.  

The low end of the content would be mostly unwatched, but it wouldn't cost them anything.  The highest end of the content would drive hype and engagement.  But they'd only be paying big bucks for the content that is proven successful.  Any studio (which is what Netflix has been aspiring to be) would kill for the chance to *only* pay top dollar for top content, and to avoid ever paying for a single flop.

As they're running it now, Netflix dumps tens of billions into content and closes their eyes and hopes some fraction of it is deemed ok.  That's incredibly inefficient.  

Let all the aspiring future Tarantinos put their pilot on Netflix.  The ones that rise will be rewarded, the ones that don't will still count as content and might help maintain niche viewer groups.  The model would be geared to favor continuous releases, be it nightly reports or weekly releases.  It would keep fans subscribed permanently, instead of conditioned for the wasteful whole season pump-and-drop weekends, where they don't get the bang for their content buck."

2021-04-20 20:08:38,stocks,"Proud to be one of those who dumped Netflix and contributed to those numbers. Serves them right for raising rates and while having a crap lineup. Hubris bites them in the ass. Maybe they will learn their lesson from that dip.

You cant raise rates while reducing quality and quantity of interesting programming.

Prime stepped up their game recently and went from having crap selection to something just as good or better than netflix for what I watch. Did not expect that.

Pluto tv (free) fills in a lot of holes as well. Theres no perfect service, but just about all of them are better than Netflix rightt now."
2021-04-20 23:47:31,stocks,They should have passed on cuties.
2021-04-20 21:53:45,stocks,There’s also nothing good coming out recently on Netflix. The quality of shows have really lingered
2021-04-20 23:03:39,stocks,They canceled Altered Carbon instead of going back to the drawing board of season 1 to understand what made that show so special - 11% is nothing after what they did to my boy.
2021-04-21 01:37:57,stocks,"Queue everyone trashing the company like they've been doing for the past 10 years. We get it, you like being bears, but Netflix will do fine if you zoom out."

2021-04-21 00:48:46,stocks,Disney is probably a better buy at the moment.
2021-04-21 02:55:26,stocks,"From my personal experience, Netflix has been underperforming for the past 6 months. The quality of shows is deteriorating, and they dropped very popular shows like the office."
2021-04-20 23:49:07,stocks,At least Amazon prime doesn’t stop after just 2 TNG episodes.
2021-04-21 01:05:34,stocks,"Netflix for $15/mo is an insane deal, we're spoiled as hell to think it's not. My gripe is the selections on the categories never change, it's the same movies all the time and finding something to watch is tiresome and takes way too long.  
  
I don't want to have to go on my phone and google ""what's new on netflix"" or whatever. They need to overhaul the UI a little and make it easier/faster to find shit."
2021-04-20 20:30:38,stocks,"Just like I predicted; a single revenue stream in a highly competitive market with high costs, dependency on volatile tastes, only plan for growth is geographic or raising prices, etc.

I never saw why they were so highly valued tbh"

2021-04-20 22:36:59,stocks,"Not surprised, Amazon video keeps getting better and Disney + is great of kids. Amazon has been slacking lately."
2021-04-20 23:26:27,stocks,Lol never invested in Netflix. Since I was in Uni this shit has been zig zagging all the time on earnings. Nice to see it still doing this 10 yrs later.
2021-04-20 23:40:05,stocks,I just bought a share yesterday... I don't think it's gonna go higher for awhile. Should I just sell?
2021-04-20 23:45:44,stocks,Probably has nothing to do with the decline in their content quality in conjunction with raising prices.
2021-04-20 23:51:22,stocks,Replace the netflix in FAANG with NVIDIA
2021-04-21 00:36:49,stocks,It slowed because your content reliably sucks.

It's the new Blockbuster unless it gets interesting again

I know what they should do"
2021-04-21 00:53:07,stocks,They lost me at the last price hike! $18 for one service is just too much.
2021-04-21 01:06:05,stocks,For me there is not many good shows on Netflix.  So why invest in their stock.
2021-04-21 01:21:05,stocks,"I think people are just lazy to not cancel their monthly subscription, even if they don’t watch Netflix anymore. If people just track how much time they spent on Netflix to how much they pay, many more will cancel. Once I realized that I am not even spending even like 1 hr a week on Netflix, I cancelled on the same day, otherwise I was just being lazy and paying 18$ a month."
2021-04-21 01:31:30,stocks,Investors with endless expectations came to the sobering realization that we are running out of people.
2021-04-21 01:35:07,stocks,Turns out Netflix's core competence was software and not media production and they failed at their strategy of churning out a billion originals imo (most of them are awful).
2021-04-21 02:58:54,stocks,"Its funny, all the rich investors probably don't have time to watch netflix/browse social media so they wouldn't know, but Netflix has really dried up recently. No hype on instagram/Facebook, no really good new TV shows worthy of memes. This fall in subscribers isn't a suprise imo."
2021-04-21 03:17:38,stocks,Melvin Capital sold off Netflix shares to cover a certain stock.

I can rent 4 movies instead"
2021-04-21 10:37:53,stocks,I unsubscribed after Cuties
2021-04-20 21:32:28,stocks,"No wonder, everyone I know is using somebody else’s account. For 1 paid like 100 freeloaders. How are they even find new customers? I guess through other businesses who give subscription for free if you get a cell phone from them."
2021-04-21 06:51:14,stocks,Woke content is what turned me away.
2021-04-20 20:47:22,stocks,Does anyone even pay for NETFLIX? Everyone I know just borrows their friends’ accounts.
2021-04-21 00:44:31,stocks,Maybe think twice next time you remove something as great as The Office
2021-04-20 20:47:00,stocks,Ouch good thing I got out couple months ago in the green
2021-04-20 22:39:30,stocks,I cancelled my subscription.
2021-04-20 22:40:26,stocks,HBO and D+ both better and Hulu and Prime up there too
2021-04-20 22:49:54,stocks,unsubscribe and short netflix :)))
2021-04-20 22:59:27,stocks,I used to like Netflix when I could get any movie in the mail... I don't use DVDs anymore but Netflix can't stream most content nowadays...
2021-04-20 23:21:37,stocks,"There are a lot of reasons to bet long on Netflix. There are a few reasons to econsider those positions.

2021-04-20 23:32:03,stocks,They have to keep spending huge sum of money to make good shows to stay competitive with so many new subscription services around. Its a very competitive market.

2021-04-20 23:37:55,stocks,"I can’t swing $18 a month for Netflix but $13 for ESPN+, Hulu, and Disney+ is alright for me

Maybe a lower tier for HD/4K with dreaded evil ads?"
2021-04-21 00:19:41,stocks,"That’s what you get when you reduce the number of active peripherals allowed on one account, then raise the price. F."
2021-04-21 01:23:07,stocks,"As excuses go, this is pretty solid.  With little to nothing to do during the pandemic, subscriptions to media like Netflix soared.  I'm sure even they never though that sustaining those numbers was possible.  A pull back in original content (very attractive especially considering competition) is also easy to tie back to the pandemic.  This does not seem to illustrate a deeper inherent problem."
2021-04-21 01:23:12,stocks,"Perfect,  the shutdown has resulted in less screen time and hopefully more nature and connection."
2021-04-21 01:34:24,stocks,would be interesting to see which hedgefunds are invested in the stock.

2021-04-21 02:01:52,stocks,"I was subscribed for 3 years and unsubscribed during the pandemic. In the 3 years I was subbed I maybe watched like 20 movies and 3-4 series.

During the pandemic, I looked up about 30 movies that I wanted to watch and NONE of them were on Netflix.

I tried other services and they also didn't have the movies I wanted to watch. These are like popular and iconic movies that got millions of people to go to the theaters in the 90's and early 2000's. Eventually I just pirated all of them. I don't understand why acquiring them illegally is much more convenient than legitimately."
2021-04-21 02:11:19,stocks,HBO max has surpassed Netflix and Hulu as my favorite streaming service.
2021-04-21 02:24:09,stocks,Plus ATH on NASDAQ & DOW plus overbought stocks plus overvalued tech sector equals this week's going to be fun.
2021-04-21 02:37:11,stocks,They should learn from Apple and put their guidance very conservative.

I generally avoid it."
2021-04-21 04:14:23,stocks,"They increased the damn price again, i downgraded to the cheapest one because I don't watch much. Only for the GF and even she can't find anything good to watch"
2021-04-21 04:22:32,stocks,what makes stocks tank on these earnings reports? are people sitting at their computers ready to sell the second they hear bad news? like if you're holding Netflix shares why would you be so quick to sell.
2021-04-21 05:00:11,stocks,Whack. The news doesn’t actually se that bad yet the shares are plummeting
2021-04-21 05:05:14,stocks,I don't understand what they are trying to achieve here by doing a share buyback with a P/E ratio of 90.

2021-04-21 06:31:28,stocks,In Pre hours NFLX is already 1.7 % up. I think it can be a good play on recovery... What do you guys think. i must get a share on 5:1
2021-04-21 06:38:14,stocks,"As someone who worked for a subscription-based service for years, I really think it's a dying model for consumers. Too many people think that a subscription-based model is the way to make money, whereas for *most* what is actually King is a free service with good data collection & monetization. 

There's just too many streaming services at the moment - the only one I think is doing it sorta right is Amazon - you get Prime Video included with your Prime membership or a discounted rate if you choose it alone"
2021-04-21 06:38:31,stocks,"As others have said here it’s a lack of good content + stiffer competition now. I just realized I haven’t watched anything on Netflix for over a month now (during a pandemic!) - they’ve had some really great content in the past (particularly documentaries) but a lot of the more recent stuff honestly feels like it’s created by an algorithm.

Ie it’s not awful content, it’s just... bland and unexciting. Like that recent documentary about the haunted hotel in LA - also I’ve heard the new one (about a mother tracking down her daughter’s killer on social media) is supposed to be meh.

And their movies are the same - except some of them really are downright awful lol. Shame as they’ve had amazing content in the past"
2021-04-21 06:57:34,stocks,"The company is of the opinion that the membership growth slowed due to “big COVID-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to COVID-19 production delays. Probably, this is the reason why the shares of [Netflix](https://kalkinemedia.com/news/world-news/netflix-misses-subscriber-growth-targets) corrected by 88 basis points (bps) on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ), despite a 141% surge in its year-on-year net income. As revenues of the company surged by 24% to US$7.16 billion, its costs remained the same. As a result, the net income of the company surged 141% to US$1.71 billion in the quarter."

2021-04-21 07:42:38,stocks,Is NFLX a ‘buy’ here at these new levels?
2021-04-21 08:03:14,stocks,Umm I guess they forgot to mention that their price hike pushed people out from 2 subscription down to one... I used to have 3 person access but each time they raise the price I remove one... next price increase I'll be done with them.

Unless my girlfriend has a specific reason to keep Netflix, I'm thinking I'm going to cancel and I'm assuming most others are in the same boat. If I watch TV any more, it's Hulu or HBO Max. I don't remember the last time I loaded something up on Netflix."
2021-04-21 11:40:33,stocks,make sense because they have competitors lmao...

2021-04-21 09:26:53,stocks,It has such a shitty selection. I’ve spent more time on there looking for something to watch than I have actually watching something. HBO Max is far superior.
2021-04-21 09:58:53,stocks,Might actually be a good short. More streaming services with compete with Netflix. Market valuations are high already
2021-04-21 12:08:17,stocks,I mean I expected this to happen. I believe a part of it could also be because there was talk on Netflix not allowing people to share their account with those in their family. I bet when they implement that they’ll either lose a fuck ton of more people or they’ll gain more because people will actually have to pay for their own account. Either way I wouldn’t waste my money on netflix anymore. every time they even put a good show or movie on they rip it away the next week.

2021-04-21 01:35:24,stocks,"The competition is fiercer now too. Disney+ is legit, especially if you have kids. And Viacoms streaming service has shows like Sponge Bob and Avatar the Last Airbender, as well as rights to some NFL games and the nickelodeon superbowl broadcast was epic. Amazon prime is cheap.

Netflix isn't going anywhere, but they've enjoyed first mover advantage for years. There are better options coming out now."

2021-04-21 00:41:09,stocks,"so does this mean NFLX is overpriced right now?

All that shit priced in should slowly bleed out over the next few months?"

I don't own Netflix, but the it's hard to even know where to start, people just want to complain about their profitable model.. but this is a stocks sub.

2021-04-21 05:04:13,stocks,"> Netflix is cancelling shows too quickly 

Because they behave like TV rather than behaving like a streaming platform. They are in the streaming business but they don't get it, same for Disney and Amazon.  


They don't understand that the point is to have a diverse set of content that has an actual proper ending (and an entire universe for the most popular franchise, MCU style). Even if you're in the loss in the short term, over the long term you're still winning since the IP is yours, and you get no more money to spend on it."
2021-04-21 02:17:58,stocks,The new Marvel universe is already here. And it's amazing
2021-04-20 20:02:42,stocks,"For me it's the lack of new *quality* content. Raise your prices, fine, but you'd better have the goods. Lately they don't have the goods."
2021-04-20 21:39:07,stocks,"I recently dropped my $18 (after having been a sub since pretty much day 1).  I found myself using it less and less, and using Prime & D+ more and more.  

In their conference call they specifically noted that they didn't think the increase in competition was a major factor... BULLSHIT!  

On a side note - I picked up AMC+ in place of Netflix and they have amazing content... hell I think I use the Shudder portion more than the AMC portion - The Last Drive Inn with Joe Bob Briggs is a new favorite (but may not be for everyone).

Not saying I won't go back to Netflix at some point... but I'll definitely be on an extended break."
2021-04-21 01:45:53,stocks,"Bingooo instead of continuing beloved IPs they just cancel them. 
Hbo has better content & still charge $5 less"
2021-04-21 02:35:03,stocks,Even my friends who are “into” Netflix say it sucks. Everything seems to be geared towards teens in a way but just from personal feelings and who I talk to for the people who are trying to save money I don’t think it’s a high priority !

2021-04-20 21:10:13,stocks,"That's why for the stock market Roku is where you want to invest in streaming the next five years. Streaming is going to keep growing at large levels, but you don't need to guess the best content provider if you invest in Roku, which itself has been doing an amazing job of expansion but still has room globally and for name brand recognition to set it from second tier to blue chip. 

Disney+ does at least have the power of children's entertainment though, Disney+ ain't going anywhere our lifetimes, I will say that."

2021-04-21 02:12:17,stocks,How come high speed internet is needed to watch Netflix?
2021-04-21 03:26:01,stocks,Starlinks speeds will drop to what they're advertised once enough people are onboarded. The satellite will need to cover a wider spectrum but 7000x on speed you'll notice the difference alright

2021-04-21 12:29:05,stocks,"Feels like 90% of the comments here are from your average white 30 year old Funko pop collecting MCU obsessed Redditor.

People need to divorce what they don’t like from what is actually popular. Stuff like Bridgerton and The Queen’s Gambit was huge and the only stuff my circle of friends was talking about outside Sports/Mandalorian. I’m not a big TV guy these days but I watched Alice in Borderlands, a show I heard nothing about on here, and really dug it and am looking forward to season 2. Not everyone cares about MCU show XYZ or Star Wars IP #4636, and even if you think it’s pandering to woke audiences or whatever the content that Netflix pushes out does get a ton of views and buzz from younger audiences (as someone mentioned earlier Ginny and Georgia or whatever it’s called got tons of views).

Feels like Amazon was pushing out a ton of good original series in 2019 but it seems like it’s slowed a lot. I do enjoy their movies and content but it’s not even close to Netflix at this point (I do like their licensed content tho).

HBO is also a non factor here in Canada as their content is tied to Crave and we still have yet to get access to a lot of their HBO Max exclusive stuff."
2021-04-20 20:29:31,stocks,I’m waiting for the day everybody quits using the “it’s covids fault” excuse for shitty practices. Terrible customer service? Oh that’s covids fault. Awful return policy? Oh it’s because of covid.
2021-04-20 22:25:39,stocks,You think NFLX would have benefited from COVID considering everyone was in lockdown at home. Out of anything COVID should have helped their business not hurt them.
2021-04-21 11:21:23,stocks,"I remember about 10 years ago, people were complaining about netflix raising prices. But it resulted in netflix increasing subscribers over the long term."
2021-04-20 20:14:35,stocks,Only if you believe they can fix whats broken. Raising rates and having a bad lineup of shows will only bleed more numbers over time.
2021-04-21 06:30:54,stocks,"I wouldn't say so. Fragmentation of the streaming services market will only increase and it's hard to predict which service will have the largest share because it wildly depends on what they will be offering at a given moment/quarter, as people tend to subscribe for a month or two to watch what they want and then wait for another big release.

And honestly, Netflix has a terrible business model with investing in a multitude of mediocre or worse series that are later cancelled en masse, often for some fucking reason with actually good series."
2021-04-21 06:25:31,stocks,"Meh, it's not smart to steal. This is purely a matter of convenience. People jumped on Netflix years ago because it was easier to use it than to pirate things. But now things are returning to piracy again because we have like 10 separately paid Netflixes and the prices are constantly going up in most cases. They are killing themselves."
2021-04-21 03:04:02,stocks,I agree but I also consider it a deeper problem than that. The entire film industry is pushing mostly trash. It seems more about the woke movement with a narrative to push rather than actual quality content.
2021-04-20 23:07:16,stocks,And there’s multiple streaming options now.

do they though? for years their most watched shows were the office and parks & rec, now they've lost those and they still somehow haven't managed to produce anything close to a classic sitcom"
2021-04-21 00:49:40,stocks,They have a PE ratio of 90 and a PS ratio of 10. Unless their growth is on track to 5x the company in the next 5/10 years they're drastically overvalued. If it looks like massive growth is a thing of the past they realistically should be worth < $250/share.

2021-04-21 12:37:31,stocks,"What “preachiness” are you talking about exactly? You also know that stuff can not appeal to you and still appeal to others?

Cuties was a French indie flick released through Netflix, not exactly an original series. Who cares"
2021-04-20 21:57:30,stocks,"Agreed, I canceled after The Office left because I just couldn't find anything that has interested me. Prime video and HBO max both have good enough content that I don't feel the need now for additional streaming services."

2021-04-21 17:44:53,stocks,"They have a tough business to run though, it's expensive trying to take the place of 30 cable channels at once. I don't own their stock because of this, too capital intensive with returns too limited. The better you want to make the content, the more it costs. Disney at least has aggressive merchandising, tv channels, parks, and theater revenue (they did, anyway) to get better returns on their creation costs."

2021-04-21 02:16:28,stocks,"Netflix subscriptions in India are only around $3 per month so you need a LOT more subscriptions to make the same revenue that you would get from North American or European subscribers.

Granted, there are a lot more people in India than in North America or Europe."
2021-04-21 02:39:44,stocks,"Yeah, but is it amongst the high speed internet access crowd?  The poverty levels in India are probably unimaginable to many in the west.  I am guessing these are the people suffering the most from covid due to lack of nutrition, shared communal bathrooms, etc.  Families sleeping on the ground together with just a blanket.

Also knowing  my south asian relatives; netflix is interesting but they have their own channels playing local shows, dramas, and movies that appeal to them."
2021-04-21 00:46:14,stocks,Isn’t piracy huge in India though?
2021-04-21 02:09:43,stocks,"Indian market is tough to crack. And also the content they are producing is below par. They are still to understand what the acting/direction skills are expected. Some of the webseries are complete joke. They are putting lots of money without much check on quality.

Because if not they're overpriced. The only company that has a comparable P/E ratio is Disney and they have movies, theme parks, hotels, and a cruise line that all got kneecapped by Covid along with record-breaking streaming growth."
2021-04-21 03:41:32,stocks,All who canceled that I know of did it because of very poor quality content in Netflix. If you still have a life going out of pandemic you would have probably watched everything that matters on Netflix. 😎 The only thing that kept me from canceling it after I got HBO Max is that my mother-in-law is glued to the TV and she is using my acount.

Covid gave them record new subscribers but lockdowns and restrictions limited the content they could produce so it created a gap in new content which we're experiencing now. It's not a matter of money - they still have by far the most amount of money to throw at new content compared to their competitors, it was that they were literally unable to film because of covid. I think short term we're going to see pain for netflix but based on what they're saying, there will be a big influx of new content in the 2nd half of 2021 and that should result in higher subscriber growth."

2021-04-21 01:08:11,stocks,That has always been my major complaint about their service. A lot of the original content that fills it(especially now that every studio has their own streaming and pulled their stuff) is just B movie quality trash. Then they upped their price a few times and I bailed. I survive with Hulu and HBO.
2021-04-20 22:06:50,stocks,Lots of cheap trash content and shows from Asia too.

2021-04-21 07:13:56,stocks,I cancelled a few months back for this reason.  Ran out of new shows to watch and it seemed like they were only putting out trash sitcoms and reality shows.  Seemed like they started pandering to the lowest common denominator.
2021-04-21 11:27:53,stocks,I agree there is a lack of quality content but they did mention covid related production delays. This could be contributing to lack of new shows.
2021-04-21 18:31:44,stocks,"I actually like a lot of what I *do* watch on Netflix but the thing is I rarely watch the new stuff. Why would I? Its just gonna get cancelled and the story will be incomplete. Even their movies half the time feel like the budget ran out 75% of the way through so they just farted together an ""ending"""
2021-04-21 11:15:37,stocks,"> In their conference call they specifically noted that they didn't think the increase in competition was a major factor...

NFLX is dead, they just don't know it yet. The content on HBOMax and D+ destroys Netflix. Viacom has a deep library as well, but they botched their Paramount+ rollout, however, I think they will roll a lot of stuff back in as their outbound license deals expire. The cost to NFLX for inbound licenses has to be through the roof and the premiere IP rights probably won't be available at any cost in the not too distant future."
2021-04-21 18:34:04,stocks,Yeah that line is definitely just damage control. Competitors are like 80% of their issues with the other 20% being executive decisions like cranking prices and flooding their catalog with cancelled shows

2021-04-21 01:34:34,stocks,"Roku has zero moat though. They are basically selling exactly what their competitors are but the top competitors have their own streaming services. I mean Amazon could sell their devices at a loss if they thought it would mean more people subscribed to Prime. On top of that, developing apps for Roku is an absolute fucking nightmare. I mean you have to learn ""Brightscript"" which is worthless outside of Roku development. At least other apps are using standard languages that developers likely already know or don't mind learning since they're useful across multiple platforms."
2021-04-20 23:35:06,stocks,I thought Roku was just a device. You can do similar things on a nvidia shield.

2021-04-21 02:03:12,stocks,"Roku’s real money maker is their customized ads, they have the highest turnover rate for viewers actually buying/visiting the products website and services"
2021-04-21 11:14:05,stocks,"I agree. I’m ultra bullish on ROKU. My vision is that it becomes the literal homepage for TV in the future, much like yahoo or google is/was the homepage for the internet. Any time someone sits down to watch anything, they are viewing roku ads. Their UI is way better than Apple TV by a mile. Every time streaming wars heat up, roku wins. People just don’t understand what roku is. 

As per moat, sure, anyone can replicate the tech, it’s nothing fancy. But it’s tough to beat momentum and familiarity. 

And for the people saying “well the really nice TVs don’t have roku”. People with really nice TVs don’t watch TV. Higher income, less TV watching in general."

Roku is nothing special."

Streaming is no longer a tech oriented business, the tech advantage that Netflix has is diminishing more and more every day. Streaming is going to become the entertainment industry and the giants that make the most money in the entertainment industry, the ones that produce the biggest blockbuster entertainment, they're going to be the ones that make the most money in the end of it. Netflix has always been the middle man, but slowly and surely society is going to phase out middle men and just rely on pure delivery to get actions done."

They have to produce content that competes with the major movies studios, but they only get revenue from streaming whereas the studios get cinema, Blu-ray, TV/cable, and streaming on their own service AND NFLX doesn't have the same back catalog of the big studios to fill out their catalog. Long term, if NFLX can hold on and create a back catalog of quality content, they might be able to eke out a niche for themselves, but there will always be fierce competition from studios who have the advantage of more revenue streams."

2021-04-21 07:05:57,stocks,"Could be,  I just think Disney is a fairly diversified company with lots of revenue sources (sports, parks, cruises,  movies) and a jump in subscription numbers isn't going to move the stock as much as it will in a pure play like Netflix.   I could be wrong though,  I have before."
2021-04-21 06:28:51,stocks,"Starlink operates a bit differently than the existing internet satellites.  It's currently at almost 1400 small satellites with the final number of about 4000.  Each satellite covers a small area and is still slower than good land based internet,  this should have a reasonable number of users per satellite which should keep it from being too congested.   The testing in the northern latitudes has shown better than advertised results so far and the beta testing has been open to everyone in the service area for a while.  That might change a little if they start advertising and bring in more people,  but this would be at the same point the number of satellites are increasing so I actually expect it to get better over time."

In addition Netflix is only 100 billion less than Disney yet has way less than Disney and Disney has a streaming service now. Netflix is overvalued it’s crazy.

The question is do people think that Netflix will be about to push 20 billion a quarter to match that valuation in 5 to 10 years. I think not. The market is getting too competitive."

2021-04-21 18:29:03,stocks,"For a specific example, the 2nd episode of CBS' Bull has a plot revolving around implicit bias.

The problem is that's one of the pop psychology ideas that got caught up in the replication crisis years ago and its most popular form (the IAT) has reliability comparable to Myer-Briggs along with little to no predictive validity.

As a result much of the episode was cringy and I felt they could have gotten the same idea across much more subtly, but it came across as lazy writing by someone with a very specific viewpoint they wanted to promote. Still not a terrible show, but the premise is silly enough without the overuse of pop psych."

Hardware might not be able to keep up with modern codecs and its kinda like with phones where you're at the mercy of a hardware manufacturer to keep up with software updates so they could reach EOL and not get the new apps or be unsupported by new app updates etc

So in that situation you'd have to replace the whole ass TV... Or just replace the $30-50 Roku. I believe Roku also plays a role in the software development of certain TVs so they potentially get to double dip in those instances. Then theres the argument that developing for a few Rokus can be easier than the 5000 hardware variations in TVs, similar to PS/Xbox vs PC, iOS vs Android etc

Thats just what I know off the top of my head. Theres probably more to it all though"

Not to mention subscribers numbers are distorted because most Amazon Prime Video subscribers don't use it for example, and there's similar problems with some of the way other streamers boost their numbers. 
Netflix boosts profits in a year where they can barely film and this sub just cares to talk about how their experience with Netflix is all the dd that matters."

2021-04-21 03:37:38,stocks,"Not really covid it was happening before it. What seems to be happening in the film industry in a whole is there more focused on delivering a narrative which is so politically correct they are loosing everything else to meet that path.

What basically happening is they are ""forcing"" a story line to deliver diversity inside the films which massivly upsets or destroys the actual original story line. Effectivly they are picking actors to meet the diversity / political corret rules and then adjusting the script to suit this narrative rather than than selecting actors which can play the part of the script.

A lot is all based around remakes of existing scripts as well. Like look at the state of ghostbusters for a prime example of a complete failure of movie compared to the originals. $80m loss at the box office. Fans were NOT impressed with it at all.

batwomen is another example. They basically stole the batman charater and chucked a load of nasty feminist eg this is the feedback they are getting [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnaW9RUbv8U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnaW9RUbv8U) Its just pure cringy lines like ""The suit won't be perfect until it fits a women"" just wreck the show. Like the ratings went from 7.5/10 (batman) to 3.5/10 (batwomen) doing this....

There lots of lines in movies which are doing effectivly that. Which is effectivly bashing 50% of their audience. So its no wonder they are loosing 50% of the cash doing it. eg gillitte advert is another really good example.

It not like action movies with strong female leads didn't do very well in the past eg Alien would be a prime example that everyone knows even though the script was originally written for a male lead. The women played/fitted the parts perfectly."
2021-04-21 02:24:17,stocks,That’s also very niche imo
2021-04-21 01:25:16,stocks,"The problem is that they don't seem to be very good at making content. Their strategy seems to be to make a massive number of mediocre shows and cancel them all after one season. Mind you, they also cancel the good shows after one season."
2021-04-21 01:35:13,stocks,"Except if you sell blurays of your old content...people dont have to subscribe. If you stop making blurays they have to sub to watch. bluray players are not long for this world, as much as it pains me to say it.

Cable? That's been dying. Massive telecom & film studio consolidation has all been for the sole purpose of competing with Netflix and Amazon. Some of them will certainly try and use some sketchy non competitive bull, watch for net neutrality to continue to be a major issue.

Cinema? Please that's basically a subscription service where you make less than  15 bucks a ticket and not everyone is going to your movie. average viewers were going maybe once a month before covid. We may see a surge as people get out and about after lockdown but I dont see a viable long term path for theaters and studios are finally getting used to cutting them out anyway.

Back catalogs you have a point on, but only because studios figured out that the reason Netflix wanted to rent their catalog was so they could make bank off of it, and then basically charged netflix to pay them to create their own services (also part of why there's been so much studio consolidation). But most people want to watch more recent stuff. They arent paying 20 bucks a month to watch titanic at will.

Netflix's niche is 100% personalized content. They make a TON of stuff. Everyone is saying ""they have so much junk"" guess what that junk absolutely was targeted for someone who isnt you. Yes they have some big mass appeal stuff but they are getting more and more targeted. I think they need to advertise a little better, but I've been seeing changes. I honestly think it wont be long until they start rolling out targeted cuts of films where different people see different versions of content, at least in the first few weeks to see what reactions are like. They also have tried getting into the interactive film stuff, we'll see if that works out.

I say all of this as a HUGE movie fan who loves the theater and physical media. As much as it's for me, I dont think it will appeal as broadly the way it used to."

I don't think it works that way or you can compare with who is better. Its cycle driven people use netflix for 3 months watch everything they want to watch dump it then move on eg Netflix -> HBO -> Hulu -> Amazon -> Netflix again

That way people spend £10/mo for 1-2 subscrtions and no more ever. Its just what the industry has created for its self by fragmenting in the way it has.

Which ""brave"" company will introduce minium contract period first?"
2021-04-20 22:05:31,stocks,"I dont have HBO, so cant comment on quality of that. Hulu pissed me off with all the intrusive commercials, so I dont know what they are like now. I dont support Disney, or the CBS one at all, so not sure about those either. Maybe they have a lineup thats worth the price?

 Amazon has improved leaps and bounds as far as the shows that interest me, compared to Netflix, plus I already have prime so its a kind of freebie for me.

I think the reason they still have so many subscribers is that people dont know of a decent alternative, but they do exist as far as quality of content now that netflix is absolute crap. Its one of those monthly fees you just dont bother to cancel despite not using it much anymore. 

I personally paid for cable (back when I had it) for like a year longer than I should have, despite only watching 1 or 2 shows on it per week. I think Netflix benefit from that mentality.  Too lazy to cancel under the illusion that there might still be something worth watch one day.

If people were encouraged to churn the different services every month or two, they would see how much freedom they have and money they would save. The alternatives dont suck like they did a year ago."

Forward PE is 40x expected earnings...I’m not sure what is supposed to happen to justify the current values. 

Perhaps cracking down on passwords will create a big catalyst? Big wave of growth from investment in broadband access?

I think they are likely maxed out on pricing power, their content isn’t that great and they have to pile on more debt to keep the content up. 

The increases in competition are going to put pressure on the costs of licensing content and pressure on the subscription costs."

The monthly subscription is still pretty high. Basic mobile version is something like $5 pm, while all whistles is $10. This should not have been a problem if Netflix is all stop for everybody for a family, far from it. 

Also content side is still lacking. 

Personally Disney+HotStar seems better deal for Indians."

**Netflix market share is about 24 %**, all others are smaller – Disney+ stands at 9%, same as Sky Ticket. The sports only service DAZN has a market share of roughly 7%. 

There are some smaller, local services, some operated by TV channels, some with special content, such as horror or Arthouse, but their market share is small.

2021-04-21 08:34:46,stocks,"Hulu is significantly better than Netflix even with ads, mainly because they post new episodes 1 day after they air instead of months after the season finishes, they also have a better selection and bettsubscription, it's cheaper, and you can get an ads-free subscriptipn if you want, plus you can get Hulu Live for cheaper than cable"
2021-04-21 07:25:00,stocks,Are you accounting for internet though? Internet without a cable package is about $70 in my area. With netflix you're now at $90. Well I can get a mid tier cable package and internet bundle for $80. The internet companies caught on so it's not cheaper to cut the cord anymore. Now you're paying to be ad free which is the way I see it and I'm totally ok with that
2021-04-21 01:39:42,stocks,Personally I’m ok with ads for some shows if I’m paying less. I pay $2 per month for Hulu through a promo but $6 ain’t bad. I also sometimes have trouble focusing through an entire episode so the commercial breaks are somewhat helpful for me

This isn’t Netflix vs all, I still don’t see which one beats Netflix alone, especially if you take the international markets into account. Possibly HBO.

2021-04-21 03:02:16,stocks,"Ohh yes. I was comparing similar markets and growth and also Disney’s income from streaming. They also almost aligned perfectly with number of subscribers to income ratio. So 100 million subscribers is about 3,5 billion to 4 billion in revenue. This was just off quick looking into finances. So even if Netflix doubled its subscribers, it still wouldn’t be able to justify its price point, would be close though. The industry is almost maxed out too. 

This isn’t shilling but for example I’m okay with tech like Nvidia and AMD (I’m invested in Nvidia not AMD) having a forward PE of 40 because the market is growing rapidly, AI chips (AI chips in general is growing so fast) in cars are a thing and unless you think electric cars or crypto-mining and cpu market is slowing down that’s where the high forward PE make sense, where in 10 years the market is still going to be growing rapidly. I’m just wondering where the streaming market goes because the revenue output isn’t even that massive in comparison to the market cap of these companies. These companies are priced in closer to Netflix in a shrinking market (AMD and NVIDIA). Maybe I’m uneducated but Netflix is running on hype not fundamentals."

100% this.

I've been a Netflix fan for years and years, arguing against the whole ""they don't have anything"" complaint for a long time now. 

But I'm having trouble finding things to watch that I haven't already seen or are in the mood for. The interface getting dumbed down slowly but surely hasn't helped at all.

Still it's better than Amazon's.. where they show you part of a description that is cut off, and no way to see the rest of it.

2021-04-21 11:36:22,stocks,Yeah I have a B-tier Hisense TV I bought in 2018 that’s got Roku built in and it’s good. They’re definitely a popular brand.
2021-04-21 09:07:04,stocks,"I'm surprised that they are valued as high as they are, but I can make some counter arguments. First, if you're going to recommend a device to someone:

* shield is expensive and for enthusiasts. 

* chromecast without remote annoys many people. New one with remote is step in right direction.

* Apple TV is great if you want to drop money and possibly sucked into an ecosystem void. Also they just finally decided to fix the remote yesterday that everyone hates after what, 3-5 years?

* Fire TVs, for me, have just been a garbage platform advertising Amazon.

The built in smart tv? Well, I bought a top of the line Samsung KS series 4K HDR quantum dot tv (~$3K when new I think?). The Tizen OS is slow, and many apps don't get updated enough. Some apps don't add the latest features, and I believe (but not certain) that certain apps aren't even offered any more. Try explaining to people that they have a Tizen OS TV. I know Plex dropped support for Samsung Smart TVs a few years back that were one model year older than mine. The 'smart' in a smart TV comes with a lifespan that is seemingly shorter than the TV.

So I literally recommend Roku to most people. I use it myself on both my KS series TVs. It's smoother, more responsive, has all the features and services that my TV doesn't have. The roku has the most neutral platform with the simplest interface and use, you can't go wrong. While I'm technical and can enjoy AppleTV or the Shield, they don't offer anything unique that 99% of viewers care about as far as I know."

Yeah same. But thats really my point. they just played the part got on with it and got the job done. There are real problem with cringy, constant dose of identity politics being delivered in modern movies and it seems to be getting a higher priority than the quality of content. The content as a whole in the new stuff coming out is not being well recived by the consumers as a whole eg its basically this is what people are saying [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqmd4iU8J3k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nqmd4iU8J3k)

Which means that the majority of stuff is going to suck to any specific individual, but the next person is going to love a bunch of that and not what the first person looks. Like my personal circle encompasses most of their science fiction shows and movies, a lot of the anime, and a bunch of the foreign language action stuff. I have friends that only watch k drama, some that only watch the comedies, which I avoid. It's basically the equivalent of a bunch of different tv channels, most of which no one person will watch, but all of which will be viewed and enjoyed given the size of the subscriber base."

Yeah I think you have to look at Disney's spending holistically and not just on Disney+ exclusive content. All of the films they make they make with the intention of them also bolstering their streaming collection (meaning they need to spend less on OC, as they're already making loads).

2021-04-21 16:42:59,stocks,">Just make good movies and I'll watch them

Well yeah. People watch this stuff to turn off from the real world. Zone out a bit and live in their fantasy realiy for a bit etc...

But thats really the problem with the woke content. Its just so cringe. Its just immeidatly pulls people back into the world of things like identity politics.

Well its other people telling that gender matters so much is the problem here. I don't care of the lead is male / female. But its an action movies. I don't expect the lead if they are a women for example to turn round and say ""I can do this because I am women"" I just expect them to get on with the job.

I killed my netflix subscription about a year ago actually. I simply could not sit though the poor quality content. Never had a problem in films that way before until very recently. Its kinda hard to pin it down to exact examples of this. But its subtle things. the dialog, cloths being worn how things are presented but most of all the charaters I can't releated to at all because they do not exist in the real world around me.... and its things like what they say which would be the cringy lines which nobody would ever say in a normal social situation.

Its like ghostbusters was a flop because it was like mostly full of constant dripple of lines. This guy sums it up quite well [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxa2tOWs6w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxa2tOWs6w)

One of the things I notice there is like the guys in the first ghost busters movie. They are starting their ghost busting company. They are broke. They have shit cloths, they have no money, their car is junk, their office is the worst in town. The other ghostbusteres is based on the same stuff. But completly unlimited funding, flash cloths, great lab, too much makeup, always put together and its subtle things like that which make/brake the movie.

One of the thing I actually detest which is resonably new particullarly in soap. Fast track from headshot to headshot to headshot of people while they are having a conversation. what it does is hide all the body language and natural interaction between people. Doesn't make for good content from my point of view. Like this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeQQufrbSwc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeQQufrbSwc) but closer :)

Its like it prevents you from looking at the places on the peoples faces to see their reaction and you can't do that when the camera is pointed at the wrong face. So I would immedaitly disconnect from their dialog."

Making money is definitely more akin to gambling (any serious trader knows its a form of gambling, idc how much analysis they put into it). While wealth accumulation is not a ""hobby"" per say, but more of a life long commitment to monthly contributions and DCA'ing for 30 years, regardless of crashes or recessions, or bulls and bears.

Imo, the market is for the latter and if people want to get rich quick, just go try your hand at blackjack.

I can usually tell where a person's ""mind on the matter"" is depending on their response. They want to make money...well they want the short term excitement, that even professionals don't get right. They want to grow wealth...then they are serious about the very very boring 30 year trek of DCA'ing and ignoring all the emotional outcries along the way."

2021-04-21 07:53:11,stocks,"Altria Group (MO) is the parent company of Phillip Morris USA, so yes, it's basically Phillip Morris, too.  It's just no longer part of the same company - they operate separately (some call them ""sister companies"").  Altria Group is also the parent of other companies apart from Phillip Morris USA, like U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company which sells the popular brands Copenhagen and Skoal, as well as John Middleton, the producer of Black and Mild cigars.  They also own a wine company, and have partial equity in JUUL (vaping), Anheuser-Busch (beer), and Cronos (cannabis).   They also have a majority stake in a nicotine pouch company.  It's all [here](https://www.altria.com/about-altria/who-we-are?src=topnav) if you're curious to see it.

That's why they're called Altria *Group*, it's a group of companies, which just so happen to include Phillip Morris USA, the producer of Marlboro cigarettes (in the USA).

The reason the ticker is MO is because Altria group originated from a corporation called Philip Morris Industries, which included both the domestic and international Phillip Morris business.  They decided to rebrand from Phillip Morris, in part, to get away from the stigma of Big Tobacco and also to show that they do more than just produce cigarettes.  A smart move, seeing as how smoking is declining in the US.

I haven't looked at the numbers myself recently, but I would assume that the biggest source of revenue for Altria Group at present is still cigarette sales via Phillip Morris USA.

Phillip Morris International spun off in 2008.  They did this to prevent regulatory pressure in the USA from spilling over into emerging markets, where regulatory pressure is quite lax.  They focus entirely on tobacco, which includes cigarettes, but also their heat-not-burn product IQOS, which they claim will be the future (and are doing quite well with)."

Regarding biotechs:
There are hundreds of biotech companies with approval/breakthrough “just around the corner” at any given year. Most of them will fail and crash accordingly.

IF their success is 100% guaranteed and public knowledge, it already is in the stock price. Meaning that if their approval is guaranteed, the announcement wont move the stock.

Also about shitting on your comment:
You have just got into stocks a month ago and here you are telling people to “get in now while its cheap” into one of the most risky stock types: the small cap biotech awaiting approval. Please refrain from encouraging anyone to “get in” anything, it is seen as very shady to pump these type of stocks. 

That said. If you have done your research and analysed their financials and attainable market shares and all that, good for you that you found a company you have confidence in. I hope it goes well for you, just remember that if it goes south and you lose 90%: you didn’t get unlucky or screwed over. Its just the risk nature of biotechs."

2021-04-21 12:34:38,stocks,"You're most welcome!  I felt strongly about these picks and did a lot of research on them, I enjoy sharing what I've learned. My second biggest position is actually in MO precisely because they seem like they have a great future in cannabis, and they've also shown an ability and willingness to adapt to a changing market and changing regulations.  The fact that they're a well-established company with steady cash flows makes them a better pick than a start-up cannabis company, IMO. 

PM is not far behind for me, smoking in the developing world shows no signs of declining and their IQOS product is doing really well.  I invested slightly less because they're already very expensive... Altria looked like more bang for your buck.

I have small positions in the two of the other biggest tobacco companies, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco, but neither seem as innovative or reliable as PM or MO.

If you're interested in the cannabis play you could check out British American Tobacco (US ticker: BTI).  They recently put a big stake in Organigram, and they've also got global distribution including US.  It's the best worldwide tobacco play (MO and PM only catch US or international but not both), which in and of itself is awesome, and cannabis could really be a winner for them.  BTI is actually my biggest position.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 20, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 20, 2021**

Stocks fell Tuesday, with all three major indexes dipping for the second straight session. Cyclical, travel and leisure stocks pulled back sharply while mega-cap tech stocks slid even as the 10-year Treasury yield edged lower.  

Despite recent dips, the indexes remain near all-time highs, with the S&P 500 (SPY) up roughly 10% year-to-date, so it’s not necessarily surprising the market beginning to pull back.  Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial wrote in a note today, ""Many of our favorite sentiment gauges are becoming extremely bullish, which could be a near-term contrarian warning. The American Association of Individual Investors Sentiment Survey recently showed bulls outnumber bears by the most since January 2018.""

In recent weeks, better-than-expected economic data in consumer spending and unemployment and strong performances by mega-cap stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have driven the market higher. On the other hand, growth stocks and more speculative plays have pulled back sharply, extending a terrible run of performance in 2021. After hitting all-time highs near the middle of February, many growth stocks are down 30-50% from those levels. While it’s hard to pinpoint the exact factors why, we think (1) elevated Treasury yields compared to 12 months ago, (2) inflationary fears, (3) profit-taking after an incredible run in 2020, and (4) investor rotation to safer assets are all impacting growth stocks to the downside. 

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to monitor earnings season to gauge if corporate profits are growing in tandem with the recovering economy. Roughly 9% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 81% beating expectation. At the time of writing, Netflix (NFLX) just reported a sharp miss in new paying subscribers added (+3.98 million vs. +6.29 million expected), causing the stock to plummet 10% in after-hours. This is likely to have negative implications for market performance tomorrow.

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said he believes the U.S. will likely resume use of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine as soon as Friday with a warning or restriction attached. The doctor said, “My estimate is that we will continue to use it in some form. I doubt very seriously if they just cancel it. I don’t think that’s going to happen. I do think that there will likely be some sort of warning or restriction or risk assessment. I don’t think it’s just going to go back and say, ‘Okay, everything’s fine. Go right back.’ I think it’ll likely say, ‘Okay, we’re going to use it, but be careful under these certain circumstances.”

**Highlights**

* Chat startup Discord Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including Microsoft (MSFT), according to people familiar with the matter, as it resumes interest in a potential initial public offering down the line.
* Senior executives with Alphabet's Google and Apple will testify on Wednesday about antitrust concerns related to their app stores along with executives of three companies which rely on those online stores, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel said on Monday.
* The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning Saturday advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March during a treadmill accident. This could affect the company's product-safety profile, a material category for the household and personal-goods sector, according to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. The stock pulled back sharply
* The U.K. government said it would probe Nvidia Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp., over possible national security issues, adding new regulatory scrutiny to the proposed deal.

Manufacturing is at the highest levels since 2018.

Consumer savings rates are extremely high, indicating people have the cash on hand to support that pent up demand. 

All of this is happening at much of the country / world is not ""back to normal"". Things are slowly starting to open up and we're already seeing very bullish economic indicators.

2021-04-20 20:03:57,stocks,"I know, it's depressing, I keep buying though. Average price $16, it's .5% of my portfolio. If they keep their user growth going, I think that they'll capture millennials and gen z as tele-primary care. Only thing is that a lot of that population is pretty young and without many medical problems and only sees a doc once a year if that. Tele-PCP access beats having to wait for months to see your doctor or going to urgent care to see someone that doesn't examine you anyway, though. I'm super long on this one as a telehealth play until user growth and retention tell me otherwise."

Too often I see a highly volatile stock absolutely crashing 20-30% and I always see this idea brought up. It's a reoccurring occurrence where once I start seeing these comments, it's almost a surefire sign the stock is heading for the Earth's core. What do you guys think?"

Either they have some crazy price target or are in utter despair. Most people posting can't even bother to read the relevant facts that are put out.  They just spout bullish nonsense until they're ready to completely capitulate.  

I truly didn't understand the manic attitude of some retail traders until I started reading these boards."
2021-04-21 00:55:49,stocks,This wasn’t a thing until online meme stocks
2021-04-21 13:18:50,stocks,"People really don't realize how low can a stock go. Or that it might not do anything return worthy for the next decade.

Stock can go as low as 1$, when it goes under its threatened to be delisted, after that company can reverse stock split to inflate the price to be consistently above delisting. One might think they will run out of shares to reverse split, but they can issue more for a price and then they will use the funds from investors to waste it further.

There are some bag holders to pennystocks that will need at 1000% jump to break even.

On top of that if anyone bought meme/hype stocks at their peak, they are just simply screwed, there is nothing else to it, if they need the stock to go up 40% - 200% to break even, that is a horrible position to be in, the meme/hype stock out of nowhere is not going to reach consistently succesful growth to organically increase that many %

best chance these people have if in next 5 years the stock will pump and dump once more, which to be fair does happen to plenty.

But if these people couldn't predict the major crash/drop of the stock, listenting to what they have to say further is as you might noticed, pointless. Its all just bag holder talk."
2021-04-21 13:34:42,stocks,"Great answer. What you said about being screwed after buying at the peak of meme stock reminds me of the GME bagholders in January. When it was teasing $40 after the epic crash, people were saying ""Gamestop is a great long term hold, they're going to revamp management and keep growing.""

No bro, you have a $400 average, it's not going to grow 1000% by organic business growth."
2021-04-21 13:59:12,stocks,"Right, that is the whole point, even if GME turns around the business, starts blooming and lives happily ever after, last time i remember the people predicted it can go up to around under 200$, still way below the buy in price after the peak still insanely enormously huge profit from the few dollars it was.

Organic growth is also the kind of growth you don't discuss on reddit every single day.

Only thing that can save them is another pump and dump, another squeeze that squeezes the absolute shit out of everyone."

2021-04-21 13:10:34,stocks,"Yes well ideally you buy an actively managed ETF because you have conviction in their overall strategy. In this case, ARK buys a ticker with a 5 year time horizon with the goal of the price doubling in that time frame. They will trade around the ticker to add value, for example they added 350 basis points to their Tesla gains in 2019 just by buying/selling a small % at opportune times. And they’ll exit a position entirely if their model on the company changes. I sympathize with people who bought at the top in Feb but if they’re selling low after 2 months then I don’t think they did their research."

2021-04-20 21:38:15,stocks,I think the future of netlfix depends on how effectively they capture international market. They have already maxed out the US market but they are putting a lot of content from Asia which I think will drive their future growth. They have a lot of room to grow in those markets.

2021-04-21 00:48:00,stocks,This is a huge red flag for people who want growth. Tech names get a pass on revenue and earnings when they are growing at a fast pace. The most concerning part is that they only project 1 million new subs this next quarter. Makes one think that their time as a growth company is over and the stock price will not yield the same returns causing the tank. I think Netflix will have slow growth for the next 1-2 years while people are eager to go out then realize streaming at home is much more convenient. The problem now is that there are so many streaming services with more coming. Will be interesting to see what Netflix will do to try to bring more/retain their subscribers
2021-04-20 20:31:42,stocks,Lol @ people talking about competition. They literally won the most awards this year. They broke sub records less than 12 months ago. Think long-term.
2021-04-20 21:34:08,stocks,"The problem with Netflix is they are raising the price of the subscription too high and trying to police their customers from letting people use their account which is a huge overstep by the company. They are also focusing too much on creating SJW and overly political content rather than actually developing a better user interface and search function and trying to improve the accessibility of their catalogue. Amazon Prime and Hulu and other services like Crunchy Roll for anime fans for example are just destroying the appeal of having to pay for Netflix. Their user interface and the complete garbage navigation of the available content is atrocious. Almost as bad as YouTube's smart tv app's search function.

Netflix will be fine though, probably end the year up 50%"
2021-04-20 20:09:44,stocks,"I am not surprised. Ever since disney plus added star section, I say it's better value than Netflix.
I would cancel Netflix if it's not my business expense. Too expensive! I am tired of seeing new garbage content. Where is new season of Narcos? Where is Ozark? Sick and tired of Korean and Spanish production. Prime video put out new season of the expanse, they are making the boys spinoff.
Netflix turned terrible."

I had D+ for a week before deleting it. I am not into Marvel or the new Star Wars films, that already knocks out most of their program. History Chanel was OK"

2021-04-20 23:08:59,stocks,"I honestly don't understand why everybody doesn't do this.

I subscribe to only one streaming service per month and it is whichever one has the new content that I most want to watch that month. I watch all of the content that I want to see on that service during the month and then the next month I cancel and switch to a different streaming service. It saves so much money and I get to watch the best of what every streaming service has to offer instead of settling for whatever Netflix makes available to me this month.

Yet whenever I talk to people about this, they look at me like I'm speaking gibberish. It is as if people think that they are permanently locked in once they subscribe and can't just subscribe when a service has something new that you actually want to watch and then cancel and move to a different service when they don't."

Side note. It's funny cord cutters went from $60/mo to $15/mo and now multiple steaming services put them back to $60/mo to get access to all the shows you like. 

I churn streaming services personally. Every couple months."

2021-04-20 21:41:23,stocks,Shorting after moving down 10% is playing with fire. This sounds more like an overreaction. Look at the low effort comments in here with people whining about how they don’t like the content anymore. No one has given a good reason to short.
2021-04-21 07:17:10,stocks,"No, read past the top comments, this is overblown for multiple reasons. Unless you're talking about a day or two, Netflix will be fine unless all the whole tech sector craps out."

Add in having to rehire and retrain while hoping you don't have to overpay with a tight labor market and you have a less than ideal ramp up. Netflix demand being pulled forward is likely to have similar effects with D+. It's still a quality stock but I am bearish in the short to mid term and would rather own the market than DIS.

I'm assuming you are being sarcastic, but the irony is that if you are living in urban areas or complexes just outside the city limits (which is who EVs are targeted to) with an EV....charging/""refueling""at home isn't an option. What are you going to do, run an extension cord out to the sidewalk to charge your Tesla that is parked on the street or have a 100+ ft extension cords coming out windows down to your parking space in the parking lot? It's cute that you think everyone lives in a nice house with a driveway and a convenient power outlet on the house only a few feet off the driveway or a nice garage for your superior EV.

On $80k per year salary, if you can bank $2k per month at 6.5% starting at age 25....that’s $2.2 million by age 55.  And this assumes you don’t increase contributions as your salary improves.  Combine that with a modest mortgage for another $500k home (bought 30 years ago for way cheaper).  Sitting at close to 3 million equity at age 55 seems pretty nice from here.

If you were a noob then, you're probably still a noob lol. So my advice, hold your favorites and don't let go. But on days that are obviously red, hedge for losses by buying puts on the same stock you're holding! If you own a solar company, but it looks like all solar is red on a certain day, short it with a put! Instead of losing 10% for example, maybe you only lose 2-3% that week... Just food for thought."

1. Well, because one of the sharpest analysts invested in it
2. Because others were buying significant stakes in $GEO call options
3. Because the stock is undervalued trading at just over $7 with revenue over $19 per share
4. Because the about 30% of the float (tradeable stock) is short, and it will take about 5 days of continued buying at the average daily volume to cover the short interest
5. Because the option market makers got spooked by the option purchases and they bought the stock - this is a recipe for a gamma squeeze

Good luck to all, happy trading.

2021-04-21 15:58:15,stocks,"Im not an expert. However, from my understanding, the problem with tangible book value for an REIT is that it is based on the purchase price of the properties minus depreciation, which doesn't reflect the real asset value based on market price. (extreme simplified example, property bought for $10, $1 per year goes into maintaining the property, after 10 years the property is worth $0 according to tangible asset value) A better metic to value this company's assets, in my opinion, is the book value or NAV. The book value per share is currently around $7.5. Some analysts use different models to value the company, for example a seeking alpha contributor (not allowed to link SA articles) calculated the value of the company using the DCF model and came up with $15.61 per share. This isnt a risk free investment, but in my opinion the risk seems to be very limited and the upside seems to be in the 30-150% range in 1-3 years in my opinion.

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"If 95% of traders don't beat the market, why are so many stock subs so popular? Years ago I learned about how terrible financial advisors were for the common man. How the same stat got thrown in my face over and over, ""95% of traders don't beat the market."" From what I understand, there is merit to this fact.

Because of this I've stacked up VTI/VTSAX, VGTSX, and VOO. Since inception, I've averaged 13% YOY. The gains are impressive since I started in about 2011-2012, with heavier contributions each year as my job came with higher salary over the years.  Easy to look good in the beginning of a decade long bull run.

""Time in the market"" > ""Timing the market"" - This is another one that seems to stand the test of time.  Constantly seeing advice on liquidating so they have ""cash on the side to buy the dip.""  Is that not just timing the market?  Why sell unless to spend or spend during retirement?

My question is why are subs like [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) and such so popular, constantly everyday people posting about their super niche tailored portfolios with DD on random companies. And it seems there is a herd like mentality in these subs as well.

Tech stocks go up - all the DD and posts are about tech stocks - everyone is bullish in tech....until its not

Tech stocks go down - tons of QQ and posts about ""how is the market going up and I'm down 15%?"" - with comments talking about OP lacking diversification.

**Again if 95% of traders don't beat the market, why are so many people trying?**

Some things that I may not fully grasp:

* Are regular people building their custom portfolios, picking individual stocks not considered traders?
* The market has inefficiencies - does this invalidate the ""95% stat?""
* Does the ""95% stat"" only apply to professionals? And by some weird way allow retail average Joes better opportunity?
* Why does the consensus on all the finance subs seem to be centered around building your own portfolio?
* Are 19/20 people in these subs really failing to beat the market?
* Why not just VTSAX and chill?"

And damn it dropped I should have locked in profit. To me, when I buy I plan on holding till retirement 20-25 years unless something drastically changed with that company. I have a 5 year minimum hold time. I’m also 85% total market index leaving only a small portion, 15% for speculative plays. Reason I do this? I probably won’t beat the market with these picks, but I enjoy it. It’s a hobby. I don’t get stressed when they go down. They are highly speculative growth plays. I fully expect 10% swings daily on no news. That’s my reason for having a small speculative portion. As for the rest of Reddit, I am just as confused as your are. I’m guessing most of them just started investing in spring 2020 and have a lot to learn. What they need to do is read some books on investing strategy because it’s nothing but the blind leading the blind here.

Another thing is we are on a decade long massive bull run. Everyone thinks they can beat the market right now. Wait for a bear market or for it to trade sideways for a few years. Then let’s see how everyone does."
2021-04-20 21:02:54,stocks,"What data are you referring to?

I'm skeptical when claims like this are thrown around. First, it's easy to do everything right and lag the market. As an indexer, if you own any bonds, you will fall behind the S&P benchmark. Are retirees stupid for buying bonds? If you leave any cash on the sideline, even for a short time you could easily underperform. Should dollar cost averaging be considered a failed strategy? Any fees in your mutual fund or ETF will put you behind the market. Are you meant to DIY your own index to avoid fees? 

When it comes to fund managers, the goal of a fund is not always maximum growth. Some funds have themes like say, biotech to give people exposure to sectors. If biotech does poorly across the board does it make much sense to criticize the fund manager? Also just because a fund exists doesn't tell you how much money people have invested in it. 

A lot of big funds (people like Dalio talk about this) prioritize minimizing drawdown over growth. When you're managing billions of dollars, the first priority is not to lose money. Counting funds like this as underperforming completely misses the point. 

Also keep in mind the Jack Bogle's of the world are  not neutral observes. He had a financial interest in selling indexing as the best strategy.

I like indexing. But I am skeptical the situation is as bad as people make it out to be."

Whereas most of my companies may fall if that stops and rates normalize for a while, most of my holdings do better in an organically higher-rate environment after adjustment. These are pure buy and hold investments. Dividends are very important and sadly neglected. I'm even looking to buy PEY tomorrow, as I don't mind ETFs that much. It's just not my preference.

The day traders, though? Yeah, it's whack to me. If you can't read a PhD thesis on security analysis the idea you can make a lot of money day trading is weird, at least to me. 2020 was good for that but that success is very abnormal. People will be burned."

No, a trader is someone who constantly opens and closes positions in stocks or other instruments (futures, forex, etc.). Most traders do poorly because commissions, spreads, and taxes eat some of your equity with every transaction, and good trading practices are highly unintuitive; most people sell when they should buy and buy when they should sell.

2021-04-21 01:03:00,stocks,"The first thing I think we need to acknowledge is that most investors do not actively manage their investments. Think about the number of people who are just making monthly contributions to a 401(k) or IRA, but otherwise not worrying about it. Most of these people are in broad market funds (that might perform with the market, but by definition won’t beat it), or most likely they’re in a blend of stocks and bonds, which protects them from market downturns and volatility but at the cost of some performance. Most retirement accounts offer target date funds that automatically adjust their allocations to be less and less aggressive the closer they get to their target retirement date, and these are the kinds of investments that the *vast* majority of people are in. 

After that, there are still lots of active investors who are at least someone in stocks or other safer but lower return investments. We don’t tend to see them on WSB or /r/stocks, but demographics like boomers and gen Xers approaching retirement or putting money into their children’s college funds are also likely to be in lower risk investments. You also have lots of investors who are happy to just buy the market and hold, but aren’t technically outperforming it. 

Then, of the people left who are aggressively and actively investing, theres still a big chunk (although maybe not 95%) who do lose money in the long run, and you also have a smaller number of people who invest, get burned once, and never return. 

When you step back and look at everything put together, it’s not particularly surprising to me that something like 95% of investors don’t out perform the market. The reason isn’t that 95% of people try and fail, but rather that most retail investors aren’t trying to beat the market in the first place. They’re at least partially in bonds, they’re using target date funds, or they’re doing a Bogelhead 3-fund blend type thing."

You get paid, break off whatever % of disposable income into your portfolio, and buy the market. 

That time saved could be spent enjoying life, or working more/getting a better job which affords more disposable income to place even more into above mentioned index funds. Not to mention avoiding any stress and regrets of being down on your portfolio, if you're prone to that. All the while, beating your example of 9% return with a self selected portfolio by at least 0.75% (again, using your example of 10% market return and the highest MER I stated)."

2021-04-20 20:23:13,stocks,"From what I understand that number counts what you do with **all** of your money, not just what money you invest. i.e. if you have $100,000 sitting in a checking account earning 0.1% interest that's counted as weighting down your performance. I don't think most of us would consider money in a checking account part of our market performance, but many of these numbers do.

Also it's not as surprising as you think that the average investor would under-perform if you think about it given a few things.

* The average investor rushes into a stock/ETF going up in price, and panic sells when the asset's price goes down. Fidelity found that the average investor in Peter Lynch's highly successful Magellan funds lost money because of this, even though the fund often had a 30% ROI each year.

* Dollar cost average (which most people do, in part because of when they earn money from their job to invest) means you'll under-perform compared to the S&P500 in a bull market even if you dollar cost average into an S&P500 index fund. This is because you're comparing a dollar cost average performance in a bull market against a lump sum investing performance.

* Index funds under-perform against the S&P500 because of fees/etc, even passive funds. Funds are also often forced to buy high and sell low because of the first point, investors flooding money into the market when prices are high, and pulling out when it starts to go down."

2021-04-21 02:03:29,stocks,"When you buy a stock it has roughly a 14% chance of beating an index fund, so if you do not diversify you might get lucky, but you have to get lucky year after year after year to beat the market.  So yah, just buying an index fund after factoring in a few years will always have better returns which is why little to no one beats the market.  The few who do tend to rely on insider tips like connections to news before it gets published."
2021-04-21 02:14:59,stocks,Sounds legit. I’ve just been spending a lot of time researching opportunities though so it’s not totally random and I have no way to gauge if the strategies I’m using will keep paying off or not so I guess time will tell.
2021-04-20 22:32:15,stocks,"Yes, that is true. But I’d argue it’s also because of the “temporarily not yet millionaires” phenomenon people believe. Maybe a better example would have been why people still buy lotto tickets when the odds of winning are so astronomically small."
2021-04-21 17:41:02,stocks,Thanks for the direction! I’ll check it out.
2021-04-20 21:43:02,stocks,"Honestly, probably yeah. But this is way more fun ;)

100K is when the compound interest really starts to pick up is all. I will continue to contribute to my ETFs but set aside a small amount for speculative stocks because I enjoy reading all the DD regardless. What are your thoughts on the new ARKX etf? It's holdings seem pretty ""unspacey"" for the most part but ARK have had some good runs."
2021-04-20 22:31:09,stocks,"Indeed.  It reminds me of how a team of investment professionals and future investment professionals lost to a cat in a stock picking contest.

For me, stock picking is done for two reasons: To make my investing more interesting, and 2) to hopefully build a source of future income.  Currently, my ""play account"" isn't beating the market (at least not the S&P 500), but it is starting to beat my Boglehead-style retirement portfolio!"

2021-04-20 22:59:46,stocks,"Oh yeah I understand that. I have to fight against myself to not never sell and not fomo. For index I had an ""investment strategy"" to just buy the 15th of each months no matter what the price was at, because I don't trust myself trying to time the market haha"
2021-04-20 20:41:41,stocks,"Only if the index you’re buying is a total or broad market index (eg VT), depending somewhat on what you mean by “the market”. 

There are tons of index funds that aren’t “buying the market”, such as indices that track particular sectors, individual countries or regions, emerging markets, companies with a particular market cap, particular technologies, themes, or almost any other number of heuristics and benchmarks you can dream up. 

For example, the NASDAQ 100 is an index that has drastically outperformed market over the last few years. If you had bought and held QQQ over the last 5 years you’d be up over 200%, compared the market which has risen ≈70% over the same period of time. This would have been a very easy way to “beat the market” without making any actual stock picks. Of course it’s unlikely that it will continue to outperform the market for decades and decades, but over the short term it’s performed very well."
2021-04-21 01:01:09,stocks,I would definitely fall in the 95% if this statisticjust took into account my daytrading haha.

2021-04-21 08:30:20,stocks,In what way does this relate to my comment? You do not have a statistic about how active retail investors manage their portfolio either.

2021-04-21 00:00:36,stocks,"Sure, I agree with you regarding equities and bonds allocation. But then I’d assume they’d compare whatever allocation they’ve picked to a similar mix of the equities and bond markets.

If you are buying and selling frequently you create more taxable events and likely paying more taxes over the long term.

Lastly, if you buy index etf/funds through Vanguard they have a patent on a trading system which minimizes capital gain taxes."

Also, you can look at it this way: I don't know what common interest rates on mortgages are in the US, but a lot of people take the 1-3% of interest and see it as a guaranteed return. Yes it's less than you'd get even with a basic index fund, but it's guaranteed, which is a huge argument for many people."

2021-04-20 23:51:59,stocks,"So true. The evidence that a huge percentage of traders lose money is shockingly lacking. Lots of studies done back when commissions were sky high, but tons back that showed but for commissions a good chunk outperformed."
2021-04-21 09:22:32,stocks,"I don't think it's that 95% traders lose money.  It's that their return is less than that of the market.  So they're still making money. Just not as much as they could in one of the passive market ETFs.  

That's just my understanding."
2021-04-21 13:23:05,stocks,"I was going to link to backtesting but the link you gave actually works fine:

>#### Potential for Higher Returns

>According to a study commissioned by the CBOE, a strategy of buying the S&P 500 and selling at-the-money covered calls slightly outperformed the S&P 500.1﻿ The study showed an **830%** return to the at-the-money covered calls strategy between June 30, 1986 and Dec. 31, 2011. During that same period, the S&P 500 went up **807%**.

So here is the thing: CCs incur short term capital gains.  Ymmv depending on what state you're in and what your income is but eg for me short term capital gains is 47% and long term is 24%.  With such a large difference, not even factoring in fees from the brokerage, even in a reasonable setting CCs lose.

That doesn't mean CCs can't make more than buy and hold.  If you did CCs in the 1970s you would have made more than buy and hold.  However, I don't have any backtests that go that far back for me to be able to identify with the tax and fee difference.  Furthermore back then trading costed a lot, literally $50 to $100 a trade, so in reality CCs probably didn't beat buy and hold then either.  There may not be a time in US history where CCs won out."
2021-04-21 13:16:02,stocks,That’s just dumb though.  Why have all of your capital stagnating when it could be used for growth.  Landlords will still capture the asset appreciation even when levered.

2021-04-21 18:25:46,stocks,"I‘m really open for counterproof. So far, most evidence I came about suggested that returns in the stockmarket are not spread symmetrical between investors. (Only a small number of people have most of the gains same as only a few companies contribute to most of the markets return.) 

That being said I still believe the market can be beaten by:
1) overweighting systematic factors like small companies.
2) advanced skill in picking stocks.

The second point, having skill, seems to be extremely hard and while I do try to achieve it, it’s unclear if I can reach it as most people just don’t. 95% underperforming also means that 5% do beat the market over long periods and given how a lot of people make stupid mistakes it should be relatively easy to at least reach the top 30%.

Sorry for the rant though."
2021-04-21 10:34:07,stocks,"I don't think it made sense either? Profit is profit, even breaking even is hard to do as a day trader.

Then I come here I use the same words as OP even though I know it isn't correct and am met with downvotes. I'm not sure why I care, but I can say it always makes me feel wrong for something I said. If I seemed mean or stupid I truly apologize, it's not an excuse but just an explanation that I was upset."
2021-04-21 01:09:23,stocks,"Yepp, and this is the deal with everything tbh, 80% of business fails, 100% of human dies, data is good but imo you should always set up some kind of criterias to clean out the noises from your data. If you do like this of traders who trade professionally for more than 2 year, X% of them stay profitable until Y amount of years for Z amount of returns, now if you see this data, I’m willing to bet itll cause a exodus from etf due to people thinking it’s easy money, it’s really not and really stressful, but I just can’t fathom the everyone who trades lose money stat, also see sources say portfolio managers stats, not professional traders, many traders don’t even have an overnight investment in the market. One last point, if you are a scalp trader that stays cash always, but u slightly underperform the market, would that really be underperform, when they have 100% cash available while making a bit lower than market returns? any dips, these guys will just step in, take away all your opportunity while guys like OP screams “but you underperform market”"
2021-04-21 14:10:05,stocks,"Yeap you are totally right, i do know a lot of people around me starting to “invest” in stocks so yes i do somewhat understand the 95% traders underperform market, in my experience when normal people says invest, they meant chasing the trend and buy whats hot and hoping to sell it for like 5-10% or something. If you include those people as traders then yes i would 100% agree, still don’t make that statistic relevant though, if anything i think it’s a misleading stat created to lead people into etfs. Not that etfs are bad though, i actually talk the new “investors” people to just do etfs instead, save time and just focus on their own career . However, if someone truly want to be a trader, i tell them it’s a rough road and one should be prepared for a lot of humbling and losses before turning a profit(beating the market), it’s not easy but it’s definitely not “95% of people who trade seriously underperforms the market” hard"
2021-04-21 14:13:38,stocks,"Btw imo, trading fulltime should be treated as a job that is paid based on your performance, if one planning on halfass it, just do etf and enjoy seeing your money grow instead, and do margin sometimes when you see some play that you truly think is good. I personally know a bunch of retail whales in my country (5-10 mil in stocks) do this when it comes to stuff of their expertise, they don’t even try to trade to beat the market, just making some extra money sometimes"
2021-04-21 16:03:49,stocks,As I outlined in my original comment the CCs only make short term capital gains taxes on the money made from the CCs. You only trigger a taxable event if the underlying is called. This is why I recommended conservative CCs aimed at maintaining LTCG tax benefits. With options fees being even cheaper now I think that only makes the argument more appealing. This may also make tax advantaged accounts such as an IRA more appealing to try it.
2021-04-21 13:20:32,stocks,"If your rent those places out, I'd rather agree with you. But the place I'd live in, I'd pay if off ASAP."
2021-04-21 10:52:21,stocks,"It's the problem with social media tbh. Reddit is definitely better than Facebook/Discord where 99% of the people have no idea what they're doing, but even on Reddit at least 80-90% has no clue and is just talking bs. My advice would be to only listen to people who can really explain their opinions and whose argumentation you think makes sense. If I'd listened to people on Reddit I'd have missed at least half of my gains in 2020, equal to over 100% of the money I invested that year."
2021-04-21 16:12:25,stocks,"I know CCs are not 100% short term capital gains, but regardless the difference is enough to have buy and hold win in the end.

>This may also make tax advantaged accounts such as an IRA more appealing to try it.

This much is true.  You might be able to get 10% more in 10 years for all the extra work."

2021-04-21 00:00:00,stocks,"VFV.TO vs SPY or VOO I am a Canadian, and i was mostly investing in VFV.TO over spy just to save the exchange fees. VFV.TO is essentially VOO, but with the currency hedged to the canadian $.


Today, my friend made me realize in the last 8 years, VFV.TO has BADLY outperformed the VOO. Voo gained around 150%, while VFV.TO gained over 300%.


The exact reason is difficult to understand, but here is my theory:


When we have bad red days like today, the VOO will often crash fairly hard.... and VFV.TO will go down a lot less, because the US dollar is generally bullish when the market goes down. For example, today, we can see that VOO is down a lot more than VFV.TO.


Obviously, VOO does recover a lot more than VFV.TO once we get to a green day... however, as we all know, losing 50% and recovering 50% isn't the same as losing 25% and then recovering 25%. the later is way better for you.


My question: Am right in thinking VFV.TO is the better long term option over VOO?


EDIT: NVM my whole theory is terrible. In 2015 the US dollar was worth the same as today, and there was no difference in performance between the 2 funds. Only reason VFV outperformed VOO so badly is 2012 to 2015 the US dollar gained value."

If anything I say doesn’t make sense, sorry I don’t know any terminology. If I am asking about a way to make money on the market, I am more or less asking if it is a viable way to make money, how reliable it is, how many people do it, if you would do it and if you would recommend it, and finally, when I should do it.

1) What is stopping someone from buying stock and selling it after it grows even a small amount, earning very little money, but fairly safely (I think it’s safe) and almost guaranteed
2) If you buy stock as it is going up and wait for it to start to drop even a small amount to sell, can you make money and is it a good thing to do
3) What is the most common/easiest way to make money on the stock market
4) Is purchasing an already massive stock, for example Tesla, a way to make money selling said stock and not from the company being successful
5) what should I know about a stock when buying it
6) signs of a stock change
7) anything else rly"

If market keeps going up everyday, there would be no bonds, no bank CD's and saving accounts with a pathetic .025% yield. This week's selloff is necessary and keeps market healthy.

*Some stocks to consider*:

**Disney** is in it's 1 month low.

**Roblox** below its IPO.

**JD** and **BABA** are below their 6 month low.

**Draftkings** in it's 3 month low.

It's   a short  bear market nothing to worry about.  Then the next  week. Then the next week is green yay. then red. then red.  you realise  your gains have reversed by 4 months. then 6,  then a year. Maybe now is the dip maybe it will go up again. you invest the cash that has been sitting around for     rainy days.  but a year on the market is still going down or at best sideways. Then two, people don't even like   to   talk about the stock market anymore. people just try to surrive on any job they can.   until  finally you notice the market went up  2% over a few months and that you are now in a new bull.  But what kind of Bull? other nations have steamed ahead and their stocks which seemed risky now look like   you should have been there all along. Gold   did well   should have switched sooner.  wow  silver. But no   too late  now.

Should you even invest in the US after all  that pain,  can the USmarkets ever hope   to  get back to where they were with all these intrests rates and regulations. Maybe i should  learn to fit solar     panels.

Don't be short sighted. A stock that went up from 20 to 200 in a year is not necessarily at a discount when priced at 100. It can easily slide back to 20."
2021-04-20 20:14:42,stocks,"Agreed. The fact that stocks are more volatile than BTC is a sign of a very unhealthy, nervous market. Wouldn't be surprised if we see more pullbacks. It's a very difficult time for new investors to know when to enter into a position."

Stability would also means GME related sub reddits wouldn't need to spam posts 10 times a day.

It swinged 20% past 5 days, it swinged 50% past month. It came up 7000% past year and dropped 90% from its peak past year.

Its anything but stable. Big corp tech stocks for example been mostly stagnating and wobbling past half year, didn't surprisingly made anyone millionaire or made one lose all his life, and even that is not considered stable by any means."

Historically speaking, inflation isn’t a 6-12 month event but something that takes a long time to play out. Buffet was also talking about the deflationary aspect that comes after inflation. He’s smart, but a different type of investor than you or I. If you want to know what it’s like being him, take $1m and buy a company with a 500m market cap without increasing or decreasing the price until you own 2x the company and can get the owner/ceo not to dilute. That’s buffet investing."
2021-04-20 20:00:57,stocks,Exactly my thought process.... thanks for the confirmation.
2021-04-20 20:16:16,stocks,Of course! I mean this is coming from a middle class person floating low six figures. I would say that strategy changes depending on who you talk to if they make more.

2021-04-20 20:45:05,stocks,I stay 75% with VTI because I expect the most growth from it but just want to diversify with enough of VXUS to mitigate any loss and to include international options. People around the Reddit boards do a number of different percentages though
2021-04-21 08:20:11,stocks,I’m probably going to wait to see how the new earnings affects the stock. I sold covered calls on it that expire on 5/16 so i cant sell until then but we’ll see. Ill prob try to get some money back with those :/
2021-04-20 20:56:44,stocks,It’s been getting absolutely crushed lately. I’m down 50% and contemplate just cutting my losses. Deep down I also hope it starts to claw back but I think I may have just had terrible timing. I’ll give until the end of June to see how it performs. Hopefully it’s not a penny stock by then lol.
2021-04-20 20:46:30,stocks,Sell cover calls to make a small premium as you wait for price recovery.
2021-04-20 21:30:14,stocks,"Has anything fundamentally changed with the company? If not, then why are you thinking about selling? The whole renewable space since mid Feb has pretty much collapsed. Just look at SunRun, Sedg, FSLR et al.

Basically this sector isn't ""hot"" anymore and was sold off by the MM's who moved into value plays such as financials and industrials. The really sold off the SPAC's but that's a different story.

You got to realise there is a constant shift of money between sectors. It is normal...

If it is a good, quality company... it will eventually come back. That's why dividend companies like NEE in the renewable space are so good... sure you may be in the shit as far as the stock goes but you're still getting paid to wait. It is not TOTALLY dead money."

2021-04-21 10:36:14,stocks,"You believed in it enough to buy it when the market was doing good. What's changed?  

Besides the rotation that hurt many stocks, the green energy industry has its best days ahead of it. The next year or two will almost certainly be better for the industry than the past two years. imo. 

I've got 400 @ 23.65, so I'm currently above water on that one, but man it hurt watching over 100% gains evaporate into 12% gains over the past few months. Seems like every day I've asked myself if I should hodl or sell. 

It's actually still my best performing green energy stock of the six I hold."
2021-04-21 01:14:30,stocks,"let's try to simplify...oversimplify this: These are the components of FF3-factor  
start with CAPM:  answer to...""how much should I expect to get paid for this stock?""

    Expected R = RiskFree + (beta)(MarketReturn - RiskFree)

Then we add on the extra 2 factors

    (x)(SizePremium) + (y)(ValuePremium)

so we can write it as: 

    R = Rf + (a)(MRP) + (b)(SP) + (c)(VP): 

this is the basis for lot of quant shops. To implement this style of portfolio all you need is some data to get those variables.

1. rf - guess work just pick a number between 0.25% to 3% or something
2. beta - could be a historical beta based on past performance vs market, or you can buy a dataset where vendor calculate it for you. Or do a macro based beta etc....
3. Market Return....subjective

Size & Value: now we get to expensive shit.

1. size premium - start with how much higher a small cap stock in general out performs large cap....apply that through a time series, see if it holds....then apply the stock you're looking at to see where it falls on the spectrum to produce the expected premium
2. value premium - PE, PS, PCF, EV/EBITA, etc. all the valuation ratios comes into play. single number is not enough....it's also about how the stock is relative to its peers...what peers? same country? same industry?

So buy a few datasets from MSCI, Bloomberg, S&P, Russell.  Then download python or R to code up some calculation program. 

&#x200B;

There! Easy as ABC! 

implement and watch your bank account explode!"
2021-04-21 08:38:07,stocks,"In the end, it's basically doing the work of an actual analyst, but putting all that data or guesses into an equation. I guess if I were able to code, it might make things a bit easier."
2021-04-21 11:14:27,stocks,Yea and it’s costly too. Sourcing data needed is like a few hundred grand a year.
2021-04-21 11:20:53,stocks,"Though my sarcasm aside....you CAN utilize some of the principles of the factors. 
Though your major allocation should still be 
1. asset classes EQUITY/BOND/CASH
2. Region US EURO APAC

Then you can look to tilt your portfolio with

3. Large cap vs small cap
4. Value vs growth

It’s a way to enhance your portfolio returns. ETFs and funds are the easiest to implement because they do have these kind of styles to choose from."

2021-04-21 07:29:40,stocks,They just rebalances yesterday to a far better diversification plug is now a way smaller holding and they have a lot of good stocks now.
2021-04-20 23:55:25,stocks,"That's right. I'm still 25% up on my position and I'm looking to average up. I think people need to realise that when a stock price spikes exponentially, it's either too late to get in unless you're willing to hold it for a few years, or they should expect a massive correction.

Once the infrastructure plan is approved, and more investments pour into the clean energy sector, what does everyone think will happen next? Think it'll just end there?

Jobs get created, more investment gets poured in, and the sector grows. Sector plays are about patience."

Especially considering I got my long portfolio started near the end of January which was basically one of the crappiest times to get your big start.

Learned quick and fast that speculation was dying and it was time to diversify so I didn't sit around. I got straight away to damage control and rebalancing which has probably kept my losses from being so much worse."
2021-04-20 22:55:47,stocks,"You're not the only one who is buying hot stocks. That said, most people with diversified investments are still up for the year.

When you take a big risk, it has a high upside potential \_and\_ a high downside potential -- what did you expect?

I'd recommend diversifying before doubling down on the same falling stocks. For example, I started moving into value stocks with all my new purchases this year and I'm still up for the year. And I wasn't even trying too hard to pick the right ones, I just bought some miners and VTV."

Now we're actually trying to carry out the recovery and every unforseen thing is deflating that hype. That's why speculative picks are so bad right now. There's less to hype over now that we're actually trying to rebuild our economies instead of imagining how they'll be rebuilt.

2021-04-20 22:38:11,stocks,Same. Thankfully I realized my initial portfolio was steaming trash and immediately got to an ongoing effort of aggressively rebalancing it to trend better with market while being more diversified and be made of crud I actually understand instead of buying cause Reddit said so. Still down about $200 from my initial investment (well ~300 after today's crapshow) but it'd probably be a whole lot worse if I didn't get down to some hardcore rebalancing.
2021-04-20 22:28:23,stocks,"I can vouch for this. When I realized months ago that my fledgling portfolio of weird stock picks and awkward partial shares was basically a garbage ETF, I trimmed a lot of the deadweight positions so I could buy actually well made market ETFs to give me the effortless diversity I wanted while still trending with the market. 

Grabbed VTI to serve as a core anchor that exposes me to all the cap sizes while getting DIA to hedge against the tech positions I was more familiar with. I'll tell ya it did *wonders* for making my portfolio more stable. And I've now added QQQ to increase gains I get from strong NASDAQ days should it endup outperforming the SP500 this year. 

I like having the privilege of being able to pick out individual stocks compared to my managed accounts by advisors that largely use funds/ETFs but even then I've found that like most folks I am not a wizard with picking and timing stocks and ETFs make a great support against our mistakes."

This on-streams 7-8000 tonnes a year, and is a permanent change once the initial investment has been made, because the marginal cost from the process is 46 dollars/kilo and it actually improves the entire process. 


Diplomatic breakthrough with Iran. Irans uranium reserves are not public knowledge, but given the way Ramsar glows in the dark, likely very large, and Iran has quite considerable centrifuge capacity. About the only sensible way to normalize that whole mess is to buy enriched U from them, which could work out to quite a large source.

Quasi-fusion breakthrough: Fusion does not need to be net energy producing to be very important. Fusion reactions produce very, very fast neutrons. This means if any of the attempts at small fusion instead produce an economical neutron source, non-chain-reaction based nuclear power may become possible. Stick a fusor in a pile of depleted uranium, and that is an entirely workable reactor core."
2021-04-20 21:51:30,stocks,"Really? Because about 20 miles from house here in San Diego there is old plant that was shut down about 3 decades ago and never re-opened... There is a problem in Japan practically every other year with thier nuclear plants. 

Utilities who tried to open new nuclear plants in the past always had trouble with permitting. And yea, waste from Nuclear is very hazardous and can easily kill regions, not just people at the plant, if not handled right. That is dangerous especially when you consider the human factor. One greedy exec or Homer Simpson who does something wrong and you do a lot of damage.

You are right there are drawbacks to other types of energy but they are all addressable with price and simply importing electricity from a more appropriate location. If price per kwh comes down 50% then it wont matter if you have 50% less sun hours. In snowy areas its better to simply import the electricity.

Fun fact, I did the calculation a few years ago but it would take less than 3% of the surface area of the USA to completely replace ALL other sources of energy (including fuel for cars) with solar in CA. Other high sun states can do something similar but need slightly more land to do it. Of course the other issue is storing energy but that can actually be done anywhere so its just a matter of time before prices become affordable for everyone. But thats where nuclear has a big advantage. Stores a lot of energy in little space otherwise there is almost no point. Better to buy land in a sunny state and build solar plants which is exactly what most utilities are doing, even in highly conservative states who live off the oil industry."

Went from 4,500,000 shares available to 750,000 on fintel. It was more than 1/3 the trading volume in the first 2 or 3 hours. Fintel only shows 1 institutions shorts afaik so the total shorts must be more than that. 

Basically, the morning volume was at least half shorts pushing it down. 

I watch the short positions on APHA regularly and from the last run up to $32 until today it did seem like it was abnormally low short volume around 3,400,00 on average. Now it's at 1,000,000. (fintel)

This is just 100% false. If you find the next enron or profitable short, you can make a lot of money. I'd argue that in this market it's a lot easier to find a stock that will halve than double. It's just much harder to put negative bets on a company."
2021-04-20 20:08:16,stocks,"r/gme and r/superstonk subreddits have been doing all sorts of research on this-- it has become clear that they are shorting GME heavily through ETFs containing GME, and there is likely a huge number of naked shorts since institutional ownership of GME is much greater than 100% of the float (currently about 140% of the float, per Bloomberg). There is other sources as well, such as FTDs, FUD from MSMs, statements from GME in their SEC filings, and via analyzing the behavior of the short-sellers. Additionally, the DTCC and SEC have been cooking up new laws and regulations that all are directed towards protecting the overall market in the event of over-leveraged HFs, who are likely neck-deep in short-positions in just GME, but several other stocks as well"

Say you have a survey where you interview hedge fund managers and identify how much they make every year (yoy) and what their height is.  You notice their height correlates to their profit.  Correlation obviously.  Correlation because it's taking two different features from the survey and pattern matching them.

Say you have a survey and you ask people what their favorite part about their breakfast cereal is.  You then group the answers.  Correlation?  Not necessarily, there is only one variable here.  Causation?  Definitely, because

>On the other hand, there are questions that we can expect someone to know a relatively true answer, and that answer can’t be disproven by other metrics. These questions fall into categories like personal identity (are you Hispanic), emotion (how happy are you with your purchase), preferences (do you like mangoes) or past, current, or habitual behavior (have you ever purchased from Acme brand? Do you ever wear dresses?). In these cases, it’s not so important to stress that the question was self report.

https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/correlation-and-causation-survey-data/

this falls into the preferences category.  However, they could misunderstand the question, not truly know why they're doing something, they could be lying, and so on, so you need a decent sample size.  One aspect in doing this is you want to make sure there is a correlation along with the causation.  Causation without correlation can be due to an insufficient sample size.

2021-04-20 20:40:51,stocks,"I accept that a healthy company that remains slightly profitable and that is heavily shorted will never have a stock price that goes to zero. However, I think it’s not normal for a company to remain in that state indefinitely. There are many forces that make it difficult for a public company to be very slightly profitable for a long period of time. The longer the period of time, the less likely. An average of companies is very likely to be slightly profitable over a long period of time. An individual company that can’t continue to scale is at high risk that any disruption will put them in the red. Absolutely such companies can exist for purposes of example, and I’m sure quite a few can be identified by looking backward (which would likely involve hindsight or selection bias), but I would not have high expectations for a company that has historically been barely profitable to continue to exist in that form. Making assumptions about NPV based on a small current profit ignores a huge amount of risk by assuming things will remain status quo. In theory, the price will never go to zero in the absence of change, but I would bet a disruptive event that NPV doesn’t capture would be the more likely ultimate outcome.

That is, if you want to continue belaboring this point - which you really shouldn't.

On the data quality spectrum, surveys are barely above anecdote.  Getting the sample sizes you need to convincingly rule out most confounders is incredibly expensive and most survey outfits that aren't backed by government money and the ability to compel responses simply don't do it.  That's just for showing correlation, and completely ignores all the behavioral psychology elements that make surveys prudent for use as illustrations only.

You need three things to show causality:

1. Clear time-ordering (X precedes Y)
2. Statistically solid correlation (Y is associated with X)
3. Elimination of confounders (nothing else could have caused Y)

Surveys might give you 1.  They only rarely give you 2.  They will never, ever, ever give you 3.

Even the best-designed econometric studies (not surveys lol) struggle to give you 1 and 2 and dedicate *significant* time, expertise, and resources to establishing 3.

If they have none the company goes bankrupt, investors don't have time to wait for it to blow over.

If the VIX is going to act like this, it's going to kill options on both sides unless you see days like the last couple days. 

It's a bit more likely now that it could wake up though considering what I've seen, but I think the regime that was seen up to mid-February is gone, you have the splashy names making lower highs while the S&P had as dominant of a stretch as it has had since August (even though it's been on a multi-month melt up with only minor pullbacks during that trend)."

2021-04-21 03:55:06,stocks,"Regarding the leverage, in a nutshell you can [look at the amount of borrowing on margin](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/stmkteqmardebt.pdf), which is like taking out a loan to purchase stocks or derivatives like options. And like loans, sometimes things get hairy on the debtor's end and they get in trouble making good on their word to pay back the debt. In the post, leverage is referring to the liability of taking on margin debt to, for example, buy stocks. 

If you use margin to increase your exposure to risky assets and those assets become devalued in the market (as they tend to do from time to time), your portfolio's net value can decrease below a threshold that can trigger a **margin call**. In this situation, the lender basically tells the debtor to either add more cash/assets to the account, or the lender assumes authority of your positions and can liquidate them **as they see fit**. This is basically what happened to Archegos: They took on a lot of water in their exposures to certain risky assets/companies, and their authorities like Credit Suisse, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley stomped them out and sold all of their positions.

The screenshot seems to be referring to the idea that there are more situations like this, wherein hedge funds are overly exposed to risk on borrowed money from banks. If this is true, and the right (or perhaps ""wrong"") parts of the market lose enough value such that leveraged funds begin to make lenders worry too much, perhaps that record-high amount of margin debt can become a big problem. It's key to understand that if, for instance, a hedge fund managing a few billion dollars gets margin called, **all of their positions are vulnerable to sale, indiscriminately**. So if that fund lost a bunch of money on, say, HAE and some shitty SPACs, but also held $1 billion in MSFT, there may very well be a huge block of MSFT entering the market all at once for sale. And that can cause more problems for other hedge funds and leveraged accounts that could, for instance, be borrowing on margin to hold $100,000 worth of MSFT."

The second half of the month has now been weaker in 4 straight months, it's a 2021 trend now, what's less clear is if it's the same thing we've seen or if it's more.

2021-04-20 22:10:37,stocks,"Institutional ownership numbers are unreliable due to settling delays *and* reporting delays. Lots of stocks do show institutional ownership as greater than 100% of the float. Often, shorts can and do cover via deep ITM calls, which market makers like Citadel are capable of covering using synthetic shares (now these are *not* included in the float.) Synthetic shares honestly make things very hard to follow. I really do think all of the deep underwater short positions covered the first time around, and the shorts are left with much safer perches. Not only that, but most of the options action on GME is a trap- BlackRock and other cartels that are long own enough shares to cover all their calls no matter what, and they'll happily sell deep OTM calls and puts to both bulls and bears when volatility spikes. Then, they'll buy and sell shares as necessary so IV gets crushed and the options expire worthless... and they pocket the insane premiums. I think they plan to do this until people give up on options, and then they'll dump their shares and buy back lower.

I'm bullish on GameStop the company because I really, really think they have a great shot at a turnaround. I don't think there will be a squeeze like before though. If you're happy to wait for a turnaround, that's awesome. As for me, I'll be buying back in at a lower cost per share."

2021-04-21 00:56:25,stocks,"You have to pay interest on a short position. Interest gets higher if the stock is hard to borrow. Right now, it's pretty easy to borrow: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

(Yea, I know Interactive Brokers isn't the only source of borrowed shares, but it's not like they get borrowed at higher or lower rates elsewhere.)

Per the SEC's FTD (failure to deliver) data, there were over 800,000 FTDs for GME for the second reporting period of January. 
https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm

It sunk down to over 100,000 for the first reporting period for February, then even lower for the second reporting period (I think 5000 or so, haven't looked in a little while.) In March it shot back up to the tens of thousands (because GME was covered and then shorted again on the entire way back down the first time), but I don't think it's broken the hundreds of thousands since early February. No one is having trouble covering. The highest up short positions are over $400, and the SI is less than the entire float. Premiums on calls are expensive af right now, whereas it was cheap premiums after a week of trading sideways that kickstarted everything in January... lots of people buying 0DTE calls slightly OTM. Basically there isn't any way we could apply enough pressure for another squeeze. None. Retail does not have the buying power for it this time, and the whales have moved on to better buying opportunities elsewhere.

I get that fraud is a beloved tool of hedge funds, but I don't think they have to lie this time. In fact, I think they're dying laughing at the thought that the truth could prove so divisive."

I bought at the top in January and then averaged way down and made money in March. I got out when the going was good. Yes, it's been volatile, but the institutional longs have the upper hand right now and they like it that way.

High premium can also come from open interest- lots of people buying calls with a particular strike price. Just like everything else in the market, price rises with demand."

It is pretty arrogant for you to think you know a better price than the entire market of stocks.  Over a hundred years of data prove you wrong on that point. 

And your assumption about holding cash during a downturn is completely flawed.  You seem to think someone would just sit and stare at gains for weeks and months and do nothing.  Not bloody likely.  

What is more likely is that an astute investor that does not simply parrot what they see on reddit and the TV know when to have their powder dry, so they can buy at levels that are not historically overpriced.

Everyone has an ideological bias when it comes to macro-economics since as you know there is no universally accepted fundamental theory in that field. Grantham was influenced by his experience with the Japanese bubble in the 1980s, which shaped his wider beliefs about the long term effectiveness and effects of central bank intervention. Of course these things are so murky that it's impossible to really know; after all this is the ""dismal science"" and all that.

It has certainly been surprising that so much ""money printing"" since 2008 didn't lead to higher inflation in the US or internationally -- and there are various ideas regarding why. It's probably fair to say that this hasn't been settled yet to universal satisfaction.

Grantham is skeptical of the long term effects of monetary policies adopted by the Fed and other central banks after the GFC and his views are certainly influenced by that opinion."

DV is leagues ahead of its competitors (IAS is coming apart at the seams) and is going in on CTV measurement and partnerships with TTD and other partners.

That can't be a serious statement, you must believe football only began in 1992. Everything that came before doesn't count? Go learn about the sport before you comment/invest in it."
2021-04-21 03:27:25,stocks,Read the news today? ;-)
2021-04-20 22:53:26,stocks,BCOV - Brightcove is the leader in video streaming.
2021-04-21 10:27:09,stocks,"CAMT - ""Israel-based manufacturer of metrology and inspection equipment and a provider of software solutions"". Consistent earnings even through the pandemic and chip shortage, not included in many semiconductor ETFs like SOXX."
2021-04-20 20:01:49,stocks,I know! Woke up at 830am EST time and saw it. Was like “damn I wish I woke up at 6! I had the funds ready to go and everything. Probably wait to see if it dips.
2021-04-20 21:43:38,stocks,"Oh I’m sorry, I thought Reddit was a public forum or something. Clearly my mistake and I was “buting in”. You’re right, trolling is just simply arguing against something. You clearly understand what you’re talking about oh master of trolling. 

How is it possible to be so stupid? Oh by being an actual troll who is being a fucking moron on purpose. That’s right."
2021-04-21 14:11:59,stocks,"I think you managed to do something remarkable that takes a lot of toughness and grit. At the same time, it is not so easy for a lot of people and it definitely it is not just ""excuses"" as there is a lot more that goes into those things, often factors beyond our control. For every one like you that manages to achieve these things, there are many many more who fail due to circumstances beyond their control (and I agree there are also those that fail due to their own shortcomings). I honestly dont know where Im going with this... that the system isnt fair and just that some of us get lucky is not an excuse to blame everything on mindset I guess and to care for the people who get unlucky ..."
2021-04-20 21:23:08,stocks,I was hoping to return to see what you had to say about today. I thought it was uncanny you posted this two days ago.
2021-04-20 22:37:26,stocks,"Corrections are healthy. I didnt sell a share or worry. Whole market was down. RFP swings harder than the market most times, whether up or down, because its a microcap with small available float. Nothing about RFP’s fundamentals are different so no reasons to panic. In fact they appeared to have paid down 180 million of long term debt today while maintaining liquidity. So actually a good day. Lastly, remember context, RFP still up 20% for the last five days, even after today’s drop."
2021-04-21 15:56:35,stocks,See? :)
2021-04-21 15:59:16,stocks,"I added to this morning actually, after seeing your reply. but I am sorry, I am very skeptical of dfv picks. Even if he is legit a genius, I believe the popular subs for GME and meme stocks are just social media scam and manipulation grounds for the conservabots and russiabots now. Even if this stock is innocent now, might not be for long. Interested to see how it goes."
2021-04-21 16:20:24,stocks,"I totally agree with you. I didnt touch any of the meme stocks and dont think anyone should. Luckily for this stock, it’s relatively easy to project likely earnings from the lumber segment and lumber is so ridiculously high that even the lowest PE ratios will put this stock much higher than it currently is if lumber stays its current course for the next few months. Not because of meme mania, but actual value/earnings."
2021-04-21 04:51:50,stocks,"Agree too; cash should either be immediately reinvested into the business or, even better IMO, immediately paid out to shareholders in the form of dividends (or ""extraordinary payment"") so they can choose for themselves whether to reinvest the funds or not.

Cash is a waste in the long term – it's only good for the potential of above uses, i.e. to be put to better, value-creating purposes, making 1$ into > 1$."
2021-04-21 16:59:13,stocks,I'm in Europe and im looking for Maruti Suzuki
2021-04-21 19:30:46,stocks,"Can’t even call it picks, just “what do the top funds overweight?”   Almost like shooting ducks in a basket."
2021-04-21 19:55:24,stocks,I use e-trade.
2021-04-21 19:23:10,stocks,Nobody cares

2021-04-21 14:58:34,stocks,I do like Air BNB
2021-04-21 06:59:33,stocks,"Everything before introduction of QE should be disregarded.

We are in a trade war and not a cold war, so I guess a market crash like this may not be as relevant anymore"
2021-04-21 14:31:04,stocks,"It's a little of that but mainly big lumber companies jacking up the prices while putting out less lumber into the market, kind of like what the diamond companies do to keep the price of diamonds high. In this case it's to skyrocket stock prices instead of diamonds. Now, what's going to happen to the lumber stock when those companies decide to offload the excess supply of lumber, or when interests rates rise over the summer causing a slowdown of new construction?"
2021-04-21 06:33:56,stocks,20% weight in my portfolio
2021-04-21 14:57:51,stocks,"Are you playing lumber stocks, if so how?"
2021-04-21 15:01:49,stocks,Nope
2021-04-21 15:02:14,stocks,A year out or for this winter?
2021-04-21 14:59:52,stocks,This is what I don't understand. Rural housing is cheap and with millions working from home and most things shut down they have no excuse not to build in a cheaper rural area. Instead they rather would whine about rising home prices.
2021-04-21 17:39:16,stocks,Raw land hasn’t really had the price increase but move in ready homes in my rural area are selling way over the appraised value. The issue is there isn’t high speed internet in all rural areas so people can’t work from home.
2021-04-21 17:50:42,stocks,"Good point. At one point in time I was invested in Frontier internet which was bringing faster internet to the rural areas. I thought it was a sure thing because of events like what you have now and the fact that many would be moving out of cities even despite a pandemic. 

By now they could have had high speed internet installed in all rural areas and suburb housing costs would've been mitigated from an abundance of cheap housing in rural areas, but I guess someone had other plans."
2021-04-21 18:09:04,stocks,For most out here the only choice is crappy satellite internet but high speed cable is becoming more available. The houses out here with high speed WiFi are selling at a premium.
2021-04-20 21:34:36,stocks,Isn't already usefull in certain places?
2021-04-21 16:45:23,stocks,"How about some decent companies, like Google, Disney, etc?"

2021-04-21 13:07:54,stocks,Its beyond 30% pullback now 😂
2021-04-21 13:44:59,stocks,Exactly. Amazing how many peopke still buy in at IPO or direct listing in this case.
2021-04-21 15:55:29,stocks,"Direct listing is even worse, it means insiders want to cash out and let someone be the bagholder."
2021-04-21 09:12:15,stocks,You can buy RocketLab and they are the second most used rocket launcher in the US after SpaceX
2021-04-21 03:00:16,stocks,So you bought VACQ?
2021-04-21 03:03:12,stocks,So if i want rocketlabs i need to buy VACQ? When they go public it wil change to rocket labs. Would the price first drop? Sorry but i'm a noob and I'm trying to learn. So all information is welcome.
2021-04-21 04:08:35,stocks,No one knows what the price of the stock will be in the future compared to right now so I can't answer that. But yes you can buy Rocket Lab's stock by buying VACQ right now. It will automatically change the name from VACQ to RKLB for you after merger completes.
