03/14/2021,stocks,"One thing to consider is your risk tolerance. You‚Äôre right that these are well established companies, but what growth potential do you feel they have? If you just wanna dump your money for low risk/reliable returns maybe do an etf? Look up cathie woods etfs. 

If you are looking for individual stocks w growth potential for 3-5 years id check out palantir, CMPS, cannabis companies, online gambling companies like betz and draft kings, and genius."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'll pretend that you didn't say Cathie Wood's ETFs are low risk. Because if you do, I don't know what would be classified as high risk assets."
03/14/2021,stocks,I want to see them get into HRT. That‚Äôs where I see them exploding. It‚Äôs such a growing market right now with aging boomers and juice heads trying to get ‚Äúlegit‚Äù testosterone.
03/14/2021,stocks,I found something online that says it was dissolved in 1932
03/14/2021,stocks,"On Google Books, that business name shows up in Canadian documents from about 1900 to 1910. 

an independent broker might be able to help. the question is if the company was bought out or merged. if they just went out of business, you're probably out of luck. but if they merged with another company, and that second company is still in business ... they might have to honor the old stock certificates.

03/14/2021,stocks,"On the stick certificate there is a ‚ÄúTransfer Agent‚Äù that‚Äôs who I would go to first, they may have merged into another co. and after a period of time the old shares not delivered are void, BUT if you contact the TA they will know exactly"
03/14/2021,stocks,I‚Äôd take it to my local financial advisor/stock brokerage and ask.  Just walk in Ed Jones or Td or hell maybe a bank and see what they can tell you.
03/14/2021,stocks,Oh well if that is the case that's fair enough. Do you mind if I ask for a link to the source? I couldn't find anything when I searched myself. Thanks
03/14/2021,stocks,What do you mean by qualified?
03/14/2021,stocks,"People could have sold at the end of last year to collect ""tax free"" gains to cancel out losses incurred in the crash and I wouldn't say you saw any major market movement from that so...

I don't see enough selling all at the same time to the point that the market moves significantly just because it is coming up on one year since a crash."
03/14/2021,stocks,I have been thinking the same that those heavy investors who bought the major dip will be unloading soon
03/14/2021,stocks,My SO and I have deal that I pick tech stocks (PhD in AI) and she pick biotech (MD in biotech.) and she opened a decent amount in CRSP with intention to buy and hold.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Beam is another one that might be worth looking into based on prior reddit posts with this discussion. However, I like CRSPR myself as well"

03/14/2021,stocks,"If you want to gamble, you want high risk and high reward, which would end up being the stupidest choice. Smack your head against your desk a few times to kill a few braincells, slam a bottle of vodka to get rid of inhibitions, then make your choice and go all in."

03/14/2021,stocks,You‚Äôre not really missing anything. You‚Äôre paying a premium to buy the LEAPS and taking on more risk if the stock price goes down.
03/14/2021,stocks,"All airlines are unprofitable and usually subsidized by governments as increased air travel roots stimulates countries economy. This is old known facts. This time is the worst because new airline companies hardly to survive this cerveza sickness period. Even if everyone will start travel in near future I would not even look at any airlines company this is dead fish. Only my opinion, not an advisor. Good DD thanks."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Why is it a dead fish, Asking out of curiosity to understand, I of course may have missed something, and I don‚Äôt have much knowledge.

Could you give a short explanation??"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I was talking about this industry in general. It is almost impossible to maintain profitable air lines company. Airlines provide a vital service and stimulates countries economy thats why they are subsidized by governments, but factors including the continuing existence of loss-making carriers, bloated cost structure, vulnerability to exogenous events and a reputation for poor service combine to present a huge impediment to profitability. I am not referring to particular company I mean whole industry in general and I don‚Äôt see how FLYR or any other new airline will make the difference? Especially taking into account current situation and their state: no license, no fleet no nothing, just nice idea which is destined to be doomed. But I might be wrong of course, just my point of view."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I appreciate your critical thinking very much.

One must always be critical when it comes to investing money, instead of happily jumping into anything."
03/14/2021,stocks,"BTW it doesn‚Äôt mean that stock isn‚Äôt going to fly high. Fundamentals and stock price are highly uncorrelated nowadays, but you probably spotted that."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think the best strategy is always to invest ASAP even if you are dollar cost averaging. 

If you invested 10k into the S&P in January 2000 and held for 20 years you would have seen about a 6% return. But if you missed the 10 best days in the market, you would have only seen a 2% return.

If you're DCAing this shouldn't matter too much, but if you wait for a Friday you might miss one of those days for just the 0.05% increase. That's how I look at it at least.

EDIT: 6% and 2% **annual** return"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Huh.

Interesting.

Wonder what the psychology of the weekend might be doing to affect this"
03/14/2021,stocks,">The January Effect [small cap stocks popping early in the year] might be the granddaddy of all calendar anomalies, but it is not the only one. **For inexplicable reasons, stocks generally do much better in the first few days of the month than the middle or end, and they also fare much better on Fridays than on Mondays.**

Prof. Jeremy Siegel, *Stocks For the Long Run* (1994, updated/revised several times afterwards)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Huh, interesting.  What decision will it inform for you?  Is this assuming you invest x amount every Friday since 1990?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve seen a comment before that said people are more likely to take their money out in order to mitigate the risk of something happening over the weekend that could affect the market when it opens on Monday. Not sure if it‚Äôs legit, but it seems reasonable"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes investing every Friday just before close, I guess it could be useful as to slightly increase DCA if you were using it as a way of reducing risk (even though lump sum is better I wouldn't be comfortable going all in at these P/E levels)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"It can't do whole body imaging (no ultrasound can, it's not cross-sectional). The ""all-in-one"" probe is also a drawback. It can't do endocavity (transvaginal or transrectal), it isn't going to replace the ultra-high frequency linear ""hockey stick"" probes (necessary for very superficial scanning, or on neonatal vascular and small parts). The footprint is also not suitable for scrotal or thyroid scanning - the probe isn't wide enough to get a whole adult testicle or thyroid in one view. 

As others have continually pointed out, in the US nobody is going to assume liability without a trained tech and a radiologist to do a formal read. Nobody is going to get reimbursed without either of those as well. And there are required views and documentation that go along with diagnostic exams (even FAST exams in the ER). 

I see BFLY ""DD"" constantly that is just regurgitated hype and investor presentations - you should try posting this on r/Radiology, the people who use ultrasound daily and are well-versed in its clinical applications."
03/14/2021,stocks,Shilling is in full bloom for that one. I'll have to watch it tomorrow for a good short entry.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Unfortunately with the legal concerns of any missed US read, I don‚Äôt think this will make meaningful inroads into American healthcare. 
Why do your own US when you can have a radiologist/technician do a formal one. (I hate saying it but it‚Äôs true).

Yes it could penetrate into the developing world though"
03/14/2021,stocks,too expensive as a stock right now. It is priced to be the next big thing and its only going to gain acceptance in limited specialties
03/14/2021,stocks,Correct - it makes zero sense to expose yourself to more liability and not get reimbursed.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Why would you write such a huge post and neglect to identify the god damn company?


GARBAGE!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"No clue without seeing the financials, but there are plenty of ways accountants can legally ‚Äúhide‚Äù revenue, it sometimes has to do with how they recognize revenue for their primary business or their other businesses."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Lukin Coffee ""hid"" their numbers for quite a while until they couldn't anymore. Luckily I lost 97% of my money i invested with them. Good times, screw China."
03/14/2021,stocks,"in The Little Book of Value Investing by Christopher Browne where he explains European companies often have different accounting standards ... nothing unethical, necessarily. but in Europe they tend to place a greater emphasis on a strong balance sheet and low debt. it's chapter 7, where he explains how Roche was undervalued"
03/14/2021,stocks,It is not a US company this is why I didn't care to Would you consider investing in it?
03/14/2021,stocks,"So, when they pay less divident they keep the money to themselves? I don't understand the dividend why a company would pay it?"
03/14/2021,stocks,Wow this is really interesting So they went from 40 pre covid to 1 then recovered to 6 right? Are you talking about this or something happened earlier?
03/14/2021,stocks,"Thanks I will check it

My main question is how they can show the input cost higher? Let's say it is wheat products firm or a milk product firm or meat products. How can they show the price of raw milk, wheat, meat they bought high? There is a huge gap one is 22% gross revenue other is 12% Let's say the sales are 1 billion dollars then the difference is 100 million which is really high"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Not sure if dividends would have to do with anything.  Those are reportable, but probably need a accountant to verify."
03/14/2021,stocks,">There is a huge gap one is 22% gross revenue other is 12% 

that is a large gap, but it's hard to say what's happening without looking at the charts. 

a bigger company might simply be more profitable through vertical integration ... if the larger company owns their delivery trucks, for example, they could reduce overall costs compared to a smaller company that needs to hire trucks for delivery."
03/14/2021,stocks,"They may be doing to pay low tax? But then, this is one of the biggest food brand here so how can they let them do this? The government would want to get the tax right?

My main question is how they can show the input cost higher? Let's say it is wheat products firm or a milk product firm or meat products. How can they show the price of raw milk, wheat, meat they bought high? There is a huge gap one is 22% gross revenue other is 12% Let's say the sales are 1 billion dollars then the difference is 100 million which is really high"
03/14/2021,stocks,"What charts you mean? There is no detail on cost in the financial report.

They are both same tier companies selling the same thing, milk products. And they are both really old companies so I believe they should get this on track until now. One seems like did but other not, I somehow don't believe, there is something fishy. 

For example The advertising cost of the company went from 100 to 135 this year while the net income remained same  around 100 million. How on earth a company pay 135 million on adverts but make 100 million income. Is this normal?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Pro tip, don‚Äôt drink Hennessy..."
03/14/2021,stocks,Fact.
03/14/2021,stocks,"You need to open a margin account, before you can short. 

When you short you borrow shares through your broker to sell and then if price drops you buy back at cheaper price and bag the difference as profit. If prices go up, you bag difference as loss.

In order to open a margin account you need to be approved, the requirements vary between countries and brokers, but it usually means you need to have a certain amount of money in your account and no major issues with your credit. 

Also when you trade on margin, you always need a certain amount of cash in order to avoid getting margin called (where the brokerage forcefully close your position to limit their own risk)

Don‚Äôt short or trade on margin unless you really know what you are doing. You can lose more money than you have (in other words, your account can go negative if things go wrong)."
03/14/2021,stocks,In a way it's the opposite of buying a stock: upside is limited to the share's value while downside is unlimited. It sounds nicer than it is.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Open a margin account with your brokerage. Or get permission to trade on margin. I def wouldn't say it's smart to wade into naked shorts, or even calls first starting out. Especially should you hold them when they get assigned."
03/14/2021,stocks,"rule of shorting 

understanding of technicals of a stock, at what price does bulls will defend it.

2. risk/reward - simple way to calculate this is how much are you willing to lose vs the reward.

3. closeout the position when the stock is turning.

it's about managing the risk, shorting requires discipline."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You can short stocks of an asset you already own.  It's a risk free (mostly) way of generating profits on a stock is very stagnant.  For instance if you're holding 500 shares of AAPL lets say and it's been moving sideways for 6 months (small gains here and there equaled by small losses here  and there) you can ""short"" the stock by lending out the 500 shares you own.  This is selling covered calls (a form of shorting in the near term when you think the price will not go up).  You're lending your shares to somebody who thinks the stock price will go up for a premium.  If your right and it doesn't go up, you receive a premium for lending the shares, if your wrong, you sell your shares for the predetermined price (which you should set at a price your comfortable with taking a profit at).  It's a way to earn passive income on owning a stock in a stagnant market.  Obviously the risk here is that  you're underlying stock drops significantly in price and your stuck in your option contract (i.e. you cant sell it).  That shouldn't matter too much if your long on the stock anyway.  The other risk here is that you're wrong and the stock price skyrockets and you lose out on potential gains (still doesn't matter though because you still sell at a profit)."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Your description of how it works is spot on. But you are asking ""how I do that"". On IBKR you just sell. That's it. No special button, just sell"
03/14/2021,stocks,Wealthsimple doesn‚Äôt allow shorting. A new investor should not be trying to short.
03/14/2021,stocks,Thank you this was super helpful!
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah i was thinking it wouldn‚Äôt be as great as i thought it‚Äôd be haha
03/14/2021,stocks,That wasn‚Äôt my question but thanks i guess? Lol

03/14/2021,stocks,"I personally do not like stop losses, i suppose it depends on how you use them. If you have them set at like 20% below your stock to prevent something like a catastrophic crash of beyond that, then maybe, but every time I've used them, it's always been the stock dips, trips my stop loss, then immediately goes back up. Even in the example above, imagine something like the Covid crash, where things tanked, but almost immediately rose again. If you'd got tripped and and didn't buy back in before it rose you'd be pretty upset with yourself. 

If your a long term investor i wouldn't use them. Just my thoughts"
03/14/2021,stocks,"No. Stop losses are shit. Gap downs or gap ups blow past them, and it also triggers a close just based on price action. 

You can buy a put option at a strike you want to protect. Much smarter way to hedge against the downside."
03/14/2021,stocks,"To use a stop loss you need to understand price action.  If you just randomly buy in and set a couple percent stop, you're most likely going to take some heat and get stopped out.  If you can trade with trend and buy an anticipated higher low and set a stop-loss at a point of invalidation on the chart, that is the best method."
03/14/2021,stocks,Everything I‚Äôve read said that all stop losses do is cause you to buy high and sell low.
03/14/2021,stocks,"It depends on the stock and your plans for it. If it is a high conviction stock for me I will never set a stop because I'm interested in its price in 10 years, not now, so anything that happens in between is pretty much noise. Where I tend to use them (and always trailing stops) is on stocks where my conviction is fairly low but where the market has more enthusiasm than I do.  So, if I'm wrong I still get the rise in price, and if I'm right I still lock in most of my gains."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You should ALWAYS use stop losses, no matter what. Protect your investment. 

Bare minimum for me is the previous level of support."
03/14/2021,stocks,If it‚Äôs a long term investment and you believe in the company then no need for a stop as the price will roller coaster for as long as you have it till you are ready to sell. If you are day trading 100% you need your stops in place.
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks. I wasn't seriously thinking of it anyways.  Just trying to learn the ropes and get peoples opinions.
03/14/2021,stocks,You have to pay for options though correct?
03/14/2021,stocks,I don't understand that. I check my account everyday anyways.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Correct, stop losses are for PLUG, GME, AMC and such. Not for AAPL, FB or TSM."
03/14/2021,stocks,"lol always no matter what In a discipline of emotion and speculation. 

~Only Siths speak in absolutes~"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Great way to ensure you sell low.

There are many critically important nuances around setting any automated sell order."
03/14/2021,stocks,Not if you incur tax gains.  What if it triggers and then shoots back up higher the next day?  Then I'm buying in higher and lost to capital gains?
03/14/2021,stocks,Not a day trader thanks.  I wanna be an investor long term.  I'll sell when I'm about 100 years old.  I'm 47 right now.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, it's like buying insurance. If you really want to protect your gains at a certain level, it's worth it. If you have enough volume of shares."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Lol, I am almost certain I have used them for AAPL and possibly for FB. AAPL especially is a stock that moves a lot on hype and a perception that it will always be growing, whereas I perceive it to be more of of a high end consumer brand that sometimes gets overpriced (partially due to its solid reputation). So, even though it is obviously an exceptional company that will be around for a long, long time the price movement makes me see it as sometimes a great buy and sometimes a sell. When I own it (which I don't currently) and see it above what I think is fair (but still climbing) I will definitely put a trailing stop on that."
03/14/2021,stocks,I guess you figured out how to pick stocks that always go up now and forever. Congrats on winning wallstreet.
03/14/2021,stocks,I'm new and learning too so take it with a grain of salt but have you looked into a trailing stop loss?
03/14/2021,stocks,"And if it shoots up when you buy in and then tanks below it the next day and never recovers... then what? I choose to be pessimistic rather than gamble. 

If it triggers mine I monitor where the bottom is of the dip and then buy back in if I think it will recover. Let‚Äôs you pick up more shares along the way and potentially increase profits. 

I‚Äôm not telling you where to set one but you should set one."
03/14/2021,stocks,I only have 50 shares AAPL.
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah.  The problem is is that you have to know when to buy back in and you incur short term gains.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Msft and AAPL will recover imo.  Not worried. Do you think AAPL will go down to $50 and NEVER recover honestly?

If that did happen the stock market wouldn't ever recover."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Maybe depends on the volatility of the stock and if it's a short term play or not. I've noticed the market is unpredictable to say the least and it would suck to sell a long term play on an overreaction to earnings or news etc., plus the tax situation. Worth it for a stock you suspect might spike then drop and might not head back."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Obv those have a high likelihood of recovering, but not everyone can afford AAPL or MSFT. I worry about new and young investors seeing people disregarding SLs and then seeing their savings wiped away from their inexperience in choosing what/when to buy. People just jumped in 2 weeks ago and were annihilated by the correction. 

Im not trying to be a d*ck, I‚Äôm just saying I can‚Äôt predict the future. 


Lol besides, I bet if they did drop that low you‚Äôd be happy to have set a stop loss ;)

Best of luck to you."
03/14/2021,stocks,"No I'd buy more shares.  AAPL is 122.  Msft is 230 or so.  Not expensive.  You can always just buy a share.  It's how much money you put in, not the share price."
03/14/2021,stocks,Neither will be profitable unless they raise prices for their services. If they can price creep like Netflix then maybe in 5 years.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Uber never made a net profit. They just burn thru money subsidizing rides to drive competition out of the market and make themselves look better to riders.
Profitable this year? I'd earn more money betting that they don't.

Hard pass."
03/14/2021,stocks,Uber is a better investment IMO as Uber provides more diversification in revenues with rides + UberEats.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Neither one is a fantastic investment. but IMO LYFT is in slightly better condition. they have more cash than debt, while Uber has more debt than cash."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I recently started a position on Uber because I think they will be the winners in autonomous transport services once the technology is there. I plan on holding for several years, obviously.  I‚Äôll likely buy dips and sell covered calls in the meantime."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Owned both, made a few bucks but they seem like value traps so I exited for more cutting edge tech stocks. 

Like others have said, not sure how they pave a path to profitability with low prices. However, as a consumer I love the low prices."
03/14/2021,stocks,I have both but Lyft has big potential as a buy-out target imo and I would choose them if you only want one.
03/14/2021,stocks,Once Tesla nails full self driving its game over for both of these caution advised! At the very least be on the look out for this in the news so you're fully informed.
03/14/2021,stocks,I like how Lyft partner with Disney. They use their platform for Minnie vans
03/14/2021,stocks,Maybe they will own a Tesla fleet
03/14/2021,stocks,Minnie Vans are discontinued sadly. But it was the reason I download the Lyft app in the first place. So it was a smart partnership by their management.

03/14/2021,stocks,"i think you do this weekly right? would be cool to see the last week's watchlist with %change over the week added on. looks like you have an interesting outlook based on technicals, but it's hard to take much interest in them without a little more history or context. then again i'm just a lazy redditor who doesn't want to do the DDs"
03/14/2021,stocks,I would recommend looking int $AMTX it‚Äôs been gaining traction for months and just had its first two big climbs the last two months and they just came out with a 5 year plan to reaching a billion $ in revenue buy 2027 by incorporating their new patented process of making biodiesel jet and diesel fuel that gives 0 carbon emission and can be used without modifying the existing engine
03/14/2021,stocks,every time I see ‚ÄúnOt fInaNCiaL aDVicE‚Äù I immediately downvote. what are we 5?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I do this daily lol.

I was gonna say for YOU it may not be much of an interest, to the folks who enjoy it - gold mind lol"
03/14/2021,stocks,You don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs priced in? The stock has been booming
03/14/2021,stocks,As someone with quite a lot of followers I like to be safe. Someone who just to conclusions like you sounds more like they're five than me.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well cus the SEC and FBI are guna raid your home because you told people to buy certain stocks dude. I mean I dont want to go to federal pound me in the ass prison over some reddit post, pretty sure that's how it works.

Also, dont give your friends any advice ever, that's illegal."
03/14/2021,stocks,"oh i'm not saying it's dumb - i like that you do these. but i guess i'm too lazy to vet the random tickers i see online unless they have more thorough DDs, which i'd use as a platform to do my own investigation. so unless i see your avg successes, there's a bit too much activation energy for me to consider investing in these stocks lol. but again, maybe i'm lazier than the average redditor"
03/14/2021,stocks,The US dgaf and is open. No turning back now.
03/14/2021,stocks,Cant happen. Biden already said were having a normal fourth of july. Unless a completely new virus emerges were opening up fully.
03/14/2021,stocks,Not happening.
03/14/2021,stocks,The UK is already in a lock down and has been for months. Our road map has us coming out in May I think if the vaccinations keep up.
03/14/2021,stocks,One word. Texas.
03/14/2021,stocks,He doesn‚Äôt have the constitutional authority.
03/14/2021,stocks,"The Fauci article you cited doesn‚Äôt even contain the word ‚Äúlockdown.‚Äù I don‚Äôt see widespread lockdowns happening in the US again. Republican governors have had enough and lack the political will, and it runs counter to Biden‚Äôs vaccination drive. Whether right or wrong, the US isn‚Äôt going into another full lockdown unless something extraordinary happens."
03/14/2021,stocks,"can happen, somewhere on the world. But not in our country!"
03/14/2021,stocks,">and UK won't be far behind.

Err... what?
We're looking at coming out of lockdown shortly. Our current figures are extremely low with just 52 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. The lowest since october."
03/14/2021,stocks,The only thing that's gonna get lockdown is Melvin Capital.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Who cares at this point.  Just put your money in Amzn, lockdown or no lockdown."
03/14/2021,stocks,UK is still in high level lockdown
03/14/2021,stocks,Fauci should've been gone last year. He's a camera whore with as much credibility as Bill Nye
03/14/2021,stocks,Not going to happen. Name a red state that would comply.
03/14/2021,stocks,Lockdowns are very unpopular and with vaccine rollout and with continually falling rates unlikely in the US. International markets may take a hit though if they choose to.
03/14/2021,stocks,Fuck bitch ass Fauci. Fuck the government.
03/14/2021,stocks,"America's vaccination effort is much better than these other countries are going into lockdown. So hopefully we wont have more lockdowns. But definitely do not want a repeat of how mismanaged things were under Trump, then we are definitely doomed"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Do I need to refresh somebody's memory on what happened December 21st intraday in the US market? 

I mean, come on now. That day really should have been enough to get the idea of ""consistent negative reactions because COVID bad"" thrown in the garbage for good unless there is an actual negative development that isn't the usual."
03/14/2021,stocks,"He said if we behave we may be allowed to celebrate freedom.

I got my vaccine I'm going to the damn barbeque regardless of what he says."
03/14/2021,stocks,no he didn't say we were having a normal fourth of july. you're just lying.
03/14/2021,stocks,You obviously haven't looked at Bidens long history and more recent string of lies.
03/14/2021,stocks,how many times were you in and out of lockdown? this time you believe it? what a sucker.
03/14/2021,stocks,"more words, new york, california, fauci, cdc"
03/14/2021,stocks,it already happened once. under trump. with biden in the odds are even better that it happens again.
03/14/2021,stocks,you have been in and out of lockdowns repeatedly for the past year. i follow uk politics/news.
03/14/2021,stocks,you know he is biden's chief medical advisor right?
03/14/2021,stocks,isn't about red states. only thing that has to happen is for blue states to comply.  new york and california will be enough. also fauci pretty much controls the cdc as biden's chief medical advisor. travel restrictions are coming.
03/14/2021,stocks,"All the ones who want to keep their federal funding. 
Pull their money and they all fold"
03/14/2021,stocks,fauci is biden's chief medical advisor and he is calling for not lifting restrictions. fauci basically controls the cdc recommendations.
03/14/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs some small dick energy you‚Äôre giving off there dude
03/14/2021,stocks,[orange man bad]
03/14/2021,stocks,I don‚Äôt care what the government says I‚Äôm in Florida we‚Äôll Bbq in a nuclear holocaust if there‚Äôs meat in the house
03/14/2021,stocks,Well we are idiotic children are we not?
03/14/2021,stocks,What Biden said and what people hear are two different things.
03/14/2021,stocks,Front page news. Theirs even an article about fauci agreeing with biden on having a normal 4th
03/14/2021,stocks,Lol
03/14/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the info. I don‚Äôt appreciate the attitude. 

You managed to score an informative own goal ü¶µ ‚öΩÔ∏è ü•Ö"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah I believe it because 30% of the population is now vaccinated. They aim to have the whole country fully vaccinated by the summer. In fact our vaccination program is only surpassed by Israels in terms of how quickly we are vaccinating people.

Once we all vaccinated covid as a pandemic is over. Course it may turn out to be endemic, but that would just mean we need booster vaccines every year like we do with flu"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Are you living 6 months in the past? The whole Europe has been under lockdown for the last half a year. If anything, they‚Äôre coming up with plans to reopen and vaccination strategies to flatten the curve."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Seriously. The US has passed this.

If you're concerned about lockdowns then buy Amazon, Zoom, or take all of your money out of the market.

But Biden is inentivized to get the economy back open again and kids in school.

I understand the epidemiology before you posted this. It has been clear for months that the UK variant is the 500 pound gorilla. But too many Americans are not ready to go to lockdowns again and are big on getting the vaccines.

If you see that there is a huge increase in the mortality rates back to where they were at the peak in the US (after vaccines are distributed), then I'd be more confident in lockdowns."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Right and now figures are plummeting and we have an extremely well run vaccination process which ramps up week after week. 

Wales and Scotland are both easing restrictions at a greater rate than England, and given you following our news you'll know they have both been a lot more cautious than England. 

Flights are due to run on the 17th May. Our airport closed in December for comparison. Kids are already back at school. None essential retail is scheduled for April. June for everything else. 

There's been a big push to end lockdown early but the UK government (at least for England) are refusing that and are sticking to the original plan. There's absolutely nothing there to suggest the roadmap is going to be pushed back."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah and he was Trumps before that. Doesn't stop him from being a camera whore every Sunday.
03/14/2021,stocks,Enough to what? Force everyone else into lockdown? No. Damage the GDP of those two states? Sure.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Not going to happen. In the past, this kind of control worked because there was a funding loss. But, the loss of GDP, and thus tax revenue, from lockdowns  is as damaging or worse than the loss of federal funding."
03/14/2021,stocks,Not lifting restrictions and adding significantly stricter ones is apples and oranges.
03/14/2021,stocks,"One has to call it what it was. Anyway, doesn't seem like people are falling for your fearmongering. So good luck with that"
03/14/2021,stocks,Thats why so many of you have died ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/14/2021,stocks,I have a feeling DeSantis wouldn't exactly comply with more lockdowna.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah, this is a bad post. The idea of Europe being under lockdown is not new and refreshing news to me (despite me not being a European) and the last time this was actually news, it caused a reaction that lasted a grand total of one day in Europe and a couple hours at best in the US markets when they were open."
03/14/2021,stocks,good luck with that.
03/14/2021,stocks,"new york, california, fauci and the cdc are enough to disrupt the country again and put us back into a lockdown.  democrats don't want kids back in school. they are currently caving to the teachers unions on this.  biden is going to play it very safe so he doesn't end up with another surge on his watch."
03/14/2021,stocks,you've been down this road before based on improving numbers. you keep allowing yourself to be played.
03/14/2021,stocks,the difference is that trump didn't listen to fauci. biden does. if fauci calls for keeping or increasing restrictions they will happen. don't delude yourself. look at the reality in front of you.
03/14/2021,stocks,restrict business and travel. thats what.
03/14/2021,stocks,You keep thinking that. Fly over states only continue to exist because of fed funding.
03/14/2021,stocks,keep your head wedged bro
03/14/2021,stocks,"the reason you have a vaccine in record time is because the trump administration removed all the bullshit that caused the process to be long and unnecessarily drawn out. but sure dude. [orange man bad] 

enjoy you kids in cages.  i know that is ok again now that dems are back in charge."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt need luck, I‚Äôm not working on those reopening plans..."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you're focused on your own echo chamber. 

I imagine you're a person of science. But if you look at local news and public sentiment, the bar is a lot higher now for closing back up.

The canary in the coal mine will be Florida and Texas. If things get really bad there again after spring break (give it 3-4 weeks) then it is possible that we'll have some sort of lockdowns. But that's the bare minimum as we approach the summer months.

Fall and winter are another thing entirely."
03/14/2021,stocks,"We were there in the summer, well before any vaccines and we were told time and time again to expect it to be bad in winter, which it was. Nobody has been played unless they chose to cherry pick their news."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Ok so by that logic should Trump/Biden have listened to Fauci when he said 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason to be walking around with a mask. When you‚Äôre in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it‚Äôs not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is. And, often, there are unintended consequences ‚Äî people keep fiddling with the¬†mask¬†and they keep touching their face.‚Äù¬†?

Or should they have listened at 1 mask? 2? What's next 33?

The only thing he's been consistent about is getting himself on all the Sunday morning shows for the last year."
03/14/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve been doing that since last March. I believe New York is still banning people from certain states unless they quarantine for 14 days.
03/14/2021,stocks,Look at the case rate. Downward it goes. Look at the vaccination rate. Up it goes. Things are good. They will say to keep wearing mask or not to stuff too many people in one location but another lockdowns is highly unlikely.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Vaccine was available/authorized in December, but people didn't start getting from until February. That definitely was an issue, that was fixed under new administration.

 Previous administration was busy with just sabotaging democracy in December and January, instead of planning a vaccine distribution plan. 

Only good thing that did was order a lot of it . UK, Russia were the first countries to authorize vaccines,  way before us, so your argument doesn't stand. Also, Trump's base peddled anti-vax conspiracies, further wreaking the process 

 They mishandled the whole situation in the first place, not mandating masks, and controlling surges during breaks. They were too afraid that their ""base"" would be mad. It's not just ""orange guy bad"", ""orange guy's dumb worshipers are dumb"".

Kids in cages argument, is just stupid. Out of context. But to add to your point, they are in the process of moving to better facilities now, and these are temporary, until they find their parents. We are in this mess because of the ""zero tolerance"" family separation policies of previous government. It takes time to clean up any mess that was left behind.

From the article: ""Democratic politicians raising concerns about how quickly coronavirus vaccines..."", this definitely is something that one should be concerned with, pushing a vaccine without enough  evidence will result in people rejecting vaccines.

On kids in cages:

Lol. You should read the Washington post article you posted, it is exactly the post I posted. If you read the post it would explain how Trump's policy is way more inhumane and was deliberate. Obama's efforts were a last ditch effort. Immigrants both legal and illegal had been hit hard under Trump. Increased racial attacks on Asian Americans for example"
03/14/2021,stocks,two of the biggest states and the cdc adding additional restrictions for air travel is all that will be needed.
03/14/2021,stocks,i understand just fine. When democrats cage kids it is ok.
03/14/2021,stocks,I understand you cannot read
03/14/2021,stocks,I got it dude. When obama and biden cage kids and deport over 3 million poor immigrants it is just something that needs to be done. It is only bad when republicans do it.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Read the article, that your posted. You will have your answer"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Dude chill. I get it. Caged kids, deportations, imperialism, going after journalists and bombing brown people in the middle east is ok when democrats do it. I get it bro."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You left out the part where they diluted shares by 30% since Q3 2020, and they haven‚Äôt reported Q4 2020 yet. 

They also cut their outlook and discovered that many contracts are closer to pro-Bono than profitable. 

They also bought two companies, took out more debt, and are now faced with the integration of two companies from countries that operate in a different language. 

It‚Äôs not all rosy."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If I were in your shoes I'd go with option #2.

If you have any alerts or daily emails set up that provide you with market updates, I would also disable those."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If it's not fun or interesting, finding ways to back away certainly makes sense. In order to pick winning stocks and have the ability to ride out major corrections like we just had in tech, it requires a mentality that surprisingly few people seem to actually understand until they're in too deep and it's too late. Good on you for recognizing the issue and attempting to adjust accordingly. 

I'd say the best approach going forward depends on what positions you picked, why you picked them, and how much you trust yourself to be proven right over time. Based on what you've said, transferring everything into some combo of VTI, VOO, QQQ, and SCHD might not be a bad idea, but regardless of what choice you make, if constantly checking and tweaking is a problem, switching your holdings isn't going to solve that issue."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you already know the answer to your own question. There's nothing wrong with having a ""boring"" portfolio that you can trust and take a breather with. Most likely over the course of 6+ months you'll make more gains than the majority of people trading anyway and with a fraction (or none) of the stress.

Personally I hold 5 companies and the remainder of my portfolio is VTI and a small bit of QQQ. The last few weeks have been amazing and I've been able to use it as a great buying opportunity."
03/14/2021,stocks,"day trading and other short-term stock strategies can be close to gambling for some people, in terms of the brain function and response. so if you're recognizing those types of traits, might be time to back off. 

I vote for 2. see how that goes."
03/14/2021,stocks, #2
03/14/2021,stocks,"Option 1 - I would want to know what you are holding on to and is a loss inevitable?    If waiting for them to come back is not realistic, take your lumps as well as consider gains you have that you can use losses to lower tax basis on gains.  

I was where you are in the tech run up and bubble bursting.  I was burned out on the daily grind of watching nonstop.  I could not look away.  I had $30k in fun money that I turned into $500k.  Things were wearing on me.   I had a discussion with brokers and they gave me advice that looking back was not good.  I held some too long and listened to too many ‚Äúexperts‚Äù advising to buy into the dot com and tech sell off.   I was also told to hold onto stocks that went from $15 to $300 in some cases and good companies at the time.  Leaders In each space at the time.  I got ‚Äúsolid advice‚Äù to hold the ones down 50% and ones with gains I was advised to sell and go blue chips and I did that.  The ones I held, some went to almost zero - I should have sold.  The pivot into blue chips got hammered to 50% of the value where I purchased.  

If you need a break, put in stop losses at price points that are not regret sell prices regardless if you are negative or positive.  If you want to park the money, I would transition into an ETF like QQQ or SPY or a dividend stock that has not run up 100% the last year.  Gravity exists in the market and if it does mot make sense, it‚Äôs likely to come down."
03/14/2021,stocks,"A question for discussion OP. What are you expecting if you were to move everything into an ETF (vti, voo, or spy) and checking in a few months?

What are your current holdings that are at a loss, for how much % loss? This can help determine whether is it better to cut your losses and move on or if there might be a chance of recovery. Your timeframe is to be considered as well."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I've found If your having to watch and stress over it,  it's usually because you're portfolio isn't balanced enough.  Too much of it in one industry or company.  If you're tech heavy,  that could be causing the stress. Trim your largest positions if they represent too much of the portfolio and find a few more companies in industries that your light on.  This helps reduce stress. Also just be sure you know what you own,  what you pay for it,  and if you think the company is on the brink of being too expensive,  trim."
03/14/2021,stocks,What's your account worth roughly?
03/14/2021,stocks,I would turn daily alerts OFF bit set alerts at major milestones that you would want to know regardless. High percentage or high or low price points.  If you need a mental break you need it - period.  Not healthy.
03/14/2021,stocks,The alerts are definitely problematic for me. I'll be doing fine and then I'll get an alert and spend the next hour looking at the day's activities.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I've been thinking i need to do this. Every time I get into a new trade I've it a different ticker because somehow i feel i need to do something different since I already have some other existing one. But honestly it just makes it hard to keep track of, like 30-40 different positions with various options on them... I feel like I should move to just a could i can know really well and am confident in, and then the rest in QQQ or something"
03/14/2021,stocks,"If I wasn't behind on some of my positions, I would 100% do this. I still might, but I think I'll see if I can go a week without checking on the status of those I'm behind on. If I can't, I think I'll just dump them and go with VTI for a while. I'm rarely tempted to check on my VTI position."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I doubt the losses are inevitable. Down 20-25% on some after the correction. The description of your mental state seems very similar to what I'm experiencing.

I think I'll try to just ignore everything for a week, and if I can't, then I'll go with the index ETF approach for a while to give myself brain a break."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think I'll try this. Or, I might just put stops or sell orders at those milestones instead of the alerts."
03/14/2021,stocks,"That's good to hear.  20% / 25% is really not really terrible, although it may feel that way.  The loses may be compounding your metal state where things feel amplified and overwhelming.  If you are also an ""A"" type personality (a driver driver) that can compounds things.  I'm super driven type A and I struggled with any losses back then even when I was up so much, smaller losses either in dollars or percentages were wearing on me mentally.   I'm now able to let things go, and step back and look at the big picture and not let a single event consume me and burn me out."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I am a textbook example of a type A personality, so I appreciate the advice."
03/14/2021,stocks,"For a house, since you appear to have the job security for another 11 years (barring UCMJ intervention), your returns in the market can reasonably be expected to exceed what you'd save by paying down the house early. 

Anything else is consumer debt and should ALWAYS be avoided whenever possible."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You should put as little down for a down payment as possible. Since you're military that should be very easy with the VA loan. Plus with interests rates super low, that's as good as it gets. Your money in the stock market will return more than the interest rate on your home loan (theoretically)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"It's as simple as comparing your effective interest rate (so after any tax advantages if any) with your expected returns, and correcting for risk.

If you expect more than 3% returns you should not be paying off your 3% debt.

A typical way of living of your investments is actually taking out cash loans against those investments instead of selling (which incurs taxes).
This is how many higher net worth people pay for their day-to-day stuff."

03/14/2021,stocks,"There is definitely an obsession with owning your own home, even though many people end up selling it within a few years.

It‚Äôs just a question of ROI:

Mortgage interest rate

Opportunity cost of renting

Possible returns from the market

Zero down VA loan cost/benefit

Being frequent movers, if you had the intent of being savvy landlords in the future, then it makes sense to buy sort of.  But if you are buying, and moving every 2-3 years and selling at the end of it, it doesn‚Äôt make as much sense."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Technically, if you do that, it is exactly like buying stocks on margin; which is not a good idea. But if your job is safe and you have someone who backs you, I would do it."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'd sell stocks before getting a loan. 

let's say you want to get a gent used car for $20k. portfolio is at $80k.

03/14/2021,stocks,Keep the stock buy a  camper
03/14/2021,stocks,Just want to say what you‚Äôve been doing these years is what I started this year.  Glad to see its been working out for someone.  Makes me feel better about the choice.
03/14/2021,stocks,Use the equity in your existing home to put money down on your next.  Time is a very important aspect of investing and you only lose it.  Interest rates are so low on autos that it seems hardly worth it to pay capital gains on your investments over what should be less than 3% interest.  Same with mortgages.  You have the ability to get a VA loan which should keep you from the extra fees like PMI if you don't have enough down.
03/14/2021,stocks,"It totally depends on interest rates, other charges, taxes, etc.

In a vacuum it seems really unlikely that you want to pay capital gains tax in order to avoid approx. 3% interest (assuming your cash flow is steady either way). Similarly, with the house down payment the main reason to make a large downpayment on a low interest mortgage is to avoid other charges (esp. PMI)."
03/14/2021,stocks,No
03/14/2021,stocks,If you saw your amortization you would want to pay off your house ASAP
03/14/2021,stocks,"Depends these days, we have a car loan for 2.25% APR. No way I am going to pay that off early."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Interesting, thanks!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sure they are, they‚Äôre just depreciating"
03/14/2021,stocks,Technically they are. I do see your point as they have next to no roi and there value depreciates like no other.
03/14/2021,stocks,Cars are indeed assets.
03/14/2021,stocks,"That's a very poor-mans way of of looking at debt.

If you can cover the debt and the risk is acceptable then you should just do whatever gives you the best returns combined with the best sleep at night.

Investing while having debt is just a form of leverage and almost everyone does it with car loans and mortgages.
First paying off all of your safe debt is a nice way to not take advantage of any leverage, and it'll slow down your wealth building significantly."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Bullsh!t? It's as simple as comparing the interest on your debt with your expected returns. Just compare your amortization schedule with your investment growth and look at the difference over time...

A mortgage is one of the cheapest and safest loans you can get because it is heavily regulated and promoted by government."
03/14/2021,stocks,Why not? Because it's a good rate? Honest question.
03/14/2021,stocks,That you can‚Äôt write off personally.
03/14/2021,stocks,You can‚Äôt write em off though unless you buy em through a company so that would be the only way I would do it.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Not OP but presumably yeah. I did the same thing -- had a bunch of investments pre law school, went, and when i ran low on savings instead of selling equities started using my professional line of credit at 2.45%. It's a risk, but while I don't take money from the LOC to invest I decided not to sell equities and instead leverage. 

Still not sure if that's the right choice, but when 5k of LOC debt costs 122 dollars a year to service, it becomes really tempting to let the investments run."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I can probably get a much higher returns on my investments, let's say anywhere between 4-10 % just by playing safe ETF's. While paying off the 2.25% loan would give me only a 2.25% return.

There is risk of course, the 2.25% car loan is 100% guaranteed to yield 2.25% if I would pay off, while investing is not guaranteed to provide any positive returns.

Still, my estimate is that most often than not investing will come out ahead. The only additional consideration is to see whether the downside is acceptable, let's say the market tanks 50%....can I comfortably survive that scenario without serious consequences in the long run? Answer is 'yes' for this car loan, I'd just continue paying and eat the losses.

For my mortgage and student loans it is the same, but I am not willing to take out an extra mortgage to invest with against the increased value of the house because I am not comfortable accepting the (unlikely but possible) downside risk."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sure you can, there is nothing stopping you from writing anything off.
You can write off the weekly groceries if you wamt to be that detailed....

What are you talking about?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Generally they get into so-called ""analyst calls"" with company's management during which management presents their 'guidance' i.e. expectations on how the business is going to perform. This forms a basis for further analysis, as management often or always is bullish on future performance. Then the analyst gathers a fact base to challenge management's assumptions: does the market grow in line with guidance? are revenue projections solid? are cost projections solid? are there any risks? what about debt? any major strategic moves? Ultimately, the analysts builds a financial model based on which they project future cash flows and value a company using on DCF. Concurrently, they use multiple-based valuations i.e. compare the company to its peers. Based on that they arrive at an implied share price and compare with the current share price. If the implied is noticeably higher, they issue a buy recommendation.

That's in a nutshell. There's of course much more detail to it but for that I suggest you look into professional literature on corporate finance, fundamental analysis and valuation."
03/14/2021,stocks,"7 Secrets to Investing like Warren Buffet was a pretty good book written by his daughter in law Mary Buffet. Obviously contains info on fundamental value investing.
I like screening on Finviz.com. I screen for revenue growth last 5 years, revenue growth quarter over quarter, EPS growth the next 5 years, EPS growth last 5 years, all over 25% each. I get a nice short list of stocks with really strong fundamentals."
03/14/2021,stocks,They just make shit up and then change their prediction every time the stock does something different

03/14/2021,stocks,Weighing machines and voting machines
03/14/2021,stocks,Don't the analysts represent companies that have short and long positions and therefore their price targets downgrades are meant to sink the stock when they're short and pt upgrades to generate momentum when they're long?
03/14/2021,stocks,"Interesting. Thinking about going to school for finance or economics.

Seems wild that mulitple analysts from different firms have different guidance and expectations. Seems like it should just be math, but it's obviously whatever people are willing to pay for it.

Ultimately I trade on technicals alone. I don't need school for that."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Analyst price target hikes and rating upgrades do elicit a small jump/decline in stock price, but that's not why they do it. 

They do it because the PT upgrade/downgrade or rating upgrade/downgrade was the end result of their research into the stock. 

They wouldn't be called investment analysts if they didn't publish their research and change their stance on it accordingly"
03/14/2021,stocks,"The basic corporate finance way to gauge at growth rate is Retention Ratio x Return on Equity (how much the company keeps instead of giving out as dividends, multiplied by the earnings divided by the book value of equity). That's just part of it, but it actually gives you a precise number as opposed to asking management ""how much are you gonna make next year"". None of the two is guaranteed to be correct, but I personally would always rather trust the former.

Analysts kinda do what they want. They have biases, they are forced to support certain companies, they take in the opinions of management.   
If you work for X mutual fund and it has a 15% stake in Y company, if you write a bad review of Y, you'll be out of a job forever. I personally wouldn't listen to analysts, but I'm also no guru and we'll see how right I am in 30+ years time."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hmmm.... so... repurposing real estate and turning it into something else is a valid argument and might pan out long term. But if that‚Äôs your view then I would say buying some shares and holding them long term is the way to go. I am not convinced that call options 3 months out are the way to go. 

But maybe...  not saying it is a sure loss or anything. Just the 3m call option strategy doesn‚Äôt quite fit with the long-term potential upside."
03/14/2021,stocks,Saw a $32 fair value for them. If I can every get out of UWMC (thinking about covered calls) I might get back into MAC. Saw a good DD on them like a month ago. With the vaccine rollout coming sooner than expected I think this could be a good play both short and long.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Real estate will always have value. Unfortunately, shares in REITs aren't the same thing as real estate. You're right that if they're a worthwhile company, they'll sufficiently adapt to the growing permanent disappearance of malls, but how effectively this happens and on what timeline, and with what obstacles along the way, remains to be a significant unknown. Still a major risk overall. Doesn't hurt to have a little as a diversification play I guess, but certainly not a YOLO candidate."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah i was using that because I have a lot of investments that will make more money byte anted to use it as a hedge was planning on buying more in may but if the price did rise I wanted to be able to buy them cheaper.
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah I got calls because I didn‚Äôt want to completely invest until after the reopening
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah that‚Äôs why I did calls at $14 waiting to buy a little after reopening
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you‚Äôve answered your own question.

Just a quick look Lemonade has market cap of 6.4 billion. By comparison Progressive (54.5B), Allstate (35.1B), Travelers (40B) are all 5-8x larger than Lemonade

It will be a long haul before an insurance startup has enough customers to achieve 5-8x given the factors you‚Äôve alluded to - people don‚Äôt typically switch insurance companies once they‚Äôve gotten established. So their growth will take time to acquire new insurance customers as younger people are looking to get started with renters, auto, homeowners, individual riders/valuables, etc.

That being said - if it can 5-8x - you‚Äôre looking at a $500-800 share price.

It‚Äôs a speculative stock to say the least - but there‚Äôs a lot of meat on the bone if you believe they can actively take market share from the other guys - there‚Äôs a large upside.

I personally think they‚Äôll get scooped up or won‚Äôt sustain their business long enough to ever see profitability - but I haven‚Äôt done a ton of in-depth research."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Uniformly bearish comments here it seems. None discussing the product lines LMND actually is in or its growth or what makes it unique.

Don't think any of them talk about their personal experience using it either. Which is kind of a shame. Use the app to do your DD. I've had zero problems with it and it's given me the best rate on renters insurance compared to both major car insurace companies I've had bundled with renters. Friends I've referred have had similarly positive experiences. No issues filing a claim or getting paid out. But that's anecdotal and online reviews always bring out misgivings. That's normal.

The true sell here as an investor is that LMND requires no agents to do the work. No hiring. And so scaling internationally as LMND has and into new verticals (like renters and life insurance as LMND also has) is a cinch -- weird that none of the posts here even considered the expansion and its success in that already. In short, LMND is a data and AI play. (I also like ROOT for these reasons, though it's not been received as warmly by markets. The test drive bit is kind of gatekeeping and restrictive but it too is something unique and worthwhile in insurtech)  

Comparing LMND to Progressive or Allstate or what have you is not the point. These have been stale and have yet to do anything like what LMND has done. Really. Talk to someone who works in legacy insurance and you'll see why. They're very conservative companies deep down and averse to change. And that's a okay. But to think they'll beat out LMND is kind of a joke if you know anything about the legacy insurers. Yes, you can sign up online there, too. But again, thinking that that's all LMND is is a mistake, particularly when it comes to its value proposition in scaling and the back end.

LMND has a unique set of products and a sort of distinct urban clientele that swears by the product, and it's growing and cross-selling customers at a very fast clip, has a management that knows how to scale, and has a certain hype to it, like it or not. 

I bought at 50, sold some at 160, will hold for the next decade. LMND also seems to attract a lot of shorts and bashers (look at stocktwits page), and I'm sure a true short report will be around the corner. This to me in the long run is kind of a good sign -- everything from SHOP to ENPH to TSLA has been similarly targeted. And they continued to go up against the odds and often on the back of the naysayers. In short: love it or hate it, don't bet against it"
03/14/2021,stocks,"What makes an insurance company great for a consumer is two things. The first is price, the second is customer service when you need to make a claim to actually use the insurance. Lemonade has absolute shit customer service with tons of better business bureau complaints for failing to pay out on claims.

The second parts scares me is and is the main reason why I see them never getting anywhere. They are the Comcast of the insurance industry."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm curious as to what you think of $ROOT. Similar tech insurance company. Had over 3.5X the revenue of LMND in 2020 and has over $1.1 billion cash on hand. However, Root is trading at a market cap of $2.8 billion compared to Lemonades market cap of $6.4 billion."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Lemonade is overvalued and unprofitable, but they have tons of cash and no debt. 

> don't think people want to actively switch insurance unless they absolutely have to. 

ideally the recommendation is to comparison shop every year for insurance, to make sure you're getting a good deal. but how many people do so? probably not a lot."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I will comment on this, I also like lemonade they were around in the NYC market for a while I used it for renters insurance ....I thought about buying the stock but passed on it....at its current price it's just not attractive."
03/14/2021,stocks,imo LMND has had its time i bought in at $49 after doing my DD on the company. i left it for a few weeks with plans to sell it in a year next thing i know it got to $180 Which made go over my research again to see if i missed anything by the time i finished it dropped to $165 where i sold it and it continued dropping. the company is way over valued atm and ill probably never get back into it again unless they're close to making a profit the risk reward isn't worth it  better stock to invest in.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I don't get the hype around Lemonade. One of the driving forces of insurance is brand recognition. Flo from Progressive and the Aflac duck have been running the money printer for years. Who thinks of Lemonade when they need insurance?"
03/14/2021,stocks,Did you read my post?
03/14/2021,stocks,Never had to deal with a claim just like most people but I'm sure it hard to get money from them just like most insurance companies!
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think the appeal is young folks can download an app and do it all without having an agent and stuff.

I‚Äôm assuming that will afford Lemonade to reduced overhead costs, thus increase profit margins or being able to provided lower rates. Which will either increase stock price by having better EPS or increase stock price by having higher revenues by an increase in volume of customers.

But I don‚Äôt know enough to know if anything they do is proprietary that won‚Äôt just be knocked off by someone with deeper pockets."
03/14/2021,stocks,"All those mascots came after those companies were well established. Lemonade has been around for 6 years, they obviously don‚Äôt have brand name recognition at this point."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, I meant comments. Sorry. Yours did that DD lol"
03/14/2021,stocks,I'd wager as soon as it becomes practical that the big insurance companies will institute something similar. Hell it's probably in the works and they'll release it when Lemonade has a fuckup that causes customers to leave.
03/14/2021,stocks,Ya I want to love it. If I got it at 50 I'd hold might buy some on a significant pull back from 100. As much as I want in I think I got some others I'm more interested in rn

I have 3 kids and the first thing we funded was 529 plans which are just thrown into straight up into a low cost S&P Index fund.  The goal is to be able to save 75% of the projected cost of in-state public 4 year degree for them.  They need to make up the balance with either scholarships or loans.

After that, we put their money (from birthdays, report cards, holidays, etc) into a custodial brokerage account and when they get to the age where they can have summer jobs we will use that to fund Roth IRAs.  

As far as stock picks go, right now they are in GOOGL, CVX, FROG, and I have some cash for each that I was going to use to buy RBLX but the valuation opened too high for my taste so I will wait to see it come down a little bit.

I had $25 deducted from my paychecks that went to the brokerage to buy more in all 4 companies. I did some other purchases along the way, stopped deductions because we were struggling, etc. but ended up with $10k that has been helping pay college costs.

When I chose companies I first made sure they paid a decent dividend and then made sure to buy companies I used every day. Our phone was through AT&T, I drank a lot of Coke and we were buying baby stuff made by J&J and Pfizer.

Since then I've switched my personal investing to index funds. Just don't overthink it and don't watch the market every day. Also don't sell until your kid needs the money.

I don't have the link to Cathie Wood's youtube video commentary, but she mentioned that Tesla believes that autonomous driving would have 20% market penetration by 2025; ARK on the other hand believes it'll be 8% penetration; Waymo predicts 1%.

03/14/2021,stocks,"I think Musk, like most entrepreneurs, are trying to sell us the future because we, like most consumers, get tired of the present and aroused by the unobtainable. If anyone buys what a businessman is selling you need to read the fine print -- the legal and realistic truth.

Case in point if you're willing to keep reading. During the meteoric rise of TSLA (during November, I believe) before they became part of the S&P, Musk promised a vehicle he had previous denied even existing; in fact, he had spoken out against making the vehicle -- which resembled something more than an SUV but less than a truck. He had to promise the stars of only to get his stock price to the moon (#NoOneLeftBehind). This is what businessmen like to do and Musk is not even the 100th person to do it.

Granted, one day...Lord knows when that might be...the Level 5 will be so commonplace and effective that this situation will be moot, but technology only gets better as we can generate the capacity for it and production of it.

If your friend feels cheated, so were we all when we were young and bought ""experimental"" doo-dads and whatnots because we were ""promised"" an expectation that inevitably fell short. Musk should be held accountable, as any manufacturer should be, but that fine print is tricky. The lawyers get ahold of products ling before the FDA, DOT, or any of their ilk do. There is some clause somewhere in the microscopic inking that says ""Buyer beware"" but no one can read 6 pt, even on a 4k res screen.

Bottom line, chalk it up to investing in better relics for the future that we'll scoff at in the year 2077 when were on Mars in Space-X/Amazon streaming taverns eating space wings at $5 a drumette."

And this stock Is completely detached from reality, under no circumstance should it be worth more than alibaba and Facebook, the fact that it is even remotely close at this stage is quite laughable, also I'm not so confident on the management of this company, mainly the bitcoin purchase they took, tesla is an energy and vehicle company two industries that need heavy capital to expand, and when tesla turns around and uses 1.5b on bitcoin when tesla is a capital intensive company, just doesn't sit well with me, even if they are right on bitcoin."

I like Elon Musk a lot. I like TESLA. I don't like TESLA at 1000x earnings. I won't short because GME proved it doesn't matter what valuations are. I just don't like the stock at this price. I'm more of a value investor."

03/14/2021,stocks,It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre immediately profitable. It just means that your contract has intrinsic value. If everything stayed constant until expiration your contract would still be worth something though you would be at a loss since you lose extrinsic value I.e time value. This is in contrast to an OTM call. If everything stayed constant until expiration your contract would be worthless at that time since there‚Äôs no intrinsic value attached to it
03/14/2021,stocks,"You are forgetting about the premium. If a strike price is below the stock price, the premium goes up."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Firstly many of these contracts started out of the money and got into the money, they then didn't get exercised because that would throw away the intrinsic value (IV) and then somebody buys them to get leverage to essentially own more shares for less but paying that premium for IV as intrest. There's also this stratage called buying leaps which is essensially buying far out (often 1+ years) far in the money calls to practially own shares for less, loss of IV still applies to this strategy."
03/14/2021,stocks,">Also, if I choose the strike rate $50.00 does that mean I am already ITM and I am profitable the moment I buy this call?

you're ignoring the cost of the premium. if you're buying a $50 call for a $56 share, the odds are pretty good that the premium is going to be around $6/share.

on to why someone would sell a call like this, is because they think the price of the stock will go down and take the call out of the money before anyone exercises it (since TYPICALLY people will excercise at expiration).

if that $56 share drops down to $45, the $50 option is worthless (until the stock goes back above the strike). to use a more real example, look at AAPL. it was trading for 133/share in mid february. if someone sold a 1 month call with a 125 strike, they would have gotten a big premium. now, the price is around 120 a share, so that would be out of the money even though it was in the money when the option was sold, and may expire worthless."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Let's say you have 100 shares of that company, and you are planning to sell at $58 no matter what, and a $50 call is $8. You would prefer to get some of the value of your shares right now in exchange for some risk.

You sell a call and you get your $8 immediately. You can buy other stock with it or whatever. The rest you get when and if your call gets assigned. If the share price goes down, but not below $50 you may or may not be able to buy back your call for less than the difference between the current price and $50. If you can, you can still get your $58+ by buying back the call and selling shares. If stock goes below $50, well that's that risk you took on when you wanted your money early. I hope you spend your $8 wisely.

If you are a call buyer, you will want these shares if they manage to stay above $50, but you don't want to buy them right now because it would cost you four times more money than calls. You believe there is a strong potential for above $58, but you would want someone else to take a risk of a drop below $50."

3. Institutional ownership is very low compared to other stocks of this market cap. Question for those more educated than I am: Is this solely because TSM is not an American company?"

03/14/2021,stocks,"Agreed, but they [should have enough water](https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/taiwan-prays-for-rain-as-drought-threatens-chip-production/) to last them through late-May. The government letting them drill new wells when water levels are extremely low is about as accommodative as government policy can be. The Taiwanese prime minister has promised Biden to do everything they can to keep chip production going, and pissing off Uncle Sam with hungry Uncle Xi next door is political suicide. 

Compared to [Samsung's situation in their Austin plant](https://www.kvue.com/article/money/economy/boomtown-2040/samsungs-austin-facility-shutdown-february-freeze/269-09e1de20-509d-42d5-8af0-7b69c80242da) where power was actually cut (not good for yields), TSM seems pretty well positioned. Let's also not forget that even with power, water, and billions of dollars, Intel can't get reliable yields on 7nm (much less anything lower)."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Based on what you and OP said, I can‚Äôt imagine intel being a bad investment right now with that amazing p/e they have."
03/14/2021,stocks,"INTC is also having massive problems getting below 10nm ...

They are something like four or five years behind their original schedule now.

I think its a good time to buy INTC for 5 years from now. They are in a market with only two companies (INTC, AMD) and just need to recover a little bit."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Intel is at least 1.5 generations (\~5 years) behind Samsung and TSM. Their struggles to get their 7nm running smoothly are well-documented and they have no real plans for smaller fabs. In January, they basically gave up and announced their next generation chips are going to be designed by Intel, built by TSM.

There really isn't anything the government can do in the short-term to address the chip shortage. In the long-term, it doesn't make sense to be building more capacity for older process nodes (10nm+/maybe even 7nm+).  Intel has a long history of troubled execution at these sizes. Its really hard to make high-quality batches of chips this small. A [Chinese attempt](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Caixin/What-s-left-in-China-s-former-field-of-chip-dreams) to invest in 7nm chip production just went belly-up despite 20 billion in investment. Smart government investments in semis wouldn't go to Intel. Can't discount the possibility of stupid government investments though (which is why I closed my Intel puts in Feb).

Intel has other structural issues. I thought [this article really made the case](https://stratechery.com/2021/intel-problems/) for their long-term problems. Lots of useful information in there."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes but all supply chains get shifted as a result. 

We're seeing 52 week lead times needed to order our controllers and I'm hearing talk of companies needed to shift their products onto new ic due to shortages. This means for some companies they'll be forced to shift into newer more expensive chips which will create a domino affect for demand at each level.

This will be further exacerbated of governments somehow step in and force fabs to produce certain chips or dedicate certain amounts of production time for those used by automobile companies."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Agreed that the EV/auto shortage is on the >7nm end of the market. The Tesla Atom example was actually the most advanced chip I could find in in a car with some light research. That said, TSM/Samsung/Intel make older chips too (\~40% of revenue for TSM) and there are definitely shortages on the <7nm end of the market too.

My broader point is that I don't really see big investments in older process nodes as a short-term response given the time it takes to setup a factory and I don't see chips for cars getting any simpler in the long-term."

I'm seeing [really reasonable arguments](https://www.i-micronews.com/chip-shortages-a-5-nm-european-fab-is-not-the-answer/) in the EU to pursue the partnership game vs. going it alone:

""For starters, constructing such a state-of-the-art facility, without support from TSMC or Samsung, will take at least 10 to 15 years and demand tens of billions of dollars of investment. What‚Äôs more, this eye-wateringly expensive endeavour won‚Äôt necessarily end in success. Intel has encountered difficulties on delivering its own advanced 7 nm manufacturing process ‚Äì if the US computing giant can‚Äôt easily succeed at this process node, should Europe pursue an even riskier jump to 5 nm?

Instead of tackling it alone, the only way for the EU to establish a 5 nm fab in Europe would be to follow a similar path to the US, and team up with TSMC or Samsung. The joint effort would require fewer funds from Europe ‚Äì around $10 billion ‚Äì and dramatically cut development times from 10 to 15 years to around 3 to 4 years."""

03/14/2021,stocks,I don't know where your heard that but they haven't given up on it at all. They just said that some chips could be produced by third parties. They're still pushing ahead with their own fabs.

03/14/2021,stocks,">they basically gave up and announced their next generation chips are going to be designed by Intel, built by TSM.

That is simply not true, they have never announced that the next generation chips will be built by TSM. There at at best some rumors that they might move low-end chip manufacturing to outside foundries but those are just that for now - rumors. And even those don't mention their flagship i5/i7/Xeon processors moving to outside foundries."

03/14/2021,stocks,"No.

If you want to make a play on data storage, you'll probably want to deal with the companies supplying the tools for data storage. CRSR is not one of those companies (aside from rebadging hardware manufactured by others for the consumer market).

Go-to plays would probably depend on your opinion on whether flash will outperform mechanical storage for the next X number of years or not (I'm ignoring tape media for now, even though it is important). The likes of SK Hynix, Micron, Samsung Electronics, Toshiba, WD, STX, Marvell all spring to mind. Then you have the other companies who deal with the tools that allow us to store such vast amounts of data. That's where the likes of NVDA/INTC/AMD come in from a hardware perspective. But also the vendors who supply those servers to data centre customers, such as Dell, HPE, Atos, IBM etc.. Oh and then there's the actual cloud giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc.. 

Basically put, a play on data can involve many, many companies. I personally (in my opinion - not financial advice, of course) think it's a great play, but I don't think CRSR would be anywhere near the list of my preferences."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Ok, these are fair points and I agree that the statement about giving up next gen chip production was wrong. I got my news timing mixed up.

Intel has confirmed plans of outsourcing some Atom/Xeon production to TSM and [rumors of moving i3](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-may-start-outsourcing-some-cpu-production-to-tsmc-in-2h-2021) to TSM 5nm in the second half of this year. Later, [Intel pretty much rejected the rumors](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/27/intel-thinks-it-can-keep-pace-with-tsmc-and-amd/) and essentially said they will still in-house production for their flagship chips. 

I do think Intel is 5 years behind in production. They could claim that their 10nm chips had as good transistor density as 7nm TSM but that claim isn't going to hold up when 5nm TSM chips hit the market with the Apple A14s going into the fall iPhones and AMD Zen4 chips in 2022 (at which point TSM should be starting to mass produce 3nm chips)."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Short-term in regards to the Auto/EV chip shortage, I totally agree with you. In the more medium-term, I think the economic upside is in the wakeup call for Western governments to start making more investments in chip production which will likely happen at the <7nm end of the market. TSM is who I think could be the biggest beneficiary of that."
03/14/2021,stocks,You should check better. Their main product is their RAM. They've been profitable since 2017. Last year $103 M profits on $1.7 B revenue and they have a P/E ratio of 28 which is lower than the average tech stock at around 30.

The EU has the funds, the willpower, and a good tech base to get going, but it seems like they'd prefer a partnership with Samsung or TSM if they can make one happen. It's pretty clear the US has chosen the partnership path (and makes sense given the geo-political connections to South Korea and Taiwan)."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Strategically, there will always be benefits to TSMC's flagship plants staying in Taiwan.

Politically, that also gives them plenty of power. If an offensive nation was to make moves that risk the global supply of high performance semi-conductors, the world would have little choice other than to be involved. So China kicking off against Taiwan would, in my opinion, quickly escalate to involving the Western powers who rely so heavily on Taiwanese semi-conductor exports. That's why keeping TSMC's main capacity in Taiwan makes so much sense for Taiwan - they get 'free' protection.

Just my opinion/perspective though. Politics is crazy!"

03/14/2021,stocks,">I just don‚Äôt want to waste all of my time,

I think it's probably a waste of time. I can think of three successful investors who give little or no time to chart analysis. 

in Ken Fisher's book *The 100 Minds that Made the Market*, he calls technical analysts ""witch doctors."" it's little better than astrology in his opinion, because there are so many variables you never know for certain if you're correct or not. maybe your chart was wrong, and just a little more adjustment or data will fix it...

In the book *The Most Important Thing*, Howard Marks writes how technical analysis is nowhere near as important as it used to be for professional investors.

In Peter Lynch's books, the only major examination of charts is to explain show a concept he developed IIRC: a chart with the earnings line and share price on the same chart, and buying when the share price drops to or below the level of the earnings line. 

Marks and Fisher both manage about $150 billion at their respective firms, and have decades of experience. Lynch is the single most successful mutual fund manager of all time, who averaged almost 30% a year with bottom-up analysis of individual companies. 

if you poke around on Google Scholar, there's simply no real data that's technical analysis reliable in general. maybe it's helpful in a few narrow situations, but that's about it."

If you want to have any confidence in your result you cannot just test all the possible strategies.

03/14/2021,stocks,"I have a few questions and some advice:

1. It took you 1 whole year and new ath's to get enough FOMO to put the money back into the market?

2. Why are you still trying to time the market if you already experienced that you can't?

3. Why are you investing your parents money if you are asking basic questions about investing to strangers on the internet?

I don't want to offend you, but it seems to me like you are so dead inside that you refuse to learn about your mistakes.


My advice:

1) Re-evaluate your risk tolerance. You should never get into a situation where you sell at the bottom of a crash, for any reason whatsoever. This includes considering not investing your parents money. It feels like you are already overwhelmed with investing your own money. Think about what it will do to your mental health if you fuck up your parents retirement. This should not be your burden to bear.

2) Set up a DCA plan for an assets that fits your risk tolerance. If it is an ETF, individual stocks or anything else purely depends on your risk tolerance. 

3) Stop worrying. It's only money. Being emotional about investing not only fucks you up in the long run, but also leads to bad decisions. So maybe it's you that needs protection from yourself. Sounds stupid I know, but if you stick to a plan it might help."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You aren't alone in your stupidity. Not a lot of people who made the same mistake are on reddit. If they are they are probably not posting about their mistake. The reason stocks tanked so hard is because so many people sold. Most of the people giving you advice on reddit will be ones who didn't have much to lose during the Covid crash or got in after and call you an idiot. Good on you for admitting your mistake. I have a bit of remorse over what could have been in 2020 as well. 

I had almost my whole 401k in really conservative plays through 2019. I was locked in for a heavy pull back. Slept better having it there. I also had a lot of cash from a house sale and stayed out waiting for a big dip. 

After the new year started in 2020 I said screw it, timing the market is impossible. I moved everything back into aggressive plays and a lot into REITs. I had the cash in a money market account for 1.5% and left it for 12 months. Covid crash hit a month after I moved everything and I kept saying ""HOLD!"" DON'T WATCH. I saw about 30 percent disappear and it made me sick. Once I saw the bottom come (you just knew it was the bottom) I moved everything in my 401k into a tech growth fund knowing it was the only logical play. It gained 38 percent and if I wouldn't have touched it at the bottom it would have stayed there. REITs didn't recover. 

My cash (which was the same amount as my 401k) never moved through all of it. Granted I didn't lose it but I didn't gain much. I could have made a years salary on that and instead I'm now trying to enter the market and it's the same frustration you have. 

Your situation is worse but I want you to know you're not alone. A lot of people got scared during the shutdown and the only people you see on reddit are those who were around for the gain. The others have zero interest discussing their mistake or the market in general. I could have held out in my fixed income funds for 2 more months and I would have missed the drop all together. I had already held them for 12 months. There are opportunities everyday to make money. Try to look forward and not back. 

I have been buying dips on stocks that haven't returned to their pre covid levels. I'm trying to get into an index fund but they are at their all time highs. 

Professionals are emotionless with your money so they see clearer. I talked to a couple financial advisors and I wasn't impressed. They basically say ""we have these great funds"" and we will take 1 percent to give you access. Meh. The only benefit is they won't sell if times get rough but I still don't sleep well knowing the stock market is tanking with so much exposure. It doesn't matter who has control of my money. 

Don't put it all in. Buy in 10 percent chunks. It could run for a solid 24 months before we see anything drastic happen or it could start pulling back heavily after the next inflation data exceeds expectations. Nobody knows. For future reference, moving money from one sector to another is a better move then moving to cash. 

One day the bears will have their day. They were starting to during the recent pullback in tech. People were buying dips until they had no cash left and the dips kept coming. It rebounded but at some point it won't and they'll be left waiting for months. That sucks and if you've ever experienced it you know how it sucks. Those that rode the downward trend week after week in 2008 for a year aren't around here for the most part. Yes stocks will recover but sometimes it takes a year or two (or more potentially). 

Anyway, best of luck to you. Try to let it go and look forward. What's done is done. FOMO is real. Don't try to gain it back overnight."

I did something similar except I sold before the crash - had a bad feeling before COVId. And didn‚Äôt buy back in until very recently. So I didn‚Äôt lose much but I also missed the upside because my Chase Private Client ‚Äúpro‚Äù told me not to go back in last April. Not listening to anyone any more. 

I would do a well diversified ETF, like VOO. Even physiologically it is easier to let the money do it‚Äôs thing. 

I have about 25 years till retirement so that‚Äôs where bulk of my money sits. I also have some stocks/dividend plays in my ROTH but that‚Äôs maybe 10% of my total networth.

I am a bit worried about your parents‚Äô time horizon. 5 years is a bit too close for 100% equities... but I wouldn‚Äôt go into bonds either. So that‚Äôs a tough call and I myself don‚Äôt know what I would do. My child is 5 years away from college and I am not putting our 529 back into equities because I can‚Äôt afford to lose what I have there right now. But maybe your parent‚Äôs retirement is different if they can postpone it if things go sour. I don‚Äôt have that option with college.  That‚Äôs my big chunk in cash and it will remain in cash."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Invest in safe, blue chip stocks. Don‚Äôt go gambling your parents retirement on meme stocks like GME and PLTR. 

Timing the market is impossible, and you‚Äôll almost always lose money if you try. If you‚Äôre nervous about an ‚Äúimpending crash‚Äù (based on what, I don‚Äôt know) then invest slowly. Every week, buy 5k in stocks till it‚Äôs all reinvested.

Some recommendations of safe stocks with good dividends:

AAPL (discounted heavily at the moment)
DIS
Honeywell
WMT (also discounted)
WM
VOO
VTI
RSP
SBUX
MSFT
JNJ
V
VYM
AXP
UNP
MA
AMZN
NERD
Costco
McDonalds

With these I‚Äôve been able to get min returns of 10-15 percent every year. It‚Äôs a diversified portfolio with many sectors so if one collapses you aren‚Äôt totally fucked. Don‚Äôt have more than 10% in any of these and you‚Äôll be fine long term.

Final piece of advice is the same as the first. Do not gamble on meme stocks. It‚Äôs tempting, but like a siren song, you will most likely find yourself shipwrecked amongst the rocks.

EDIT: I am not a financial advisor. I am an amateur investor- take this info from that perspective."
03/14/2021,stocks,"What I would do (not advice, dont sue me etc.):

-take 75% and DCA it over the next year every 2 weeks.  The other 25% is in case there is a huge unforeseen crash, at which point, lump that in.  Some people recommend 1 and 3 weeks into the month, the theory being there are bumps due to paychecks on the 15th and last day, not sure myself on this.

- put around a third into high dividend stocks or etfs.  Someone mentioned REITs, those are a good way to get some yield also.

- put a third into total market/sp500 type etfs

- put the rest into growth/tech stuff.  It got hammered recently and while it may fall further, you wont know the exact bottom.

Finally, if you want to squeeze a little more yield out of everything, try reading up in selling/writing options, particularly the wheel strategy, or even just covered calls.  Youll risk giving up some growth but itll reduce volatility, which in your fragile state is something to avoid now.  There is a fund called QYLD whichll basically do this for you.  Best of luck."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you are afraid for another pull back, you could try dollar cost averaging. Invest 10k per month into index funds or ETFs.

03/14/2021,stocks,Why not DCA your way back into the stocks you feel confident in?
03/14/2021,stocks,"First off, it's hard to admit when you fucked up. That's the first step and it's a big one. Kudos to you. 

I would look at this as two buckets. One is $100k (parents) and the other is $80k (you). 

It's hard to say what you'd need to do for your parents because there's no other information such as if they have any income, assets, age and lifestyle. If you want to represent a 60/40 split you can easily do this with a total stock market and a total bond market fund. There's plenty of choices out there but to keep it simple I'd go with either VTWAX (total world) or VTSAX (total US) for equities and VBTLX for bonds.

As for your money, I'd be 100% equities in either of the funds mentioned. Not sure if your parents money is in separate accounts but if not you could use an ETF for stocks to keep your funds separated. (VTI or VT). I'd have dividends be reinvested. You could literally log out of your account and not look at it until you're ready to reduce equities exposure and still earn market returns which will beat most of us dabbling in individual stocks over the course of a few decades.

EDIT: I would lump sum invest. Going with DCA will likely leave room for FUD to kick in and maybe you don't follow the plan. Plus lump sum has shown to have better returns than DCA.

EDIT2: I'd highly recommend you read /r/bogleheads because you're going to get a lot of, shall I say suboptimal advice here given your situation. At the very least it'll provide an additional sounding board for you to base your decisions from.

EDIT3: based on the downvotes and what's being upvoted it tells me many of y'all here haven't been investing very long and don't understand the context by which OP is coming from with trying to time the market and being unclear on the best path forward. Hopefully OP doesn't take feedback in this post too seriously.

There's different investing strategies for different people at different stages of their lives. I'm not proposing to go the bogleheads route indefinitely, which is completely fine if you did want to and is probably ideal for most. I myself own about 40% of my portfolio as individual stocks."

03/14/2021,stocks,"I think a good option would be mreit's. They are still underpriced due to (IMO) overblown fears of a mortgage crisis. Note that mreit's are different from REIT's in that they invest in mortgages, not actual properties. 

They make their money through the spread on long-term vs short term. This is actually a good thing ATM since long-term rates are set to rise while short term borrowing is still easy and cheap. 

The safest choices would be AGNC and NLY, both of which have very little credit risk due to having mortgages backed 100% by the government. AGNC is the safest at a 8.7% yield, NLY has more credit risk but also a higher 10% dividend. 

I would not be surprised if they increase dividends this year. Refinance risk has gone down as well since mortgage rates are rising. 

Dividend aristocrats like T are also great plays. They've moved sideways for years and they are likely to continue holding steady, especially with 5g expansion and HBO max supporting their revenues. 7% yield that won't make you rich, but also won't blow your portfolio up.

I would put the rest into SPY since it has a 1.5% yield as well as a good chance of ending the year higher than it is now.

Note this is not what I'm personally invested in, since I have a 25 year horizon (mostly in growth atm, though I do have 15% in mREIT's and 10% in value)."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Wow. Everyone is saying market at all time highs so I think now is not the time to get itchy and dump it back in. If we get another dip in March, you should put some in, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it all. 

This is a real problem for anyone when you‚Äôve got a huge chunk of money to invest all of the sudden and avoid losses because it‚Äôs harder to dollar cost average in and avoid a big drop. 
So maybe put your toe in by buying a very small amount in March...like 1%. I would put it in dividend stocks as they need income. So buy a nice dividend yielder on a down day. Try something like t, Bti, ko. Those haven‚Äôt had a huge run up like amazon, so don‚Äôt feel too guilty you‚Äôve lost out. Ko is still a little under because of closed events, so it could still see mild growth. T under 30...particularly in 28 range and you shouldn‚Äôt have too much volatility. You won‚Äôt have a lot of growth, but at their age they shouldn‚Äôt be in all in on equity growth stocks anyway. When you buy hit ‚Äúdo not reinvest dividends‚Äù. This way going forward you can give them dividend income without having to draw down and sell off equities. For etf yielders  you can look at fra, pty. But again, you want to dca into anything as these could have losses if fed raises rates. 

Then dollar cost average a small percent of parents into growth stocks. But near retirement and with such a small amount saved for retirement, you can‚Äôt gamble wildly at their age as they have no time to recoup losses. So dollar cost average in a small amount into ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if a company like amazon is growth anymore. It‚Äôs a very expensive stock in a fairly mature company that pays no dividend but it‚Äôs not going away either.  You can try buying ‚Äúslices‚Äù like you can on a site like Schwab-$50 bucks a time. You might try something like pltr, but again...this is not a stable stock. Lots of volatility so gambling a whole nut in it likely to result in pain. Allocate a small percentage to growth and dca in. 

Look at the M1 money supply. The savings rate is higher than ever. A LOT of people are sitting on cash. The reserve banks are printing like mad. You‚Äôre not the only one in this situation. All you can do is try and avoid making another mistake and dumping it all in at once. Set some goal that you‚Äôre going to dollar cost average in a certain amount each month over the next 12 months unless we get a huge down day. Don‚Äôt be reactionary and let your past mistake push you to into the arms of another. A lot of people ‚Äúwake up‚Äù in this situation at 50 or 60 and think ‚Äúnow is the time to save for retirement‚Äù and try to make up for it and go heavy into crazy pure plays. 

As always, I‚Äôm not an advisor. This is only opinion and you have to do your own research."

03/14/2021,stocks,"1. I most likely have deeper underlying issues, I didn't technically sell everything at March, just wanted to simplify the post but what I did had essentially the same effect. I had only started ""investing"" at the beginning of 2018. I had 70k to deploy but only put in 10k due to everything at ATH. I guess my market timing tendencies started back then. I wanted to deploy the rest after a pull back or crash. Stopped paying attention to the market shortly after and didn't even realize the market pulled back in December of 2018. So 60k cash sat in a 0% brokerage for 2 years. Then came 2020. The sentiment on reddit was that the sky was falling so not only did i not go long, i decided to go short with a leveraged inverse ETF at about 15k at literally the bottom on March 23. Then sunk cost fallacy came in, i kept hoping the short would recover so did not go long. I kept thinking, how can markets recover to pre-covid levels when the pandemic was still raging. I had only sold the short recently at a 80% loss. 
2. I guess I just cant accept the fact that going back in now would be essentially locking in my losses. And this just dragged on and on till today. I keep telling myself, why buy in now when you didnt when everything was half off. All this bubble talk lately also led me to believe we are due for a correction. 
3. My parent's investments only sat in a mutual fund for years, they stopped contributting so it was only the initial lump sum amount. I had the bright idea to sell the mutual fund and buy back the equivalent ETF so we can save on the MER. I think the idea was good but the execution was terrible. Again due to the sunk cost on my short, i keep thinking the market would crash again and I can buy back the ETF at a lower price. My greed has instead costed us dearly."

Heck, I also went short at the most stupid time in march while the major drop basically already happened and didn't buy the correction. I was way too emotional and turned my put-hedge into an oversized short and almost bought no stocks at all. Luckily I only sold a few stocks at the beginning of the correction and kept the rest for almost the whole year. (Tesla carried my ass so hard it is ridiculous.) So, I had to learn it the hard way, too. Don't listen to the masses. Make a strategy and stick to it. It is too hard to predict what the market will do and it will drive you crazy.   


One last thing: I know a lot of people that are really good at reflecting about their own behavior and what is wrong, but then do nothing about it. I sometimes have the same problem. For me it feels like changing my behavior would imply admitting my mistake, but my pride somehow keeps me from doing that, even though I can clearly see my mistakes. What I try to do now is that I try to find patterns in my mistakes. It is crazy how biased the human mind is. Then I try to be as rational as possible and think about how I can adapt my behavior to prevent the same mistakes from happening again.   


It seems like you are already doing a good job at analysing your mistakes. Now you only need to learn from them (adapt your behavior). I know all of this is not a concrete tip how best to invest, but in my opinion the biggest enemy in investing is yourself. So, any knowledge you get about yourself (as a human and as a person) makes you a better investor. So yeah, keep it up, you are on the right path! I wish you all the best!"

03/14/2021,stocks,Haha something about sending passive aggressive comments into the nether just comes so easily sometimes
03/14/2021,stocks,"It is done very frequently and it is 100% legal. The reason it isn‚Äôt done all the time is because there is a $15,000 annual cap per person or $30,000 per couple. 

So let‚Äôs say you have a half a million dollars and you want your son to inherit it. If you give him all of it while you‚Äôre alive or in your will, he pays taxes on it. If you give him a tax free $15,000 gift every year for 33 years while you‚Äôre alive, he gets every penny of the half a million dollars tax free. If you were trying to give him 20 million dollars tax free, it would be impossible."
03/14/2021,stocks,"No, original purchase price transfers to new owner. So recipient would pay tax on gains from sale which would be sell price - gifters original purchase price. 


Similar concept however is donating to charity. If you donate a stock the total value is the donation and the gifter avoids tax on gains and gets a donation credit. The recipient would have tax implications but assuming they are a proper charity in the eyes of the irs it could still be a favorable. this compared to selling and using proceeds to donate."
03/14/2021,stocks,"It is also a good way of donating money to a charity, most smaller charities will not do it because of the hassle.

The benefit is if you have a stock that goes from $1k to $5k if you had sold you would have gotten that $5k minues the taxes on $4k of gains.  Giving the stock you get tax credit for giving $5k and never had to pay the taxes.

The amount of deduction changes if you held the stock for short or long term before donating it."

03/14/2021,stocks,"The receiver never pays taxes, only the giver. $15k is a yearly exclusion, any amount above it gets deducted from the lifetime exclusion, currently at 11.7 millions. For practical purpose, the average person never has to worry about gift or estate taxes."
03/14/2021,stocks,I see. Is this limit on howuch you can give or how much you can receive?
03/14/2021,stocks,"So I misunderstood. You don't pay gift taxes as long as it's less than 15k per year. However, you still pay taxes on the gains from the stock as if you were the one who bought it. Thanks for the help!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I just did some reading and what you're saying is the same as what's on investopedia. However, another person says the opposite.

03/14/2021,stocks,You don't pay taxes even if it's more than $15k. You *report* the amount over $15k and it reduces your lifetime exclusion limit. You can give away almost $12 million tax-free.
03/14/2021,stocks,"u/voxtrion (and I also just looked on investopedia and it says the same) says that you still have to pay taxes on it. I'm getting confused, lol."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it's so complicated, lol. I think I get it now, hopefully."
03/14/2021,stocks,Oh I thought you pay the taxes on the amount over the allowed 15k per year. Thanks
03/14/2021,stocks,"Going through comments I am confused as well honestly. Seems like There are two tax events here getting mixed up. 

1) the gift of something of value. Gift tax rules apply, gifter is responsible, annual exception, life time allowance, blah blah gift tax rules. 

2) Selling of a stock received as a gift and determining basis."

Looks like it shot up because an analyst pumped it up..."
03/14/2021,stocks,Nice play!
03/14/2021,stocks,"This has happened to me several times haha.  Leverage those shares by selling covered calls to collect premiums on the higher IV.  I generally sell week long calls on Friday's as the price is rising, usually pretty far OTM where I feel comfortable selling the stock if it does execute or expire ITM.  Then as the stock starts it's climb back down I might turn my perspective to selling puts.  I'll sell the puts at a price I don't mind buying the stock at if it does execute or expire ITM.  All in all your goal is to continue to hold the stock since your long on it, but to make premiums on the upswing and downswing.  The risk is you sell your stock (you still make money) or you acquire more on the puts (which you're long on the stock anyway so acquiring more shouldn't be a bad thing).

Of course, it also depends on the rise.  If the stock sees a 100% return or something way beyond your price target, you might consider selling all together and rebuying once the  stock settles back down.  Just think when you got into that stock you planned to make a nice return in a longer time frame.  You just realized that return in days or weeks, that's also a win, move on and come back later if the value is there.  Nothing wrong with selling winners no matter how much you like the stock, don't get emotionally attached to the stock.  At the end of the day you bought it because you believed the company would make you money and it did."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Info from fintel and nakedshortreport Yes they changed the price target to $14 I believe and it‚Äôs currently under $5. I should rephrase and say that Friday alone, short volume was over 68 million. Fintel has short ratio at 31% percent."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Thank you!!! Those are wonderful ideas. I‚Äôm definitely going to try out that strategy, if not on this stock, on another one. I have done puts on the way down but had not gotten into selling covered calls yet. Makes sense though."
03/14/2021,stocks,"meh, I'm not a fan of them as a company.  I've tried using their product a few times to track some stats and use it for error reporting / tracking from my server logs.

The system seems convoluted and there are a ton of other companies out there which can do the same thing.

Before i saw this post, I had actually thought I'd give them another shot and reinstalled Sumo Logic on my website to track some stuff and then uninstalled it about 5 minutes later.

While the stock might be attractive as far as price goes, I really don't see them doing anything disruptive or which would provide a big growth opportunity in the future.

Just my 2 cents as a web developer."

03/14/2021,stocks,There's a few over here in the UK. They are all a bit of a joke though. Never delivered much. A few letters of intent here and there. A few prototypes around. Used to be big market caps. Everyone's give up on them now pretty much though.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Another issue is that a lot of the investment into graphene is coming from big players like Samsung who stand to benefit from having a strong foothold with the first-movers. If a private company backed by Samsung or a similar juggernaut makes the first breakthroughs in the technology, then the smaller independent players will forever be playing catch-up. 

That said, with the potential for this technology to disrupt nearly every industry there is, the industry late-comers could still prove to be quite lucrative plays. 

Production is still difficult and expensive enough that I think we're still a year or three away from seeing any meaningful advances toward cost effective scalability, so the entire industry is unbelievably speculative for now. I won't be able to put more than about half a percent of my portfolio toward it at this point."

2021-03-14 19:58:27,stocks,"New to the investing world Hi, I‚Äôve just started to try and study into the world of stocks. I‚Äôm 19 and don‚Äôt really have a great deal of complex financial knowledge. However I know my way around statistical analysis to an extent. 

So far I‚Äôve been reading some books and having a go on demo broker accounts to get used to how trading works. 

I think Im mainly looking to invest portions of money each month to hold long term and I‚Äôve seen things such as the S&P 500 as possible ‚Äòsafer‚Äô ways of doing this. But I also want to try investing in other things as well. 

Any advise of how you first started off or some tips would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Don't get too excited or FOMO'd into investing all in one go. Stick with your dollar cost averaging. The market is in a weird moment right now with lots of new investors and volatility. Lot's of people saying we're in a massive bubble so be careful. Having 20-30% of your money on the side is a good strategy so that if there is a big dip or crash you can put money in and benefit from the gains that will follow.

Couple of main strategies are growth investing and value investing. I like value investing because I can use metrics to analyse stocks.

I tend to use this as my main way to screen stocks:

PE Ratio (Price to Earnings) **< 25** means stock undervalued

PEG Ratio (Price to Earnings Growth) **< 1** means stock is undervalued

PB Ratio (Price to Book)¬†**< 3** is good

All this info can be found on Yahoo Finance and other sites for free but I would also recommend SimplyWallSt, you can get a free trial to analyse stocks and filter by markets, sectors and these metrics plus much more.

Best strategy is a long term one which you seem to have identified but if you want to try more risky methods as well as your safer S&P500 strategy then there's plenty of trading apps you can use and maybe set aside a portion of your money that you want to use for these manual  trades.

Remember to be diversified, it will limit your gains but it will also limit your losses. Keep educating yourself, you seem like you're on the right track. Far too many people getting involved as a get rich quick plan, which is the total wrong way to go about things.

Choose a strategy, stick to it, stick to your ratios of how much money you're going to invest. Take your profits at certain targets. You've only made a gain or loss once the trade is closed. In general holding for a long time will get you gains but if you're going for a more day trading route you need to set targets for taking profits.

Eg. you buy a stock at 50$ and you think it's fair value is 100$, there's nothing wrong with taking profits at 60/70/80/90$"
03/14/2021,stocks,"My advice. Focus on companies with no debt. Make sure the business has revenue. Read the first dozen pages of the annual report and accounts. Only ever invest in businesses with products you can understand. Never invest in a company whose management team are based in a developing market. Look at the gross margin..stay away from anything too low... it means its a low quality business.

If you do all that... atleast you know you are looking at a proper business.

Finally look at the market cap. Exponential growth means nothing if the market cap is too high. I'm afraid that just comes from experience though."
03/14/2021,stocks,I started with mutual funds like recommended in /r/bogleheads then moved into more direct equities and ETFs.  I suggest splitting between low-maintenance funds and direct trading so you have a backup if you screw up the latter.

03/14/2021,stocks,"No worries man, best of luck with it!

Lots of good YouTube channels you can learn a lot from too, would recommend PensionCraft, Andrei Jikh, Graham Stephan, Damien Talks Money.

Not read these books but heard good things about them, The Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham and One Up On WallSt by Peter Lynch.

Definitely try out SimplyWallSt, best stock screener I've found and very reasonably priced, there's other analyst companies like Zacks and Motley Fool but I love the layout of SimplyWallst and the free trial makes it worth giving it a go, found it very helpful as a beginner.

Another strategy people invest in is Dividend investing where companies essentially pay you a passive income for just being invested with them, usually companies that have had such huge past success that they can give money back to investors. The counter argument to this is that they're not reinvesting the money back into the business so their growth might be limited, but if it's a massive company anyway that's probably why they choose to pay dividends since their growth potential isn't going to be as big as a smaller market cap stock. There's a lot of noise and info out there so it can be difficult to choose a strategy or method. You don't have to stick with one though, you can have a couple of strategies.

A well diversified portfolio should have 40-80 stocks but I like having \~100.

If you look at the breakdown section on this Vanguard ISA fund

[https://www.trustnet.com/factsheets/o/acdv/vanguard-lifestrategy-100-equity-a-acc](https://www.trustnet.com/factsheets/o/acdv/vanguard-lifestrategy-100-equity-a-acc)

You can see how they've diversified the portfolio 45% in USA stocks, 22% in UK stocks etc.

Then in sectors they have 17.2% in Information Technology, 14% in financial companies etc..."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah there‚Äôs so much to learn. I‚Äôll be sure to check out the channels as well as SimplyWallSt. Definitely not going to make a decision on anything until I‚Äôm well educated on it.

2021-03-14 19:35:16,stocks,"Stocks vs Options. Is it possible to make good money buying stocks or are options the only way to go. Greetings and salutations, 

It seems to me that any gain porn I've ever seen comes from people becoming millionaires in the space of 1-3 years by trading options. Being relatively new to stocks and trading, I've bought into a few stocks here and there but the only feasible way to great gains (and equally great losses) is through options. 

Am I wrong?"

03/14/2021,stocks,I do stocks for long-term investments rather than letting my extra money sit in a savings account. I do  options strictly for fun. I set aside money I‚Äôm OK with losing and roll the dice. It‚Äôs like going to Vegas without having to leave my home.

Huge confirmation bias. For all the gain porn you see there'll be plenty more that have loss porn but just don't share it because why would you admit to losing money?

I own some leaps that give me access to 200 shares for the same price I was paying to hold 50 shares of stock, and the expected price movement and time horizon are similar in both cases.

03/14/2021,stocks,"There isn‚Äôt a real stock vs options when it comes to profit. It really depends on the risk you are willing to take and the amount you have to invest. 

I always felt stock and options play together for profit. I don‚Äôt like a lot of risk, so I mostly use options to make additional income off the stock I own, if you own 100 shares you can sell a call for the premium. Free money with low risk, the risk is if it ends up ITM you basically lose your stock at strike price but you keep the premium in either case. I think of it as way to lower my cost basis. Every time you keep a premium it lowers your cost of the initial investment.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Stocks better than option in long run. Option works well for volatile stocks , however timing it is important. Majority of my losses in option is they expired 1 to 2 weeks before projected move."
03/14/2021,stocks,"don't forget that ""options"" is an INCREDIBLY broad term with many different levels to it.

you can absolutely make huge gains with normal shares and without touching options. (just look how much money someone would have now if they put $5k into TSLA in early 2020). it's just harder to make big gains, ESPECIALLY if you don't have a ton of capital to put into a company that you think might double or 3x in a couple years.

i was EXTREMELY confident disney was going to skyrocket from the $90/share it was going for a year ago, but it's not like i could simply say ""ok, i'm going to put $200k into this and next year my money will double and i'll have $200k of profit"". 

think of it this way, there's a big difference between a 100% rate of return on $1k than there is on $100k. it takes money to make money. now don't be discouraged by that, because with compounding growth, shares are going to grow over time and you'll typically end up with much more than you put in, it's just  not necessarily ""get quick rich and retire in 2-3 years"" for most people with normal income/savings.

on simple options (covered calls, possibly some puts), there's a lot of capability for someone to take their holdings and enhance those gains. you're not doing anything high risk like some option strategies, you're just saying ""hey, i'll take $100 from you now, and if these 100 shares that i paid $35 for go up over $50, i'll sell them for $50 no matter what they cost. you win either way because either it doesn't strike and you keep the premium, or it does strike and you made a profit on your investment.

if the idea of options make you uncomfortable, just ignore them and pretend they don't exist. you can make a solid return without them just from share growth and dividend payouts. if you do want to experiment with them, there's nothing wrong with going slow at first. 

i created my first portfolio last march, did my first options trades (covered calls) around the 4 or 5 month mark (july/august), and then now that i'm more comfortable with them i'm starting to get into puts."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Depends on trading style and risk tolerance. With options, it can be very fast downhill, and may not have enough to trade next day. It is not one or another, but a combo so that you can stay in the market long term to reap gains."

03/14/2021,stocks,I see cost basis as cost basis and the covered call is just additional return.  But I see the logic in it.
03/14/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs an interesting way to look at it.

 I think I‚Äôd be hard pressed to find many people who genuinely believe in a company and buy stocks based on that alone assuming the real reason we buy stocks is to turn a profit.

I like your approach but what gets me is that even if you invest in a company you believe in and you lose it all the best your going to get from said company you believed in is a ‚Äútough titties‚Äù response."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Completely ignorant answer here. Options can be used for many things, such as reducing risk or generating an income stream. 

Yes, there are high risk plays with options like selling naked calls but you don't have to do those things."
03/14/2021,stocks,I have been buying ATM AAPL leaps this week and I feel pretty good about them.

03/14/2021,stocks,"If I had learned options right after the pandemic caused the crash, I would hold that I would be a millionaire today.  I've seen 236% growth overall on just holding stocks over the past year.  Recently started trading with leaps and longer dated options and collecting premiums.  That 200% growth could have been leveraged with options and been a 10X return.  It was pretty much a guarantee after the crash that all stocks were going one direction (up).  I would have made the same decisions I made but with much more leverage for higher returns."
03/14/2021,stocks,Called LEAPs and yes good. Could also sell Shorter duration CCs OTM over them üòâ
03/14/2021,stocks,I'm up on 13 out of my first 14 contracts.  But the one that was down was *really* down.
03/14/2021,stocks,"My first 3 were leaps, did well"
03/14/2021,stocks,Peter Lynch is one of the most successful investors and never touched options
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, and they also increase the importance of timing the market a bit, which is also more gamble-y. Otherwise, with a 2-year time horizon, you don't time the market, you just get in and hold. I changed all my shares for leaps on Monday afternoon, so my timing worked out nicely. One of them is NXPI, which just got added to the S&P since then. Lots of luck involved, but at the same time, when I bought the leaps, the premiums were \~25% of the share price, meaning I needed large and growing chipmakers to grow by 25% in 22 months to cover my premium. With the right timing (a gamble-y qualifier), that can be a serious no-brainer.

* NXPI: 20 Jan 2023 170c at 42.40 premium, and it hit 195 in AH following the S&P announcement.
* MRVL: 20 Jan 2023 40c at 10.47 premium, and it's already back up over 47.

Similar, but not quite as awesome numbers for AMD, QRVO, SOXX, SWKS. My timing was good/lucky, but using the ""be greedy when others are fearful"" approach, with Monday's bloodbath following an already-brutal two weeks for tech, converting shares to leaps felt like the way to go, and it's going to pay off much more handsomely than had I just held."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I approach it as both, profit is awesome and the primary goal of course but as a very close secondary I want my money to be... helping in the grand scheme of things. So I try to avoid any fossil fuel stocks or weapon manufactures and try to lean into anything trying for green energy, building up our space infrastructure, curing diseases and all that sorta thing. 

Obviously there is no perfect way to do that. Pretty much anything is going to have some negative impact somehow someway that someone can point to and be like ""you invested in that solar farm!!? don't you know that they forced a little old lady off that land!?"" 

But... baby steps to that Dyson Swarm right? :D"

03/14/2021,stocks,Last 6 weeks is where it has an effect.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I haven't tested my theory much, but I figure with LEAPS you have a greater chance of catching some short-term peak of the stock price for profit - suppose there is that one week a year from now where there is a ton of hype on the stock, and THAT'S the week you would close the contract. You're right, the timing is important and often times my timing has sucked."
03/14/2021,stocks,"In general, don‚Äôt you want to buy options when IV is low? Aren‚Äôt you paying more in extrinsic value?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I have been trading options for less than a week, so keep that in mind as I pretend to dish advice like I know what I'm talking about: 

One way I think you can eliminate the impact of timing is on the back end of the contract. If X represents that golden point of strike price plus premium, and you still have 8 months left on your leap and it has been fluctuating between X plus 10% and X plus 40%, exercising the contract and then selling a few shares at a time on spikes allows you draw out the timing of your exit a bit and spread it across a few peaks. 

I know people like to exit their positions by selling the contract, but so far, I have only bought leaps with the intent of exercising."
03/14/2021,stocks,Ya but payout is bigger too because iv is high. It‚Äôs a 2 way street and I‚Äôm more risk tolerant given my younger age
03/14/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm young too. An underlying that is already high IV is more likely to get lower than even higher (mean reversion). I don‚Äôt think your point about a bigger payout is accurate.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, if statistically stocks are more likely to drop then the calculation for iv would be weighted"

2021-03-14 19:11:08,stocks,"IPO Hype Question In preparation for the Coinbase IPO I started to look into technology or Fintech companies that have IPO'd over the last 10 years. It would seem that many of these companies start higher then their close. In other words, the open price often falls by a couple of percent after a couple of days. 

Historical data seems to indicate this is a trend? Is it a fair statement to expect this behavior? 

Is this why people hold off from buying the first day only to buy a few days later? 

Note* I understand this is part data part speculation. Looking for opinions here."

2021-03-14 19:03:31,stocks,"How much of my portfolio should be ETF Ok relatively new to investing. I am 32 and previously have just had a 401k for about 6 years.  I took about 10 grand and opened an account that I have been slowly buying stocks with. So far I had only about 5k invested. 50% in AAPL, AMZN DIS and 50% in APHA and CHPT.

Basically I am looking to but the remaining 5k into EFT. I figured this would have me at 25% Growth stocks, 25% value stocks and 50% EFT.  The EFTs I am planning to buy (likely next week) are ARKF, ARKF and PRNT (not 100% sure about PRNT yet). Is this a good portfolio model to follow? I plan on adding about 4K-6k a year for now as well as diversifying more. Should I be investing more in value and growth stocks and less in EFT?"
03/14/2021,stocks,It's totally up to you. The higher percentage of your portfolio you put into ETFs the more diversified (aka safer) it's going to be.
03/14/2021,stocks,"The general rule of thumb is that you should keep the majority of your investments in funds as long as you're inexperienced in terms of investing/trading. In other words: if you don't know how to read balance sheets, calculate [insert fancy finance term] ratios and predict prices based on recent news articles, be really careful with regular stonks. Blue chips are your best bet, at least on a long term. I would lower the growth stocks to maybe 10% as - and this is just my personal view (and I'm an idiot) - I think there's a lot of overhyped junk on the market right now. Take a look at the MSCI World ETF by the way, it has mediocre returns but is a safe innvestment for sure"
03/14/2021,stocks,The thing is that long term is very hard to beat the market. If you just invest in an index that follows the sp500 you will have around 12-13% with dividends reinvested. Hard to beat that
03/14/2021,stocks,"an old recommendation is that single stocks should be a minority of your overall portfolio. 10-15% is a common guideline. the bulk of your portfolio should be in low-fee funds or ETFs giving you broad exposure to the US market. I'd look at VOO, VTI, IWB for the core position. the ARK etfs are highly volatile and IMO should not be the centerpiece. there's a strong chance they're gonna come down from the sky-high levels of last year."
03/14/2021,stocks,"ARK is growth ETF so whether you invest in growth stocks or growth ETF is better question.  

If you want value stocks you need to look elsewhere.  but that is a whole different topic.

Unless you have really high conviction on a particular growth stock best to go with ETF imo."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sorry, just realized I wrote ‚ÄúEFT‚Äù a couple times..."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Depends entirely upon your risk tolerance. A sudden life-changing amount of money should certainly be moved into less volatile assets, for example. ETFs also require less effort, for example, if you‚Äôre running an entirely unrelated business and have little time to research on stock picks. 

If you regularly utilize Margin, keeping a fair bit of your portfolio in less volatile assets can also serve as an effective backstop from getting Margin Called during downturns. We‚Äôve probably got bigger problems than a little Margin debt if the VTI drops 50% in a month. üòù"
03/14/2021,stocks,I don‚Äôt even keep tabs on what % of my holdings are an ETF.  I am not sure it‚Äôs important at all.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think it depends on how much time you have to spend researching and how much you enjoy doing it. I think if you're intelligent, have good research and have the time you have a good chance of out performing a standard etf like vti or voo. The more specific etfs take more research but can perform well. Take 50% and put in an etf or two. Take the other half and do some dd on 3-5 stocks and see what did better over a year or so."

03/14/2021,stocks,"That‚Äôs generally true.  

However, SPY or even QQQ are miles ahead as ‚Äúsafer‚Äù than what OP mentioned in ARK.  Investors in ARK commonly refer to it being an ETF and there is safety, and that‚Äôs completely wrong.  ARK can drop 80%, and stay down.  That is very very unlikely for SPY"

Your talking about APHA and CHPT right? I only have a little over 1k in each. So far APHA has almost grown 100% since I bought it.

03/14/2021,stocks,"> I am not sure it‚Äôs important at all.

It can be important to determine if you are too heavily invested in certain sectors.  If you are not looking at everything as a whole I can see this being a flaw and allow yourself to be vulnerable to volatile market swings."
03/14/2021,stocks,Can be. Some etfs are held back by trash companies where you're better off just picking the top 5 that you like
03/14/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs pretty much exactly my strategy as of now. Thanks for the help!
03/14/2021,stocks,Not sure I understand the logic here. I choose ETFs by looking at the holdings and if I like the holdings I buy the ETF.
03/14/2021,stocks,Anything that is not VTWAX is a bet that some portion of the market is going to do better than another.  Even VTSAX is a bet that US based companies will do better.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I have 8% in ARK funds and I've never heard of it being a ""safer"" stock. It's volatile as hell, yes. Higher short term risk as well. If people think it's a disruption proxy of a total market fund they are mistaken. You buy into ARK because you believe in the disruptive technologies as they do. You plan to hold 5+ years and keep your emotional fingers away from the sell button and let them actively manage the funds."
03/14/2021,stocks,On the other hand since your new you could do 90% in a safe etf and 10% to play with while you learn then after you gotten the ropes after a couple months do the split.
03/14/2021,stocks,"My logic is basically, FANG is bad and therefore buying SPY or VTI or VOO is bad.  But there are ETFs I suppose that have companies not run by swamp people."
03/14/2021,stocks,For a big one like SPY I will just look at the top 10 or so companies and if I mostly like the higher weighted ones I buy the etf.
03/14/2021,stocks,I edited my answer on ya. Sorry. I just hope people realize that when they buy an ETF they indirectly invest in companies they wouldn‚Äôt otherwise for moral/ethical reasons. Think of all the people that are against the endless wars in the Middle East but  still buy SPY and therefore are investing in Lockheed or Boeing or Raytheon. There‚Äôs a hypocrisy attached to investing in ETfs thats too often ignored. People actively support institutions theeyre activist against.

However, in this time I‚Äôve also had a decent amount of losses mainly through options. The losses are not significant compared to my capital gains but I was wondering if I‚Äôd still be able to get a some kind of tax break from them. Like for example if I profit 10k off of something but I also suffer a 3k loss off of a completely different trade, am I simultaneously getting taxed and getting a tax break?

You just answered your own question right there. Just pay off your bill. Invest money when you have your bills under control and you actually have extra money.

2021-03-14 18:33:14,stocks,So what about BA? Thoughts So I bought Boeing a couple weeks ago around 200 now it‚Äôs up quite a bit. So I am kind of new to investing and I will switch from individual stocks to etfs soon but I really don‚Äôt know how high it can go? are there ways to predict it? Obviously no one can accurately predict it but what would be your range of high?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I bought the first dip under 440, which was (25) 374, and I held even at a 70% loss because... it‚Äôs a Boeing and there‚Äôs insane amounts of infrastructure that won‚Äôt let it fail.  $500 stock in 2-3 years; I‚Äôll just hold my shares."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If anyone could predict the stock market they would be rich. It will only go as high as someone is willing to pay. I think it took off because of more MAX orders than cancelations. I have been wheeling it, but also own 50 shares on the side for a 110 price point."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Put some stop loss point below 240 - 250 if you are getting uncomfortable, if it drops there, it's getting sold and you can move your profits elsewhere. On other side, it can certainly hit 300 too, in that case you move the stop loss higher.

It cannot be predicted, but you can make sure you walk away with profits, no matter where it goes. Unless you are long, in that case you might want to ride it for a longer period, with some luck it could reach ATH again."
03/14/2021,stocks,I bought in at $200 myself. All I can say about how high it could  go is that in 2019 BA was  $440 per share.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think BA would be classed under Cyclical shares right now due to the pandemic. I personally would hold on to it (or/and buy more) and ride this out if you can wait. A lot of airlines have deferred orders of planes for the time being but this could change in the next 2-3 years , once immunisation is rolled out globally. My own BA holdings are up 25%. It will go up even more eventually"
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you‚Äôre worried about BA going down you can sell out a portion of your position to lock in some gains. That way, no matter what happens you should be happy. If it goes up you‚Äôre still making money from your remaining position, and if it goes down then thankfully you‚Äôve secured some profits that you can direct elsewhere."
03/14/2021,stocks,That is what I was thinking. But they were doing buybacks thus why the price was so high then. I think I‚Äôll sell low 300s may be. Idk
2021-03-14 18:27:29,stocks,"GoodRX (GDRX) - is a GOOD long-term investment On Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality."
03/14/2021,stocks,"GoodRx really only helps people that need to pay cash for scripts.

I think the US is headed toward more social medicine, so cash for prescriptions will go down. That being said, it will be interesting to see how they adjust to these policy changes.

Their S-1 was interesting, claiming an $800B market cap. Not sure I necessarily agree with their assessment of the cash-pay market. They are moving into telehealth and providing prescription services, much like Roman and Hims. But they are entering a crowded space, esp. with Amazon entering with their telehealth platform."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I disagree, universal healthcare is going to happen eventually which should hurt things like this. I see commercials for this all the time and it seems like it's targeted towards older folks and like you said Amazon, Walmart or companies like hims who actually know how to effectively advertise can squash this if they wanted. Just my opinion"
03/14/2021,stocks,Does anyone here use goodrx instead of Health insurance?  Is it a decent replacement? What doesn't it work for?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would love universal healthcare even if it would hurt my investments but I just think that here in the US so many people are conditioned to think that universal healthcare means we are suddenly in the USSR, so it won't ever happen.

But I actually hope I'm wrong and you're right."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Everything I'm about to say is speculation, but even the day that the US gets true universal healthcare (and I fully believe it's inevitable, even if it takes a while) I would bet it's still going to be watered down in the sense that it will still have significant private sector input. Health insurance companies are just too integrated into our health care system for them to just disappear overnight and the likelihood that centrist politicians would sign off on a system that that eliminates them is slim to none.

Given demographic trends and the rate that the Democratic party has moved in a more progressive direction over the course of the last decade or so I would think the opportunity to pass a real universal healthcare bill will present itself in the next couple of decades, but that opportunity will come before an actual progressive majority takes hold of both the legislative and executive branches (assuming that even happens in the first place). Ultimately the choice will come down to getting it done faster with compromises with the center or waiting long enough to pass Medicare For All in its current form, and the left will most likely compromise on it to get it done faster as long as it gets the basic core objectives met.

There's going to be pushback from legislators in states that employ lots of people in the health insurance industry (which, by the way, is a figure in the low millions) because Medicare For All amounts to tons and tons of people losing their jobs. Which, yeah, redundancy drives a lot of the cost of our health care system and one of the things that makes Medicare For All a cheaper proposition than our current health care system is that it cuts a lot of that fat out of the system, but that still translates to job losses that politicians don't want to be blamed for. Not to mention industry lobbying would go balls to the wall to stop that from happening because their livelihoods would literally depend on it.

I'd put my money into the system we get looking a lot more like ""Medicare Advantage For All"" rather than ""Medicare For All"", mostly because it softens the damage on both those fronts and makes it an easier proposition to get done without the progressive majority needed to pass the pure Medicare For All bill. You still have health insurance companies that won't suddenly have to lay off all their workers, and ultimately for the majority of people that get their health care as part of their benefits from their employers would likely have a similar arrangement. The main difference would be that Medicare would be available to everyone, including the zero premium plans that I imagine would likely be popular among low income households.

Again, all of the specifics of this are speculation but the underlying idea behind all of it is that I'd be hesitant to say that companies like this would necessarily be hurt if the US passed some kind of actual universal healthcare, to the point where I'd still think companies like this will be around for a long time."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sometimes you can get some meds cheaper paying cash with GoodRx discount than using your health insurance. 

Problem with GoodRx is that there is no moat. Amazon recently announced they are coming out with their own version:

https://www-fool-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2020/11/19/why-amazon-pharmacy-is-bad-news-for-goodrx-investo/?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a6&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=16157476391340&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2020%2F11%2F19%2Fwhy-amazon-pharmacy-is-bad-news-for-goodrx-investo%2F

There are also a ton of other competitors (just go into your app store on your phone and type in ""discount medication"" and see how many pop up). I also have GoodRx competitor, Blink, on my phone too."
03/14/2021,stocks,I've used it to get a prescription that my insurance company wouldn't cover. I think they also do pet meds (not 100% sure about that)
03/14/2021,stocks,Sounds interesting. Maybe  I should cancel this health insurance I pay 700 month for
03/14/2021,stocks,"No, just check GoodRx, Blink, etc before you go to the pharmacy and sometimes your medication will be cheaper if you tell them ""I don't want to go thru my insurance and want to use this GoodRx/Blink coupon and pay cash instead."" I prescribe psychiatric medication and this is what I tell my patients."
03/14/2021,stocks,"That's a weird statement to make. GoodRx doesn't replace insurance. It's strictly for meds. Can be useful, sometimes better than copay, depending on the medication. However, prices vary and often the cheapest one is by a pharmacy chain that doesn't exist in the state you live in."
2021-03-14 18:05:34,stocks,"How do I find out if some paper stock certificates are even worth anything?

03/14/2021,stocks,Don‚Äôt throw the paper away. Even if.... There might not be any ownership value.... The paper could also be sold as collectibles.

03/14/2021,stocks,Talk to a broker. Does she or you have a brokerage account with a company that has a local office?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you can call up your broker and ask if you can deposit paper certs into your account.

Never even seen a paper cert but they should have info on the stock so broker can determine what stock (if any) they are now."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Do you currently have a brokerage account set up anywhere?  If so, I would highly suggest talking with them.  

I'm not seeing Tennessee Valley Oil Company as a publicly traded company, but it's possible they merged with Tennessee Valley Authority or someone else throughout the years.

Biden is a moderate (or at least forced to be), so there probably won‚Äôt be huge changes in the military industrial complex and these companies do fine regardless of who is in office.  Clinton and Obama dropped more bombs than Trump Ever did."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I own some of RTX and BAESY which are both in the defense industry to one extent or another. I think both are solid investments but not very strong growth companies. 

I really don't care who is in power in the house, senate or the white house. Basing investments on that is, in my opinion, a fool's game. 

My biggest individual investment today is in DIS because people will always want to be entertained and DIS is a stable company who knows how to show a profit on entertaining you and me. 

In my retirement accounts I favor things like VOO and VTI because stock picking itself often returns less than average profits over time. What pays off today is a loser next year or the year after and nobody can accurately predict when it will turn around."

This isn‚Äôt really different at all from Trump‚Äôs Syria policy, because like I said, there‚Äôs a more generic US policy on national defense that hasn‚Äôt really been pushed back on by any President in our lifetime.

Trump and Obama used missile strikes on war-torn countries (Somalia, Syria, etc) as well, because these places often become pockets for militants, some (many?) are supported by Iran who doesn‚Äôt want a direct war with the US and prefers proxy conflicts to maintain instability in a region where they don‚Äôt want Sunni bloc countries to gain too much power."

03/14/2021,stocks,A war doesn't have to happen for defense stocks to go up. Higher military spending is all that is required. I think tensions with China over Taiwan might be one of the reasons defense stocks would go up. A war is very unlikely but higher military spending is.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Still Trying to drag me into politics? 

Middle easterners aren't ""brown"", there are pretty light skinned middle easterners and others that are much browner. 

And ""Democrats"", really? Is Bush a joke to you?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes otherwise he woulda been like ""yah I just sold that after a 30% gain"""
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you mean higher military spending globally, I agree. However, I just don‚Äôt see how much more the US can spend on its own defense budget, especially after covid."
03/14/2021,stocks,Ha ha ha. He finally dragged you into politics after all!
03/14/2021,stocks,"holy shit this is massive cope lmao. you‚Äôre blocked, fascist"

Don't jump to conclusions."

Saddam was literally a fascist by defenition."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Ha ha, fair enough."
2021-03-14 17:31:05,stocks,"Where do you monitor for the latest breaking company news, that isn't either garbage, or waffle? When it comes to shorting stocks, we know that bad news is often a catalyst for a price drop.

Where do you guys go for the most accurate and instant news? I monitor the news ticker on finviz which updates in real time but there's a lot of guff in there too. Like it just posts all articles, and around half are just nonsense.

What is considered a good media source for business news, and ideally one that springs news on companies that people don't keep an eye on.

Every media outlet going posts an article when Tesla do something, but I want news relating to the kind of stocks that only see interest when they start crashing or mooning."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yahoo Finance is good for tracking company news.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Nothing seems to beat just manually googling and searching twitter for recent announcements.  

I have yahoo finance set up, but any useful news is buried under a wall of dogshit from motley fool."
03/14/2021,stocks,Bloomberg beats everyone by several hours typically.
03/14/2021,stocks,Or waffle? For some reason I feel targeted :p
03/14/2021,stocks,"Ok all the comments here are trash

&#x200B;

The best are Bloomberg Terminal, NOT Bloomberg, It doesn't beat anyone by hours, 2nd best is thomson reuters competitor and equal to them are the MANY twitter accounts and services that scrape boomberg and post their updates to twitter. Twitter in general is very good, definitely can replace everything else with curated twitter accounts

&#x200B;

After that the best paid service is The Fly, and after that probably benzinga and others

&#x200B;

Sometimes I see news in my twitter feed or in the fly and I check the stock price and think, ah I guess its not a big deal since the price is not affected. And then over the next few minuters the price changes. But some price announcements are algo-hit and you cant react in time"
03/14/2021,stocks,I've found barchart dot com to be a great resource
03/14/2021,stocks,We are always behind the insiders. Thus why we set our stop losses and alerts
03/14/2021,stocks,Twaddle or waffle.
03/14/2021,stocks,Have you tried setting Google Alerts for your stock symbols?  You'll still have to filter out some junk but I've found it helpful.
03/14/2021,stocks,Seeking alpha. MarketWatch. TheStreet. You can use their free service.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Schwab's accounts are free, and they have company news section and market maker price forecasts, etc.

(Sorry, I'm GenX, lol)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Seeking alpha - I'm not sure how legit or influenced it is, but it pumps me stuff fast and often. There is a paywall for some content"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Trading news is hard and you will in 90% of the cases be late to the ball. That said I've heard really good things about Benzinga Pro's service. It's quite expensive but if you trade news it might be worth it. More effective and safe approach in my opinion is to take a position when the market correct itself after the bad/good news, since it tends to overreact. Other than that I've notice that Twitter and 'weird' blogs like Zero Hedge often have more original and less mainstream news that I find more interesting."
03/14/2021,stocks,Webull has a news section which is pretty quick with news. Also Twitter.
03/14/2021,stocks,Blackboxstocks uses the fly. Pretty good.
03/14/2021,stocks,finviz puts out a lot of news.
03/14/2021,stocks,MarketWatch as we all learned can see into the future.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Yea, I use yahoo mainly and have alerts set on.

CNBC has been given a bad rap lately, but I sometimes have it passively set in the background to catch breaking news.  Helps out in crisis periods to see what people are panicking into or out of. (And do the opposite)

But like all these, there is a large amount of garbage to look through. I think you get better at it over time (or I might be fooling myself)."
03/14/2021,stocks,"The amount of absolute crap and click bait articles I see advertised by Motley Fool is one of the main reasons I instantly distrusted Motley Fool right out the gate.

03/14/2021,stocks,Bloomberg TV is available on YouTube for free
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, it's a subscription service. $35/month. I mostly use it for Bloomberg TV, plus the pre market and after hours briefings, and to keep up with rates for commodities, futures, and bonds."
03/14/2021,stocks,If you're a Goldman Sachs ML algo with terminal access even best.
03/14/2021,stocks,Seconded. Would like to know as well.
03/14/2021,stocks,Well that is of course impossible to know. A good start is to do these kind of trades on companies that you like and have done some analysis on. If you dont wanna do that and do momentum trades then the only recommendation would be to watch the price action like a hawk.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> ‚ÄúThe markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,‚Äù said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. ‚ÄúI think the message is going to be consistent.‚Äù
*****
> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% ‚Äî its highest level in more than a year.
*****
> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year ‚Äî deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,‚Äù said Peters of PGIM.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there‚Äôs going to be pressure on rates moving higher.‚Äù
*****
> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
> # Growth vs. cyclicals
> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhen rates are very low, valuations don‚Äôt matter to people,‚Äù said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
> ‚ÄúIf rates are low, there‚Äôs no penalty,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve seen here.‚Äù
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he‚Äôs found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe names that I‚Äôm in ‚Äî Visa, GM, Ford, Macy‚Äôs, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.‚Äù
*****
> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
> ‚ÄúRate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,‚Äù Redler said. ‚ÄúLast week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‚ÄòWas that it?‚Äô‚Äù
*****
> ‚ÄúNext Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúRates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday‚Äôs lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.‚Äù
*****
> Apple‚Äôs stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market‚Äôs gains last year.
*****
> ‚ÄúWatch Apple because it‚Äôs a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,‚Äù Redler said.
*****
> # Bond volatility
> There is some important data in the coming week, including February‚Äôs retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank‚Äôs leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
> The program expires March 31.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,‚Äù Peters of PGIM said.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe markets are kind of divided on what‚Äôs going to happen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.‚Äù
*****
> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre going to see these whippy moves.‚Äù

> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

> March‚Äôs option expiration week performance is second only to December‚Äôs and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ‚Äôs track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March‚Äôs quarterly options expiration.

> # Signs of Life in Europe?

> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

> While we don‚Äôt think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. ‚ÄúWe remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúHowever, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.‚Äù

> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

> We‚Äôve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market‚Äôs technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior ‚Äì and likely to do so for some time to come.

> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today‚Äôs stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week‚Äôs technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

> # Versatile Outperformers

> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great week and month ahead r/stocks."
03/14/2021,stocks,"My apologies to all here at r/stocks for not having this thread up yesterday! Admittedly, I have been having a ton of issues of late posting these threads in here due to r/stocks A/utoM/od which keeps flagging my posts as s/pam due to some certain key words that are b/anned on this sub. I tried to post this in here a couple times yesterday but did not work. Then tried again this morning, but the same results initially at least, until just now when I think I managed to remove whatever k/eyword that kept tripping up the A/utoM/od in here. Hope you all are having a great weekend up to this point and have remembered to set your antique clocks an hour forward this AM. Happy Daylight Saving Time Day. :P

Have a great trading week ahead r/stocks!! :)"
03/14/2021,stocks,Just buy tech at dips and hold.  I refuse to buy banks and cruise lines.  Tech is not going away.
03/14/2021,stocks,I wish I understood any of this...
03/14/2021,stocks,"So when does something switch sectors? You look at a company like SQ who started of as a payment platform but now is starting banking services, has investment services, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they start providing loans. Maybe they already do. At some point they are going to be a more tech focused JP Morgan. Does a committee of some kind decide ‚Äúok we are switching them from tech to financials‚Äù?"
03/14/2021,stocks,I would just love a normal week. I can‚Äôt remember the last time my portfolio was up two days in a row.
03/14/2021,stocks,"""You know that tech stock we talked about? I picked up 500 shares.""

""You get in at a good price?""

""Oh yeah. I saved about 2 cents on the bid-ask, though I did pay about three times what the thing's actually worth.""

*credit: ‚Å†@hussmanjp*"
03/14/2021,stocks,Thank ya kindly!
03/14/2021,stocks,"This article sums up nicely why I think markets will still boom for another couple of months. Also the DJIA and NASDAQ have similar volatility levels over the month of March, confirming flow of capital out of tech and into cyclicals/industrials  


 [Why ARKs Cathie Wood is still bullish on Tech](https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/why-arks-cathie-wood-is-still-bullish-on-tech-a866b634f94c)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"This is the big one for me:""The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank‚Äôs leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending. ""

If they reinstate this policy, then the massive influx of stimulus checks deposited into banks and new debt taken on is going to MASSIVELY inflate the banks books and they will be required to hold a percentage of that capitol.  This is going to drive money out of the markets and yields much higher.  There's no way I can see the FED letting this lapse, I see an extension coming for it which should temporarily relieve some fear and might even drop the yield price.  But if they don't extend it, then I think that sends banks into a panic to come up with capitol.  The next couple weeks are looking to be pretty volatile, I'm mostly cash at the moment and will probably start getting back in after the FED announces the policy change or extension.  I know some banks are calling to make the relief permanent but I don't see that happening either.  At some point this issue will have to be dealt with along with many others (corporate debt, government debt, mortgage delinquencies, inflation and rising costs of just about everything, etc.).  I know it's clich√© but I really feel like we're setting ourselves up for another roaring 20s into another depression era to follow.  History does like to repeat itself."
03/14/2021,stocks,Does Viacom have more room to run?

03/14/2021,stocks,What software is used in the screenshot?
03/14/2021,stocks,Is the FOMC meeting press release going to cause yet another panic selloff Thursday morning?

03/14/2021,stocks,"FDX is set to hit liftoff again. I've been in on FDX for a while (only 14 shares now) and used to work in ecommerce/logistics, and the company is in a good financial position to take advantage of continued pro-ecommerce macro trends"

03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks for putting all this together!
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks for all you do
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well put together, lot of useful information and several links. Helps me get a head start and then double down with my own DD. One of my must reads every weekend. Thank you for sharing."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks for the run-down.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Let's band the AM that is pulling your post down 

Thanks for all the work."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Same.... for the life of me. I rather average on my apple shares than purchase oil, cruise  travel, bank....
I know in the long run. I will get more return with my growth stock."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Bought cruise lines, casinos, and airlines at the bottom of COVID dip. CCL is up total 207% for me today (close to YTD) and RCL is up 148%. Not buying in anymore now, but I am for sure holding. I think that industry will recover BIG. People want to get out and travel post COVID. Right now (14 March) on the Gulf Coast during spring break, every, and I mean EVERY hotel is booked between LA to FL (check Expedia). I think that is a signal of things to come. Do I think you should get in now? IDK that's your call, however I wouldn't rule cruise lines completely out in terms of growth potential in the near term from the current price. There could be a surprise boom on the horizon."
03/14/2021,stocks,Agreed. And with the article out today that Carnival says cruise lines have 2 more years of rough waters ahead of them (pun intended) I‚Äôm especially staying away from those.
03/14/2021,stocks,AAPL MSFT LRCX etc
03/14/2021,stocks,Neither is travel. It's still on a big discount and I've been flipping them over and over this entire time. It will eventually rebound so if you like to buy and hold long term it's a no brainer. Just dca and enjoy the free money in a few years.
03/14/2021,stocks,Apes together
03/14/2021,stocks,"Nobody knows nothing. The ""market"" and maybe market makers scare everyone into thinking tech is now BAD.  Then Cramer and CNBC crew tell you to start selling tech and put your money in value etfs.

Then they send in El-erian after a rally to say that things are frothy and the market is gonna crash.

Cramer tells you now to sell faangs cause they're overvalued.  Then 2 weeks later he'll tell you the faangs are where you need to be. 

Same old crap, different week."
03/14/2021,stocks,"New to stocks, so take this with a grain of salt. But I feel this is the importance of DD. So many companies are doing so many different things that apply to multiple sectors. TSLA is electric cars, renewables, and automation, for starters. AAPL is working on automated vehicles. Even a supposed 'boomer' company like DE works on AI in agriculture. It makes investing tricky, but also exciting if you like researching trends."
03/14/2021,stocks,"FYI SQ has already announced plans to start small business loans. I think it happens when natural transition opportunities present themselves. SQ has cultivated loyal customers who were getting screwed by Mastercard/Visa for decades. Directly giving those customers loans is such a natural move, that will require little changes to how they do business."
03/14/2021,stocks,Stocks don't care about your portfolio.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Again with the near-term thinking ""look at the current valuation though"" argument style...

Tech investment isn't about competition over a current product and market to be valued per their share of the market today.Tech is about creating and participating in new market domains that wholely or partially aren't even present yet.

Take the most talked about tech ticker of the days TSLA. Was there a large scale EV market before TESLA? No. There is now though, and now the talk is all about ""they are going down because VW etc"". They will have competition in the EV market sure, but TSLA is focusing on autonomous driving now and this is bound to create new market domains.
Who's to know how much these will be worth and by when exactly? How do the critics apply something that isn't even fully shaped yet to valuation predictions? They don't.

Tech investment is like that as a whole. It's about whether the ppl running the company are capable and driven and have a track record of success."
03/14/2021,stocks,"What a stock is worth is what people will pay for it. Just look at gme and tsla. And possibly others. Hell look at cruise lines. The key is to sell before the share price reaches it's ""true"" value."
03/14/2021,stocks,How does one learn the intricate knowledge of finance without majoring in finance?
03/14/2021,stocks,Interesting. What would you like to see them announce on Wednesday? I feel like their ultimate priority at the moment is to avoid getting trapped in a financial negative feedback loop - damage control mode.
03/14/2021,stocks,110+ this week
03/14/2021,stocks,Wow... What in the world happened with VIA? I missed the boat on this one.
03/14/2021,stocks,Like what? Just increased volumes?
03/14/2021,stocks,I think it‚Äôs finviz
03/14/2021,stocks,What about UPS?
03/14/2021,stocks,Not a good idea mate
03/14/2021,stocks,Really bad idea. Tesla is on a hard recovery course.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Right.  From what I've heard banks have never done well or at least not for over a decade.  I still don't think they'll do well.  Maybe this year they may though.

They want us to sell MSFT and AAPL and PYPL NVDA and put it in KO PEP HON and JNJ lol! Value probably WILL do well this year just because everyone is dumping tech and buying value etfs.

But do people seriously think value is going to beat out tech in 5 or 10 years?"
03/14/2021,stocks,">Bought cruise lines, casinos, and airlines at the bottom of COVID dip. CCL is up total 207% for me today (close to YTD) and RCL is up 148%.

Well nearly everything is from the lows of March. Retail, cannabis, tech, oil, you name it. 

Cruise lines were probably the riskiest bet and you risked that for nothing really when you could have gone in a number of other industries and made the same return."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'm mostly in JETS.  Very low risk but high upside.  Like you said, cruise and airlines are pretty much the only 2 industry left to recovery to their pre-covid price.  With the equity market flooded with capital compared to pre-covid, I see both sector reaching new high by next year.  Assuming  no black swan event."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I hope so but watch the covid numbers start rising this summer then everyone will run for cover again unless they don't mind getting sick and having lung issues for the next 5 years.

We're NOT post covid.  That won't be for many more years.  People are fooling themselves.  I WON'T be going inside restaurants ANY TIME SOON thanks.

No cruises, large events, etc ..... No thanks!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don't think people are gonna be lining up to go on cruises this summer like everyone thinks.  We're also not running back to large events and restaurants and the offices any time soon.

They're blowing the ""reopening"" thing out the window.  I doubt things are going to be as good as everyone thinks this summer.

Of course I HOPE , but I have my doubts."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think that is just the company preparing for uncertainty, but I think even the company is going to be surprised at the number of people wanting to sign up for cruises this year. It's a regional mentality thing, and I can tell you the SE region of the US is almost pretending COVID isn't happening. I wager all the cruises out of Mobile AL and FL are going to be booked up this summer/fall. If not to max, then to higher than expected capacity. To me, the spring break hotel bookings (this weekend) on the Gulf Coast are a huge signal of this regional mentality."
03/14/2021,stocks,I mean maybe? That seems outside the scope of this topic tho. I‚Äôm speaking more about the mixing of ‚Äútech‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-tech‚Äù and it‚Äôs increasing difficulty to classify. As this blurring continues posts like OPs will be more difficult to find trends (like this post is supposed to do). It will also effect passive investing because sector etfs are built off this outdated classification system.
03/14/2021,stocks,This is accurate
03/14/2021,stocks,I just think the techification of everything is blurring lines. Is Uber a tech platform or a consumer defensive? Is Amazon a consumer cyclical or is it tech (with AWS). There are so many more examples. This sounds semantic but when it comes to index investing or etfs the classification is important. I just wonder who ‚Äúruns‚Äù classification. WeWork tried to market as a tech company and wanted to IPO with tech pricing but people saw it as the real estate play it was and it crumbled.
03/14/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs true. And JPM has end-point payment processors just like SQ does. They are continuing to merge in the middle of finance and tech as they should. Eventually they will provide many of the same services yet one will still be classified as tech and the other financials. (SQ is a company I hold a solid % of my portfolio in btw)
03/14/2021,stocks,your portfolio doesn't care about your stocks
03/14/2021,stocks,"In that case, what is your explanation to why markets have fallen 50-85+%in previous ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù (following what are historically called bubbles).

If the stock price is the same as its ‚Äútrue‚Äù value, then in these occasions the average company genuinely lost 50-85+% of its value.

I would say the stock price is what people are prepared to pay for it. The stock value is the long term discounted value of future dividends. And the more we big up the stock value, the only thing we can be sure of is that the long term return is lower."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Here's a good article on what's at stake.

03/14/2021,stocks,What is your reasoning?
03/14/2021,stocks,Cruse lines are still way off their highs... whereas much of tech is at new highs. There is a lot more relative upside for these cruise lines.
03/14/2021,stocks,Everyone will have the vaccine by this summer if they want it.
03/14/2021,stocks,">That won't be for many more years.

Curious, how long do you think before we'd be back to what you consider ""normal""?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"It is a very regional mentality. If you come to the gulf coast/FL you wouldn't even think COVID was a thing besides employees wearing masks. Even if just people from the SE US booked cruises out of Mobile AL and FL this summer/fall, I think they will be filling up all their available bookings. Do I think it is the best investment?, nah, not at all. But I do think if you got in at a low it's worth holding on to because of future potential/highs. Basically I think there will be a higher than average demand for cruises as the fight against COVID progresses and majority of people are vaccinated even if it is only a perception of feeling safe enough to go on a cruise... But that is just my guess and I accept the risk. People told me I was an idiot for investing in them when COVID hit, and cruise lines will never come back for years. But they are now still sitting at the top of my total returns for new stocks I bought into YTD. It even surprised myself. Cruise lines are a very small portion of my portfolio, but I am definitely not selling them anytime soon."
03/14/2021,stocks,You must not know how bad ghetto mf's want to flex at parties and how bad hoes want to go out.  They finna get a stimmy and spend it at the club in Vegas
03/14/2021,stocks,"I picked up some during the massive dip last couple weeks as well. I bought in at like $100 well over a year ago, and sold it at $120. So my regret came up when it was back near 200."
03/14/2021,stocks,That's right.
03/14/2021,stocks,Hedge funds moving money around because bonds and news and inflation and corrections and yields and needing cash to pay for something else. Most stock doesn't pay dividends. Only profit from them is price increases.

03/14/2021,stocks,"That's only if they are expected to truly fully recover and actually get back to their highs. By your logic it was best to go into tech and switch over to recovery plays in the past couple months. That was the optimal play. 

Regardless being in cruise lines last March was not a smart move at the time nor even in hindsight over many other safer plays. I'm up over 200% in Macys, Nordstrom, Southwest, Marathon and Oxy, nearly so in Boeing, over 300% in Cannabis, wasn't even in the exact bottom and all were safer than cruise lines."
03/14/2021,stocks,Everyone in the developed world. If we don't truly vaccinate everyone we'll be at risk of possible mutations.
03/14/2021,stocks,It doesn't necessarily work.  I hope it does. A lot of people won't take it anyways.  How long does it last?  Nobody knows yet.
03/14/2021,stocks,5 years at least.
03/14/2021,stocks,Cool I hope everything works out.  I wished I had got in low enough.
03/14/2021,stocks,Good for them.
03/14/2021,stocks,"SQ is going to $1000 in the next 2 years.

03/14/2021,stocks,"I disagree. Price increases are paper wealth, but to realise this wealth you have to sell the stock.

The only real return you get for a long term investment is the yield - so dividend. 

Sure I guess an exception is growth stocks which often don‚Äôt pay a dividend, and still grow in value, and return value to shareholders via a sustainable increase in price. The price increase is sustainable if it is balanced by the increased potential of future dividends.... ie even though they don‚Äôt pay now, the long-term discounted dividend is still significant. 

I fail to believe that the massive price increase in the majority of growth stocks is sustainable - therefore the long-term return will be negative! This will result in reversion to the mean. 

And because I think this is the case across many many stocks - reversion to the mean will be a major market (index) reversion."
03/14/2021,stocks,"OK well my reasoning is that Tesla is overvalued massively, their expansion is already priced in, 10 Yr bonds soaring which is bad for growth stocks, and I believe a lot of stimulus money will be going into crypto, but we'll see. I think the next tesla drop is going to be extremely painful..."
03/14/2021,stocks,"By being in cruise lines, do you mean getting in or staying in? Getting in...idk about that, but staying in, no brainer."
03/14/2021,stocks,Among pathogens viruses mutate the slowest so it won't be a huge issue. As a point of comparison the common flu virus has about a dozen different variants a year and your average flu shot immunizes you against most of them. I would be more worried about new viruses occurring during this recovery period than the current one mutating.

03/14/2021,stocks,What about aapl and msft?  They will have higher share prices in 5 years.  Tech is the only thing making money unlike cruise ships.
03/14/2021,stocks,"> Price increases are paper wealth

Yeah, which is why you gotta sell. Or rather convert to cash and spend. Money in the bank is paper wealth too, but (unless you invested poorly) at much poorer interest rates."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah, Tesla is overvalued. But that's the current market. Who cares tbh. People make their money and that's all that matters.

The drop will come, but not this or the coming months."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don't see a lot of people wanting to vaccinate.  I don't think it's all as easy as people think it is.  I'm cautiously optimistic, but think 5 years goes quickly.

A lot of people will still be afraid to gather even with masks this year I think. Especially seeing that a lot of people won't vaccinate.  A lot of Republicans won't I heard or at least the deep South ones.  Also a lot of poor people may not thinking they can't afford it, etc."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes I agree, think both will have higher share prices in 5 years as well. Both strong companies and Microsoft particularly is getting involved in some really cool stuff... however:

1) I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll continue on the same trajectory (almost parabolic) over the next 5 years though, and you‚Äôre right maybe they aren‚Äôt even overvalued now!

2) I think other companies are massive overvalued though - and when a bubble pops, history shows that even good companies have their price pulled down as well in the short term (I think this will be even more emphasised now by the rise of the ‚Äúglobal index tracker‚Äù).

So for these growth/value companies that are super strong - I think they‚Äôll still exist, and grow, and thrive, and increase in value. But most importantly - there will be cheap buying opportunities in the near future when the non-profitable tech crashes."

Both look fairly valued with ALL being the bigger (I like that) and LNC having more potential upwards. It looks like ALL is more in up movement, currently at 115 going to 120. LNC looks like it is with 59 quite near their 60 price target.

I am now reading all the Market Wizard books, and they are equally engrossing.

2021-03-14 15:57:45,stocks,"Lump Sum Investment Right Now I‚Äôm curious to see what the opinions are on what to do with a lump sum right now (pension transfer to a LIRA in Canada). I‚Äôve been debating a few different options and having a difficult time deciding. I will leave some of it for riskier investments, but for majority of it I would like to be smart with. The options I‚Äôve considered are:

1. Picking one or a couple ETFs and throwing it all in now. (Very uncomfortable with this at ATH) I‚Äôve considered protective puts with this approach but the price of those really eats into any profits
2. Throw a portion of it in now and leave some cash to buy if/when it dips.
3. Make purchases periodically to average in over a select timeline and sticking to it.
4. Buying Leaps of the ETFs I choose to capture some gains while preserving cash to buy if it goes south. I was thinking if I had money to buy 2000 shares I‚Äôd buy 20 ITM leaps.
5. Waiting for a crash. 

I appreciate any input. Thanks."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm personally going 3. Important to have a good amount of cash, but I have too much savings, so I am moving it gradually into an ETF alongside my disposable income. I won‚Äôt want to expose all my savings to a massive dip when stock markets are at historic valuations... not that I believe I can predict a dip .. lol"
03/14/2021,stocks,We haven't made it back to the ath for everything becuse my portfolio is still red after buying at the ath .
03/14/2021,stocks,"I do 3, but 4 is good too"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would do 3, while also writing OTM cash secured puts to earn you some more income while cash is waiting to be averaged in."
03/14/2021,stocks,"same boat. I invested 25% of my cash lump sum in February. Right now investments are in 75% ETFs, and the other 25% I have invested in individual stocks.

 I think it is likely a good time to buy into growth stocks or ARK, with the thought that near term, there could be a lot of pain on the horizon, but if you have a long term hold in mind, and are looking for maximum gains, these are going to be great. If not. At least you have contributed capital towards tech that will advance and improve human life down the road. So I think its a win"
03/14/2021,stocks,I wouldn't recommend 5 what's so ever. I was stupid enough to sell at the bottom of March last year and I still haven't bought back in. Lost out on more than 2 years of my salary in gains. Not to mention the cash had been sitting in my brokerage earning 0% interest for a year now. It has been a devastating experience and I'm still in a very dark place. I kept hoping for a crash so i can buy back in at least a bit cheaper but now I don't think i can hold off any longer with so much great news on the horizon. I will need to bite the bullet and eat the 60-70% loss. It kills me that I only came to terms with it after the historic rally last week and not when the market was down 2 weeks earlier. Now I have pretty much have to buy in at ATH and will commit to DCA over a period of a few month so I can be fully invested.
03/14/2021,stocks,3 is pretty much the standard way to offset risk of poor timing.
03/14/2021,stocks,I thought  you can only move a Lira to a RIF and can only withdraw funds to a maximum amount. I would max my tsfa in a stock account  to avoid taxes or rrsp account  for tax savings and buy etf in that account and only take out if you need it. Bank stocks are good they pay divends and are doing well  right now and mix with some mining.
03/14/2021,stocks,Just hate all the regulations on Lira accounts with all the withdrawal. I am going start maxing my withdrawal  at 55 to put in accounts I can use down the road. So I am not stuck taking money  out at 7 percent a year. Sucks having all that money in there I cant touch.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would put it into a ‚Äòsafe‚Äô ETF for now (like VNQ), wait for a significant dip, and then buy something more growth."

03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks. Any idea what kind of timeline you would buy over? Just sucks that there will be no further contributions so it is what it is..
03/14/2021,stocks,Great idea but we‚Äôre not allowed to sell puts in registered accounts in Canada. Just CC‚Äôs and buy calls and puts. Just another bonus to go along with our ridiculous fees..

I believe if you are going through a traditional broker dealer they can facilitate that for you but the online platforms can‚Äôt handle that scenario. I asked similar question a while back as my GME calls went nuts and was looking to keep profits from run and then exercise so I still had additional profit potential but as shares rather then the calls and I couldn‚Äôt do it on RH they only allowed the cash exercise and would of forced me to rebuy shares in open market

03/14/2021,stocks,You can put a buy limit at the highest price you‚Äôre willing to pay... or a market buy at whatever price that may be when the markets open. Depending on the stock there may be pre-market trading prices that could help you determine an accurate buy limit too
03/14/2021,stocks,Limit order.  And I wouldn‚Äôt buy at open unless your bullish to the bone.  95% of the time you‚Äôll get a much better entry just waiting 30-90 minutes..
03/14/2021,stocks,"I always try to optimize at what price I buy at, but if you are dealing with a small amount of capital, a few cents isn‚Äôt going to make a big difference.  With that said, like the others have mentioned, buy later into the day.  Always by limit, especially in high volatility days. It Will make sure you don‚Äôt pay too much for any one stock."
03/14/2021,stocks,This is the way.
03/14/2021,stocks,That actually solves the problem. I mean I knew I was able to do this but I never knew how to utilize it.

If they go down in price after you sold them, you could buy them back.
Obviously if they go up in price after you sell them then you would have been better off not selling.

2021-03-14 14:29:24,stocks,"Looking for an honest opinion I‚Äôm new to this, but I think of stocks on a logical way, Ofcourse I am not right but maybe not wrong. My opinion or thought right now has two dimensions. Love to hear your thoughts. 

A: everyone gets their stimmys, jobs come back and people keep feeding the market with growth 

B: pandemic is over, money people saved prior to pandemic for investing as an alt / take advantage of down times to invest in the market have pulled out their earnings to use for real life like going out, travel or other. 

I guess this is a market prediction question... 

What are your thoughts?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I feel like the stimulus has been already priced in, but not totally. The markets will gain because of it, but not as much people are expecting.

When we enter the post-pandemc era, people will start to travel more and spend more money. This will result to an inflation spike and the stock market might take a hit. At least Jerome Powell spoke about an inflation spike from the increase of money flowing, but it will probably be just a blip.

This is just speculation, you never know when the pandemic is over and how the market will react to upcoming events."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think there are a lot of new investors in the market that have taken a lot of gains.  I think the gme hoopla has brought a lot of new people here.

Depending on the sector people are invested in, many have not really had to go through any sort of a real market reset.  Many have never really lost money in the market.  My portfolio is diverse enough that I have not really felt this last reset, as an example. I believe there are many others like me.

Whatever change happens from the pandemic, I think will be gradual.  So I think people will keep investing in the market in the short term.

I think the first real reset, when all indices go down, that is what will be the event that chases some people away from the market."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Treasury Yield will keep rising, so tech stocks will fall.

People going to travel, buy food, consume...so traveling, Disney and food stocks will start earning more profit and stock prices will go up. 
Crash market already happened, from January to February it grew too fast, it fell down. Now stocks are at bottom, so now stocks will rise again, people find job, money keeps growing. I say RIGHT NOW is best time to invest. Because smart people invest when stocks are down. Not when stocks are at highest"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Remember last year how economy was a dud but yet stonks kept going up! It‚Äôs going to be the opposite going forward. If 10 year treasury hit 2%, it‚Äôs going to affect the whole market not just tech! Too much winning!! Lol"
03/14/2021,stocks,The m1 supply will go off once economy is totally open causing inflation eventually driving up interest rates which will then rape the market
03/14/2021,stocks,I‚Äôm pretty liberal. But I worry about inflation. There‚Äôs no balance in Washington anymore. Deficit spending is the way for both sides. That said imma keep buying select tech stocks as they fall. Eventually I think the ones I‚Äôve picked will come back in spades ‚ô†Ô∏è
03/14/2021,stocks,"I actually don't subscribe to the inflation thesis, in my opinion we won't see mass spending when we open up and instead we will see deflation, but as with predicting the future its a beast and I very well may be wrong but I dont see inflation coming. Also in my personal opinion we are in a bubble I don't think anyone really is denying it anymore and what intrest in about bubbles is that they burt at the most bullish point in their cycle that's why I'm watching out for may and June"
03/14/2021,stocks,Isn‚Äôt that meeting next week?
03/14/2021,stocks,"Agreed on stimulus already being priced in. I think OP was suggesting that a flood of people will use their check to buy more stock and flood the market. While I see a possibility of this for meme stocks and some other high attention stocks, I am not sure it will affect the market as a whole. But it's an interesting thought."
03/14/2021,stocks,"This is a great thought. Do you mind if I PM you to discuss more? I am one of those GME influenced people but did not invest into GME. 

I came in here thinking more logically versus hype. My ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù is not WSB related"

03/14/2021,stocks,Dow IS at all time high though rn. Nowhere near bottom. Not that I'm predicting a bottom is necessarily coming anyway.
03/14/2021,stocks,We had signs of inflation raise this week and market turned around. Weird times.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Both sides are deficit spending because thus far there has been no downside in doing so. Inflation outside assets has been tame because the velocity of money has been falling as the money supply increased. If velocity moves higher due to reopening and stays there, inflation and interest rates will follow. Ignore what the Fed says. They will not tolerate sustained inflation above say 3-4%."
03/14/2021,stocks,Let‚Äôs pray that it doesn‚Äôt and we reach new highs. Last week I went skiing in California... I was shocked to see how many people were out and about. I think people are ready to spend money again and go out. I‚Äôm just hoping they don‚Äôt pull that money out of the market.
2021-03-14 14:22:33,stocks,"What is the point in recession proofing a portfolio? I keep hearing about stocks like Kellogg‚Äôs and Coca-Cola being recession proof stocks and you should buy them when you start to think we are heading for a  recession. 
But I don‚Äôt understand why?

Surly you would just take profits out of most of your investments and just hold cash until you reach the bottom and get major discounts. I don‚Äôt understand the point of resection proofing a portfolio or how you would go about doing that.


Thanks any help would be appreciated,"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Those stocks will probably also go down in a recession. Just perhaps less than other stocks. 

Of course if you know 100% that a recession is coming soon, you shouldn‚Äôt own any stocks; being 100% cash would be better. Or better yet, buy puts or an inverse ETF. However nobody actually does know when it is coming."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You're looking at timing the market, if you think you can do that then sure, but how do you know when the market has bottomed out? How do you know when to sell and when to buy?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"It sounds really easy to sell some stocks and hold cash before a recession. But timing the market is really really hard and even for professionals impossible. What you actually mean by recession proofing is rather diversifying your portfolio, so the losses of cyclical stocks are offset by the gains of defensive stocks.

And all the selling and rebuying of you think the market is going up or down only benefits the broker (they get the fees) and the state (they collect the taxes on capital gains). I just hold it through every market phase without wasting money on fees and taxes."
03/14/2021,stocks,">Surly you would just take profits out of most of your investments and just hold cash until you reach the bottom and get major discounts.

In essence you're trying to time the market, which is ill-advised. 

No one knows when the bottom will happen. You might buy in thinking it's the bottom, only for the market to continue downwards."
03/14/2021,stocks,dividends
03/14/2021,stocks,You don‚Äôt know when the recession is coming. That‚Äôs the point. So you buy some conservative stocks that will still go up and be steady and won‚Äôt lose as much value when things go south. Plus they usually have a good dividend.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think if somebody really thinks there was a recession coming, act like you're going to retire in a couple years. Put your money into safe investments like bonds to recession proof your portfolio.  Zero chance of losing money."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Because most people cannot time the market like that.

People don't have the time or inclination to sit and monitor the markets."
03/14/2021,stocks,"A stock can still gain in a recession, just more slowly, and with dividend reinvestment you can accumulate more shares for the eventual recovery and be in a better spot long term."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Logistics, consumer staples, debt/repossession processing, vices, utilities, basic Healthcare....these things florish in recession compared to the market overall because they aren't optional. In good times they just kinda hang out, thus why they aren't sexy and are just boomer stock.  The index overall can and will take a dive during recession because discretionary spending is tanking. 

Recessions last for a while. If you hold those positions in cash you'll be losing to inflation in a major way. I can keep it growing in something like KO and sell off once my positions bottom out.  Even if I believe in a stock long term there's no reason to ride it down that far except boomer sentiment or because I don't care to actively manage my portfolio"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Honestly, k is a good buy any time. If you think it is undervalued at any given moment. Buy some, zoom out on their graph. They are not going anywhere, legacy company, pays dividends. Should have companies like this in your portfolio no matter what. My opinion. Plus I drink coke just about every day and they say invest in what you love. K, curl, bud, dkng where my last purchase lol."
03/14/2021,stocks,"So that the major holders in recession-proof stocks can make money. Duh. 

Do these elites actually think the lower class can't live without coke and cereal? (The beverage and breakfast kind.)"

03/14/2021,stocks,Are you good at picking lottery numbers as well?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I am thinking about the consumption patters surrounding coke & flakes products during the recession times vs before / after. Not having captured the statistics _ can't have a 'firm opinion'. Also it matters what nation etc. Yeah that sounds be my first step. Do understand the end customer behaviour patters! Also mcdonald's could be relevant in this conversation. 
_Good question!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Right i over looked the fact i cant see into the future, then how do peaople actually ‚Äúrecession proof‚Äù there investments"
03/14/2021,stocks, I watch a couple youtubers jeremy and Kevin and they bought the dip literally every single fucking day that it dipped. It's like wtf. I bought a few shares but how many dips can they fing buy...
03/14/2021,stocks,This was probably the best explanation thanks I forgot about tax and all.
03/14/2021,stocks,"yeah, sometimes I feel like these people just talk to have their mouth open - do they even hear themselves? ""just buy at the bottom"" - no shit sherlock, so easy, right"
03/14/2021,stocks,Oh i don‚Äôt normally look at dividends but that makes sense
03/14/2021,stocks,That‚Äôs the thing surly its just better to rip out most of your investments and buy back once you thing the recssesion is coming to an end. Worst case scenario there isn‚Äôt a reception and you have to buy back all of your positions again as they have increased in value a bit.
03/14/2021,stocks,Dose it talking about how people act in a recession as I clearly don‚Äôt understand the topic
03/14/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs just hedging against a recession, to make it not as bad for their portfolio if/when it does happen."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Until they get scared by overextending on their margin and have to sell to not get called. If they have affiliate links on their channel, they're getting the kickbacks on those, and also factor in the ""courses"" they offer. Their platform provides them more capital from their subs. Conflict of interest pays, I guess."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Second this, i've seen many people discuss buying the dip but for most of us working class people there just isn't much ""ammunition"" left after a week or two of constant nosedives.

In the tech selloff and latest rotation to value, I intially bought in lots of ~500ish every couple of days but ran out by the end of the second week and that was it.

During the March 2020 dive it was a little different as I had been keeping funds aside due to monitoring overnight Repos since late 2019 - the latest one was offbeat though.

Have a few mutual funds set to auto reinvest on the side and they seem to be pulling in stronger than my dip strategies (they're multi-asset funds)."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you have a million dollars and you buy a dollar's worth on every dip, you can survive a million dips and point at your first trades as massive gains..."
03/14/2021,stocks,‚ÄúBuying the dip‚Äù‚Äòisn‚Äôt really timing the market. The market is still basically at its all time high.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I have limited control over my 401k. Liquidating it is not an option. Moving it back and forth between stock funds and government bonds is. I keep a balance of the two that I change as market conditions change. Moving large chunks from government bonds to funds more heavily invested in stocks about April of last year made me 10% return. Not great...but better than the 1-2% bonds pay...and better than breaking even on stocks if I had just road the dip down and the rise on the other side.

What I have directly invested in stocks is relatively new (about a year) and has ridden out this tech correction just fine.  But this is my most vulnerable investment.

The rest of my money is invested in real estate. This road the pandemic dip out just fine last year. My tenants are all retired, fixed income. So were uneffected by the pandemic."
03/14/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/14/2021,stocks,"Ok i think I‚Äôm getting it now, its for when you have lots of investments you dont think have hit there potential yet and if you think a resection if coming, you get out of your Rickey investments and buy into these ‚Äúrecision proof‚Äù ones to wait out the impending doom"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Too many people overlook cash as a position. I always keep 30% of my portfolio in cash for dip events. I can‚Äôt see into the future, but I‚Äôm often able to buy dips because of the strong cash position."
03/14/2021,stocks,"One way to buy a dip is to sell your positions that have been least impacted by the sell off. For example, with this latest tech rotation, you could be selling energy and financial positions you hold to buy tech stocks, essentially rebalancing your portfolio."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I get it stock going up 300% and then dropping 30% isn't a crash. But good stocks dropping 15-20% is still an opportunity.

I believe tech will either stagnate or go up. But not crash so a dip like we had on march 5 was an opportunity"
03/14/2021,stocks,Sounds good I‚Äôll have a read thanks
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you're 2 years away from retirement you definitely want your portfolio to be more recession proof than if you're 20 years away from retirement, because you're going to be needing that money way sooner rather than later. Sure it might still go down, but reducing the impact at that stage in your life is very important."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Which only makes sense if you think they're so recession-proof that they actually go up, or at least down slower than inflation.

Rarely happens. Best bet when you smell the whole economy turning sour is to get into cash or get short."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Back in my early 20s in finance class we were always taught that ""cash is trash"" and money is best kept in bonds or PM and carefully moved into stocks as the bear market progressed. Its hard to break out of that habit!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"well, in a bull market, your cash position just sits there and it is highly likely that even if a dip happens, you buy in higher than if you invested from the beginning in the first place."
03/14/2021,stocks,"This is a great idea and a plan thats been in view for some time - Right now i'm just curious as to how far the fed is going to let the interest rates rise, but i'm going to start rebalancing next week if the situation continues as it is - Thank you."
03/14/2021,stocks,Oh I agree completely. I bought some as well. I‚Äôm just saying that‚Äôs hardly ‚Äútiming‚Äù the market.
03/14/2021,stocks,I don‚Äôt hold any bonds. The interest is better than cash but the opportunity cost evens it out for me. I also write deep OTM calls to collect the premiums which helps grow the cash position in the same way interest payments would.
03/14/2021,stocks,Same. I sell super OTM calls on my long positions. If I'm planning to buy a dip and not sure if its the bottom I will buy a put to hedge my bet.  If it wasn't the bottom it prints and pays for the shares. If it was I can usually flip the put for a small gain or small loss. It opens up a huge revenue stream to keep the portfolio consolidated to 100 block positions
2021-03-14 14:21:25,stocks,"I have my first call option that I'm going to sell this week ITM what's the difference between sell to open and sell to close?

When I decide it's time to sell the option I have two choices ""Sell to close"" and ""Sell to open"" which one do I pick and what do they both mean?

Thank you in advance!"
03/14/2021,stocks,Sell to close
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you BUY-to-OPEN - you are going long on the call, assuming the stock goes up in value. Then you SELL-to-CLOSE, in order to close this position.

If you SELL-to-OPEN - you are going short the call (stock) assuming it will move down or sideways (theta decay play) and not reach the value of your call.  To close this position, you BUY-to-CLOSE"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sell to close means you are selling your option to someone else if it goes through. After you have sold your option, you bear no further risks associated with the option.

Selling to open means you are short selling an option."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well if you buy to open your position you sell to close your position. 

I understand everyone starts at different levels, but that is a reason they have different levels of options. You can lose a lot money fast with options, I have seen a lot of posts lately about the basic fundamentals of options because people are just jumping in. I lost 7k in the first two weeks because I decided options are simple, I didn‚Äôt even google stock options to find out more. I stopped trading options after that until I did more research learned what delta/theta/... is. Now I make a constant profit off options, but I know how to evaluate the risk and not just gamble.

I say this not to shame you, just if you really want to make a profit it‚Äôs good to have an understanding on the subject, because your $300 profit this week could turn into a 7k loss next. 

But that being said it‚Äôs your money and your risk so really in the end you own your choices, best of luck!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you sell to open, you are not closing the existing position you‚Äôre opening another."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sell to open a call option, means you are creating a call option that somebody else will buy to open.

Sell to close means you are closing out a call option you have previously purchased. My understanding is this is where you are at."

03/14/2021,stocks,"You are making assumptions here and should stick to the technical meaning. 

Buy to open means you are buying the option contract to open a position. Sell to open means you are writing/selling the contract to open a position. Whether it's a call or a put it's the same. 

Sell to open on a call option does NOT necessarily mean you are shorting the stock. By definition, if you are selling covered calls (own the underlying stock) you are not shorting it."
03/14/2021,stocks,Dumb question. If I sold to open a covered call can't I just let it expire?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I just had another question I thought about if you could help me out. Say the stock takes off and I make more than what it would cost to exercise the option 

Example: Cost to exercise option is $900 and I make $1000 off of the single option contract..could I use the profits from my option to buy the 100 shares at the strike price and pocket the left over $100? Or can you not double dip?"
03/14/2021,stocks,That's not what '=' means...
03/14/2021,stocks,"Fuck this advice. Go ahead and try it out. Buy a cheap OTM call of your favourite stock and see what happens. Your .30 premium bumps up to .80 in a week? Good work. You made money. It drops to .10? So fucking what. You paid $20 to learn first hand how simple options work. The only rule is don't spend what you can't afford to lose. But take a fucking swing, it's better odds than the lottery."
03/14/2021,stocks,Is that what you tell someone learning to ride a bike?
03/14/2021,stocks,His name checks out.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sure can.  But if it starts to go the wrong way for you, you can buy it back to get out of the risk"
03/14/2021,stocks,"You can only use the option once. When you exercise it for your profit of $1000, you can't suddenly decide to buy 100 more at that price - only buy more on the market at market price (unless you have other options to exercise)

If you have multiple options contracts you should be able to exercise them differently (but once each)

Not sure if that was your question"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Fuck this advice. He should sell some calls. That‚Äôs free money right away for the premium. Don‚Äôt have to wait at all. I mean, imagine waiting a week. Couldn‚Äôt be me. Doesn‚Äôt even matter if the stock price goes up or down. Free money."

The whole application for options trading on fidelity has taken like a month to process which is annoying"
03/14/2021,stocks,That makes total sense now. So the only way for my half baked scheme to work is if I buy multiple options and sell one of them for a profit to buy another at the strike. Got it.

03/14/2021,stocks,Robinhood and webull both processed my applications very quickly. Webull gives you more info quickly when trading an option. Robinhood is probably the most beginner friendly.

Blame RH because they have terrible customer service, executions, etc. The app is fine in itself but I have to have my account open on both my phone and PC to actively trade lots of options because one is bound to lag/freeze during any kind of volatility.

Tastyworks is by far the best platform for trading options imo. Their analysis/options set up tools also blow RH's ""break even""/""do you think it will go up or down?"" crap out of the water."

2021-03-14 13:42:44,stocks,"Any good stock recommendations for Div? Wondering if anyone has any stock that pays more than PSEC for Dividends?

I did some research and compared around 30 different stocks/Tickers with a fake ""$1,000 CAD wallet"" to see how much I could make per month and per year off each stock.

PSEC and SJT both came out on top

Quick Note: 777USD is the equivalent of $1,000 CAD with the -3% transfer fee

**PSEC:**

* $6.12 USD | 7.63 CAD per Month
* $73.44 USD | 91.61 CAD per yr
* PSEC: 777 / 7.55 (current price) = 102 (shares) \* 0.06 (dividend) = 6.12 (monthly dividend) \* 12 = 73.44 USD yr
* (When next payment is and how much) [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PSEC/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PSEC/dividend/)

**SJT:**

* $9.3 USD | 11.60 CAD for 8 months
* $74.4 USD | 92.80 CAD yr
* SJT: 776 / 4.17 = 186 (shares) \* 0.05 (Dividend) = 9.3 (monthly dividend) \* 8 = 74.4 USD yr
   * Stock normally misses a few months in the year so it's 8 rather than 12

03/14/2021,stocks,"I kind of feel like I might be better off investing in more stable long-term stocks, like DIS (which I believe will grow, as Disney is already huge and very likely to continue buying other companies like they bought Fox), TSLA, AAPL, 5G stocks (which will SUPPOSEDLY blow up this year or next year), etc.

But, realizing that GME could have FINALLY freed me to not only start my own life, and not only make up fir 25 years of missing out and misery, but I could live BEYOND my dreams.

I could literally have $483,000 (more or less) RIGHT NOW, which would definitely afford my healthcare next year (I turn 26 at the end of the year), I could get away from all of these right-wing extremists, I could avoid having to work away the rest of my 20s (I am so far behind the only way I can catch up otherwise is probably working another job over 40 hours a week, somehow going to school fulltime too, and likely paying for therapy more than once a month, which is all insurance will pay for) and barely even have time to sleep (which I struggle with even when I DO have time, I just can‚Äôt fall asleep early at night).

The idea of putting my stimulus and tax return (a total of over $2,300) into more secure long-term stocks definitely seems promising for years or decades down the road, but it‚Äôs depressing as f*ck, because I see myself being miserable and lonely, either overworking a terrible job, or even being homeless until I get big returns.

If I wasn‚Äôt ready to immediately move out so I could plan that better, I could at least pay my parents more rent to help them out better (they have their own debts).

I was ready to throw my stimulus and tax return into CLVS and PGEN, as these are SUPPOSEDLY the next short squeezes, but I‚Äôm not sure that will happen. And supposedly Jack in the Box and Chili‚Äôs.

I‚Äôm also planning on investing in weed stocks as the US is legalizing marijuana, I support this (although don‚Äôt personally smoke, as I take medication that would have dangerous reactions like serotonin syndrome) and think it‚Äôs safe to say that these companies will blow up, and a lot of these stocks are only like $0.30 a share right now. Also mushroom and psychedelic stocks (microdosing is already legal).

If I made all that money from GME I could afford to invest in the short-term AND long-term, AND live it up RIGHT NOW, but I can‚Äôt go back in time, so trying to find the next play.

My money is definitely not growing just sitting in a savings account though. I‚Äôm not going to take it ALL out, but I might take some extra in addition to my stimulus and tax return.

I‚Äôm 25, I don‚Äôt want to be poor and/or have to tightly budget until I‚Äôm an old man. Especially if that means I have to spend my life in either a dangerous part of a city or a small town/rural area (NEVER AGAIN!)

I just want my independence and security, and I want it now, and, at least to some extent, kind of need it before the year is over.....

I just want to enjoy the game of Life. I don‚Äôt want kids, so that‚Äôs a responsibility I won‚Äôt have, but I would like to be with women (which is easier when not poor/broke)

That‚Äôs the best I can explain it.

I got banned from WallStreetBets for 5 days for mentioning a stock that is only worth $1, as I didn‚Äôt bother to read the side rules. I can‚Äôt mention it by name, but it‚Äôs only $1 a share, and some people believe it might be the next short squeeze, so I‚Äôm wondering if I should buy 500-1,000 or more shares of that."

Most of management are not getting paid directly, but instead through rise in equity value (share price increase).

Company was completely under the radar for some time, but is now gaining attention fast!

Unfortunately, a lot of people will end up burned from these meme stocks again, and you could have been one of them. Lots of people kept averaging up last run up in January, and got burned.

Yes, TIME IN the market>timing the market. Well, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing with GME now, counting on Ryan Cohen transforming the company.

I wish I would have realized more 5 years ago and put more work into my own life though, being isolated for so long really made me weak and helpless, I‚Äôm still probably unaware of a lot of opportunities, because my parents only see their own little world, and it‚Äôs hard separating legit opportunities from scams on the internet.

Take the sudden drop from 300 to 200 the other day.I you had a stop loss at 250 (and bought at like 230) then the stop would have probably fill out around 200 anyway, loosing you at net $30 per share.

Or wait for it to come back down. But it might not. The higher it goes the more and more you fomo builds. Finally you buy back in at an absurd price. It falls.

03/14/2021,stocks,"You say that like $241,500 isn‚Äôt still life-changing money. 

3 years of salary? $80,500 a year? I WISH. Yes, I don‚Äôt really have any good skills or education at the moment, but I don‚Äôt think most college graduates my age (and even in their 30s, and many adults in their 40s) make anywhere NEAR that.

All these kids EVEN WITH college degrees making less than $10 an hour bagging groceries and stocking shelves like me right now.

My dad is in his early 50‚Äôs. For YEARS, his yearly salary has been less than $45,000 a year. 

My mom (claims) to make even less than me. My recent tax return showed I made less than $20,000 for 2020. 2019 was even less. 

There are much older people at my job, 30s, 40s, even 50s and 60s, struggling to live, working there AND another job, and still having to live on a tight budget. I‚Äôm miserable now, I can‚Äôt imagine doing what they do, I‚Äôd literally rather die.

Living with my parents not even making $2,000 a year and I‚Äôm miserable and feel like shit, I can‚Äôt even imagine doing this same shit, but even more hours a week, and still barely able to survive. I‚Äôll never enjoy life that way.

I‚Äôm not against having to work for a living, but a lot of people work FULL-TIME, AND OVER THAT, for LESS than a living income. And I‚Äôve had so many people act like something‚Äôs freaking wrong with me, I legitimately had a coworker at a previous seasonal job assume I was on SSDI disability. They actually ASKED ME if I was (usually if or when anyone thinks that about me, they never outright say it) and when I asked why they thought I was, they said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù.

I feel rejected by society A LOT, I just want to get my freedom (huge wealth) and get out. Be left alone.

On the other hand, retail/grocery shitty jobs are the only types of jobs I‚Äôve ever had. All I‚Äôve ever really been qualified for."

2021-03-14 12:39:48,stocks,"My way into investing so far - loss 5% Hello and good sunday morning :)

This will probably be a long post, but then you can kill some time before market opens monday :D

I'm pretty new to investing, I got into it about 1 month ago. I'm trying to read up TA and FA, i'm not sure witch one I like the best tho. But I think maybe FA is best for beginner.

I have read, that I should try to diversify my portofolio and I have tried to do that. But those say, that it is best to only have a few stocks, when no investing more capital than I have. As said I went with diversify a bit, but meh that seems to have gone a bit wrong.

My portofolio so far is:

\- **Apple (AAPL)** \- 26 stocks - buyin price 123,15$ - my plan is very long hold on this one. Reason for buying. I liked the entery price, and I think for many years they will still be one of dominant players in phone market.

\- **Companhia de Saneamento B√°sico do Estado de S√£o Paulo - SABESP (SBS)** \- 156 stocks - buyin price 7.67$ - My plan is long hold. Reason for buying. It is a water company so I saw this as a rater safe stock, as ppl will need water both now and in future.

\- **Corsair Gaming, Inc. (CRSR)** \- 60 stocks - buyin price 47,98$ auch - This one been expensiv learning lesson. With current price at 34$ this might turn into a very long hold. The reason for buying is I think they have oki position in market, and even tho that ppl will spend less time on gaming, once the world opens up, then I still think that new ppl have opened their eyes for gaming while being at home.

\- **Crayon Group Holding ASA (CRAYN.OL)** \- 125 stocks - buyin at 141.25 NKK - Plan to hold semi long. Reason for buying is that even tho I bought at high price, I still think that there is room for growth.

\- **Daimler AG (DAI.DE)** \- 25 stocks - buyin price 66,5 euro - Plan to hold untill start 2022. Reason for buying is that I wanted a luxury brand in portofolio, and I want to learn and see what happens when/if they but the truck division on the stockmarket.

\- **Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)** \- 60 stocks - buyin 43,22$ - Plan is to sell soon, cause I'm up 15% in this one. I had hoped for the world to be more open, but I think 2021 will also be a bad year for airliners. If business travel goes down in comming years, and with more debt added to the company, I think it is time to run. Reason for buying was, that I had hoped for a return to ""normal"" in spring, but looks like it will be longer.

\- **Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DBK.DE)** \- 125 stocks - buyin price 10,72 euro - Plan is to hold for 3-5 years. Reason for buying, is I wanted a bank in portofolio too, and was looking around and thought that this one could be oki. It has a name and pretty big and they are in the mid of a turn around. They have completed 85% of the turn around goals set out in 2019 and the golas should be done in 2021/2022, so I think they are on the right track.

\- **Norway Royal Salmon AS (NRS.OL)** \- 55 stocks - buyin price 202,42 NKK - Plan is to hold for 1-2 years max. Reason for buying I think there is more room for growing and with new factories opening up and with restaurants opening up later this year, I think will be positive for them.

\- **Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)** \- 25 stocks - buying price 29,09$ - plan is for long hold on this one. Reason for buying not really any, was looking for a tech stock and this one was talked about alot.

\- **Pfizer Inc. (PFE)** \- 70 stocks - buying price 34,91@ - Plan is to hold till the annual report for 2021 and then dicide what to do with it. Reason for buying guess a stable company and was interested in seeing how the vaccines will influence them.

Overall i'm down about 5% for this roughly last month since I started. Still have some cash that I need place in something.

**My investment profile**

My investment profile is mostly semi long to long. While I do try to keep up most days I feel it can be overwelming specially for a new investor, so I plan to revisit and look over my stocks like every quarter and see if I want to change something. This portofolio is for pure investing, retirement account that hold bonds, etfs, stocks etc, I don't consider that account ""investing"" but more a passiv thing. So what I want to learn with this one portofolios is to look for ""bargins"" and companies I believe in.

**My plan for idle cash/shortlist**

I still think prices on many stocks are high, so I'm not sure if to put rest of money that atm is idle in the account into more stocks.

On my list of stock to maybe buy is:

\- **Hugo Boss AG (BOSS.DE)** \- I think when ppl can return to shops, they might get a high sale.

\- **Halliburton Company (HAL)** \- With olie prices up and it looks like Texas might open fully up, maybe this one, could be a bet if not buying BP, Chevon etc.  
\- **Index fonds** with focus on the european markets - if the US is ""overpriced"" compared to EU-markets then this could be option I think.  
\- **Essity AB (publ) (ESSITY-B.ST)** \- Is a women personal care mostly, and with ppl going out more women also needs more personal care products :)

**My questions are the following:**

\- Is my portofolio totally messed up?  
\- Would you cut down on number of companies and put the money from the sell off into the other stocks that is left after sell off?  
\- Is it oki to discuss european stocks here? I mostly see US stocks - that is great cause gives me information about the US stock market. I'm from Europe (DK), so sometime I miss talks about european stocks.  
\- When I started to buy the stocks I thought the prices on nearly all stocks were very high and was a bit scary of jumping into investing, but with the negativ rates in the bank, I though was better to invest. But in times like this when stockmarket is really high, is it then oki to be mostly semi-long to long, or is it better to marke more trades and taking small profits?  
\- How did you get started? Reading books? Podcasts? YT?  
\- Have you ever doubted your trades and how did you handel it? Sometimes when I see red numbers I feel like I suck at it, and to affraid to cut losses, is there a way to overcome the feeling and say enough is enough, let me just sell and move on?  
\- Based on my investment profile and shortlist/plan - do you have other recomendations? (the markets I can trade on is US, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway)

Ty for taking your time to read the wall of text :)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hi fellow eurobro, Italian living in Norway here!

From what I read, you've little confidence in many of your picks, which is not a good sign. Do you know what Crayon does? Do you know 70% of their business is from a single client? (Microsoft, which is good, but still a single client). To know everything about a company you own will increase conviction and will be easy to stick with it in downturns. 

If you're a beginner, I would advise you to invest first in ETF such as VOO, VTI, QQQ or even SMH if you know the Semiconductors market. There are EU alternatives as well to those ones. I would allocate 90% to ETF, and 10% to stock picking while learning. In the meantime learn how to evaluate a company, to read financial statements or at the very least the concepts of PE, PS, PB, PEG, cash flow etc. Once you get more skilled in picking stocks, I'd increase my single stock %.

Always keep something like 15% cash for good opportunities like last month. By studying and identifying the company you like you'll be ready when everyone panics to buy them at a discount, because you've done your homework before.

And remember that 99% of traders don't beat the market. Index investing and dollar cost averaging is boring but it works, especially because it removes the worst enemies of an investor: fear, greed and emotions in general."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would get out of SBS, although it is technically a water company as you say, it is a government owned sewage/water company and the politics in Brazil, specially S√£o Paulo are not that good."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you only got in about a month ago, really don't worry about the ""loss"". Ups and downs are going to happen long term - you just came in right about when things started correcting.

Look to put some ETFs in for some core stability. An S&P tracker like VOO, some geo-diversification and some industry specific."
03/14/2021,stocks,"\-Is your portfolio messed up?  
No it's better than 90% of the portfolios you see here, at least you thought a little about why you bought what and didn't just go 100% US-Tech. That said I wouldn't recommend buying something just because ""people are talking about it"" that isn't a good strategy. If yo ain't 100% confident in your stock picks, you might also want to include some index funds. You could do something like 20% Total US market, 20 developed markets, ex US, 20% emerging market and 40% individual stocks. you can also do a 30/30/30/10 split and just follow two stocks closely, to really learn what it's like to invest in individual stocks.

\-Is it okay to discuss EU stocks  
Yes. We have a lot of people from the US here, and US stocks have done great in the past, so naturally, you get a lot of people thinking that US stocks are the only stocks that make sense to invest in, which is false. People also somehow got the idea that ""they know US stocks better"" something I can't exclude, but I highly doubt they know them better than any other stocks, at least to any meaningful extent. That said accounting regulation differs between countries, and you need to be aware of this if you invest in individual stocks around the world.

\-Are prices too high?  
Too high? I don' know, but prices are very high, which has a negative impact on future returns.  
To quote every financial article ever written. ""If things go well stocks might go up, but if things go poorly they might also go down""  
In any case, it's better to be invested than not. If you are very worried and are sitting on a lump sum, you can divide that sum by 12, and invest it over 12 months.

\-How did I get started.  
Youtube inspired me at first.  
I would start by watching the lectures Aswath Damodaran got on his channel. That should get you started with the basics. When you're done with that I can provide you with a reading list if you are interested.

\-Have you ever doubted your trades  
Yes I think that's true for everyone. Back in September when the market was setting all-time highs I was down 16% for the year. I was not happy. Today I am up 24% vs the markets 22% since 01/012020. every single person that invests in individual stocks will have periods of underperformance, in some cases, they will underperform massively.  
For me two things really help. The first is just knowing what you are doing. If you know the companies you are buying are solid, you know it's stupid to sell when they are down. In fact doing anything other than buying more would be stupid. After all, if the price is down 16%, but the fundamentals are the same, my return must be 16% higher now..  
Another trick I use is to only look at my portfolio when I buy and sell stocks. Not much is going to change in a company in a month, and the only time you get enough information to truly act is with the quarterly report, so unless you find a new company you want to invest in, you can't make a lot of meaningful changes outside of earnings season anyway, so just don't bother looking, or in the case of most people. Just fight the urge to look. It gets easier with time.

\-Any suggestions  
I already suggested the 20/20/20/40 or the 30/30/30/10 split between indexes and individual stocks, and I stand by that.  
Next time ask one question at a time. I'm not even going to proofread this that's how long it is, so I'm sorry about all the errors."

Stonks that should be on your maybe lists.

Disney, - I love/trust this one just as much I trust AAPL. Has not let me down.

AMD - Great price to buy now, Great leadership, has a better tech future than INTEL imo. Plenty of room to grow.

ARKK - Had a bad stretch of couple weeks, nice entry point as of now.

BRK.B - I don't have this stock, looking back I wish I bought it back then.. Been super steady. Great way to diversify your portfolio.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Not going to respond to the whole thing but I‚Äôll give you one advice regarding Apple. If you‚Äôre buying today because you think they will remain a dominant player in the phone market, how much do you think is the market going to grow to justify any further share price increase?

Hint: not much. Most people in the world already own a phone or two and they simply won‚Äôt start buying more phones. The adoption S curve is flattening.

What Apple needs to do to grow further is find other sources of revenue. If you look at their product line (or earnings), you‚Äôll see a huge portion of their income is from other products (accessories, Apple Watch, etc.) and digital (App Store, subscriptions). In fact, Apple Store is where a lot of the revenue increase has been coming from for years. They‚Äôre already diversifying and been doing so for a long time.

In conclusion, I don‚Äôt have anything against Apple, but be careful about why you pick stocks and how you justify their growth potential."

03/14/2021,stocks,"No problem. And since you asked how we started: I started trading single stocks end of 2018 right before a -20% market correction and realized I did not have the stomach yet. Then switched to ETF in 2019 while still trading single stocks but this time studying valuations, growth potential etc. 2019 was the Trump-Twitter-China trade war year and oh boy was it volatile. I made mistakes like buying Tesla at 180 and selling at 250 pre-split  thinking I was a genius, don't make me think about it. Or eyeing AMD at 20 something and never getting in... Then 2020 corona crash. When 2020 arrived I had almost 2 years of f**k ups behind me and I was ready: bought some stuff near the bottom with (too little) % of my cash and then set an aggressive weekly auto savings in the mentioned ETF. Never looked back. Can't predict the market, can't time it, if you're young just invest and ride it. My 2 cents. Good luck!"

2021-03-14 11:00:59,stocks,"The Next Tech Software Play: Acquisition-Driven Vertical Market Software? Is the next Tech software play in acquisition-driven vertical market software?

[Constellation Software may cut dividend, plans to pursue bigger deals](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-software-star-may-cut-dividend-as-it-pursues-big-deals-1.1563950)

Constellation Software (CSU) is a much younger version of Roper Technologies (ROP).  Think Berkshire Hathaway plus technology.  Also, the scope of the software offerings is broader for the former than for the latter.

This little-known Canadian play in vertical market software returned at least 3600% between mid-2010 and mid-2020.  More importantly, the stock went up *even as interest rates went up in 2016*, because all acquisition targets were already profitable and cash-flow-generating businesses, and were also bought at a discount.  In other words, all acquisitions were a corporate exercise in value investing.

In turn, this company has a little brother of its own, Canadian-based Enghouse Systems (ENGH), and has also spun out European-focused Topicus (TOI).

The earlier question isn't about any of the aforementioned companies specifically.

Is there potential for one or more ""next Constellation Softwares"" that are in the business of acquisitions for building vertical market software empires as lucrative as the above, especially as we come closer to 2023-2024 and beyond?

2021-03-14 10:48:06,stocks,"AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader # Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites ADA and WCAG accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, GameStop, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company‚Äôs operations in recent years. He‚Äôs a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company‚Äôs mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye‚Äôs current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There‚Äôs also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There‚Äôs a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world‚Äôs population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don‚Äôt see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye‚Äôs technology isn‚Äôt that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye‚Äôs customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It‚Äôs a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It‚Äôs dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It‚Äôs urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they‚Äôre working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There‚Äôs also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I‚Äôm cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they‚Äôre in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion."

There was only one 3 for 2 split after they were purchased. Would this give my mom 4 shares in total? Do splits account for fractional shares or rounding at all?

BA seems to only be going up regardless if ongoing issues or resolved or not. 

AMC... I'm not even going to say anything.

I have recovery stocks on my watchlist that are 20-30% higher than pre-covid, while posting negative growth and questionable or just bad guidance.

No they wont. First of all, once they are allowed to sail, they will be limited capacity, some say balcony cabins only. So not even 50%. Second of all, they are already booked. All those people whose cruises got cancelled, they are first in line to get on board once ships start sailing, and they won't pay a dime, they already paid a year ago. 

Oh, and let's not forget. They sold, what, half their ships? 6 ships? Even if they had no debts and could operate 100% capacity, they couldn't get pre-pandemic profits simply because they don't have pre-pandemic amount of ships/capacity."
03/14/2021,stocks,"The bears are also overlooking the industry as a whole.  I'm not expecting CCL cruises to start until September.  They'll limp along and won't recover until next year but more importantly they're not going bankrupt neither.  However, their less financially stable competitors might not survive which means more market share for CCL."

that's kind of six of one half dozen of the other. prices are exceptionally high right now for a stock that's a potential bankruptcy risk. 

at almost $30/share, i'd be collecting profits because it's almost certainly going to dip substantially before it goes up far beyond that. the risk of holding doesn't really outweigh the benefits at this point."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would be careful. In my experience, in these situations, it doesn't matter the time to recovery, how bad current earnings are, the shares will do well and recover from any short term sell off. All that matters is that people believe a recovery in the business will come. Question marks only get raised if people believe their is structural changes... I.e. People never going crusing again... or until we get to the point it should be recovering fundamentally and it isn't."
03/14/2021,stocks,"No it didn't lol. I bailed at 16 after they started diluting shares and there was still no end in sight. Could have held from 8 if I wanted to but instead I took my free 100% and moved on to better things. I guessed mid 20's at the highest unless covid got fixed quickly, and now after share dilution, tons of debt, fleet downsizing(which makes recovery very hard), and how international borders are going to be a shit show for years, a 30 dollar price is downright scary. Anyone holding at this point is in irrational exuberance mode risking a hell of a lot for basically no gains. Same with airlines, those are even worse in regards to being overvalued thinking oh things will just return to normal after a year of businesses realizing they can just do everything remote for a fraction of the cost."
03/14/2021,stocks,Well I looked at it much lower down :). The market is just being efficient though. In the good times it trade at 1.3x book. If it gets back there in 3 years... and itd 1.x book now thats a 10pc return a year which is about right. So fair value. Hardly a bargain and I'm not sure what the upside case is.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you don‚Äôt recognize how quickly people can adapt to new ‚Äúnorms‚Äù though as well. Just like when we got shut down, people adjusted.  If we sit here in August and 75% of the population is vaccinated and cases are 1/10 of what they are now, and deaths are 1/100 of what they are now...people will start travelling again.  Quickly.  When it does happen that we get past Covid it will be very clearly in a quick amount of time.  

There is clearly a path to a bullish scenario for this stock.  You need to realize that our current life will change again quickly.  Whether that is in August or December is a bit unknown, but people will be on those ships ASAP at first ‚Äúall clear‚Äù signal"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Cinemas are stuffed I think. Everyone has invested in their home cinema systems, bought streaming subscriptions, major movies now going straight to TV.

03/14/2021,stocks,The issue with AMC wasn't Covid. They had issues way before Covid. Them exceeding their pre-Covid levels make no sense.
03/14/2021,stocks,"""Vaccine exist = consequences of pandemic no exist"" in some people's minds.

Well, it would be one thing to buy now, before they fix everything, even partially. But share prices have not caught up with neither the pandemic close down nor the limited profit after they'll be allowed to sail at all, which is in the future. Once the prices crash, then it could be reasonable to buy and hold. Amc and gme are one thing, a huge gamble, but ccl i wouldn't even gamble on. But then I went and looked at the 12 month price. Good lord, worse investment than gme. Worse than the time i held RKT overnight + 30 minutes after open and only got 30% returns in a day instead of 60%."
03/14/2021,stocks,None of that is gonna matter though when it comes to the stock.  It should.  But it won‚Äôt.

03/14/2021,stocks,The downsizing is only a problem when demand exceeds capacity.  Demand isn't likely to go back to pre-pandemic levels for a year or two.  The ships they scrapped were older and less-efficient and they probably avoided some needed overhauls by getting rid of them.

03/14/2021,stocks,"The loss of ships is that even if demand suddenly went back up, they would not be within the same profit making capacity they were before the pandemic. It limits the max theoretical upside which is a case against returning to pre pandemic prices. If anyone was banking on them going back to the 40's and 50's, that's one of many things against that which is why I advise to not try and hold to those numbers

As you said, demand won't be back for many years. All signs point to trading sideways in the best case, bearish in the worst. Too much risk for too little upside"

Yes the CEO has said that, but he also is in a position of maintaining the business‚Äôs viability.  So it‚Äôs very likely he is planning for a near-worse case scenario in terms of saving the companies cashflow until then.  That doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt aware of an upside case as well where they plan to get more ships on the water if things turn with restrictions and demand is there.

Anyways, CEO discussion on value doesn‚Äôt necessarily change stock price at all. Elon said Tesla‚Äôs price was too high at $140, and if investors listened to that, they‚Äôd have missed out on a 5x run.

03/14/2021,stocks,"He also has a growth stock portfolio on his second channel. 

His content is honestly the most down to earth, not-clickbait, and sound commentary out there - in my humble opinion.
It's never just top lists of ""top 7 dividend stocks to buy"", but actual deep dives. I love it!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"He has a second channel as others have mentioned I don‚Äôt agree with everything he says. However, he has a very healthy, reasonable approach to investing which I appreciate."
03/14/2021,stocks,Good channel for beginners but I think that most of his videos all carry the same message
03/14/2021,stocks,I actually enjoy his content and videos a lot. He‚Äôs not cheesy and gives it to you straight. He has some investments that I‚Äôm okay with missing out on (Spotify for a recent example).
03/14/2021,stocks,"Super solid. Should have listened to him earlier if $DIS and $AAPL when he bought in. Good analysis and good dude fir sure!

Financial Education and Jeremy by far the best long term cat and not even close. He made me a lot of money and I would have made even more if I listened to him better. Did my first LEAPs on $dBX because of him. All those have done is print. 

Good luck."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Any youtuber that sells you a monthly subscription in order to get access to information about what his videos mean is hot garbage. It means:

1. His videos are pump alerts. People pay so they buy early and sell when he posts a video that causes the stock to jump. I've seen stocks jump 5% in 20 seconds after he posts a video.

2. At this point he makes more money from the pass than from stocks.

Avoid his garbage."

It just shows this guy pitches stocks after doing a quick google search on his crystal ball, which is conveniently located deep inside his own rectum."
03/14/2021,stocks,"What‚Äôs great though is that he covers literally everything going on in the world cause that man just sits and consumes news 24/7. If there is something new with government or Jerome Powell or literally anything you bet he‚Äôs gonna cover it, and he gives very thorough summaries. His chat is a bit memey and he does call people paper handing weenie babies but imo he is the guy to follow if you want solid coverage on current events and stocks. He‚Äôs not a day trader though, he goes very long term into stocks he really likes, and rarely sells share. He‚Äôs disclosed his positions and his largest position to date is Tesla by far, only because of his initial investment and price point."

03/14/2021,stocks,"True but he has a sharp perspective on the market and potential companies. Everything with a grain of salt. 

Professional investors make me laugh.. They gamble with other peoples money so they dont take as much risk in potential long term plays. My moms broker told her PLTR and EYEs were too risky and volatile for them to invest in for her üòÇüòÇ what? Ive been following secondsight medical for like 8 yearsüòÇüòÇ, and fidelity has restrictions on stocks they ""dont have enough information on"" as well as other brokerages, so professional level investors dont always know what's best. Nobody does. Thats why not everyone wins, and the winners who always win wont ever let the mass in on their secrets. 


I say watch them all and learn from it. And kev gives all all the top earnings right quick if youre on the livestreams.

*edit* I am not a course member of his and have no affiliation with him or his channel. If you get your news from only 1 source then your only getting 1 side of the story which probably isnt true. Check all your sources and make your own educated decisions"

I‚Äôm simplifying obviously, but those skillsets will help you then find rationale in the business and then you can branch off to find things that others arent paying attention to get in early before it gets hyped. What‚Äôs a stock is in the news (GME) it‚Äôs usually too late to get in. Youtubers are typically the least qualified to talk about it, but in all fairness I have seen a few who actually knew their stuff and offered valued insight. Typically the good ones, the minority of the bunch not to sell you into anything or guarantee anything. Nothing is guaranteed (ahem GME mooning over $1000)..."

03/14/2021,stocks,"So copy someone else because it's too hard to research it yourself. Got it. /s

This is what professional investors do: They put in the work, minimize their downside, and take in profits when they can. They don't waste their time on YouTube because everything there is on a reactive level when people should be on a proactive approach to their portfolios. The rest prey on the small fish who blow up their accounts because they don't want to do the work but want the money that comes with investing."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I avoid cnbc typically when it comes to strategies, but if someone like this comes up on headlines like these there's a reason."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Thanks for this. It also made me realize that I was hasty when I read the OP. I was under the impression *(total projection on my part, because that's what* ***I'm*** *looking for)* that he was looking for YouTubers that TEACH you how to do exactly the research you mention in your post. Sigh.

Do you have examples of who ""knew their stuff and offered valued insight?"" 

Thanks."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Never copy any other investor. Do your own due diligence. But it doesnt hurt to listen to others and if it peaks your interest one way or another you can investigate further and make your own moves. 

And professional investors do watch YouTube üòÇ he just a one of the ark invest folks on his show and he gets shoutouts online all the time.  Search up some trends yo! For a guy who talks about the importance of personal investigation you sure havent done your own DD on who watches youtube for information üòò"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah the reason is that big wig wallstreet doesnt like the idea that small retail investors are gaining a competitive edge through youtubers like meetkevin. I have seen first hand that they're getting livestreams delisted midstream so I dont think its a coincidence that everyone is putting out hit pieces on anyrhing they want to deem a ""meme stock"" and youtubers who are encouraging the mass rallys. 


Regardless his guidance has helped me make a ton of money and understand the market fears a lot better. To each their own."

03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôll take a look at who I had seen in the past - truthfully I don‚Äôt use YouTube too much just because in the last few years it‚Äôs felt more scammy than helpful. If I can find those names I‚Äôll rehearse here. 

I have a little of unfair advantage because I work in tech finance so I have to live and breathe this stuff, but it‚Äôs not rocket science and it can be learned by the average person ‚Äî but it does take work and understanding. 

I know the request was on YouTube, but searching stuff to watch on business models, valuation and growth vs value investing might be good starts. There are a lot of amazing books, but sadly what I found was there wasn‚Äôt one good one that had everything it was the combination of all of them that I started being able to put more tangible analysis together and more cohesive strategies that really have done well for me over the last 3 years. 

I‚Äôll keep you posted!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I said they don't waste their time. Read properly. Enjoy having these ""guests"" that are pushing their own narrative, then. Have a good day."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'm glad to agree to disagree. Seeing someone set up their business at a conflict of interest usually alarms me, especially when people are being directed to said channels. Selling access is a conflict of interest as well. Anyway, enjoy your day and stay safe."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Thanks! I am myself kind of a visual learner. Dense text doesn't work for me at all, I need graphics, videos, and the feeling that I can do something while I am still learning. I am looking into chart patterns, which of course is only part of it but it's a huge part, isn't it? Besides knowing as much as possible about the company, who runs it and how, and the industry they're in?
It's just that I would like to put together a system that I can use with every stock I look at. I realize there is a lot to learn, it's a HUGE learning curve for me. But I believe it's important to get your feet wet while studying and not get trapped in the mindset of analysis paralysis, or the information hoarder complex, that I need a maximum amount of knowledge before I can execute even a small trade."
03/14/2021,stocks,Everyone wastes time. Just like you have been here with me by arguing about why people are wrong rather than reinforcing a proper suggestion for the OP. And its about 11:30 pm so imma let my night rock on brother.
03/14/2021,stocks,Can definitely attest to that. If I see a few of my trigger points I‚Äôll buy a position early on and after more investigation will then continue to raise it. Always nice when you get in early and watch it take traction over time

03/14/2021,stocks,"No, it can't.

 There is no viable technical indicator. It's a self-defeating system.

 If you discover a way to predict the market, that causes the market to move. From them on you're only looking at the movements you cause due to the indicator, and the indicator isn't looking for that because you developed it without its influence. So the indicator thinks the wrong thing is moving the market and gives you wrong signals.

You become noise in the system as soon as you start to trade.

The fundamental problem is that people set the price, and they are often irrational and often rational, and the balance between the two is a chaotic one, not a predictable one.

You can back-test everything, but until you can forward-test it, you will never see it work on the future."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I did my own self-testing experiment on technical analysis, using a broad range of stocks from megacaps to pennies, and testing over a range of a few days to a few weeks. 

I documented my predictions and my rationale, using specific prices and time frames that could retroactively be assessed for accuracy in very black and white terms. 

If you separate the predictions into two rough categories of ""up or down,"" it turns out my accuracy was almost precisely 50%. Strange coincidence!"

The next day she comes in again. ""See? XYZ went up 10 cents. Please buy me another 100 shares."" He thinks about demurring again, but does as she asks. The next day she comes in, points out it's up another 10 cents, and requests and receives another 100 shares. The next day she comes in and says, ""it's gone up another 10 cents and I have reached my target; I would like to sell them now.""

03/14/2021,stocks,"tl;dr - As a TA non-believer speaking to a TA believer, I'm asking a good-faith, honest question here.

[Here's a chart of NXPI](https://imgur.com/a/XgCWotH) from the beginning of Sept 2020 to present. I've added ascending channel trendlines, using Sept 25 and Oct 28th to establish the bottom limit and Oct 12th and Dec 8th to establish the top limit.

The blue dot from 5 days ago represents the spot where I sold all my shares (held since July 21, 2020) and used the funds to instead buy two leaps  for 20 Jan 2023 170c at a premium of $42.40. As of right now, TA says that either one of two possibilities is true:

* The prevailing uptrend, denoted by the green lines, would show that I bought at the bottom and I have nothing but good times ahead.
* There could be a new prevailing downtrend, denoted by the red lines, which shows that if I want to turn a profit, I need to sell right now before the price corrects back to within the downward channel.

Those of us who hate using TA know that the only way to know which turns out to be accurate is to wait another two weeks and use hindsight.

**Primary questions**: As a TA believer, what holes can you poke in my cynicism regarding the ambiguous, hind-sighted nature of TA? Is there a finer point I should be considering?

(With the benefit of hindsight, we also now know that NXPI has just been announced as the newest inductee to the S&P 500, so I'll be doing my happy dance while money printr go brrr, but that's beside the point - the attached chart shows the closing price Friday without such knowledge, so let's operate as if we only know what we knew at that point.)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"10%, I should have said, not 10 cents. Analogy is crap. 100 shares doesn't move prices."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Previous comment was removed because of the ticker I mentioned.

Well this is where TA does fall a bit short, and this is why I would never advocate for ONLY using TA. I use TA for entry and exit points. Example - I plan on grabbing a certain stock tomorrow (unless it explodes in premarket) because they were trading at 25+ a month ago, got hit hard because of the tech/green energy dip, and MACD is about to cross over. Looks like an easy 6-7 bucks a share at the very least.

Based on that NXPI chart though, I'd certainly be bullish - support has been higher and higher, MACD is approaching a cross, and RSI is smack dab in the middle."

2021-03-14 09:05:08,stocks,"How are stop limit orders used and when would you use them? My understanding of a stop limit order is that you set a stop price which triggers a limit order to happen. What‚Äôs the difference between that and a normal limit order? 

Say I‚Äôm doing a buy limit order of stock XYZ. I set the stop price as $10 dollars and the limit price at 10.50. What‚Äôs the difference between that and a limit order at $10.50? What does the stop price do?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"A lot of people use trailing stop losses to prevent riding a dip too far down. I set mine to preview mentorship missing a spike. I rarely have them in place. One of the few times I used them was the day RKT mooned. When I saw it break 30, I set it for 41, just for shits and giggles. It blew my mind when I got done with work and saw it triggered. 

If I learn about price movements by finding out I no longer own the stock, that‚Äôs how I want to do it. For everything I own, I know dips and volatility are possible, but I know longterm is good. I‚Äôll only sell if it spikes too hard."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would use a stop limit to protect as best as I could from a crash. If a stock is at $100, and I want to sell no lower than $70 in case of a crash, I might set a stop limit of $70 that activated at $72. The reason I set it to activate higher than the desired price is as a contingency for if the price enters freefall and I dont want to shoot past my limit and never execute.

I generally only do this for speculative stuff that im not 100% confident in, I would never do it for my passive investments or companies like MSFT."
03/14/2021,stocks,Ok I just thought it through a little more. Is the limit price on a stop limit buy order supposed to be below the stop limit? So in my example above instead of a limit price of 10.50 it‚Äôd be like 9.50?
03/14/2021,stocks,"In your example, $10 stop price will trigger your limit order at $10.50.

If you set it as $10 stop only, then it‚Äôs market order after your $10 is triggered.

People use stop order to trail stop a trend, typically when a stock is trending up and you don‚Äôt want to miss the ride. The down side is you will NOT sell at the absolute top but you will ride majority of the trend."
03/14/2021,stocks,Is a trailing stop loss the same as a stop limit sell order?
03/14/2021,stocks,"Trailing stops adjust with the price as it moves up, but triggers the sale if it then drops by a fixed amount. 

At $10. Set trail at .10. If price goes to 9.90 it triggers sale. Now say price goes up to $15.00. The trail goes up to $14.90. So the sell is now triggered at $14.90 not $9.90. Can also use percentages. 

A set up I use all the time is....If XYZ drops to $10. Trigger a buy when price goes back up to or above 10.10. 

This order triggers trailing stop at .10 / with a market sell being triggered. So worse case I break even (+/-) slippage. 

Looks like this. I‚Äôm at work doing worky stuff. Set the order up. When XYZ is at $11

XYZ dips to $9.90. My first if leg is triggered by dip below $10. 
Goes back up to $10.10 second if leg is triggered. A limit order is triggered for $10.10. 
When that order fills it triggers a trailing stop at .10
XYZ goes to $12.50
Then drops to $12.42 my trail isn‚Äôt triggered. 
XYZ goes up again to $12.60
Then drops to $12.50, my trail is triggered and a sell order made. 

I just scalped $2.50 while doing worky stuff. :)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Not sure, since I barely use them. I think they‚Äôre functionally the same thing (sell stock X if it hits price Y), but the difference is in whether they‚Äôre used to keep you from slipping too far (trailing stop loss) or to keep you from missing the chance to sell a spike (stop limit). 

I could be making that up though."
03/14/2021,stocks,Trailing stop loss follows your stock up.  Then when it retreats x percent it sells
2021-03-14 09:02:53,stocks,"Short Term Capital Gains More than annual income from job Suppose one earned enough short term capital gains to push them in to the next tax bracket.

Example: 

yearly salary $50,000

Short term gains are the same as your regular 9-5 income, so total taxable amount would be $550k.

For me Federal tax max cap of 35% starts on every dollar past 150k i believe. But it gets worse.... I owe state taxes of 5.25%. Then I gotta pay Social Security Tax on this money so there goes another 12%, oh dont forget medicare thats another 2.9% (Social Security and Medicare are full values since the income doesn't come from an employer that is splitting the cost with you). 

In total I will be facing a tax rate of around 55.5% all things said and done for every dollar over the max cap.... thats just fucking BS... Im all for paying taxes - but a man/woman shouldn't have to give up more than .25% of their income to the government.

Also, now that im done bitching a little bit - you will owe taxes the following year. I made the realized gains this year - I will file them on next years income tax return."

General AI is science fiction for the next decade (and that's optimistic) so what we have is ML, lots and lots of ML eventually there will be ML on what the machine should learn a neural network of neural networks. $AI is into all of these things (including GAI) but they are not in the big leagues - expect merger/acquisition if they make any breakthroughs. 

My picks for AI: Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, Facebook

Top Pick DD in 4 lines ($GOOG):

* Deep Mind
* Tensorflow
* Golang
* So much money

I hold AI 1@$83. It's a novelty for the ticker. I also hold YOLO and MOON because they make me laugh."

I mean a lot of these valuations are ridiculous, but I see it as no more ridiculous than a lot of other things in the market.

That necessarily isn't a reason to invest but... its just the market we are in. Like all the businesses above it has potential but needs to deliver on that."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks for the response! I‚Äôm hoping to scoop some GOOG once I have the funds. Till then nvidia is my ai big boi. Eyeing up ibm as well
03/14/2021,stocks,The market hurt itself in its confusion!
03/14/2021,stocks,"The big risk with GOOG is mounting antitrust pressure. I'm of the mind that legislatures that are putting this pressure on don't understand the landscape. 

I also don't think any arguments are strong enough to make any big moves against them. That said there's a buy opportunity now since we just saw some market correction in the sector. I think growth will be ""slow"" until Google beats any antitrust sentiment, so you may be ok to wait üòÅ"
2021-03-14 07:07:05,stocks,"This DD on $RKT may interest some of you. There was a DD posted on r/wallstreetbets (I know but hear me out) that discusses how undervalued $RKT is at the moment and I have to agree. $RKT has surpassed expectations and revenue with growth of 161%. Its a relatively safe stock to invest in if you look at the charts at $25 (current value)  it's not overvalued and is very unlike to dip too much below that anytime soon (not financial advice). I really feel at $25 there's not a lot to lose but so much to gain. This is not financial advice, but I would be interested to see what you think after you read the article.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m496ec/gme_and_rkt_short_selling_not_allowed_on_td/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I agree RKT is solid and I never understood what drove such a strong short interest in them. I held them from last November and cashed out at $41, and now that it‚Äôs back at $25 I‚Äôm strongly tempted to get back in. Considering how markets as a whole have performed the last six months, there‚Äôs no reason RKT hasn‚Äôt been a steady gainer over that time. Putting it in a meme category alongside the gaming meme and the movie theater meme is completely underselling it."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôve made money on RKT and I really didn‚Äôt want to sell but the volatility during GMEs trading halt was too much for me. Monday, maybe Tuesday I‚Äôm getting back in long. I really love the attitude of the CEO."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, I too think that $RKT is undervalued.
I'm thinking of getting in on it for the long run, but there's some things to take into consideration IMO:

- Mortgage rates are starting to recover(rise) from the lower values in 2020. This will maybe somewhat lower the number of people buying properties, which will (in theory), lower $RKT profit numbers.

- Debt to asset is at ~83% as of today. Usually having higher d2a lowers a company's ability to freely invest in innovation and growing their business. (This is far from the worst d2a, just something to keep in mind.)

- The stock is still being shorted HEAVILY in my opinion.
Last trading session was around 38% being shorted of the available share float.


On the positive side, the sentiment is high for $RKT.
They also authorized a $1bn stock buyback following the results achieved in 2020, meaning that the company has matured financially.

Anywho, I still think that $RKT is a solid play, even at $25.
The CEO is VERY bullish, as he thinks that even at $43, the stock is still heavily undervalued compared to competitors. The company drives real value for it's customers and it has a pretty solid market cap.
I'm probably going in with $10k this week into $RKT.

*This is not financial advice. I just hope that the company is recognized for what it actually is."
03/14/2021,stocks,"It's so difficult to form an opinion on this one. But I do agree with the wsb dd on the fact that downside is fairly low here. I see the stock as a low risk low reward, since the company and its earnings are essentially in the hands of FED. Then again, they seem to be gaining market share which might change things.

Disclaimer: I bought them last year for less than $20 a share, then bought more the day before earnings because of US house market data was looking great, and sold all when it was going for $30. Too soon, ik, but gainz is gainz."
03/14/2021,stocks,We shall see what the $UWMC ultimatum does on Monday.
03/14/2021,stocks,I like the company for it's strong fundamentals. Potential short squeeze is interesting. I own leaps but will be buying 3/19 calls Monday.

03/14/2021,stocks,I want to build a position on RKT as well. Looks like a good long term play. Any opinions?
03/14/2021,stocks,100% this is undervalued. The article explains it very well but this thing has crazy potential and obvious short attacks. I truly think the CEO is right in saying that $43 is just OK. This thing is going places and I'm sure as hell gonna be along for the ride. Prediction: $100 EOY. Position: waiting for my paycheck lol
03/14/2021,stocks,"RKT is a scam.

The owner of Rocket Mortgage packaged it as an online real-estate/financial market cloud tool to enable local RE businesses to upload their business model. They called it the ""Amazon cloud of real estate financing"" or something.

Then they IPO'ed to create a heavy cash-out for that guy and his family.

Underwriter interest was so weak that they decreased both the price and size of the issue to close the placement.

It smells really bad. They don't have a product and the IPO was a cash grab by departing principals."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Aggressive management team + 1B buyback program + strong macro headwinds on a clearly undervalued company for the long term.  Not to mention short-term there could be enough upward momentum to easily double the value of the stock and have it hold (as opposed to greedy / paperhanded gamma squeeze the other week.  As safe of a floor as you'll find these days.

I have 141 shares @ 25.02 and likely to double down (at minimum) early next week."
03/14/2021,stocks,Totally anecdotal but I started the mortgage process with RKT and god what a miserable experience. As soon as you give them your info you're looking at 5 spam calls a day pestering you to open a mortgage.

03/14/2021,stocks,Just want to point out that the cut off date for dividend was  March 9.
03/14/2021,stocks,You're underestimating how cyclical the mortgage industry is and how unsustainable RKTs revenue growth is. A substantial amount of the people looking to capitalize on low rates to refinance have done so by now. Those stellar earnings are most likely a one and done. Not to mention how easily companies like these go under in a financial downturn.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Their Q4 earning report was stellar. However mortgage rates have been slowly creeping up, there will be less refi and new home purchases if the interest rate keeps going up.  For the last 6 months, $RKT has been hovering around $19-20, I think anything above $23 is too expensive"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would buy Hive over RKT, much more undervalued and are profitable."

03/14/2021,stocks,Great thanks. Will watch RKT closely and get in if it dips
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well I guess seeking alpha articles aren‚Äôt allowed on here.  I suggest doing a 14 day trial to read some analyst write ups.  ‚ÄúRocket recently reported Q4 '20 EPS of $1.09. Yahoo Finance's survey of Wall Street analysts shows estimates of $0.86 for Q1 (lower) and $0.66 for Q2 (even lower!). The full-year estimate of $2.45 suggests that second half EPS will be even lower still. The current estimate of $1.83 will almost certainly prove to be way too high. $1.00 may be more like it.

Maybe 2023 and beyond will be better? In my view, it probably won't be a lot better. The industry first must wipe out a huge amount of capacity, almost certainly including Rocket. And when will the next refi boom occur? When will the 10-year Treasury bond get to 0.5% or lower? Hard to imagine, with the Federal Reserve creating $2 trillion of new money annually.

That leaves Rocket's EPS well under $2 a share for a long time. The present value of that earnings stream is well under $20 a share.

To conclude, the recent short squeeze on Rocket Companies' stock is not a sign of a permanently higher stock, but a blip on the way down. Wait for a much lower entry point.‚Äù"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sideways is good, it means it will stay or moon. Or drop. But it's not dropping anymore. Honestly though any dd has dried up, no idea what any catalyst for change would be. Dividend has been divvied up, teleconference has been held. That UWMC ultimatum deadline maybe?"

03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you just blew my mind.  

If I want to buy a stock, but wish it was lower, just sell puts for that price.  If it goes down, I end up getting the option exercised, and I buy the stock at my target price.  If it goes up or trades flat I just collect my premium?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"In the weeks leading up to earnings on Nov 10, RKT traded between $19 and $21. On Nov 10, they announced $1.21 EPS compared to $0.79 estimates. RKT was right at $20 at the time. RKT spent the entire next 3 months trading sideways, between $18 and $21, while the rest of the market went through a massive speculative euphoria. 

On Feb 25, RKT announced $1.14 EPS compared to $0.855 estimates. It spiked above $40 and now appears to be settling around $25. 

The spike to 40 seemed odd, but the 3 months prior of trading sideways is the part that REALLY made no sense. Its P/S ratio was below 8, while its ROE was stupid high, over 28%. 

The fact that I can't quite pin down the correlation, if any, between RKT's share price and reality is the only reason I'm not back in. (Cashed out at $41.) 

When I bought shares in mid-November, I would have been floored to find out that 4 months later it's only at $25, but the 25% increase since then is a very reasonable move for a company whose numbers look like theirs do."

2021-03-14 07:03:32,stocks,"What are your thoughts on Salesforce (CRM) Been watching CRM for about a week. Did some digging on the stock because the price is 25% below it‚Äôs 52 wk high right now.

I‚Äôm not sure how to feel. Most of the articles I‚Äôve read only offer one sentence type explanation for why the price is down so much. So I thought it‚Äôd be cool to ask y‚Äôall.

Bear Case:

- It has a ~50 P/E which is super high for a value stock but maybe average for a tech growth stock. 

- Up about 40% 1 year (Reference SP500 is up ~50% and QQQ is up ~70%)

- TA shows pretty clear 6 month bearish channel 

- Bond yields rising so growth stocks are taking a hit. CRM down ~12% (reference QQQ down ~6%)

Bull Case:

- Goldman just moved CRN into their conviction but category. The average analyst rating implied an upside of ~20%.  

- CRM seems to be a dominant leader in CRM and SaaS. 

- Has grown revenue ~30% YoY. Super crazy profit margins (don‚Äôt remember exact numbers but ~ 60%). Very low debt and asset/liabilities.


I should note that my source for the second point in the Bull case is from a couple YouTube videos and articles I‚Äôve looked at; I‚Äôm not an expert so I wasn‚Äôt able to make sense of Salesforce lead in CRM or SaaS yet.

But yeah. Wondering what y‚Äôall think.

Positions/motivation: have a small position in CRM with an avg at 150, and am in the process of figuring out if I should go long. Also considering buying options."

03/14/2021,stocks,"As someone who worked with CRM, my concern is that there are many other CRM competitors that do many things so much better than Salesforce. The biggest for me is barrier to entry, Salesforce is so much more expensive and involved to get it up and running, not a big deal for big companies, but small-mid would be a deal breaker. Some CRM startups like HubSpot are free to start, and you add features that you would pay for. So yes, companies F500 companies would be happy with Salesforce, but how many of those companies are left that they can sign on as new customers."
03/14/2021,stocks,CRM is a good stock and was overpriced after it bought Slack so the value went down along with the correction. Salesforce is a good long term stock as many companies are adopting Salesforce. You see the commercials advertising companies helping with the setup as well as my own group uses Salesforce. Wasnt my choice to use it but it is a popular choice now for data management. I would buy CRM at the current low price except I am too tech heavy with my portfolio right now.

In 2019, I was with a small company, after looking at several options, we went with HubSpot that our VP had experience with. I end up being the person to implement it, took 3 months, and did everything we needed it to do. 

Granted, these two situations are different. Salesforce had a lot more functions than HubSpot (even though there were other functions just we didn‚Äôt need it). And time periods are different too, but HubSpot sales person cited ease of implement as one of the selling point compared to Salesforce."
03/14/2021,stocks,Depends on your horizon. I'm not sure any acquisition should lead to a significant share price decline unless value is being destroyed or it indicates a change in strategy or unknown weakness. As my investment horizon is 1 to 2 years typically I think it will go up over that period.
03/14/2021,stocks,Hmm. Is there a reason for trading sideways? Does an acquisition of this size diminish CRM‚Äôs growth potential?
03/14/2021,stocks,Ah gotcha.

If you look at its client list, you‚Äôll see F500 firms that I believe include Dow Chemical, AT&T, etc. Salesforce also has a pretty robust app marketplace for software development that is compatible with its CRM. If you google CRM competitors, be sure to specify ‚Äúenterprise crm‚Äù because this differenties them from crm systems that service small businesses. Salesforce is much more expensive than other enterprise crms like Zoho and Insightly, which cater more towards midsize but still sizable firms. 

Salesforce remains the only firm that is currently capable of providing CRMs to national/multinational type firms."
03/14/2021,stocks,Ahh I see. Thank you. What I‚Äôm somewhat piecing together is that CRM isn‚Äôt directly competing with Hubspot because CRM is aimed at Larger firms? Do you think there‚Äôs anything stopping Hubspot from scaling their stuff?
03/14/2021,stocks,"huge risk is that the acquisition doesn't go through, the market will typically wait it out until deal is closed and official."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Oracle CRM On Demand fits the bill and is a strong competitor. Oracle bought Siebel and subsumed the functionality into their product. A good choice for large enterprises that already own other Oracle products. 

However, like many Oracle products it‚Äôs feeling a little dated. Salesforce specializes in CRM and is constantly growing. The new analysis and dashboard features because of the Tableau acquisition is a great example. IMO, this is a long term growth stock and a great buy at current valuations."
03/14/2021,stocks,"They are both CRM, or customer relationship management software. Aside from the CRM ticker name. But they both compete for the same customer, does same kind of things, doesn‚Äôt have same features but it‚Äôs similar. Salesforce is a more established name, if you don‚Äôt mind paying the money and time, then there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it. Maybe HubSpot isn‚Äôt as easy to customize and less developers/implementation consultants you can hire, I dunno."
03/14/2021,stocks,Ahh I see. Is there some sort of risk that the acquisition won‚Äôt go through? I remember the acquisition had negative sentiment cause Slack was supposedly a corona-stock. But do you see any legitimate reason it would be blocked or fail?
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yea, I‚Äôm watching oracle as a potential sleeping giant, but if the business model relies on you being held hostage to the other systems... and those other systems are mediocre, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel good as an investor."
03/14/2021,stocks,"it's mostly about the acquisition value and whether they overpay for Slack at some insane valuation. Also depends on the structure of the deal and whether they finance the acquisition stocks, cash, or debt."
2021-03-14 06:44:42,stocks,"Buying call options OK, I am new to options (haven't bought or written any contracts) but I am learning. My main question is, is that if you buy a call that expires itm, are you forced to buy the shares before you can sell them? Would I need money in my account to cover the shares at that strike price? And if it does expires itm, your only profit is how much the share price got above the strike price correct? Sorry if these are low level questions, just trying to get understanding."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Options give you the option, not obligation, to buy"
03/14/2021,stocks,No you‚Äôre not obligated to buy. You either buy the shares or you sell the option contract for market value. If you don‚Äôt check it on expiration date and it expires before you exercise it then you are SOL.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes if you pass expiration and your call is in the money then you will be assigned the shares. If you don‚Äôt have that you should sell the call prior to expiration. Some brokerages may assign then sell if you don‚Äôt have the funds, but the best move is to sell the option prior to expiration."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you don‚Äôt have the funds to cover ITM options when they expire it‚Äôs best to buy to sell on that Friday before the markets close. A lot of brokers will automatically assign your ITM options if you don‚Äôt sell.

Edit: I meant sell to close if you don‚Äôt want to exercise the option."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If at expiration you were going to exercise and then sell the shares you would need the funds to buy the shares.  But your better bet, presuming you don't want to own the shares and/or don't have the $, is to simply sell the option just before it expires.  Your profit would be the closing price minus the strike price minus your premium."
03/14/2021,stocks,"No you can sell off the contract but word of caution is it can move massively for you or against you as well.  I pick and choose my spots very carefully and sparingly, I don‚Äôt suggest yolo plays you can really wipe out profits alarmingly fast. Winning at trading options is much more difficult than buying and holding shares."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah jus sell the option. No need to exercise it.
03/14/2021,stocks,"sorry for this question im just noob on options, but if im selling the option contract like 1 day before expiration, who will buy them knowing that it expires soon? and whats their reason for buying it, is it because they plan to exercise it?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Some brokerages will auto-execute the call option if it's in the money, though.  I think Schwab does this, but unconfirmed."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Options are automatically exercised if they expire ITM.  Your account is debited the cost of the stock and credited the shares.

You have to tell your broker when you *don't* want that, and your broker has to inform the Options Clearing Corporation, because they're the ones who do it.

If you don't want to sell the option and don't want the shares you can ask your broker to execute the option and sell the shares simultaneously. All the mechanics work out in settlement and you'll be left with cash, if there is any."
03/14/2021,stocks,I feel like I would need a margin account for them to assign it to me if I didn't have the funds before a sell correct?
03/14/2021,stocks,"So you can set it up at the beginning to buy to sell, so I can like set it and forget it? Also can I sell the contract that is in the money at what I may think is the peak before it expires?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Your don't need the funds. You can do a ""cashless exercise,"" which combines exercise and sale (for a call option). The settlement to you is the difference left when it's all settled."
03/14/2021,stocks,Is there a possibility that the contract doesn't sell and I end up with it when it expires?
03/14/2021,stocks,This. The last 15 minutes before an expiration can have some interesting moves as people close their options in various ways. Most often you'll see the stock price make a beeline for the nearest strike price with large open interest as the option holders in-the-money exercise and trade to close.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Who knows, I know I personally bought a contract of BB @$1 a share when it had only two days to go. I executed it too as soon as I got it so I could average down my average share price that was at $17. It‚Äôs now at $10.02. Think the contract price only was $850 or something like that, so I got 100 BB shares for $950, averaged down my average share price, and the same day was in the green as a result. Could be a ton of reasons people buy options."
03/14/2021,stocks,It's impossible to know who is on the other side or why.  Trading options close to expiration provides great leverage (and volatility) and can be a fun time to trade.  You could also have buyers closing out covered calls and rolling to a later expiration.  On and on it goes.
03/14/2021,stocks,[try this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWC3i-PWuIo)
03/14/2021,stocks,the guy who sold the option could buy it back so theres no risk their shares get called away or someone could buy it to exercise
03/14/2021,stocks,Fair - I would never count on it though. And I‚Äôm that case to OPs question you would need to have the money to exercise in your account.
03/14/2021,stocks,The OCC does it. You have to tell your broker to tell the OCC not to.
03/14/2021,stocks,"No, I believe the brokerage would just sell it for you"
03/14/2021,stocks,"No, I don't think any brokers provide the ability for you to specify in advance if you want to exercise the option at expiration. Most brokers, including Ameritrade, will automatically exercise the option if it expires in the money. But they will only do that if your account has enough buying power to purchase the shares (in the case of a call) or short the shares (in the case of a put). if your account does not have enough buying power, then they will throw your option in the garbage and you will lose all of its value. It could be worth tens of thousands of dollars, and you will get screwed out of all of it.

Options are not like stocks in that you must monitor options. You cannot ""set and forget"" an option. This is one of the disadvantages of options compared to stocks, because it really does take more of your time.

With stock, you could buy it and forget about the shares for years if you wanted. But that is not the case with options.

By the way, the general consensus is that you should never exercise an option. Instead you should sell it. If you buy an option, you can sell it at any time until the market closes on the day that the option expires.

You should definitely go onto YouTube and search for options basics and things like that. There are a number of really great educational videos that will walk you through every step."
03/14/2021,stocks,I thought that was only for employer-granted compensation options but see that‚Äôs not the case.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sure, the contract won't sell if you ask for a ridiculous price.  But under any normal circumstance you should have no problem realizing your profit by selling an ITM option at expiration."
03/14/2021,stocks,"ohh so you could use the method to average down, i just thought that BB contract @1 would be way more than that if the share price is already way above 1, because people could then abuse it and just buy those calls then exercise them?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"So you spent 850 dollars for the contract, then spent 100 dollars on the shares. You paid a total of 950 dollars for 100 shares, so that‚Äôs 9.5 dollars per share. Same as what the market price was. You could‚Äôve just bought the shares at market price; buying the option didn‚Äôt really help you. 

Like yeah, on paper you paid 1 dollar per share, so it makes your cost seem lower, but you didn‚Äôt actually pay less when you include the price of the option. Lowering your cost basis just seems like a psychological thing in this case."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thank you for your input

>Options are not like stocks in that you must monitor options. You cannot ""set and forget"" an option. This is one of the disadvantages of options compared to stocks, because it really does take more of your time.


This... The values can rapidly fluctuate, especially in the morning."
03/14/2021,stocks,"This is wrong. The OCC automatically exercises any option that is in the money at expiration.

You have to tell your broker to tell the OCC not to."
03/14/2021,stocks,How would you determine a price to sell a itm call at?
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, until there‚Äôs no more of those calls available. I honestly think I got lucky and bought someone‚Äôs calls who meant to put them up as a put and they just hit the wrong button. 

IIRC the price at the time for BB was $10.50ish. I bought a contract for $850ish (8.50 per share) and exercised the contract letting me buy those shares for an additional $1 each for a total of $950 spent. As such my average price went way down and I was instantly in the green as my average cost was now bellow the share price."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Market price at the time was over $10. Like I said, I think someone was trying to sell a put and fucked up. As at the time there was only 1 contract for that price."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt have funds most brokerages will sell for you.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Do you have a reference for this? I really don't think this is the case. Example: if the OCC automatically exercises options requiring a million dollars of buying power (think 3 cheap 1 day calls on AMZN that expire 0.01 in the money), and the holder of the option has $10k in their account, then the weekend risk goes to the broker, and the broker is taking $1M of risk over the weekend. There's no way they would tolerate that. I don't think the OCC makes decisions about exercising (or not) any options. It has to be the owner of the option and the broker. The OCC is just responsible for clearing and backing the transaction if one side fails to deliver."
03/14/2021,stocks,At expiration there is only intrinsic value which is the underlying closing price minus the option strike price.
03/14/2021,stocks,The same way you decide what to sell a stock at. Options have bid-ask spreads just as the underlying stock does. Start there.
03/14/2021,stocks,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticexercise.asp

You are responsible for settlement. Your broker is responsible for flaying you if you fall to settle.

Your broker will likely just sell the stock if you're unable to do it yourself. You can even instruct them to do it ahead of time. It's called ""cashless exercise"" now, because ""turn and burn"" is a little over the top for a checkbox."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thank you for sharing your information with me.
03/14/2021,stocks,You‚Äôre welcome.  I say this not to be critical because it‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre learning something new.  I‚Äôve definitely been in your shoes.  But your questions are really basic and you‚Äôll do better just googling option basics and reading and/or watching videos.  There is a ton of info out there.

Don‚Äôt stress about what the price is if you plan to hold the companies long term.

03/14/2021,stocks,The markets been at an all time high thousands of times before. The best time to buy in is when you can.
03/14/2021,stocks,"You can buy pretty much whatever solid tech company you want at these prices, and even if we hit a ""dot-com bubble""-esque crash on Tuesday, you're a long way from retirement and it's only 300$. It shouldn't concern you right now, go, buy aapl, fb, amzn, etc. any of em, all of em. 

Time *in* the market, beats *timing* the market. Continue your reinvestment strategy. Diversify your portfolio as you build it up. Until you build up to a 20-30k diversified portfolio, ignore red numbers. They don't exist. You've done your research and you believe in the company, right? Well, so long as you aren't seeing articles about them going insolvent, *don't sell*. 

Once your portfolio becomes thicc and juicily diversified, start looking at the red numbers. You believe in these companies, right? *Buy the dip*. That's the money. Find value, where many others don't see it. Alternatively, you could further diversify your portfolio by searching for value in the market, or if you're all green, buy more of your lowest priced holdings.

That said, *always do your DD - Due diligence.* Research every company you want to buy, in and out. Scour their balance sheets, look at institutional interest, look at insider transactions, etc. I'd bet there's tons of YouTube videos showing budding investors how to research the fundamentals of a company; how to look for value in a stock. Plenty on online articles, as well. All free information for the taking. *Take advantage of it.* 

May the markets treat you well. You got this, champ."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you've never done this before, honestly and from my own experience, choose one of two paths:

1) start off smaller than $300. Personally, I have never ""lost money"" in the stock market. I have, however, ""paid tuition,"" And some of those classes have been very expensive.  

You will see a lot of posts on here and other forums of people who went all-in on some stonk and made small fortunes. You'll also see fortunes getting erased, which happens a lot more often. You see there's gambling, and then there's trading. Gambling us luck, and trading is a skill that takes time to master. It's also something I just love to do. It's better to keep your tuition low while you work on that skill. 

After all, if you can't turn $20 into $25, you probably won't be able to turn $20,000 into $25,000 either. 

2) if the time commitment, skill, and learning curve aren't for you, you're better off just investing. 

Take the time to find an ETF that aligns with your values, park your money there, and come back in ten years.  If you're just in college, there's no reason you shouldn't be a millionaire by the time your kids graduate."

Snap ipo‚Äôd in 2017 and just broke even from their overpriced ipo late 2020. 

Their company isn‚Äôt as privacy invasive as FB and I can genuinely see them taking them down one day. Maybe in 5 years. 

As of rn. The best social media business. Is FB. And I see why. They literally stalk u ebeywhere. Location, web searches. What app u use after fb. Everything. 

I don‚Äôt think this is going to last forever. I feel it‚Äôs just a matter of time before privacy standards rise and clap FB. 
 Snap is awesome. Let me know any reason it‚Äôs not 
I‚Äôll prolly delete this soon. I‚Äôm high asf Rn."

Snap is fine at what it does, and I expect there is further monetisation / growth potential. But it‚Äôs essentially a platform with some of the functionality of WhatsApp (chat) and some of the functionality of Instagram (stories). There‚Äôs a niche, albeit for a younger audience. I could see the potential to take away from WhatsApp‚Äôs market share (and therefore FB).

But Snap has none of the core functionality of Facebook - events, somewhere to keep photos, somewhere you can find colleagues and acquaintances easily on name etc - so I don‚Äôt see that it could replace the actual social media functionality of Facebook, unless it has plans to create or a acquire a platform that does this alongside its core app?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"As a person who used Snapchat in high school... Snapchat has lost all of its appeal for me. Streaks are not entertaining, I feel no need to keep the app anymore. The stories are boring

Note: not a financial advisor"
03/14/2021,stocks,I was a big fan of snap and pins but snap hasn‚Äôt been holding its weight. It‚Äôs hard to judge a stock that‚Äôs just an app and yet pins has nearly tripled my investment. Personally I‚Äôve stepped away from snap.
03/14/2021,stocks,Snap could benefit from the antitrust probes affecting Facebook and they had an increase of 22% in daily active users yoy. The company needs to focus on revenue and growing their user base.
03/14/2021,stocks,"You want DD? I‚Äôll give you DD:

I deleted snap this past week :)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"snap is a fad used by young adults. I also dont know why you think privacy and snap are connected. They arent full stop, they only protect users from themselves. You are very naive.

I dont know how you completely missed the big competitor called tiktok. I have no confidence in that platform either."
03/14/2021,stocks,Snap is ok but I see so many young ppl start with snap and move onto IG. I don‚Äôt know if snap will ever reach FB just bc IG is so huge and tends to have better ‚Äústickiness‚Äù. I still think snap has room to grow but at this point I can‚Äôt see it taking over FB (IG). The progression tends to be Snap to IG to Twitter as ppl age ... at least from what I‚Äôve witnessed in my kids and their friends. They stay on IG Twitter equally but Sbal often gets left behind.  For reference I have 5 kids so a lot of observation here.
03/14/2021,stocks,Id buy puts.
03/14/2021,stocks,28 here. My age group consist of 24-30+ and some people still use Snapchat but others don't. I see it being used less by the older population so I can't safely say it's a good investment long term. I'm not too sure what snapchat will be branching off to but I would buy it short term and swing trade it while it still has some momentum going. I should also specify just because the older population doesn't use it as much anymore doesn't mean the youth aren't. It has a large is not one of the largest usage rates by the youths followed by tiktok and Instagram
03/14/2021,stocks,SNAP over 70 this coming week. You heard it here.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Personally, Snapchat is this ‚Äúcool‚Äù app that all teenagers needed and I don‚Äôt really think it is hype or a short term craze. You can apparently play games on it, complete streaks and it‚Äôs very addictive. (I don‚Äôt use it just quoting my friend). Essentially the idea is not how many users they have but how they monetise this user base and SNAP is doing an excellent job. With people growing over Facebook, with more developing countries transition from Facebook to something else, I think snap chat will see a huge growth over the years. However, with the economy opening up, I think many investors will feel bearish towards snap so I don‚Äôt expect this bull run to last very long. Altho I think this company has a lot of potential. If you are looking to create another position, a good entry would be 50 or below."
03/14/2021,stocks,idk maybe its my friends but most people 25+ that I know are on snap. It's just so quick to post a quick snap and go.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know man. I‚Äôm in my 20s and people I meet up to 25 are still on Snapchat. 

I think if you grew up using Snapchat in high school you still use it. I don‚Äôt know about high schoolers now."
03/14/2021,stocks,26 here. None of my friends use Snapchat.
03/14/2021,stocks,In my experience I‚Äôve seen more and more boomers start to use it
03/14/2021,stocks,You clearly don‚Äôt know any Gen Z‚Äôers.
03/14/2021,stocks,they have a lot banking on altered regality features
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, cathie had SNAP featured in her Big Ideas report at the start of this year. See sees it as a leading AR and virtual world play."
03/14/2021,stocks,What part of that post could *possibly* be construed as financial advice?
03/14/2021,stocks,Shoulda got in earlier. Up 500% in 12 months.
03/14/2021,stocks,"tiktok and snap arent in competition

they are completely used for different features."
03/14/2021,stocks,Snap is used by teenagers. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so successful.
03/14/2021,stocks,"snapchat is for actual messaging and sending pics to people of what you are doing when you are doing it. 

IG/FB is too cumbersome for that"
03/14/2021,stocks,"> Essentially the idea is not how many users they have but how they monetise this user base and SNAP is doing an excellent job.

This. They used to make like $2.00 a user. Now they‚Äôre at $2.70 a user within the last year."
03/14/2021,stocks,I am 26 and neither me or my fianc√©e use Snapchat at all anymore even though we did when we met a few years ago. It‚Äôs always come across as a thing for single people.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don't. But I wouldn't put my money into a stock relying on Gen Z'ers, especially when it is proven that their business model can not keep their users on long-term like Fb or Ig do. I don't publish anything on fb anymore but at least I use messanger to keep using their platform."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I was in extremely early, I just saw the stock price and wow. I probably should‚Äôve kept it."
03/14/2021,stocks,"yes and no. If you think autodeletion of stories is difficult to implement then yes, it certainly is different. Most content creators will find this difficult to work with.

I mean if you can mention serious differentiators please do let me know. I certainly cant think of anything these platforms dont copy from each other."
03/14/2021,stocks,"or she just deletes the app when you are around

/shrug"
03/14/2021,stocks,">	I wouldn‚Äôt put my money into a stock relying on Gen Z‚Äôers

That‚Äôs your right but obviously a missed opportunity. People like you are why these stocks are usually undervalued."
03/14/2021,stocks,Snap is primarily for texting/sending pictures and short clips. Nobody goes on tik tok for the same reasons they use snap.
2021-03-14 05:47:46,stocks,"Annual average return Hello ladies and gentlemen
I hope you are having a good day

Is it possible to earn 20% YoY returns on the stock market? 
I‚Äôm looking into tech and pharmaceutical stocks as there seems to more growth in these areas
If it‚Äôs impossible what are ways to increase returns?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sure it is, in the last decade at least, especially with a tech weighted portfolio."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you pick the right sectors year over year, yes. Will that happen, probably not.

Things tend to revert to 8-13%."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes but to do this you need to know how to do well in all market conditions bear and bull, if you are playing short term you also need to have a good sense of where the marketbis headed, if you're long that dosnt apply however"
03/14/2021,stocks,"it is possible, but it depends on how long you think you can sustain that performance.  I m not sure i know of any money manager that has had those type of numbers over a long period of time.  if you are asking Reddit, i am going to guess you won't be able to do it"
03/14/2021,stocks,You could do 2000%. Or lose half.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Very possible, but be weary of pharma, there are better ways to hit 20% annually. I‚Äôd recommend doing a lot of research on stock and doing a bit of portfolio balancing and reconstitution leading up to quadruple witching days, as well as big index reconstitutions like Fortune, Russell and S&P"
03/14/2021,stocks,definitely possible you just have to be riskier
03/14/2021,stocks,"Options are a great way to see insane gains depending on risk tolerance. Educating urself on how they work could be financially life changing. Definitely was for me

It‚Äôs also a way to get wiped out if u don‚Äôt take the time to learn how they work and u don‚Äôt have a stomach for volatility, so I‚Äôd be VERY careful with them if u don‚Äôt know wtf ure doing"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôd recommend not buying individual pharmaceutical stocks there all over the place and boom/bust. Much better to come in with an etf or mutual fund but I think you will beat the s&p. I own trowe price health science fund, xbi and arkg"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Obviously highly speculative stocks have a potential for high return but they are highly risky so you could just as easily lose it, especially in pharma stocks."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Hedge funds are generally not focused on total return. They‚Äôre usually focused on risk adjusted return (aka Sharpe ratio). The goal there is an equity like return with a bond like standard deviation. Some hedge funds are high flying but hedges cost money and markets tend to be efficient so they usually underperform equities a bit. The underperformance has grown in the world of correlation due to passive investment flows. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love hedge funds. They‚Äôre a great investment within a portfolio but they rarely can replace equities, as long as the investor can stomach vol."
03/14/2021,stocks,You probably can‚Äôt afford a hedge fund. And they don‚Äôt necessarily outperform the market. As the name suggests they hedge the markets and get you better returns in down years.
03/14/2021,stocks,"In general, most hedge funds can‚Äôt outperform the market long-term. A few years of outperformance is usually due to luck. There is one fund which actually does seem to have something good figured out (the medallion fund) but they won‚Äôt take your money anyway"

It has moved from $311 to $331 in the last three days and I expect it to appreciate another 20% by the end of 2021.  3rd quarter will look good and 4th quarter will trounce prior.  

2nd quarter revenue grew 14.6%, but earnings missed expectations due to $.41 Covid-19 hazard/premium pay to employees that ends in March.  So, the 3rd quarter will have some premium pay/Covid-19 expenses while the 4th quarter will have a significantly smaller expense.

Other trends in COST favor include possible membership price increase, falling gas prices (increase their gas sales margin), sales increases (1/2 of February goes in 3rd quarter) February up 15.2%, two upgrades last week following all the downward price adjustments after 2nd quarter earnings and the list goes on.

FWIW - last year Costco sold more than $52 billion of merchandise under its own Kirkland Signature brand, up 7% from 2019. That is more revenue than Coca-Cola, more than twice as much as Colgate-Palmolive and about the same as Kraft Heinz, Kellogg and Campbell Soup combined.

If I get motivated, one day I'll post my ""pump"" notes."

The largest country in the fund is Taiwan which has done well with Covid. After that is China. But yes, point is heard on the rest of the holdings and that is a risk - but it should be priced in.

The biggest risk is: 1. Taiwan/China conflict and 2. Interest rates rise and the fed doesn‚Äôt implement yield control and the dollar strengthens (bad for EM)"

03/14/2021,stocks,"Arbitrage.

The fund sells shares to market makers. Market makers sell the shares to retail investors. When you buy and sell you may be trading with either a market maker or another retail investor.

The fund (ostensibly) buys the underlying stocks at the published weighting. So the retail market can calculate a notional value for each share of the fund. That is the price that traders would use to set the limit orders they add to the book, or to decide to fill orders that are on the book.

If you think the price on the book is different from the true price, you would tend to trade the ticker until the book moves to the price you think it really should be.

I.e., the retail market arbitrages the price against the calculated weighted price of the fund's published holdings."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Some ETFs are big enough that they could be affecting the price of several of their underlying holdings. For instance, QQQ, SPY, and DIA are probably responsible for some of the bulletproof nature of their largest-weighted tickers, because it's likely that millions of 401K account holders allocate a piece of every paycheck to one or more of the funds. Continuous cashflow produces continuous order flow on the buy side regardless of company news or market conditions.

The only thing that could cause a selloff is if all those 401K account holders suddenly took the ETF off their allocation."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yes massive sell offs will drop the value of the stock same as the major companies in it losing value look at the major drop in ARK stocks over the past month.  Most dropped around 20-30% and still haven‚Äôt recovered.

03/14/2021,stocks,If you take your money out of a stock thats been doing great...what do you plan to do with it? If your answer is ‚Äúbuy a different stock‚Äù my question is ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Why sell a winner to buy a stock that hasn‚Äôt performed as well?

If your holding long term (years) you can take some profit as soon as your up 20% you can take half off.  It all depends on your time frame and risk tolerance.  

You can also make the case that it‚Äôs never wrong to take profit (regardless of how small it is)."

Short to midterm plays I don‚Äôt like to decide when to pull the trigger. I use a stop loss after I‚Äôm up 20%. If volatile then I set it to 90% of the recent high and move it up each time the stock is up for the week. If not volatile then 93%."
03/14/2021,stocks,Look up trailing stop losses
03/14/2021,stocks,"This really depends on a lot of factors. Mainly, what you‚Äôre doing. If you are day trading, you‚Äôll see comments from people on here looking for 5-20% and then they exit completely. They have another trade in mind to get the next 20%.

If you are swing trading, your targets are likely higher (but you should have targets). For long term investing, just hold / dollar-cost average each month.

It also depends on the speed of the move. If some small cap doubles on news, take money off the table. I started out taking out half when it doubled. That completely protects your initial capital, and is a great starting point. If it then falls, you can choose to put some money back in. Depending on how bullish you still are on the stock, you might only take out 40%. This still greatly reduces your risk of losing money, but gives you more exposure to further gains. Just don‚Äôt be greedy. It‚Äôs perfectly fine to sell your entire position and collect your money."

03/14/2021,stocks,"That's honestly very nice point tbh I am not too worried about pulling out profits to get into another stock or just for the sake of taking profits but I am worried about when my stocks go up crazy amount in short time.

I noticed a bunch of stocks I been holding that been going up crazy all went down and erased all my profits and now I look like a clown, I wish I sold some or took some off the table when I was up because it was inevitable the stock was going to dip cos it went up way too quick

So now I'm trying to create a strategy where if I see stock go up quick I gotta take some profits off the table and be ready to buy the dip if it dips 

Just need to learn how much to pull out. I feel like pulling off initial investment might be a little too much for me but maybe 20 or 30% might be smart will see if I can use technicals to try to time this"

03/14/2021,stocks,"That's my issue too

I don't mind holding especially if I'm long on a company and nothing changed in my fundamentals but at the same time if it goes up quick will prob fall down again so the smart play in my opinion is to sell a bit that way you can buy the dip if it dips but if it keeps going your still making gains 

The other issue becomes taxes, if stock price goes up quick and I sell so I can buy the dip, I will get taxed more if I had just kept everything in for a year ..."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Well that‚Äôs a different story. You can use a trailing stop loss. 5% seems to be a common setting for this. Or just do like everyone else says and take out small chunks at a time.  But people talking about 2 and 3 hundred percent gains.... on average the stock market returns 10% a year. Just come up with a system, something like every time you make 20% sell 10% or if you bought 10 shares for 100 dollars, every time the value of your holdings hits 130 dollars you sell it back down to 120 or whatever numbers make you feel comfortable."
03/14/2021,stocks,"So I have a list of companies I know reasonably well but i also occasionally jump on some momentum stock that‚Äôs running one way or the other.

Mostly I‚Äôd do companies that have a decent amount of volume and or move a lot on earnings."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yea, I try not to think about taxes too much, could have the reverse effect and you scalp at the wrong time.  Hit or miss, I just go with whatever makes sense with the knowledge I have on the stock."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You should always take some profits if you have a stock that is pumping.  If you buy at 50 and it goes to 75.  Take of a small percentage.  Once it hits 100, take out a bigger chunk.  Consider putting a stop at breakeven and ride the rest forever.  Rotate the profits into other stocks that have potential."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I should probably explain that better. I have three portfolio's. One is my forever holdings, one is mid term plays and the other is short. I use the double/triple rule on my day/swing trades.

Once my position is to a point that it will not be harmed by pulling out the original investment I do so. It may take time to get the complete investment out, but I try."

2021-03-14 04:04:10,stocks,"Do people with more capital have an advantage over people with less capital when it comes to trading? I'm still new and trying to learn but I was curious about this. Say person A has $100,000 that he can execute a trade with, compared to person B who can only put $10,000 into one trade, can the former person leverage their situation to make more profit? I know hedge funds can cause massive fluctuations in price but I'm talking about retail investors who might be a bit on the wealthier side and can exit a position quicker than a hedge fund.

One example I can think of is low-volume stocks. If person A shorted that low volume stock with their 100k, wouldn't they be able to cause a relatively large drop in price since the volume is low and their capital can short a lot of shares? What about vice versa?

Again sorry if this is a stupid question, just tryna learn (also sorry if this the wrong flair, not sure which was one more suitable). Thanks!"
03/14/2021,stocks,Someone with 100 shares can write a covered call that expires months out and a handful of percent out of the money and use it to buy multiple weekly ATM puts and make more in profit on the puts than they lose on the price of their shares if the price is tanking.  There are a handful of ways more money allows for more strategy
03/14/2021,stocks,"You likely will never have enough money to move a ticker

If you all in a low market cap stock at say 7.00 per share and buy 10,000 shares.. every dollar the ticker goes up you make 10,000 dollars. 

Investing is compounding. 30% more of your 300 dollars Wendy saving portfolio is a lot less than 30% of 100k

That‚Äôs the only advantage really, and being able to day trade after 25k"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I can‚Äôt comment on price fluctuation, but in terms of total dollars invested, the person with more money invested makes more money if all things remain the same. 

Additionally, a person with $100k can margin up to their $100k. Whereas a person with $10k can only margin $10k. A person with $100k, and fully margined with another $100k, only needs their portfolio to go up 5% to make what the $10k person has as their total equity ($10k). On the other hand, the $10k person, with an additional $10k fully margined, would need to make a 50% return to just make the same amount. 

It takes money to make money, and the more you have, the easier it becomes."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I may not be understanding the question correctly here, but I would imagine that any move person B can make person A can make 10x as many, or bigger, moves.

As for the dumping into pennystocks, as long as there is someone on the otherside buying/selling there shouldn't be an issue. Sometimes the problem with large positions in pennystocks, is the fact that there isn't always a large buyer, so to execute your trade multiple transactions need to be made which in turn may actually drive the price down from transaction to transaction."
03/14/2021,stocks,"it takes money to make money.  the frustrating part is, if you have 100k and are up 10% you make 10k, if you only have 1ok, you only make 1k. but the amount of due diligence that you do, is the same. so leveraging your time value is better with more capital.  

yes you can margin more, but that is a dangerous game."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Started with ~7k back in Feb after I cashed out for $300 gain. Re-entered back in June and went from investing 200 every check pre-covid to now throwing in anything i can afford into the market

The game completely changes with more capital to play with..so I‚Äôd suggest getting there as fast as u can while ure young"
03/14/2021,stocks,"One of the biggest advantages to more capital is holding tons of shares and selling OTM calls for some cash flow. So I would say yes in that sense but that‚Äôs really it. 

You‚Äôre not gonna move something with $100k and if you do, you‚Äôre not gonna be able to dump it fast enough."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Of course, more money gives more opportunities. A person with $100 000 will see stocks you never hear about, get chances ar private trades and pre-ipo deals well below market price.



And ofc they can buy a few reddit accounts and pump a (penny)stock of their choice with fake DD. Add a fee shills praising the ""deal"" and some reddit gold and sure enough youll foool dozens if not hundreds to buy a shit stock you're selling at a premium. Ps: this isn't financial advice"
03/14/2021,stocks,I think actually having the money to execute your calls would be a significant advantage.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes because you can much more safely target a flat $ value income with more capital. At a certain threshold you can just live off dividends even and earn more than most working people.

As for active trading, there are a lot of opportunities that open up when you can start trading stocks that are $100 to $1000+ per share. Those companies are expensive for a reason

As others have said once you can afford 100 shares  you can make really consistent income from selling covered calls, and of course you get more for higher prices stocks. Something like a TSLA you need 70k for 100 shares but can sell calls for thousands of dollars every week or month."

03/14/2021,stocks,With more capital you can afford to have cash and wait for correction and  buy  stocks at a discounted price just like last week when tech stocks were down for several trading days.
03/14/2021,stocks,You can move the stock if the market cap is low enough and you have enough funds. Especially if you move your bid up people will sell u shares. Obviously ull need some pocket change and be buying above market value...
03/14/2021,stocks,Yes.  Unless your name is Melvin.
03/14/2021,stocks,The biggest advantage is you can afford to make less risky trade and still make a bank.
03/14/2021,stocks,"In low volume stocks if 100k is enough to move the market. Than that could be seen as market manipulation, your broker will probably call you up and tell you quit your shit. 

But really for most stocks listed in an exchange you shouldn't really have trouble filling 100k worth of shares in the regular sessions.

To summarize yes you can bully the market on low volume stocks but that's big no no. Also 1 percent return on 100k is 10 times more than 1 percent return on 10k. So you make more if you are right. But, you run into liquidity issues a lot quicker in thinly traded stocks with 100k than 10k."

Or is it still just going to be largely random?"

I‚Äôve always thought so, but I‚Äôve bought 7000 dollars worth of a low volume biotech stock with a 9 digit market cap and I moved it ten cents.

It took me a while to accumulate the amount I wanted."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Exactly. If the S&P moves up 5%, you make 5K on 100K, but just 500 on 10K. A difference of 4.5K

And suppose you succeeded in identifying a good investment opportunity before the rest of the market? One that brings 100% growth?

Then, 100% return on 100K is 100K compared to just 10K on 10K.
A 90K difference.

In the extreme case that you rode a 10x return on a meme stock?
1M vs. 100K. A 900K difference.

It really is that simple.  More money makes more money and the higher the returns, the larger the effect."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Maybe I worded the question poorly, my bad. Let me try to re-explain. If I shorted a stock with low volume using 100k, would that be enough to move the stock price down solely off my trade? Just like the hedgies did with GME a couple of days ago where they bought the price down from 340 to 200 in minutes but on a much smaller scale.

And if I understood what you said correctly, if person A were to execute a large trade like that, his only issue would be finding someone to buy/sell the shares (depending on whether person A is going long or short)?"

Low volume stocks that are sub penny often have a lot of people watching with alerts, but they can sit dormant for a while. If you start stacking shares, alerts go off and trigger more buying.

If the stock goes past the strike it is considered ‚Äòin the money‚Äô. Someone could theoretically exercise the contract and buy the stock for less than its current price on the market. (In reality contracts are hardly ever exercised early, as there is time and other factors that give the contracts more value). 

When you sell a call for let‚Äôs say 100 strike. 

As the stock approaches that price, having extra money allows you to buy more shares to cover the call you sold. Rather than having the stock price go way past the strike and leaving you with a ‚Äòloss‚Äô(theoretically it is a loss, in reality you could have made money if your cost basis was below the strike you sold)."

I own 100 shares of a stock that is currently valued at $90, so I decide to write a call option with a stock price of $100, just like your example. Someone buys this option and I collect the premium, but now the stock price is approaching $95 and since I have cash on hand, I buy more shares of the stock at $95 and the person who bought the option exercised it and I now have to sell my 100 shares. Is this correct or am I missing something? Wouldn't my profit be dependant on whether the premium was enough to cover how much extra I had to pay to buy the shares at $95?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"If the stock goes to $150 and you sold a 100 strike, you‚Äôll miss out on a lot of money there. 

With extra money you can cover your 100 strike with more shares rather than having to buy the contract back for more than you got paid.


Edit: if a stock I sold a call on goes to my strike + the premium I got paid(25 strike +$100 premium =26 breakeven for example), I‚Äôll often buy 100 more shares and sell a high strike call again.  In this example I‚Äôd set a buy order for 100 at $26. 
Then if the stock goes past my breakeven I can still ride it upwards and my profit is not capped."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Ok, a couple of things, having handled estates and stock certificates before....
1.  Call the investor relations for the company.  It is usually listed on the certificate, although they can change.  They are responsible for accounting of every outstanding share, and who owns it.  There should be a CUSIP number on the certificate that will help identify it.  They can tell you if it‚Äôs a duplicate (like they lost it along the way and had a replacement sent). 
2.  If the shares are actually owned by them (the certificate is legit) I would advise retaining an attorney and getting a good accountant at this point.  If you are the sole heir, and the estate is open still, it may be very wise to have the shares (maybe not all) cashed in by the estate.  This would establish a date of death (dod) valuation for the shares, and the estate would be liable for some taxes.  Depending on the total value of the estate, you may be able to inherit the balance ‚Äútax free‚Äù, making you only responsible for the gains since the DOD.  
3.  Plan your investment strategy.  I would STRONGLY recommend that if you are not familiar with handling this amount of money, you seek out wise counsel.  I can‚Äôt tell you what that means for you, but it certainly isn‚Äôt following subreddits blindly into the abyss.  

Best to you.

There is no substitute for a good accountant and a good attorney, one should have both employed."

03/14/2021,stocks,To actually answer your question: work with a broker. Their physical securities department will help process the paper certificates to book entry. From there you can hold or sell. Source: am financial advisor.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Finally, something I can help with.

OP, I work for a Stock Transfer Agent, not the agent for Meredith, but I can steer you in the right direction.

First, you can't assume that the stock certificate is worth anything at this point. You MUST contact the Stock Transfer Agent for Meredith. That is Equiniti:  800-468-9716. Any time a physical stock certificate is issued it is no longer listed on the records of a broker and instead is listed on the Transfer Agents records. So there is no need to contact a broker first.

You will need some info before calling Equiniti. First, see if you have any old statements kept with the certificate. These will list the account number at Equiniti. Also, whoever is the first name on the certificate, you will need their social security number as well. 

You will need to explain to the Customer Service Rep (CSR) that your Grandparents are deceased and you found a stock certificate among the possessions that they left for you in their will. The CSR will ask you if you know your Grandparent's account number (from a statement) and if not, the social security number of the first name listed on the stock. Thankfully you've already done that legwork. Next they will ask you to pass a verification check. This will include tell them exactly how the account is registered (the names on the stock certificate), the mailing address (most likely the last address your Grandparents lived at) and the last 4 digits of the shareholder's social security number (if you haven't provided the ss# to locate the account). They will also ask for your name and a telephone number for you. All Transfer Agents should capture this information on every call. 

Once you've passed the verification, you can ask the CSR if the certificate is still a valid certificate. They will ask you for the certificate number, which is usually in the upper left hand corner of the certificate. It may include letters and numbers. They will also ask how many shares and when it was issued. With those three pieces of information they can tell if the certificate was previously claimed as lost and replaced (no longer valid) or if it is a valid live certificate.

The CSR will most likely not be able to verify anything else for you over the phone because you cannot prove over the phone that you are the legal heir to the shares. You cannot sell the shares at this time, you cannot change the address, or anything else. We treat you as a third party, not the owner of the stock for security purposes. So they won't tell you the current balance or anything like that. Sorry.

To obtain a current statement and change the address the CSR will most likely advise you to submit a letter in writing along with a certified copy of the court appointment naming you as executor of your Grandparent's estate, dated within 60 days, asking to change the address to your's. Unfortunately, since you are a third party, everything must be done in writing. Again, it is our job to safeguard the owner's account and you cannot prove you are the owner over the phone.

Once you have a current statement and have the address changed, and if the certificate is valid, you have a couple options. 1. Take it to a brokerage firm. They can deposit the certificate into an account. You will most likely need to provide them with the same legal documents you provided Equiniti. 2. You can transfer the shares into an estate account (if there are multiple heirs) or an account in your name. I'm not familiar with Equiniti's transfer process but you will most likely need to fill out Transfer Forms, obtain a Medallion Stamp from a bank or brokerage firm, and possible provide another certified copy of the court appointment. You will also need to mail them the original stock certificate. My company recommends sending the certificate trackable mail and insured for 3% of the value of the stock as this is the cost to replace it if lost.

Once the shares are in your name, whether at the broker or transfer agent, they are yours to do with as you please. 

Now, I will say, there is a very good chance that the certificate was claimed as lost and replaced already. There is also a very good chance that the company had no contact from your Grandparents in over 3 years and sent the shares to your state's Unclaimed Property Office. This is called escheatment. 

I also wouldn't get too excited about stock splits that everyone else is hyping. When a stock splits the shares are either issued in a new certificate or held electronically at the Transfer Agent. So your Grandparents may have cashed those in a long time ago. I also wouldn't get excited about dividends. The fact that you didn't mention that you received any quarterly checks from the company at your Grandparent's address has me feeling the shares are escheated or already cashed.

This is pretty exciting though and it's worth the effort to chase them down. I wish my company was the Transfer Agent because then I could look it up in a few seconds and give you the good or bad news.

If you have any questions, feel free to DM me, and fingers crossed you hit the jackpot!"
03/14/2021,stocks,What happens to the dividend?
03/14/2021,stocks,Don't get ahead of yourself. Odds are they were in the estate and disbursed. Paper stock certificates are basically worthless if there's nothing attached. Protect that paper nonetheless but don't get your hopes up.
03/14/2021,stocks,Would like an update on this once you get it figured out
03/14/2021,stocks,Imagine finding .1% of a billion dollar company inside an old desk....
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hi OP, I actually do this for a living so I want to give you some steps to help you look into this. A lot of people are really excited for you, however what they don't know is that just because you have a paper stock certificate doesn't mean it's worth anything - it's possible the original holder thought they lost it, reported it as lost to their broker or the transfer agent and was able to still redeem the certificate. Yes, that can happen, just because a certificate is lost doesn't mean the original holder can't still get their shares. Until you have at least confirmed the certificate is valid, there's not any point in celebrating.

You have two options here - the first is you can redeem them with your broker, the second is to redeem them directly with the transfer agent. Usually a broker is going to charge you a fee, but the process is a lot easier. If there's someone you are already working with your best bet may be to go to them. The broker will provide instructions to you on what paperwork they need to get this done for you.

The ""manual"" way is to redeem it with the transfer agent. Here are some general instructions to set you on this path:

If you go to the Meredith Co Investor Relations website and scroll down, you will see the transfer agent listed as EQ Shareowner Services. I am not going to put a website or contact information in this message, because I think it's important you do this yourself. Call them & report the death of your grandfather, and speak with someone about whether certificate itself is still valid. If it is, you have completed the first part of this journey. EQ should provide some instructions to you on how you actually need to redeem the stock certificate, and the documents they require may depend on how the shares were held. If it's under your grandfather's sole name, it's possible that EQ may ask you to provide documents for the Estate of your grandfather. Are you the executor of the estate, or are you in contact with them? They may need to be the ones to work with EQ.

Often times for situations like this, the transfer agent may ask that the executor either open up a new account directly with EQ in the name of the estate, or that the Executor provide a written letter of instruction to instruct that an account be opened up for a beneficiary. In both cases, the new account holders will have to complete new account paperwork. This new account will be established to receive the shares from the deceased individual, and will hold book-entry shares - basically electronic shares. Often times this happens because companies don't like liquidating things under deceased individuals SSN's - the IRS doesn't like seeing activity under social's that are assigned to deceased individuals, so any liquidation will most likely need to happen under the EIN of the Estate, or the SSN of a beneficiary.

Once the new account is established and all the paperwork provided, then you can work with EQ to liquidate under the new account or to transfer the shares if you don't wish to liquidate. EQ will be your best friend for every stage of this process.

Final bit of advice - if you end up sending the paper certificate to anyone overnight, please  insure it. You may not need to insure it for the full amount, as like I stated before lost certificates can  still be redeemed, however redeeming a lost certificate often requires you to pay 3-5% of the underlying value of the certificate. Def throw some insurance on any original packages you send through the mail.

Edit : also make copies of anything you send out"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hold up.  You didnt find cash.  And it is not in your name.  

First, the certificate may have been cancelled and would be worthless. If it had been lost and your grandparents had it replaced, it is wall paper.

Second, as it is not in your name, you are going to have to get it registered in whoever inherited it, probably ALl of your grandparents children.  If one or more are already dead thst is a problem.

The bottom line is it is like finding a check made out to someonr else.  Your brokerage firm will NOT under any circumstances let you deposit a certificate made out to anyone other than the exact name(s) on your account.

You have a long road ahead in re-registering the certificate.  Maybe it is all yours and maybe not.

On the splits, they may be held at the registrar for the company.  Or they were paid out when your grandparents died.  It is not likely you eill get the additional shares."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hi there,

I actually just did this for a stock certificate my dad had for 20k shares in Ammo, Inc. (ticker POWW). It was a relatively simple but lengthy process. The biggest hurdle will be proving ownership however. I imagine the stock certificate is in your grandfather's name and you need to prove that your are the inheritor and executor of his estate through the courts. If you are named the executor of the estate then you can begin the process of converting that stock certificate into actual shares in a brokerage account. This process is done via any brokerage like Charles Schwab, J.P. Morgan, etc. I used Vanguard because I already have an account with them. I had to open a new brokerage account owned by my father's estate and then get the shares added to the account. Once the shares were reflected in my dad's estate's brokerage account, I was able to sell them as an executor and the money went into my dad's estate's bank account which is owned and operated by my siblings and I as the inheritors of his estate.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Wow, congrats. Regardless of how this all goes down, don't be afraid to ask the sub for help. Coming over a fat stack of life changing money can be confusing and challenging, so having a plan is good."
03/14/2021,stocks,Don't compare the shares to todays price per share - the reason is that a lot has happened since 1988. The stock could have split and it has earned dividends. The value would need computed from the day of purchase.  Congratulations.
03/14/2021,stocks,Need a final update on if it‚Äôs worth
03/14/2021,stocks,"The instructions for cashing in should be on the certificate, if not call the main office. Do not hand it over to anyone, especially unsigned. Call the main office to find out."

03/14/2021,stocks,Congratulations. You are a millionaire buddy
03/14/2021,stocks,"Go to this website here for stock information

https://ir.meredith.com/stock-information/default.aspx

If your grandparents bought in 1988 there was a 2:1 stock split in 1995 and again 1997

6722 * 2 in 1995 = 13,444 shares;
13,444 * 2 in 1997 = 26,888 shares

Total today
26,888 * $36.96 current price = $993,780.48

Plus all the dividends that were paid on these stocks through the years, example 2019 $0.575 per share quarterly.

Have fun with that money!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hey OP, if this hasn't been said already, you need to also look into if there are physical uncashed dividend checks. When my grandmother passed away my parents spent hours and hours going through her stuff and found paper shares, unclaimed dividend checks, unclaimed property searches turned up thousands in checks. She was brilliant to the point of crazy, and had more money squirreled away than my parents ever expected. To give you an idea, they wrote a check to the IRS for almost $5,000,000.00 when it was all said and done AFTER they split the money and property 50/50 with mom's brother. If your grandfather still had paper shares hiding around, there could be more stuff you don't know about. 

Congrats BTW.  Find a good lawyer and maybe an accountant to help you though this."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Absolutely. 36.96/share last Friday.

For the converting the certificate AND past dividends you'll need to contact Meredith Investor Services:

https://ir.meredith.com/investor-resources/default.aspx

If they start bleating about they can't help you with the past dividends, the Minnesota Government (where Meredith is based) is the next place. Companies don't by law get to keep unclaimed dividends. They have to turn them over to the state, which has a department to handle these situations. (It happens a lot). It is called escheatment.

https://ir.meredith.com/investor-resources/default.aspx

Last annual dividends I noted were $2.30 so nothing to be ignored. 

Expect some tax consequences too.

Good luck and persevere. Paperwork inbound!"
03/14/2021,stocks,did op confirm whether the certs were valid before deleting?
03/14/2021,stocks,Don‚Äôt cash that in right now. This company is just rebounding and has a bright future!
03/14/2021,stocks,Most brokers have a process for depositing physical certificates. Congratulations
03/14/2021,stocks,"call the transfer agent, if not, if you have a broker send you a form, i think it is called the stock record .  you fill it out so you can deposit the shares into your brokerage account.  you also may be entitled to dividends of they were not sent out to your grand parents , since it was a physical certificate.  good luck and congrats"
03/14/2021,stocks,Hey that‚Äôs interesting. I just found a stock certificate for 24 shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT) from 1995. And I was wondering the same thing. Someone tell me I just made some cash?
03/14/2021,stocks,"I would hold it for another year or two, that company got devastated by the covid crash but has been on a huge recovery for the last few months, if it returns to pre covid prices which judging by the chart looks like it‚Äôs well on its way, it could nearly double in the next 6-12 months or so 

Or cash in a third of it to have a decent cushion to sit on while the rest of it recovers"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Congratulations, and fuck you haha."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Save you a call to IR.

Go to the IR page of the website, scroll to the footer and Monday am call the transfer agent. The stock is in your grandpa's name in their records if his name is on the certificate.

They will need a few things from you to transfer the stock into your name ie death cert, will, if there is one, or probate. Then they will provide the steps to send the certificate and transfer it into your name. To get it into your brokerage account, you will need to contact your broker's compliance department to have the shares transferred into account.

This process will take a few weeks, several calls, and emails to sort through. Depending where you are there may be a tax impact, so be prepared for that."

So I was able to collect the money they sold it for, but the stock had gone way up since that. Something to find out about. Otherwise, congratulations!!!!"

03/14/2021,stocks,Holy shit dude congrats!
03/14/2021,stocks,"First thing first, contact the Transfer Agent for the company, the stocks will be on file with them, that‚Äôs why stocks are Registered securities. Looks like it‚Äôs EQ Shareholder Services. They‚Äôll know the legal and internal requirements for transferring ownership to you or whoever is the legal owner/holder. 

I cannot stress this enough though, the transfer agency won‚Äôt be able to sell them, you‚Äôll need a broker for that. I would suggest you actually get them in your name and just let the dividends roll in or reinvest the dividends.

Given the age of the shares you‚Äôll also probably have to convert them to a more current form, class C01 to C04 for instance. Corporations consolidate and split securities all the time, and they typically roll into one another. 

The hardest thing is going to be proving you should be the owner. They‚Äôll probably go into the name of your grandparents estate, but not necessarily. Talk to an estate lawyer about it. 

It‚Äôs kind of a long process to get the correct forms and stamps but it can be done. Good luck!"

03/14/2021,stocks,"I work in the financial markets in the U.K. I used to deal with estates as part of my role, helping clients who inherited shares get them on a platform and then I would advise them on investments.

I once had an old lady whose husband had died, she inherited a share certificate of 75,000 greggs shares of 0.25p nominal value or something low like that.

She had marked it down as being worth ¬£15k, I can remember telling her and the excitement as the 75,000 were actually worth c¬£24 ($30) each... so over a ¬£1.5m holding - for a working class lady whose husband had worked for the company a long time ago, was a huge moment for them.

If you want to put the stock in your account you need to sign them.SIGN THEM AT THE BROKERAGE OFFICE! I suggest a known brokerage firm like Merrill Lynch or Fidelity.

03/14/2021,stocks,"I believe you get a stepped up cost basis using the date of his death.  Was it identified in the will that the shares belong to you?  Because other family members might stake claim or maybe it was part of the settlement but it wasn't included because of it being paper maybe no one knew where they were.  I think on the stock certificates, you should see a company name listed, like a transfer agent or a broker dealer possibly a NYC based company.  They know what's out based on the certificate(s) number(s).  If he put them in an account at some time, you could've come across the paper certificates but they were transfered to a brokerage acct electronically and are actually worthless.  I know I had some old Marriott Host certificates that were already transferred even though I was in possession of the physical certificates.  They should be able to tell you the date that happened if it did.  If you aren't sure where the dividends went and they weren't reinvested or they were being deposited and the account got closed, they get turned over to the state and collect interest.   Contact Unclaimed Property for the state he lived in. Good Luck!"

Ten years is a long time, though not impossible, for it to remain with the holder with no activity. 

There are laws for each state that govern the timeline but the definitions are interpreted by each holder differently. (If the dividends are being reinvested, is it really dormant?)

They could have been transferred to an account prior and the paper is just pretty now like you say. Or maybe youe a mil richer. From there you can also speak with an advisor, cpa, attorneys, estate specialist and whatever else plus a dedicated rep to assist with what kind of account you would need to setup pending the outcome."

03/14/2021,stocks,"You will need to contact the transfer agent (computer share, EQ, broadridge) who is the record keeper for the shares.  Just google company name and transfer agent.  They have some paperwork that can retire the physical stock certficate and convert it into book entry shares.  A bank will need to provide something called a medallion stamp so you will need to work with your bank.  I'm a financial advisor and do this for my clients at least once a year."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I also found some from my grand parents. You need to call the company‚Äôs investor relations office.  They can tell you if the certificate is still valid.  In my case, the company had already dissolved all the physical certificates.  They attempted to make stock holders whole based on the information they had available.  If they were unable to contact the person whom was issued the certificate the stock/funds were submitted to the states lost money fund."

03/14/2021,stocks,Take it to a financial advisor at some brokerage firm that you feel comfortable doing business with. They will help you with opening an account and getting the shares converted to book entry for so you can trade them much easier. I will mention that there are typically some costs that come with converting these shares but if it‚Äôs just one physical cert then it will be a very small amount. I help process these things all the time at work. Congrats on finding those!

03/14/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs possible to own the certificate and not the stock. There should be some sort of ID number that tells the transaction. I would imagine  a broker will know if these stocks still are the possession of your grandfather or his heirs. 

https://www.exhibitindexes.com/blog/mature-money-how-to-tell-if-old-stock-certificates-are-worth-anything/"
03/14/2021,stocks,Sounds like this question can be specifically asked/handled at a bank. Someone's phishing for a loop.
03/14/2021,stocks,"You can do this with a broker at a real brokerage, i.e. NOT Robinhood. We‚Äôre all assuming your grandparents are deceased. If not, it‚Äôs theirs and they deposit it in a brokerage account. Otherwise, someone else was bequeathed it and that person does it. Then there‚Äôs accounting because the stock may have split and those shares will be deposited. If there were dividends, the grandparents would have gotten the checks. So whomever owns these shares takes it to a real brokerage and they do this without extra cost."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Think first! If you cash it in you‚Äôll pay over $100k in capital gains just to the feds and then state and local taxes depending where you live. It‚Äôs probably a qualified dividend so the rate would be the same as a long-term capital gain. At the current yield you would get 16k every three months. That is a stellar appreciation these days. You‚Äôd be hard pressed to find a comparable return. You‚Äôre due dividends. A Stockholder is an owner. A certificate doesn‚Äôt expire or become abandoned. Also, the shares can‚Äôt be shorted as long as you hold the certificate. Those assets are subject to the distribution specified in his will even if undiscovered at that time. Congrats! Grandpa did well!"

So they (there broker) might have those .. if they haven't been turned over to the state unclaimed money fund."

03/14/2021,stocks,"This is a very accurate answer. I, too, am in this line of business and handle these matters all the time. For those worried about mailing and overnighting the certificates, it is done frequently and successfully."

There‚Äôs also the very distinct possibility that the certificate was cancelled due to being ‚Äúlost‚Äù, and the shares could have already been deposited to an account in the past."

What's more likely: The stock was cashed in years ago, or the (edit: million dollar) paper certificate was left just haphazardly laying around?"

03/14/2021,stocks,"> Good luck retiring early with $900k

what about high yield dividend etfs at like 5%+, thats 45k a year for life which is a good paying job"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Take that money and stick it in a broad fund, wait 5-10 years, and retire. That would net you $1.3-1.9 mil, which would be plenty for a modest but comfortable life.  

You could wait less if you already have some investments, or are in a position to add to the principal."
03/14/2021,stocks,"$900K put in a safe long term div stock, like let‚Äôs say the SPYD, would give div payments of 41k annually. Is it luxurious salary, no, but it‚Äôs certainly enough to retire if you live modestly. Many people don‚Äôt even make that much money while working. 

That said, it makes sense to continue working for 5-10 more years, let the money grow to anywhere from 1.2M - 1.7M with around 7% growth in some etfs, then retire with a 81k annual dividend."
03/14/2021,stocks,It's not exactly hard to do that.  Put it into ETFs and solid dividend paying stocks and live off your $50k a year income.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes, absolutely. After paying off debts, I would put a chunk in growth stocks or growth ETFs, and the rest in a dividend ETF or another high dividend stock. IBM would be my first choice with a dividend of over 5%. I would also add $50k to my current GME position."
03/14/2021,stocks,You could move to a country like mine and live live a king/queen with that kind of paper Hahaha
03/14/2021,stocks,"Or re-invest it into something else, hell the stock he's holding is currently $36, twice it's reached over $60 and its on it's way back up. He could just hold onto it and let it grow a bit more."
03/14/2021,stocks,"With close to $1 million, letting it sit in the market without touching it can net close to $100k a year in returns. He may not be retiring early but he is close to retiring early. The saying goes the first million is the longest and hardest."
03/14/2021,stocks,Honestly just throw it in a bank acc and live on the interest that well over 38 grand a year
03/14/2021,stocks,"As far as accountants, the best one for you is one that has similar investments to yours.  For example, if your investing in real estate, find an accountant that is investing in it as well.  As far as attorneys go, most will tell you they ‚Äúcan‚Äù do this or that, I always ask, ‚Äúhave you done this‚Äù, and how many times.  In either case you are employing them for their services.  Treat it as you would if you were looking to hire an employee, and don‚Äôt be afraid to sever the relationship (fire them) if they are not a good fit."
03/14/2021,stocks,"> I've always wondered, how does one find a ""good"" accountant/attorney?

Recommendations from friends and family are a good first step. 

If you know someone in a related industry, you can ask them.  For instance, if I needed a real estate attorney I could ask a real estate agent I've worked with previously. 

Sometimes you can also reach out to people you work with. For instance, if I needed a CPA, I could reach out to one of the accountants I work with for a recommendation. I don't really now the accountants where I work, but they'd be better then just going on yelp."

03/14/2021,stocks,Probably waiting for you in the account unless they had checks being mailed to them
03/14/2021,stocks,If the dividend hasn‚Äôt been dispersed in the 10 years you‚Äôve had their estate it kinda sounds like they already cashed in the stock and kept the OG for paper filing
03/14/2021,stocks,Odds are higher then but if they died circa 2010 there's a good chance the shares were in an account at some point that was cashed out. It's pretty rare to hear about a find like this with actual valid shares behind it but I'm rooting for you.
03/14/2021,stocks,Be prepared for this to take a while and dont get discouraged. This may take weeks or even months.  Just have patience.
03/14/2021,stocks,RemindMe!
03/14/2021,stocks,"Thanks haldcha. I could completely understand why someone would be afraid to send a million dollar certificate certified overnight, I imagine it feels like a lottery ticket. Once you've done it a thousand times though, it  loses its anxiety inducing effects. 

OP, also make copies of anything you send, added an edit up above."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Unfortunately, no. Inherited IRAs and associated RMDs only come into play if the asset was an IRA or retirement account to begin with. That does not appear to be the case as OP presents.  Edit to add: But, you could certainly arrange something similar in a taxable account under your own standards. There would be no requirement to have assets liquidated within a certain period of time."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Be careful they never hear about this or else they'll suddenly remember that ""Family is important"" and try some legal fuckery when you tell em no.

03/14/2021,stocks,DO NOT fill out anything on the back of the stock certificate. Just leave it blank. If you fill anything out it is easier for someone to steal the certificate. Transfer agents will always tell you to leave it blank.

03/14/2021,stocks,"My man lmao. But seriously, this if invested in a boring ass investment like the S&P would net you an average yearly income of around 50k plus. You could easily live of this then pull it out and retire with it too."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Your enthusiasm is awesome, and screw those hedge funds but you should really sit down with a financial advisor or financial planner and talk things through with them. This is a life changing amount of money and you need to use it wisely. There are lots of articles on how to interview your financial advisor when selecting one. Find someone who has the kind of ethics you respect. I work in this industry, if you need help formulating questions let me know.

I don‚Äôt know if you have read about what happens to people who win the lottery but they often live really enjoyable lives for 5-10 years and then the money runs out and they commit suicide. It is awful. Don‚Äôt put yourself in that position. Think about this money as an employee, not as a winning lottery ticket.

Here are a few things to consider from someone who works with investors.

-	If you want to put 3-4% in some YOLO investments then go for it, but make sure you keep that separate from your primary investment money
-	keep your job. One of the biggest reasons the aforementioned lottery winners commit suicide is that the money runs out and they have to find a job again. Having some normalcy in your life will keep you sane.
-	another reason to keep working: if you show an income you are allowed to invest lots of money in your 401k and Roth IRA. These have significant tax advantages long term. Find out of your 401k has a Roth option. Maximize both. You‚Äôll be able to invest ~60k a year while spending some of the money that you inherited.
-	don‚Äôt tell people about your inheritance. Money changes people and relationships. Go look on the financial independence subreddit, lots of folks there keep their savings a secret because there have been so many horror stories of people asking for money coming out of the woodwork.

03/14/2021,stocks,legal advice is a place where idiot redditors and LEOs like to give shit advice and circlejerk about tree law. there are no actual lawyers there and anyone claiming to be one is 99/100 times lying.
03/14/2021,stocks,"1.	if you‚Äôre not a lawyer, you‚Äôre not licensed to give legal advice. And if you ARE a lawyer, it‚Äôs generally unethical to give legal advice to someone who isn‚Äôt a client, which is why lawyers are always saying things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a lawyer, but not *your* lawyer‚Äù, and ‚Äúnothing in this comment should understood as legal advice‚Äù. The lawyer-client relationship creates a number of legally-binding obligations. 

2.	It‚Äôs ok to give legal *information,* though. The distinction is, I can tell you where to find a lawyer, or the field of law a problem falls into. Anyone can. But the instant *should* or *ought to* enter the situation, you‚Äôre crossing a line. Even just ‚Äúthis sounds complicated, you should talk to a lawyer‚Äù is closer to the line than some lawyers will go. 

3.	Even if neither of those restrictions applied, the law is incredibly fact-dependent. The only valid answer you could give for 99.9% of questions is, ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. Not because you‚Äôre being cagey, but because it does. If someone asked, 

>	‚Äúwill I get out of a ticket if I get into a one-car accident going 95 on a back road, hit a railroad track, launch my car 100+ ft in the air, wreck it, walk away uninjured, ale a farmer up at 3am, be too drunk to tell him my address, have him call the police, confess all of the above to them, and blow a .31?‚Äù

   The answer would probably be ‚Äúno‚Äù. But I just got a guy out of all charges in exactly that situation because it turns out the police violated his rights during arrest and most of that evidence had to be suppressed. You just can never say. 

4.	That sub by its very nature entirely ignores all of the above. Which tells you all you need to know about the quality of the ‚Äúadvice‚Äù. Also, it‚Äôs all police as others have mentioned, but the advice on criminal stuff is bad, and there‚Äôs all kinds of advice on non-criminal stuff."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Another user pointed out that this company pays pretty generous dividends that arent accounted for in the original figures. At 3-6% annual dividends OP is likely looking at hundreds of thousands in dividends, which if they had been reinvested throughout would have gotten them to a million far sooner"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Consider this:

The median household income in the United States is ~$60k. If you are saving 20% if your gross income, as is recommended, that would be $1,000/mo. Your essential expenses should be about $30k, so an appropriate emergency fund would be $15k, which will take you 15 months to create. Once that money is set aside, there is really no reason to keep adding to it, because it actually loses value over time as a result of inflation. That means that your $1,000/mo savings can go straight into your long-term investments. Let‚Äôs say that your investment horizon is 30 years and let‚Äôs assume a modest return of 10% annualized over those 30 years. In that span of time, you would have invested $360k in cash and it would be worth **$1.9 million**. That‚Äôs the effect of compound interest and the time value of money. All you would have to do to get these results is drop $1k a month into an S&P500 ETF and not touch it for 30 years. 

If you started doing this straight out if college, you would be 52 and sitting on $1.9 million. Here what‚Äôs even better, if you restructured that $1.9 million portfolio to be income producing, which, done properly, should pay you about 3% in dividends and interest payments, then you would be able to pay yourself a $57,000 salary *on the dividends and interest alone*. That means that your $1.9 million can continue to sit there and grow, albeit at a slower rate. Once you factor in your social security benefits and the return from an employer matched 401k, then there  is really no reason that you couldn‚Äôt retire at age 52 and spend more years retired than you did working. If you chose not to retire that early and worked another 10 years and retired at age 62, you‚Äôd have $5.3 million and be able to pay yourself a $159k salary. 

TL;DR: you don‚Äôt have to be dead to be a millionaire."

I've never dealt with a physical stock before, but the money goes to your broker then to you when doing electronically. My guess is either a broker has the dividends or the company does?

Just take care of saving the money, if you invest it right, the dividends alone can become a source of income every 3 months.

I don't know the dividend situation, but you might now even want to cash the stock in and just start receiving the dividends. That will be easiest for you tax wise because the taxes will only hit once you sell.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Wat? I get reddit hates baby boomers but that's totally untrue

edit: from 2 minutes of googling:

> Among older cohorts, Boomers (ages 51 to 69) are currently divided (45% favor, 48% oppose), while Silents (ages 70-87) are the only generation in which significantly more oppose (53%) than favor (39%) gay marriage. 

> Born between 1946 and 1964, LGBT Baby Boomers advanced the U.S. gay rights movement and within one generation succeeded in changing social attitudes from seeing homosexuality as a psychiatric condition to winning same-sex marriage rights and acknowledgement of their civil rights in an increasing number of states. 

> I came out as a lesbian at the age of 16 in the 1950s. Those were the bad old days, probably the worst time in the history of the country to be gay or lesbian or transsexual. The psychiatry profession defined us in its diagnosis and statistical manual of mental disorders as sick, beginning in 1952. In every state of the union, sodomy was against the law ‚Äî all homosexuals were criminals.

So the nadir of gay rights was when the eldest of the baby boomers were 6 years old.  

> The Stonewall riots (also referred to as the Stonewall uprising or the Stonewall rebellion) were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the gay (LGBT) community[note 1] in response to a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. Patrons of the Stonewall, other Village lesbian and gay bars, and neighborhood street people fought back when the police became violent. The riots are widely considered to constitute one of the most important events leading to the gay liberation movement[2][3] and the twentieth century fight for LGBT rights in the United States.[4]"

03/14/2021,stocks,Unfortunately you‚Äôre incorrect.  Stocks are not bearer bonds or even close. Actually most stocks are held in [street name](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/185.asp) and allocated to someone‚Äôs account by a brokerage firm. If the stock certificates are in the grandfather‚Äôs name they can only be transferred by his grandfather or his estate. Stocks are not like bearer bonds. You have to have legal title to them to transfer them. In fact one often needs to get a [medalion certification](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medallion_signature_guarantee) which is a form of guarantee that the person is able to transfer shares of a company before someone will accept the shares.  There are companies or financial institutions which issue these. Many brokerage firm will accept the stock certificates and hold them on the client‚Äôs account.

But also they have been issuing quarterly dividends for many years (increasing each year), which they could also be entitled to.

I would split it between a couple of low-cost market ETFs, keep my day job and wait for a decade for it to double.  Then, assuming the market hasn't taken a dump, you could just take out 50-100k per year and basically never touch the principle.   If you look at the returns on S&P 500 for the past 20 years, it is an average of just under 6%.

Better yet, you could pick up a portfolio of investment properties and make it your day-job to manage them."

We lost 10-15k on this mini dip, of that was 200-300k I'd be losing it.

03/14/2021,stocks,"You can check the hypothetical returns of $10,000 since the inception of DIV (2013) [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=4&startYear=2013&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=DIV&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=ITOT&allocation2_2=100&symbol3=VTSAX&allocation3_3=100). In this scenario, dividends are reinvested, so it tracks the total portfolio size over time. Sure, the 7% dividend is nice, but is far outweighed by the returns of the asset increasing in value over time, as with a total stock index. 

DIV stocks do not typically appreciate much in the long run, and can be susceptible to market corrections like last year, where your dividend gains from 2014-2020 would have been completely wiped out by the value of the stock decreasing by nearly 50%. In fact, the DIV valuation still has not even recovered since the market correction in 2020, while the total stock index recovered in 7 months. **The total stock market fund out performs the DIV portfolio by more than double** (since 2014). Like I said though, it all depends on how close you are to retirement. A nice sized portfolio still will get a decent dividend and could be used as income.


Additionally, I think you're confusing the return of DIV dividends. The payout is 7% annually, but the dividends are paid monthly. A 7% return per month is a bit insane."

2021-03-14 03:26:15,stocks,"Triterras $TRIT DD **Summary**

* Triterras is a global trade finance company that is using blockchain technology to bring financing opportunities to parties with who banks do not want to work with due to increased regulations and thus lower margins with traditional systems.
* Recent price action is due to accusations of fraud in a short report which caused a 50% price drop.
* My belief is that many of the allegations are not substantive, and the ones I haven't dismissed are highly speculative.
* Recent events have added support to the companies reliability and future growth and have, in my opinion, resolved the worry of fraud.
* Recent filings show the short float might suddenly jump from 36% to 45%-50% due to a decrease in the float.
* If this is the case, then a strong price reversal is imminent.

**Company Overview** 

[Triterras](https://triterras.com/) is hoping to address the market of small and medium-sized companies who do global trade but who do not work with large enough supplies to qualify for traditional financing with banks. This is largely due to new stricter regulations to protect the parties involved. Such regulations are beneficial in avoiding cases of fraud, but make it less worthwhile for banks to work with companies who don't make enough money to qualify the increased effort and thus lower profit margins on the bank's side.

Triterras is using blockchain technology to more efficiently provide financing whilst still meeting the new regulatory requirements. They're not the only company trying to do this, but they're the one who is furthest ahead. They are also largely focused on bringing traders to the platform, fully aware of the fact that the network effect is both the greatest hurdle and greatest advantage in situations like this.

**What happened?**

A couple of short reports ([A](https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-triterras-trit)) ([B](https://phase2partners.egnyte.com/dl/bZMK5uwx27/)) were released with accusations of fraud. The former is relatively speculative, but it has been shared on Reddit before so I included it. Many of the concerns seem far-fetched, especially given the renewed support recently (discussed later). The later report is far more detailed. Many of the accusations are directly discussed in Triterras's [announcement](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/triterras-company-statement-in-response-to-short-report) and have in fact already been brought up by the SEC in an earlier [form](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-033318/). Obviously, Triterras didn't provide as much of an answer as I would have liked, but again I think many of the accusations are speculative. A seeking alpha article provided a very thorough look into the situation and much of the comments section furthered the discussion with really valuable perspectives (written by 1035 Capital Management, I cannot link the article per sub rules). I highly recommend reading through all of these resources in full.

As a result of these reports, the share price fell from the $11-$14 range to the $6-$8 range. I believe a large number of short positions were taken out during this time, see [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/TRIT) and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/trit). The current shares shorted is around 8 million shares with a float of around 24 million shares.

**Recent Events**

Recently, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/37/triterras-announces-strategic-partnership-with-western) a partnership with Western Union, a massive leader in money transfers and financial services. The description of the partnership provides renewed support in Triterras being a sound company with a hopeful future. 

Moreover, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/38/triterras-signs-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-invoice-bazaar) the intent to purchase Bazarr, furthering the regional expertise of the company and providing renewed support for future growth.

**Institutional Ownership and Buyback**

Here is where things get a bit more speculative. With the drop in share price, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/triterras-authorizes-50-million-share-repurchase-program) a $50 million dollar buyback. The verbiage used is 

*""Triterras‚Äô recent share price has created an attractive opportunity for the company to institute a stock repurchase program. The Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company‚Äôs common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may or may not be conducted through 10b5-1 plans.""* 

The key is that the buyback may be done through privately negotiated transactions, remember this.

Looking at the holders on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRIT/holders?p=TRIT), we can see that Fidelity owns a large number of shares through both FMR LLC and Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunity Fund (I'll call them FAGOF, lol). On 02/08 they submitted a [SC 13G form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001327/) to the SEC detailing their new positions (this data is not accounted for on yahoo finance yet). We see that FMR LLC's position is essentially unchanged, while FAGOF more than doubled their position, from 2.2 to 5 million shares. A month later, on 03/10, they submitted another [SC 13G/A form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001436/) detailing their new position. Now, we see that FMR LLC owns only 56 shares. During that time, the share price was around $7. That brings the value of their position during that time to around $50-$60 million. Now the trading volume during that time was only a couple million a day, and we see a steady decline from mid-February to late-February. So, and here's the speculative part, my belief is that FMR LLC sold a majority of their position to Triterras as part of the $50 million buyback previously mentioned. The remaining shares were slowly liquidated from mid-February to late-February.

But wait, why would FMR LLC sell all their shares, especially when the price was so low? Well first, so far as I can tell, we don't know what they paid for those shares. It's entirely possible they still made a profit even at this price point. In general, I imagine, Funds like these don't like to participate in stocks that are so crazy volatile and not super reliable. Triterras is a growth company, and the recent news and everything going crazy may have encouraged Fidelity to back out of the craziness. On the other hand, Fidelity's fund focused on growth, FAGOF, which can take the volatility and risk, more than doubled their stake.

Let's assume that 6-8 million shares of FMR LLC's position were sold directly to Triterras through an off-market deal. Triterras already said this was an option, and FMR wouldn't want to trade that many shares on the open market with such a low average volume since it would tank the price. That means the buyback is complete, and the float is now around 16-18 million shares. Further, this means the short float, which was 36%, is now around 45%-50%. Also, right now, the daily volume is low, so the days to cover is around 3, according to the latest [short interest report](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/trit/short-interest).

**Now What?**

Well, if the accusations are true, then the company will probably go bye-bye, or at least get another drop and take a while to recover or just fizzle away into nothingness. But, if instead, the accusations are false or insignificant, then I expect a good price reversal. The current price is only depressed because of the belief in the accusations. So, with a renewed sense in the companies outlook, and a potential 50% short float, the price could easily go back to its past levels or higher.

**Closing Remarks and My Position**

I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter. I didn't go into many specifics about the short reports, especially the analysis of the actual blockchain transactions in report B. If anyone here is familiar with the data I'd love to hear your opinion.

I currently have a few short, medium, and long-term call contracts and a handful of shares. And of course, this is not financial advice and I am not encouraging you to buy this stock. I'm sharing my findings and am eager for feedback on things to reconsider."
03/14/2021,stocks,For a company which did $16M revenue it's pretty shitty to spend $50M on a share buy back right after going public when that is like 40% more than they expect to generate in sales for 2021. A responsible and ambitious company would use that capital to fast track its operational build out or maybe look to acquire assets to improve its business.

03/14/2021,stocks,"That's a good point that I hadn't really considered. At the same time though, the current share price assuming everything is legit is extremely undervalued, meaning now is perhaps one of the best opportunities for a buyback. That combined with low-interest rates and very low company liabilities mean it may not be an awful idea. Though I agree in terms of a company focusing on growth and beating competitors to dominance, an investment towards that goal would perhaps be more prudent. Do you see any positive part of the buyback, or does it totally leave a bad taste in your mouth?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Agreed it's sort of mixed news. I would expect a ""fintech, growth"" company to have better opportunities to grow organically than buying back shares. On the other hand, the price was beaten down so low, so quickly it's almost a 50% return to put the money directly into buybacks - that's an insane return on free money."
03/14/2021,stocks,Do you have an opinion on the future of the company or the controversy surrounding it?
03/14/2021,stocks,It does tend to make you think they are very confident they are buying back at an excellent value.  Somebody ask them and report back.  :D
03/14/2021,stocks,Just that investing in this company requires a long term hold. They're barely just beginning.
03/14/2021,stocks,I mean in the announcement I linked that‚Äôs essentially what they said.
2021-03-14 03:20:14,stocks,"Citron/Hindenburg Discussion Is there a reason that so much credence is given to Citron and Hindenburg? It‚Äôs something that has puzzled me for a while now. They are more often wrong than they are correct, and everyone knows it. Yet they still move markets and drive stocks down on a regular basis. It‚Äôs like the boy who cried wolf, but people listen to them. Could someone explain this phenomenon to me?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Citron called Enron. For several years now all of Citron's shorts 10Xed though. They scared me out of Ubiquiti at $30 a share when I was in at $26 or something and now it's $350 ...

Never forgot, and glad my modest stake in GME helped fuck them over."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I am not too familiar with Hindenburg's other reports, but they nailed it on Nikola, and their claims in RIDE are mostly correct. IMO, there are too many new EV companies now, a lot of them focus on creating a good story to appeal to the investors, instead of focusing on how to mass produce good EVs for consumers"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Citron gets TV time, Hindeburg I believe was know for a short call on one of the weed stocks."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I come with a biased opinion supportive of the company they are targeting now. But in most cases, them, or someone in cahoots with them use torpedoes that strike stop losses and scare uninformed investors. When an investor is trapped with 30% losses and a stock is still dropping, any retailer is going to shit the bed. 

But if you‚Äôve been around the block once or twice, you carry a covered put for these easily targeted companies. I lowered my buy in price on lordstown to 13.8 Friday and bought back a put end of day at 15. You just gotta understand your investments, but I don‚Äôt think many newer investors do

Either way, I don‚Äôt think short selling firms is the right solution to outing fraud. But a fraud police is needed"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hinderburg research always looks more detailed to me with a lot of DD and investigative stuff.  

Citron follows the headlines.  I remember his call on CC;  I like the stock as being a number 1 player in two categories -  TiO2 and fluorocarbons. It dropped to $6 and I purchased more - I still say thank you very much !  So I always read their stuff and make my own decision."
03/14/2021,stocks,"For Hindenburg to come out and say that Rivian is a scam because their orders are not contractually binding is a fucking joke. It‚Äôs not like they said they were üòÇ. Anyone can plop down a deposit for a right to order a vehicle . That was their smoking gun and it was laughable. 

Do I think all 100k preorder will stick? Depends on how the first 5000 go. With increasing commodities prices coming I‚Äôm sure the price of the truck will rise too."
03/14/2021,stocks,Citron has never been good with tech stocks.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Hindenburg Research has about a 50% success rate and an average return of -10% on their investment advice.

When you factor in that they have a vested interest in effectively pumping their sell position and that they literally cause panic selling, they are quite a bit more fraudulent than ‚Äúreputable‚Äù."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Not true- Citron still shorts, they just don‚Äôt make their positions public."
03/14/2021,stocks,Exactly. Elon musk said the same thing about the cyber truck pre orders. Literally anyone can pre-order one. If you're a company you'd obviously promote the number of pre-orders but expect that there's going to be people who ultimately back out.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Prove the short reports were wrong, im not talking about 
their roi if they are correct but the market is pumping the fraudulent stocks then they are still reputable as in they don't make up facts, like the current lordstown resech is 100% real."
03/14/2021,stocks,Posting facts vs the way you spin them and the motivation behind doing so are different things.
03/14/2021,stocks,"What‚Äôs the difference between Hindenburg doing research on a company and announcing they are short in a company because of A, B and C vs. Cathy Wood doing research and going on CNBC saying she‚Äôs going long in a company because of X, Y and Z?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"It's amazing to me that people only think that short have an agenda, like yes they are short but the analyst at goldman and the guy telling you to buy apple on reddit also probably long the stock, so most of the information you get is from people who have an agenda its just the shorts who are targeted for it."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I mean the idea would obviously be to take both opinions with a grain of salt and do your own research. And then the only other thing you can possibly take into account is their track record, which again, Hindenburg‚Äôs is relatively poor.

If you scroll up a little bit, my first reply was to a comment saying that Hindenburg isn‚Äôt wrong very often. They‚Äôre wrong about 50% of the time. Yes they list facts, but the conclusions they draw from those facts are wrong a lot of the time."

2021-03-14 01:37:01,stocks,"How Many Stocks is Too Many I was having a conversation with someone on this subreddit about how many stocks you should have in your portfolio at one time. In my research, there is no consensus as to how many you should have. I have 32 different companies in my portfolio right now and will be adding five more with money from my stimulus check. 

I‚Äôm not aiming for a set number, but I‚Äôll likely have 30-50 from different sectors and build up my positions in those companies. I do research on all of these companies and keep up with current news on them as best I can. Assuming I continue to do my DD on every position I have, how many stocks would you recommend having? Is there a number you would consider too many?"
03/14/2021,stocks,A man died once by eating 413 chicken nuggets. So I would say anything under 412 and you're fine.
03/14/2021,stocks,I think until you cant keep track of them all.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Depends on what you're doing.  Sounds like a lot of stocks to be going long on, but hey if you have a plan for each of them, who am I to say?    


I just looked and I'm holding 31 right now, but I day trade.  So that number jumps around quite a bit.  Of those, there's 5 or 6 that I plan on holding long term.  (outside of the ones I'm just bag holding on...  hahaha  meh...  pennystocks...  it's a racket... ) :D  


I'm long on F, NVDA, SWKS, TSM, and ORC.  The rest are a good green day away from pure liquid."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I have >100 different stocks on average. The amount doesn't seem too large for me personally because I have specific sectors/countries that I organize things by. To reduce the mental effort of keeping track of everything I try to focus very intensely on a DD for a single theme/sector for a period of time, buy what seems to be the best, and then hold it for a year or more. 

Yes there is some redundancy, but that works out for me during tax time because I can sell one at a loss if needed and then buy into its closest equivalent."
03/14/2021,stocks,The way I see my portfolio is that if one of them wins it‚Äôs gotta be big enough to carry the rest if they all fail. So I don‚Äôt have that many positions.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Unless ur account is a sizeable amount, wtf r u doing with 32 positions and looking to add more?

Chase ur winners and highest conviction plays. Diversification naturally comes when ur account grows in size and u need to strategically hedge ur positions.

If a stimulus check is enough for u to add 5 positions, ur account doesn‚Äôt sound big enough for diversification tbh. No offense, but $1400 isn‚Äôt shit in the grand scheme of things and the long term outlook of ur portfolio size.

No point in holding 50 companies and owning 3 shares of each company.

Started my account with 7k back in June and invested in 7 positions (mainly tech). Account is now ~200k and i‚Äôve only managed to add about 5 new positions which r hedges against my tech heavy holdings. 

Can‚Äôt even imagine how ppl think they can manage 30+ positions with less capital"
03/14/2021,stocks,"If you want to hold them long term, look into sector ETFs, Fidelity and Vanguard have some great ETFs with 0.08% expense ratio or lower. you can buy 5-10 different sector ETFs, plus 5-10  solid stocks to stay diversified and minimize the risk."
03/14/2021,stocks,"There proper number depends entirely on you. It depends on how many you can consistently track. If you have only enough time to track 10, then 10 is your number. If you can track 100, then 100 is your number. I personally have between 50-60. I find this beneficial when buying for value. For example, I want to buy medical sector stocks, some days JNJ is at the best price/ value. Some days it may be BMY, PFE or MRK. As a result, I own them all.  If I feel one of them becomes over valued, I might exit that position entirely and move to another. I typically don‚Äôt sell one to buy another if I think it still has room to grow, I just focus new investment and dividend reinvestment in the others.  It really all depends on you and how much DD you can comfortably keep up with, while allowing time to look into other potential investments."
03/14/2021,stocks,"A lot of people think about this question the wrong way.

The question is not ‚ÄúI am too diversified‚Äù. The actual question is ‚ÄúAm I better at diversifying than a index fund‚Äù.

For a vast majority of investors, you are better off buying some combination of SPY, QQQ, and IJH than you are holding 50 or more companies.

However, if you genuinely put a lot of thought, knowledge, and labor into it, you could overperform those indexes, but it‚Äôs something you should think about.

Of course there‚Äôs also the aspect that if you really believe in a stock, it should be a large part of your portfolio. So if you are buying a stock that‚Äôs gonna end up being like 1.2% of your holdings, ask yourself if you think that stock will overperform/underperform the rest of your holdings, and grow that holding or shrink it depending on your answer."

Then chose just a couple in ten years. And go all in."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Not a pro, just sticking to a method I developed for myself a few years ago.

Updating two previous DD posts on Funko Toys with new information based on their latest conference call earlier this week ([DD1](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/l8fems/dd_funko_toys/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), [DD2](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lgm5db/new_info_funko_toys_dd/)).

Funko is well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market ‚Äúfairly soon.‚Äù

(TL;DR at the end)

=====================================================================

Here are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):

¬∑ Funko beat expectations with its second highest revenue quarter ever

¬∑ Growth is expected continue in 2021; driven by Europe, Loungefly, and other initiatives

¬∑ Operational responsiveness and flexibility has allowed Funko to thrive during the pandemic while providing a way to engage with fans in new and more creative ways

¬∑ Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market ‚Äúfairly soon‚Äù

=====================================================================

FUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS

¬∑ Net Sales in Q4 2020 was up 6% vs Q4 2019 to $226 million

o This represented Funko‚Äôs second highest revenue quarter in its history

o Outperformance was driven by the US market which had its highest revenue quarter in history and grew 18% vs. Q4 2019

o International was constrained by lockdowns; but still grew 10% vs. Q3 2020

o Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019

¬∑ Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019

¬∑ SG&A decreased 6% to $53 million

¬∑ Cash Flow From Operations increased 69% to $47 million

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to the prior year

GROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2021

¬∑ Funko is forecasting 30% revenue growth in Q1 2021 (vs. Q1 2020)

¬∑ Full year sales growth is forecasted at between 25-30%

¬∑ Gross margin is expected to strengthen in 2021; driven by Funko‚Äôs direct-to-consumer initiative and from regional / distribution mix shifts

¬∑ Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%

¬∑ Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.

o Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.

o Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys

o Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a ‚Äúmajor master toy announcement‚Äù fairly soon

¬∑ Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth

FUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC

¬∑ Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it‚Äôs brand and products

o Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don‚Äôt have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)

o As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development

¬∑ Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule

o FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns

o Given that Funko‚Äôs direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown

o Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic

o Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues

o Funko‚Äôs expanded games portfolio grew 50%

o Loungefly grew 55% in Q4

\-- Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year

\-- Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions

o In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few

¬∑ Funko‚Äôs overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance

o Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year

o Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019

¬∑ Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible

\-- ‚ÄúVirtual cons‚Äù in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases

\-- Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness

\-- In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual ‚ÄúFunko Fair‚Äù where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.

¬∑ The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.

¬∑ Funko launched ‚ÄúFunko Pop Albums‚Äù in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers

o For example, the AC/DC‚Äôs classic ‚ÄúBlack In Black‚Äù record was Funko‚Äôs top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers

o Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers

===================================================================

*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis / information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT‚Äôs themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn‚Äôt really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and ‚Äúgut feel.‚Äù Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*. That‚Äôs all for my PSA. I‚Äôll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT‚Äôs into it would clearly be incomplete.)*

===================================================================

FUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs ‚ÄúFAIRLY SOON‚Äù

There aren‚Äôt many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT‚Äôs right now other than Funko.

*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT‚Äôs, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*

After today‚Äôs [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company‚Äôs share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko‚Äôs valuation.

I don‚Äôt even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT‚Äôs on Funko‚Äôs stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT‚Äôs in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Potential impact of NFT‚Äôs on Funko‚Äôs go-to-market strategy (speculating on how Funko MIGHT implement NFT‚Äôs to expand and reinforce their business model):

¬∑ Digital items have the ability to move globally in an instant; increasing the total addressable market. Both for Funko and for collectors.

o For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don‚Äôt have immediate access.

o For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. 

¬∑ All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT‚Äôs, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.

¬∑ NFT‚Äôs allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items.

o There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.

o Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.

¬∑ NFT ‚Äúartists‚Äù or ‚Äúcreators‚Äù can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).

o Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko‚Äôs website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.

Quote from Funko‚Äôs CEO [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) about NFT‚Äôs:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we‚Äôre going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT‚Äôs to our fan base and link NFT‚Äôs with physical products. And that‚Äôs not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT‚Äôs. I won‚Äôt mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we‚Äôre going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That‚Äôs disruptive. That‚Äôs new. It‚Äôs different. It‚Äôs only what Funko can do. And we‚Äôre really excited about what the future of NFT‚Äôs are. We‚Äôre certainly all over this. And I think you‚Äôll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.‚Äù

TL;DR:

As expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko‚Äôs sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko‚Äôs international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko‚Äôs direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this.

While Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, thier CEO's interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that the company soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT‚Äôs would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a ‚Äútoy company.‚Äù They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market. (Some examples: [Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30), [Funko 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Freddy-Bloody-leatherface-POP-Exclusive-12-PIECES-EXTREMELY-RARE/143968624938?hash=item218532e12a:g:RgIAAOSwEiNgQco-), [Funko 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FUNKO-Pop-Games-Fortnite-VALOR-463-Vinyl-Figure-NIB/392842180285?epid=15027456221&hash=item5b7737f6bd:g:wRMAAOSwc7Ve6lE9), [Funko 3](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-POP-Star-Wars-Holographic-Darth-Maul-SDCC-480pcs/133480926875?hash=item1f14154e9b:g:JjMAAOSwfYpfJMGL)). Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT‚Äôs provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.

Disclosure: I am long FNKO. This is not investment advice. I reserve the right to buy or sell FNKO without updating this thread. Do your own research and share (or not share) with the community in this thread. Thank you to the others on Reddit that shared this idea earlier.

Feedback: If you have any additional information, ideas, or critiques please make sure to comment. It is great to get the perspective of others when making an investment.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m3p94p/why\_should\_you\_buy\_fnko\_three\_letters\_n\_f\_t/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m3p94p/why_should_you_buy_fnko_three_letters_n_f_t/)

I truly believe FNKO is an as-of-yet undiscovered opportunity right now.

The NFT market is growing rapidly; both in usage and in dollars being spent.  However, it's still in its embryonic state.  And that's because the vast majority of people have absolutely **no** idea it even exists.

(Proof: ask someone ""What do you know about the NFT market?""  ... *crickets... )*

At some point in the very near-term, however, BIG MEDIA is going to hyper focus on the NFT market - its purpose, the opportunities it presents, the **billions** being made by both creators and investors; etc.

And when this happens - when BIG MEDIA starts *educating* people - the masses are going to want to get in on the action and make some money, too.

One of the quickest, easiest ways to make this happen?  By simply investing in a publicly-traded company already associated with the NFT market.

(Example: OSTK and MSTR; both of which have moved substantially higher as a result of these companies now being associated with a certain ""coin."")

And this is *exactly* why you should invest in FNKO **now**.  *Before* the Wall Street vultures have swooped in and picked up the (previously) inexpensive FNKO shares, and *before* you see the new car your neighbor bought sporting a FNKO license plate.

And yes; I'm long both FNKO shares and calls."
03/14/2021,stocks,Terrific DD
03/14/2021,stocks,I just learned about NFTs a few days ago and it‚Äôs one of the most retarded concepts I‚Äôve heard about in a while. But then again people are pretty fucking retarded in general so who knows what will happen. I definitely don‚Äôt want any part of it though.
03/14/2021,stocks,eli5 nft?
03/14/2021,stocks,I like the NFT play. Higher oil prices might hurt the rest of the company. I‚Äôm hoping for a nice dip to get in on Funko.
03/14/2021,stocks,Some funkos are worth a lot. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if these took off
03/14/2021,stocks,Same so I thank OP for convincing me to make the jump but when it drops back down I‚Äôll go back in
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'd think you'd be right if covid lockdowns were here to stay. People are gonna be out partying, traveling, and actually spending their money in the near future- not saving and being bored at home lol"
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/14/2021,stocks,"Just looked it up. Huh. 

Sometimes I wonder if I'm from the same species as people that waste money on things like funko pops. And nfts are just digital files. It.... Doesn't make any sense"
03/14/2021,stocks,Digital artwork that no one can steal or copy bought with crypto
03/14/2021,stocks,You can steal/copy it. But you won't have the original. Such as I copy an artist's digital art and use it as my wallpaper.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Great DD, super weird bot interaction"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Which is kind of weird, because all you get from buying an NFT is the ability to say ""I have the original png file"", which sounds an incredibly dumb thing to spend money on."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don't think it's weird at all. It's like owning a Picasso. There are a lot of fakes but someone owns the original and they can say ""I have the original painting (file)"". This might be the future, I don't know. It's very interesting though."
03/14/2021,stocks,"You can't create a million identical copies of a Picasso instantly. Of course one can debate the value of original artworks ad nauseam, but NFTs push it to an extreme, where the only noteworthy thing about them is that the process is kind of new. That being said, there's a lot of money in it, so some companies could make a killing from them."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Zoom.

It‚Äôs got a decent product, but has low moat, high competition (some with deeeep pockets), it is trading at a terrible price to earnings, and there is no way that I see it will ‚Äútop‚Äù its user and revenue basis from the past year.  So you are currently paying a high premium as it‚Äôs a growth company, but it has nowhere to grow.  2020 will clearly be at the top of its revenue for quite some time, so you are paying a 150 P/E for the hope that in 5 years it can recover from the ‚Äúback to normal‚Äù just to reach that same level?  

There is no path to valid price to earnings ratio of ~20.  It is not the same as the other high flier growth stocks that should continue to grow and ‚Äúcould‚Äù eventually get that P/E to something respectable in 10 years,  Zoom just had its highest use year and still didn‚Äôt generate much money.  I fail to see how they can increase revenues from here, let alone keep them flat."

Disclamer: I have no position in gold but I like the colour."
03/14/2021,stocks,Zoom
03/14/2021,stocks,"Can I suggest a category?

Any weed stocks where the company focuses on distribution (I can see an argument for investing in weed growers).

Assuming marijuana is legalized nationwide and turns into a common commodity, Philip Morris or other big nicotine companies will probably add it to their existing product lines and sales channels. A small company would suddenly have to compete with Marlboro Greens or Winston Chills being sold in every gas station and convenience store."

03/14/2021,stocks,"Disagree, today's oil companies will also have the largest market shares in clean energy.

I checked out r/WSB for the first time in early January, because I was curious about T-S-L-A stock. In the daily chats, G-M-E was being discussed as the same volume as other plays. P-L-T-R was mentioned more at the time if I remember correctly. 

But I held onto that call option, and one day it started shooting up. That's when people started talking about it. I believe it was when it reached like $40 or so? 

It wasn't very hard to do research... and it wasn't hard to see why the company was incredibly underpriced. Michael Burry was invested, Cohen got in, they partnered with Microsoft, they have millions of subscribers to their newsletter, they were closing unprofitable stores... the list goes on. 

Sure it was a gamble, but putting money into a stock always is in some capacity. The people YOLO'ing their life savings into it were truly gambling. But people like me who put a small amount and waited to see what happened weren't risking much more than anyone else.

Now, buying at current levels? In my opinion that requires either a conviction in the short squeeze thesis, a belief that success here would resemble Chewy's market cap, or motives other than financial gain.

- Short squeeze thesis: There's a plausible argument that short interest is much higher than reported due to short positions held against etf's that contain GME. Is ""plausible"" enough to justify the risk at current levels?

- Chewy's market cap: The only thing these two companies have in common is Ryan Cohen and a couple of his execs. It's a different industry. Some people point to the size of the gaming industry as a whole, but I've not seen a compelling breakdown of how much of that business GME can reasonably get. This isn't purely about market share. It's also about how many of those dollars go to retail vs the game producers, hardware manufacturers, etc.

- Motives other than financial gain: I think some people are revenge trading after taking losses. Others have turned them possibility of burning the shorts into a political movement."

It's as Warren Buffet said I think: If there is a 10% chance that something might go up 100x, you always take that chance. Not that I am advocating for piling all your money into GME, but it makes a lot of sense to put in a small amount that you are comfortable with

I also made a lot of money this run up from 150 to 300, not by luck, but I knew when these price jumps would happen due to option chains. For instance, I knew that if GME crosses the threshold at 150, it would run up to 180 or more, due to MMs hedging (gamma squeeze), along with the considerable number of contracts between 150 and 200

There are some like Keith Gill who believe in the future value above the current price it is now. He may be right in the future, but I'm not planning on holding through the current run

Aside from fundamentals, the tweets by Cohen should have everyone interested in GME as well. Obviously, twitter is not fundamental analysis whatsoever, but also, there are only two CEOs that I know of who when they tweet, things happen. Musk and Cohen. It's kind of a grey area in terms of legality in my opinion, and it feels kind of ridiculous, but I think twitter and/or other social media needs to be taken seriously when a CEO is willing to post things that are almost definitely related to the company, albeit cryptic"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I mean, in my reply, I admitted it is a gamble‚Äîalbeit a calculated one.

But honestly, right now, reason why I'm still holding to see it through (and yes, this may seem self-fulfilling/circular) is that GME just got a foothold with momentum ahead of those. Look at some other popular memestock like AMC (same ""squeeze"" potential and ""solid"" fundamentals), it's been floundering because it just didn't receive as much retail impetus and media attention. 

And I haven't read on SKT/RKT since I have no positions with them but at least for you to be aware, GME next week alone (at least with respect to the squeeze) has stuff like:

1) Stimulus speculators riding the hype or ""movement"";

2) Current calls for a shareholder recall to force shorts/MMs to sort out the shares;

3) Bonds issued by GME that are maturing on the 15th and being settled well unlike what shorts hoped;

4) Congress hearing on the 17th; and 

5) Stuff like the new DTCC disclosure rules, the conference call on the 23rd with ecommerce ""whizkid"" Ryan Cohen, quadruple witching hour on the 19th and ETF shenanigans holding GME.

I know it might all be a nothing sandwich but I am definitely holding to see the fruition of this shitshow (which might be next week as stated or some longer timeframe). If it pops off given these catalysts, I'll cashout and maybe leave a few shares to ride the long term potential. If it doesn't pop off, I've already made six digits and still have that long term potential.
 
In short, I do not see SKT/RKT having these same contextual factors and catalysts available. There's still time to speculate which I think still answer's OP's question."

If gas and coal can be used to evaporate water, hydrogen can as well. And even better than that, hydrogen can be used directly to create steam because it's already half of the chemical compound of steam, H2. Increasing efficiency in the transfer of energy and reducing costs to generate steam. 


Hydrogen is just altogether a more appropriate answer to our energy demands as well as our environmental impact."

It's rather simple and I'm sure many of you have already thought about it. 
I don't think it will be happening all that soon but lets fantasize that the squeeze is squozen and one, if not the, largest redistribution of wealth has been completed.

The first run up of was chokeholded by restrictions on buying, at the time they claimed to have covered shorts, but the price was plummeting. The price action dictates how many shorts have covered.

Which I agree makes shorts at high prices profitable. But, they still have shorts at various price points and doesn‚Äôt get rid of the original problem. When GME was $3-4 they were trying to short this company into the ground and bankrupt them (and avoid paying tax).

2021-03-13 23:02:51,stocks,"A daily rundown of my DD schedule.. are you putting in the work? I wake up and immediately check where my watchlist (a group of 30-40 stocks) on seeking alpha are doing to start the day. If it's an up day, I pay less attention and focus on news coverage from various sources.

I check all the politico newsletters, NYTimes (+ DealBook), Axios, CNBC Pro, Forbes business articles (JJ Kinahan Is great), and then check the reddit investing/stock boards/threads and topics. That should take about 30-45 minutes.

Another look at the watchlist, but also with an emphasis on my current portfolio. For stocks I have w less confidence in, on a major up day will track them even more closely (every 5 minutes or so) and look to sell one or two for profit only.

Another swipe at more news articles. Barrons, WSJ (especially Heard on the Street/Stocks/Market section), TheHill finance, Washington Post, ReutersMarket, and 3-4 Twitter stock people I follow from different POV's. 

A quick 10 minute break, and back to Watchlist and Portfolio looking. At this point I've already copied and pasted various quotes I found from all the news sources that total 3-4 pages. 

End the session by looking at Benzinga, TipRanks, and a quick swipe through twitter for any major breaking news. Also will start to zone in on certain stocks on SeekingAlpha (and articles authors I like), as well as a look at Yahoo Message boards to see people's satisfaction or annoyance at stocks they own. 

By now the market should be closed. I do a quick swipe through all the sites again, particularly Barrons and Forbes as they tend to post articles after the bell closes.

By the night, I do a cycle through all the notes I highlighted and copy pasted, to have a gameplan for the next day. I review my watchlist stocks, and place number evaluations I feel comfortable buying at, levels of aggression I want to go at certain stocks depending on earnings reports and sector news, and a general idea of which stocks in order I'd like to go at to start the next day assuming all things are equal. Also another review of my portfolio and which stocks I'd look to sell.

At all times I'm fully prepared w enough cash to spend like crazy if the market were to tank, but in general I limit myself to 2-3 sells/buys a day. Especially recently with the market appearing to be on an upswing. 

On weekends I skim news, but generally try to find a stock book related to psychology and human behavior to gain a deeper understanding of things. I also place a HEAVY emphasis on doing as much DD as possible on my top watchlist stocks, that way if a stock goes down 4-5% in a day, I have full confidence to snatch it up ASAP rather than second guessing myself. 

I'd encourage everyone to construct their own gameplan as well! We're competing with legitimate financial advisors on one level as well as meme stock ""no DD"" people too! The harder you work, the better your odds. With COVID I'd say 80% of my day revolves around stocks and it's very easy to do instead of playing video games, watching TV, or whatever.. especially if you enjoy it. 

Not to mention the most important rule: Keeping a level head and staying unemotional. More than anything, that is far most important.

2021-03-13 22:39:34,stocks,"Getting in early - trends of the future I'm interested in thinking about what is just in its infancy now that will become big in the future and why.

EVs: OK, yeah, everyone knows this already and a lot of EV stocks are way overvalued at the moment. But among the winners in this space, I think we'll all look back in 15-20 years and you won't even be able to see a bump on the chart. We're talking about the entire fucking world moving from ICE to EVs. Of course, all the existing automakers will transition too, taking a big part of the pie, but right now is the disruption period where new companies can come in and take their piece too. Looking this far ahead, it'll be hard to lose money no matter what price you get in at now, provided the company is one of the ones that survive. TSLA is an obvious choice.

Fake meat: This too will take over in the next 15-20 years. I'm really noticing a lot more vegetarian and vegan products as well as restaurants popping up everywhere. The move to stop killing animals for food is growing at a faster rate now than it ever did. 30 years ago, I literally didn't know one vegetarian. Today, you meet new vegans every day. I'm not saying meat will go away completely. Probably not. But a large part of our diets will be plant based. Especially once boomers die off. The younger generation has grown up in an environment of sustainability and compassion for animals like I've never seen. Lab grown meat may someday take over (probably) but the technology is not here yet so for now it's plants. Here too, the obvious choice is the only big player on the market: BYND. Also TTCF but I'm not sold on them just yet. Probably worth a bet though. If/when Impossible IPOs then I'll sell my soul for some stock.

There are some sociological drivers such as health and wokeness, but the real driver is economics of food on scale.
It is just so freaking expensive to mass produce meat, most of the resources and money go into keeping your livestock alive and healthy to kill them later.

03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks. I‚Äôm invested in GE for the same reasons. They would be in a position build the nuclear fusion grid reactors even if their research didn‚Äôt come out with a profitable fusion technique.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm a nerdy electrical engineering student and used my savings from a job I had before college to invest. I was surprised when I saw France‚Äôs fusion project and I wanted to find a way to make a small and safe investment in alternative energy. I invested in big, secure companies that are setting themselves up for a future with nuclear fusion. 

I invested in General Electric since they already build grid power plants and have government contracts that will last the next few decades. GE will build the fusion energy infrastructure and use another company‚Äôs fusion technology. The fusion technology or technique would be very risky to invest in now, but GE already builds nuclear fission reactors and researches alternative energy, AI and microgrids. I think they‚Äôre a secure company and currently undervalued."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well, yes that‚Äôs why I said after when federal legalization occurs."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I‚Äôm not an engineer, but went to a tech school and a lot of my friends are engineering, so I end up staying at least partially abreast of the goings on. It‚Äôs crazy interesting stuff and I think I would‚Äôve gone that route if I were to do it again. 

As much grief as people on here give GE, I like them long term. I think to your point, they‚Äôre on the right path to streamlining their business into something more along the lines of an engineering firm with a maintenance arm. If they‚Äôre able to offload things in the right manner, I think there‚Äôs a lot of potential for them to do really well. I held them for the last couple years, but off-loaded them just before they announced the reverse split (good timing) for another company I‚Äôd been looking at for a while. I‚Äôll certainly be following them for another entry point down the line"
2021-03-13 22:39:28,stocks,"Analyst ratings that are up to date? The app that I use for trading has a section that gives analyst ratings and suggests whether the stock should be bought, held, or sold. I‚Äôve noticed that they seem to be out of date, because they don‚Äôt change. Most of the time they don‚Äôt anyway.

Is there a resource I can use to see what most analysts recommend for each stock?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Most analyst targets are for 12 months out of none of their inputs materially changes. If there is a material change, usually around earnings, then they‚Äôd update."
2021-03-13 22:37:37,stocks,"Why isn't the previous candle close aligned to the next candle open? Don't they happen at the same time? I mean, if one is closing then necessarily the other one is opening, unless open and close refer to different values or timeframes. For example:

Let's assume O1, O2, C1 and C2 refer to open and close from successive candles and we have 1 minute intervals for 2 minutes (0:00 , 1:00, 2:00)

**Either:**

O1 occurs at 0:00;

C1 and O2 occur at 1:00;

C2 occurs at 2:00;

**Or:**

O1 averages 0:00~0:15;

C1 averages 0:45~1:00;

O2 averages 1:00~1:15;

C2 averages 1:45~2:00;

Anyone have an insight into which one it is? Also, are 1 minute intervals the best you can get for historical data?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'm pretty sure C1 is the last trade between 0:00-1:00 and O2 is the first trade between 1:00-2:00. That's why for daily candles, C1 is yesterday's closing price and O2 is today's opening price. Just keep a live intraday minute candle chart open of an illiquid stock to see how the candles evolve to make sure that's how your broker displays it."
2021-03-13 22:15:55,stocks,"A tax question I don't know if this is the right sub to ask this but lets say hypothetically, I recently made 10k in short term investments. I cashed out and reinvested that money in a different stock. It didn't go as planned and I lost it all. Using some of the my own money  I worked to get those 10k back, which I did. So my question is, will I still be taxed for the 20k total I made or does the fact that I lost the first 10k means I won't pay taxes for what I lost?"
03/14/2021,stocks,Nope he would see a 10k gain the a 10k loss

03/14/2021,stocks,"You will have to pay capital gains tax on whatever you make from the sell of your stocks.  Because that is income.  Just because you turn around and plunk it into a loser and lose it all the IRS isn't gonna say ""ahh don't worry about claiming that income, we feel bad for you.  But you can claim losses on your taxes.   If you want more precise info on how it works there is enough YouTube videos and Google links to find out.  Or just quick call to a broker or tax person."

However, there is an article stating that GE suffered their biggest loss in 9 months, so I‚Äôm cautious about committing."

03/14/2021,stocks,"They are turning their business around. As Boeing and the airlines begin to rebound, so will GE. If you can wait 5-10 years for 40% gain then try to get this closer to $11. They are doing a reverse stock split that will take the price to 90 a share which opens this up to mutual funds, etfs and will naturally go up."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I just exited my position in GE recently after over 100% gain in less than a year.  Basically I bought a bunch of blue chippers last April when the pandemic had the market shot all to hell knowing that it might be 2 years before I made a dime in a worst case scenario.    


As it turned out pretty much anything you bought last April is flying high now compared to then but I figured old American giants like GE and Ford weren't going anywhere and April was a good chance to pick them up at good values.  I'm still holding Ford because I think electric vehicle sentiment might keep driving it up.  GE though, I was happy to get out of.  Entered around 5.50 and sold around 13.  If you can get into GE in the single digits, I think you've got some upward room, but I don't see it going anywhere fast.  I will say that Biden is gonna be throwing those frogskins around to companies like GE for the next 4-8 years...  So that's something to think about.  


With government money flowing to American companies though, I've decided my play there will be in K-12 education.  BOXL is company that I initially bought as a distance learning play during the pandemic, but now I realize they intend on modernizing classroom learning and will benefit from Uncle Joe's big education bill.  The price is right at the moment.  I think anything below $3 will end up being a good entry point.  It will probably be 12-18 months before any government money hits public schools and 2 years before we see it making a meaningful difference on BOXL's books.  So this isn't a day trade.  lol  I see myself jumping out at $12 in 24 months.  (That's the plan anyway.)"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I don't see GE going anywhere, so it could be a good investment long term, but it's definitely not a growth stock. They have 8.8 billion shares outstanding and already have a market cap over 100 billion. I try to avoid companies with outstanding shares in the billions, but that's just my opinion."
03/14/2021,stocks,"GE has suffered from awful management (continues to suffer? No clue) for many years now. It seems like their strategy for the last 10-15 years was to get into everything, and they just weren‚Äôt doing well enough in a lot of industries.

Is their something to be salvaged? Probably. The newest leadership has dedicated a lot of effort to fixing their balance sheet, including paying down a lot of debt and reconfiguring the company. They tend to see their best ROI on specialized manufacturing from what I understand.

They‚Äôre at least ditching a lot of their investment in GE Capital, which was largely seen as dubious by potential investors as a division being used to hide financial toxicity.

Personally I‚Äôm not buying, either before or after the reverse split. Not because I think it‚Äôs a bad company or anything, but because I prefer to invest in companies with a stronger ideology for what they specialize in. GE from a brand perspective feels like a company that tried to be a monolith and still isn‚Äôt sure what it wants to be known for. If they decide to ditch their capital and renewable energy segments and focus on specialized manufacturing (including healthcare equipment), then I‚Äôll be way more tempted to invest. I‚Äôm down to invest in a company that makes jet engines and MRI machines, not a company that dabbles in 12 industries and uses its profits from a few segments to subsidize its losses."
03/14/2021,stocks,GE is a notoriously mismanaged company. I stay away from it if you are looking to invest. If you want to trade then follow the money.
03/14/2021,stocks,"No.

They lack direction, both in terms of the actual business and what they want their equity to do.

And there are much better investments out there."

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who is giving feedback and insight into the areas I didn't cover. Will Defiantly keep in mind the things I missed for my next DD.

 Some of the the biggest rebuttals people are saying is the ceiling in SK and the competition. This is defiantly something to keep in mind and look into.  As for me. I don't think this changes much in my eyes. I will wait a few weeks or months to buy because (as people have also said) it does seem pretty overvalued RIGHT NOW. With that said I still think this company has great potential and to me, most of the arguments being made against Coupang are arguments you can say about a lot of companies as well. Thanks again for the Feedback and the upvotes. Much appreciated!

&#x200B;

**---------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER--------------------------------------------------------------**

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don‚Äôt know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can‚Äôt tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I‚Äôm just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I‚Äôm no expectation. I‚Äôm bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn‚Äôt a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the ‚ÄúAmazon of South Korea‚Äù
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO‚Äôs a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don‚Äôt know anything.

üì∑

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP ‚Äúgross domestic product‚Äù (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: ‚ÄúHow did I ever live without Coupang?‚Äù

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. ‚ÄúPeople aren't the friendliest‚Äù ‚Äúyou're expected to work like a machine‚Äù ‚ÄúWork life balance can be hard‚Äù ‚Äúneeds more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and ‚ÄúBombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I‚Äôd name them but I don‚Äôt think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show ‚ÄúYour Honor‚Äù and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *‚ÄúWe are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.‚Äù*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *‚Äúpursue operational excellence and innovation‚Äù* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don‚Äôt think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *‚ÄúWe believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.‚Äù*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I‚Äôm going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I‚Äôve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should‚Äôve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole ‚Äústonks‚Äù thing. As you may have noticed I haven‚Äôt given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I‚Äôm waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don‚Äôt own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I‚Äôm buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn‚Äôt you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

03/14/2021,stocks,"These 2 statements by OP are contradictory, right? What am I missing?

&#x200B;

1. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.

2 Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

\# 1 say company won't be taking proceeds

\# 2 says they will get money from the IPO and will be using it.

I am sure there is a valid reason to reconcile the 2. Can someone explain?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Can we stop using the languages wsb uses. I find that sub entertaining and informative from time to time. But using terms like ape, paperhand, diamond hand etc sounds like trying too hard."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Interesting.  As a rule I always give tech companies a few weeks before even considering a buy.  They usually fade after the initial hype.  I buy on the rebound.  I can see this one being a $100 stock despite the problems others have mentioned.  If I could enter in the 30s, I may just do that.  Too pricey and still fading.  May hit the 30s soon."
03/14/2021,stocks,Sighh...buying $10K worth OTM calls on this now
03/14/2021,stocks,"I live in SK and I wouldnt even think of buying shares in Coupang.

Population growth has stalled and will now decrease. Delivering market already becoming saturated. Too much competition, no brand loyalty (easy to buy from alternatives). Very unlikely to have expansion outside the Korean market.

Lots of bad press at the moment in the press about workers rights but unlike America and Amazon the govt here is likely to step in here eventually (as they should) and increase the costs for the company.

Way too many headwinds. Coupang will likely expand but it will never grow like Amazon, Baba, Mercado Libre or SE."
03/14/2021,stocks,Saved the stock in my favorites. Will keep my eyes on it.
03/14/2021,stocks,this feels like $20 stock for me. ill wait and put it on watchlist for now
03/14/2021,stocks,"I live in Seoul. Coupang is number one right now for online shopping. Basically all the other online retailers are getting killed by them but the working conditions are harsh. Employees have 5 day work weeks on paper but the actual corporate culture is 7 days. The delivery ppl are treated like shit. I always see them eating their meals as fast as possible in their trucks. 
Not to mention Samsung, Hyundai and Lotte are doing everything to kill the company. They were forced to go to SoftBank because the big Korean companies threatened any investment firms in Korea. 

That being said my family and I basically use coupang for 90% of shopping. The app has rendered my Costco membership useless because of competitive prices and same day delivery. 

Also I live in a huge apartment complex and all you see everyday is Coupang trucks driving in and out and the recycling center is fillled with coupang packaging."
03/14/2021,stocks,Its not only retail that holds AMZN value though
03/14/2021,stocks,"Good work, I like it. Silly question on my end here but is there a standard format for due diligence works cited?"
03/14/2021,stocks,Totally thanks so much. Defiantly will keep that in mind.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Thanks! Defiantly should've done some more DD on the competition. I'll keep that in mind for my future DD's and personal research. I agree it might be hard to get market share outside of Korea but I am hopeful with the expansion Coupang has shown already, it really will live up to their goal of making people say ""how did we ever live without Coupang"" As well Its no secret that Korea's economy is growing rapidly and will continue, and IF Coupang becomes the #1 E-commerce platform in Korea then I think the economy growth with be pretty directly related to Coupangs growth. Thanks again for the perspective and feedback. :)"
03/14/2021,stocks,Well counter fact - doesn‚Äôt Japan use Line? It‚Äôs actually Korean
03/14/2021,stocks,"You must have lived in Korea like 10 years ago. Gmarket and 11st are dying almost everyone uses Coupang. Now there is serious brand loyalty. Ppl love the Coupang brand ‚ÄòGom Gom‚Äô. And even in pop culture we say ‚Äúthe coupang man came!‚Äù When shit gets delivered. Also, social media is filled with screenshots of nice messages from delivery men sending delivery confirmation pics."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Same, got worried for a second.."
03/14/2021,stocks,Yeah people don‚Äôt understand that. Amazon could completely abandon their retail and it‚Äôd barely make a difference to their profit. AWS operating costs are way lower and the profits are WAY higher
03/14/2021,stocks,"Interesting. I'm still very new at this so would you mind telling me why dilution is SO bad? I thought (as is in my DD) that dilution at this stage in a company would just be in efforts to expand, not save their asses. Right?"
03/14/2021,stocks,Defiantly. When I buy Ill defiantly  be holding for a long time
03/14/2021,stocks,"Harvard undergrad, dropped out during MBA"
03/14/2021,stocks,Interesting. Didn‚Äôt take into account population but GDP still looks promising. A lot of people have been mentioning the workers rights as well and as that is cause for concern the same thing can be said about apple and people are still buying IPhones out the ass. Thanks for the insight though will definitely keep these in mind.
03/14/2021,stocks,Think that‚Äôs a good idea. Definitely not a buy right now but if it drops to $20-25 I‚Äôll be sure to pick some up.
03/14/2021,stocks,Yup. I‚Äôll be doing the same.
03/14/2021,stocks,"In ecommerce:
Gmarket, 11st, Auction, Interpark, Wemakeprice
People generally search for what they want on Naver Shopping which then conveniently price compares the item on all those sites as well as Coupang. Even without an account it‚Äôs pretty easy to buy what you need generally thanks to Naver signin. 
However for every day items and certain food items, Coupang is king and tbh the Coupang app and next day delivery service is so much better than all competitors. It does also compete with Supermarkets for next-day food deliveries but a lot of the time Coupang is easier.

For streaming, it competes with Netflix and Watcha which are both superior and will be difficult to beat. Especially Watcha imo. 

For food delivery it competes against Î∞∞Îã¨ÏùòÎØºÏ°± (dunno how to write in English so let‚Äôs call it Baedal) and Yogiyo. Op said Coupang Eats is the biggest now but i find that hard to believe. Baedal is just a better app and has been available a lot longer than Coupang eats."
03/14/2021,stocks,people have been saying that since 70s and foreign companies keep getting screwed by indians and their government.
03/14/2021,stocks,Defiantly. But the same thing about worker rights and shit can be said about Apple. Are people still buying Iphones? Defiantly not discrediting any of that and its for sure something to keep in mind. Thanks for the insight.
03/14/2021,stocks,"If there is a ecommerce company to bet on in SK it is this one. Like others have pointed out they work their employees hard and have a negative view socially. But my wife, whose Korean and still follows Korean companies says all the ecommerce companies do anyways. lol goodluck on your investment!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Japan occupied them for a long time before WWII. They committed horrible atrocities. They took women as sex slaves, destroyed history and monuments, even forced them to use their language. I think a lot of people forget how japan was before they lost WWII. Do i think they should still have beef...No. But i understand why they have it."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I see this sentiment posted all the time, but it's just wrong, just look at Amazon's quarterly reports.

In the most recent quarter, for example, AWS net income was $3.56B while everything else (North America + International) was $3.30B.   AWS did pull ahead as the larger earnings contributor in 2019 but non-AWS is still close to half of profit so it's quite a stretch to say abandoning it would ""barely make a difference to their profit"".

Non-AWS actually grew more as well YoY from Q42019 to Q42020, however 2020 was obviously weird.

Have a look, the segment breakout is on page 14.

03/14/2021,stocks,Yup.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Sure, everyone already uses Coupang here (along with numerous other great competitors). So how will they grow if everyone uses them already, and they are not expanding outside of Korea? We don‚Äôt stick with only one brand, and use all of them interchangeably. Coupang has actually been in the news a lot here recently for 1) human/labor rights violations and poor working conditions and 2) people poking fun at Coupang for being so overpriced, and opening in the US market because Americans didn‚Äôt know how the country actually operates. Korean businesses are pretty notorious for screwing over their investors.

I‚Äôm not saying Coupang isn‚Äôt a good company, but comparing it to Amazon is a reach. If I buy, my PT will be closer to $25-30."
03/14/2021,stocks,"The difference between workers rights in these two companies is not so much a PR issue but a legislation issue. Korea is more likely to pass laws protecting workers rights (especially under the current administration) than in the more laissez-faire American style of business law.
The concern is that this will add greatly to Coupangs costs and delay a path to profitability."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Always has been.. Japan/Korea's stock market to say isn't the best performing outside of its blue-chips (Samsung, LG, Naver.. not even sure what JP has that has grown consistently)

Even Chinese stock is probably a better stake e.g. blue chips like BABA, Tencent, TSM

Or rly... if I have to be in KRX (Korean Stock Exchange) better just buy Samsung"
03/14/2021,stocks,What? This just isn‚Äôt true anymore. Everyone orders food via delivery apps. You must have lived in Korea at least 5+ years ago?
03/14/2021,stocks,Wtf are you talking about?? I live in Korea and I haven‚Äôt had to make a call to order food in the last 3 years. Everyone I know has like 3 apps for food delivery including boomers
03/14/2021,stocks,"It‚Äôs ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù, just so you‚Äôre aware."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks! good to know.
03/14/2021,stocks,"I think you're missing part of the cultural nuance here--a lot of East Asian countries did not have the privilege of being like the West (thinking of North America in particular) as they had to rapidly rebuild from years of colonization AND WWII AND any subsequent civil wars/violence in their own lands. At least part of the reason for the nationalism you mention is due to the government using national pride to get the people to unite/reduce individualism whilst they were trying to rebuild and ""get up to speed"" on industrialization. That + historical issues like being fucked over by foreign countries (Japan refused/refuses to acknowledge a lot of it's wartime atrocities, American and other occupation post ww2) has led to some suspicion of foreign presence and globalization...

All in all a pretty different situation from Canada, where there's been more time to adapt to foreigners, but it's also not a 1:1 situation because multiculturalism codified and formally adopted in 1971/1988/etc. by the government in order to try and deal with French Canada and subsequently the other parts of Canadian culture.  That being said, it's not like those acts have formally solved everything anyway; discrimination still exists, and mistrust in different communities still exist due to historical and ongoing violence/trauma perpetrated by the English (Anglo-sphere), similar to East Asia, it's just not as generalized due to the different cultures."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Yea for sure not comparing them to Amazon in terms of size and growth potential, more so business model. The labor rights are defiantly something to be concerned with however the same shit is said about numerous companies, Apple being one of them and people are still buying Iphones. I agree with everything your saying though and I too will be looking to buy in more so at the $25-30 range. Thanks for the insight!"
03/14/2021,stocks,">yone uses them already, and they are not expanding outside of Korea? We don‚Äôt stick with only one brand, and use all of them interchangeably. Coupang has actually been in the news a lot here recently for 1) human/labor rights violations and p

Why would they IPO in America if they are not expanding outside the Korean market? I think there is a lot of upward potential in this company. While we have Jet for Walmart delivery more competition is better for the market. If you are able to get in the company at your target price go for it. I am think they are going to try to expand in the American market hence the IPO in America. but we will see what the future brings. I never hyper-expose anyway lol.

&#x200B;

It's not like Amazon doesn't have its own labor rights issues. What multimillion-dollar business doesn't have labor rights issues?"

03/14/2021,stocks,I left when COVID became serious. Everyone used phone delivery. Cheongju and Daejon. Possibly city or aged based?
03/14/2021,stocks,Um. No. I Put everything in my own words except the quotes Obviously. But thanks for the criticism anyway.
03/14/2021,stocks,\*when you don't have anything to add so you make fun of peoples grammar
03/14/2021,stocks,"Oh, I see. I'm in Seoul and it's been mostly delivery app based for the past few years now. I'm sure some old senior citizens still use phone based but it's super inconvenient and most restaurants don't have phone delivery anymore."
03/14/2021,stocks,"It changed very quickly this year. I live in a 1 million pop city (Changwon) so if it has happened here it has happened everywhere. Food apps have taken on mass adoption all over the country a lot of restaurants have stopped using their own drivers and are now using all of yogiyo, baemin or coupang."
03/14/2021,stocks,"it‚Äôs not grammar, it‚Äôs a basic spelling error you‚Äôve made over and over again just in this thread"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well in my experience (here in the US) I find I need at least 3 or 4 services, especially if I'm looking to stream a specific film or series, so that's okay with me.  They all have their own licensing agreements. I imagine that will remain the paradigm in any country,"

2021-03-13 21:19:55,stocks,"Fidelity Spire Has anyone used this for trading yet? I just downloaded it and see that everything from my fidelity is there and it seems to have trading now, but I can‚Äôt test it being the weekend. Once they have reoccurring investment I will no longer have a reason to need robinhood anymore.  I like being able to buy a little bit of my favorite stocks every day automatically, and besides the ui it‚Äôs the only reason I have robinhood now. Fidelity spire looks a whole lot better than the crusty old fidelity app.

Edit: I see that it just says reoccurring deposits not that it will buy for you like robinhood. I hope that one day fidelity will have that. At the moment you can do that already on fidelity, but it‚Äôs just deposit once a week or month I think, and then you have to go buy the stock yourself."
03/14/2021,stocks,Im trying to check my stonks 20 times a day and every time Fidelity acts like I'm doing a quarterly check in on my 401k.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Used to it. Brokers take one bite at each new tech then don't change a thing, because they're saving up for the next new tech.

RH only looks new because it was developed a decade after the others did their phone apps. It will be old and busted before long, and it won't get fixed.

It's basically a furnishings company leaning strongly to floor coverings, and they also are parent company to a few brand names. They had some issues with earnings reports if I understood correctly, and the stock took a major dump. Other than that, it looks like a solid company. Their website is totally professional with investor information. On google maps their facility looks great. But other than that, I have no information other than they have dipped, and the stock is going up. Estimating to possibly 30% gain returning to previous historical performance.

2021-03-13 20:02:38,stocks,"Tax Advice ‚Äî capital gains I‚Äôve been trying to make some sense of how to bring down capital gains tax for a stock sale. I‚Äôm rebalancing my portfolio, and I have a stock that I‚Äôve held for years and years that‚Äôs just too much of my portfolio. However, if I understand correctly, selling it to buy other stocks will trigger capital gains tax. That sucks, but such is life. 
From what I understand, if I also sell stocks at a loss, the losses will subtract my capital gains tax obligation. 
So here‚Äôs my theory on strategy, but I‚Äôm wondering if this would really work: 
Let‚Äôs say I owe $2,000 in capital gains tax for 2021 taxes. I have no losses to sell. I could wait until next tax season and owe $2,000 ... OR... and here‚Äôs my idea: 
If I have to pay uncle sam $2,000 anyway, why don‚Äôt I try putting $2,000 in to some very high risk stocks. Best that could happen is they make big gains, and I make more money. Worst that could happen is they tank and then I can sell them for a $2,000 loss, which cancels my capital gains tax obligation. 

Will this strategy work? Is it a good idea? Somebody here has probably got some good suggestions. 

Thanks for the ideas."
03/14/2021,stocks,"So I believe the question you should ask yourself is: Is owing 10-37% (depending on your tax bracket) of that $2000 worth losing all $2000 on the risky stock?

Edit: And what if that risky stock gave you gains?  Should you keep trying to lose it? I think you want to owe capital gains, that means you made money.  If you have a net $0 capital gains, what was the point?"
03/14/2021,stocks,"I haven't read the comments here yet.

Let's say you're in a 20% tax bracket.

you said you're going to owe $2,000 in taxes. That means your capital gains was $10,000 in a 20% tax bracket.

If you put $2,000 into a risky stock and it plummets to zero and you sell it in 2021... That $2,000 would be subtracted from your $10,000 gain, not the $2,000 in taxes you owe.

So now you would owe taxes on $8,000 worth of capital gains (10000-2000).  So it would only save you $400 in taxes.

This is just my understanding, and my math. Do your own research, and check my math."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Absolutely right! Now that I‚Äôve read through a few comments and realized my stupidity. Losses only subtract from totally gains... whereas my stupid ass was thinking the loss amount would subtract from my tax obligation. 
Which leaves me in the situation that a gain is a gain. There‚Äôs not much to be gained by YOLO‚Äôing right now."
03/14/2021,stocks,">If I sell a stock at a $2,000 dollar loss, and I sell a stock with gains amounting to $2k in capital gains tax, do I owe $0 in taxes?

Aluminum-ion batteries Ok, so I may be blowing my own spot on finding the next Tesla/Netflix/Amazon... but, after weeks of searching, I seriously have come up empty.  So I'm turning to you dear Redditors, for help.  I need a company that is primarily involved with producing aluminum-ion batteries.  From what I've read, they're more efficient, smaller, charge faster, and are overall cheaper.  But I can't seem to find a company that produces them.  Obviously, some company that is involved in mining and/or aluminum production like Alcoa may be a suggestion.  But those are so highly diversified, that they will not gain the benefit of explosive growth that a pure play would.  Key example is, I own Pfizer, and it barely budged after having the world's first covid vaccine.  It barely budged because of being highly diversified.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

03/14/2021,stocks,I like Scwab. I‚Äôve had very poor customer service experiences with TDa as they kept requiring me to send in the same documents multiple times.
03/14/2021,stocks,"A few things I learned switching, sell off any partial shares these aren‚Äôt transferable if you don‚Äôt they will do it for you whenever they get to that stage whether the market is blood red or not.  

I switched to Schwab and negotiated them to credit me the money that Robinhood charged to transfer.  This depends on you account size if the will let you do this it doesn‚Äôt have to be huge but it has to be worth it to them.

It took a lot longer than a week for Robinhood to do the transfer, another thing let any shares and cash settle first before starting the process having shares that didn‚Äôt settle slows things down considerably once you put In the request they lock your account and will deny you any access so do these things first before you start a transfer"
03/14/2021,stocks,"one thing to keep in mind, make sure you let ALL your transactions settle before initiating a transfer.

lots of people were reporting all kinds of weird issues when they had purchases/sales that were still in the middle of their 2 day settle period or various options on their account.

also keep in mind that some things in your rh account might not be transferable, such as if you have any ""rule 6"" in there. that stuff you'll have to either leave in RH (you shouldn't be buying ""rule 6"" at rh anyways) or sell and then take the cash over.

on a side note, i know webull will re-imburse you for any transfer fees (up to a limit), and i wouldn't be surprised if most brokerages did this. (webull is just the only platform i see actively advertising that they do this)"
03/14/2021,stocks,I also recommend fidelity.

2. a shitload of NEW $12 were added yesterday. Which is..less than 1 percent chance, look at the volume and OI of its neighbors.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Yes very easy to use. I do find the number of stocks limiting at times, but when I‚Äôve asked for stocks to be added they have done so, I caveat that that statement as they haven‚Äôt told me they‚Äôve added them, they just add them behind the scenes when I next look for them. They have three types of accounts ISA, CFD and normal investing. I only use the ISA account. I don‚Äôt do CFDs and don‚Äôt intend to use the other account due to the ISA tax breaks. Their customer service are fairly good. In terms of the platform, it‚Äôs great on mobile, desktop it‚Äôs not too bad either... plus no fees apart from exchange rates so can‚Äôt really complain!! There are lots of other platforms out there though so not sure how it compares to those e.g. etoro"

That‚Äôs the point, if you have a small amount in your account then leverage is a way to increase potential profits, of course we all know it increases potential loss, but I‚Äôd still say a leveraged trade on something like Apple is less risky than penny stocks. I‚Äôd also add further comment that people don‚Äôt like to hear - paper trading has limitations. You can paper trade to learn the mechanics, but it will never be the same as your own money.

I think people don‚Äôt want to invest alone so they join these subscription things to feel some kind of security.

For example, when I bring the car seat forward I can reach the pedals, and I can adjust the chair height upward, so that‚Äôs great too. But now I can‚Äôt reach the cup holders on the central console without reaching behind me. So awkward. 

It was a generalization about women‚Äôs time, but it was based on documented studies about how the majority of working women also still have to work another shift at home: cooking, cleaning, child care, elder care, after work errands, picking up the kids, driving them places. And they often work jobs where it‚Äôs harder to take time off midday to participate in a focus group or product study. So the majority of test study subjects are men, except for female-specific products, and that skews the average towards most men. The book I referenced does a great job of laying that out based on data. So if you‚Äôre reading my personal accounts and thinking oh, that‚Äôs so much BS, just try reading the book, or doing your own survey of the women in your life, or notice all the things that do fit well, and then imagine if they were 20% larger or heavier or taller, and what that would be like."

I probably live on the wrong continent‚Äîyet culturally I belong here more than anywhere.

I did buy a car that was stereotypically a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs car‚Äù ‚Äî but they redesigned it to make it more appealing to men and I wasn‚Äôt clever enough to buy an earlier model because the seat height, steering wheel, and pedals did fit me well, and I didn‚Äôt notice the cup holder placement.

It‚Äôs great that you noticed most things are built for you.

And for the most part, I didn‚Äôt think much about how many things are the wrong size for me, until I read that book, Invisible Women. Of course there are men who fall outside the normal range who will also struggle, but when the majority of things work well for men but don‚Äôt work as comfortably or easily for women, it just makes things that much harder for women in subtle ways, and harder for men to notice anything amiss because most things are relatively comfortable for them to grip, hold, push, pull, lift, reach, etc."

Technical analysis is about risk management just as much as the stock itself. If you see a stock you like, do you just enter directly or wait for pullbacks? Do you enter at a perceived high or wait for a dip?

Technical analysis is very useful when other people are seeing the same things. For me, when I see a stock, I like to see the chart, look for Wyckoff schematics and volume spikes. Then I want to see it pull back toward a support and then see consolidation near this support. The consolidation tells me that traders are playing this area.

Technical indicators that rely on basic credible data such as moving averages are the ones that will prove most useful. Not the ones that use off-math with no real correlation to price movements and most of those formation patterns resembling animals, flags, or wedges. Anyone could come up with some mathematical formula plugging together various data points in order to predict a past movement. But I‚Äôd like to see ONE study or meet ONE trader who is consistently profitable from using such indicators. I‚Äôm willing to be proven wrong but from my experience and as someone who used to trade like that I‚Äôve learned that 90% of those indicators that noobies use are bs. You‚Äôre much better off using the most readily available data that people can find and browse Reddit or other trading groups to gauge sentiment. People should be learning about the real data first instead of going down the endless rabithole of useless indicators"
03/14/2021,stocks,There‚Äôs definitely some merit to TA. As well as fundamentals and investor sentiment. I‚Äôve been a very profitable day trader for a couple years now and often times most of my money is made by analyzing charts and  other indicators to help determine where price movement might be likely to go. TA isn‚Äôt everything and I always check the news surrounding a company before I buy in to make sure some bearish catalyst isn‚Äôt currently in play. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned about the stock market it‚Äôs that patterns tend to repeat themselves but they don‚Äôt always have to. The key phrase here is ‚Äútend to‚Äù. Sure sometimes my TA falls through because of those instances where ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt always have to‚Äù but 8 times out of 10 I am profitable. I have to say that I definitely disagree with what most of this post says.
03/14/2021,stocks,"The most simplistic answer I tell people who believe TA is a bunch of bullshit is this:

**There is a reason why almost every single hedge fund has their own technical analysis team or they hire a firm to give them technical analysis advice.** 

You really shouldn't judge the merits of TA based on Youtube videos. The overwhelming majority of Youtube videos explaining TA are garbage, and if you don't know TA yourself, you won't be able to judge whether or not the video is good.

Similarly, the overwhelming majority of FA videos on YT are garbage. *Does that mean FA is a bunch of bullshit, too?* No, certainly not.

Find a credible and well respected place to learn TA before you dismiss it. Start with finding someone with the designation Chartered Market Technician (CMT), which is essentially having a Masters degree or PhD in Technical Analysis."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I use technical analysis for all my trading. Patterns, volume and levels.
You only think its bullshit because you don‚Äôt know how to do it, or you only see people who don‚Äôt know how to do it (which is a majority of reddit and social media) correctly.
It definitely increases probabilities, knowing where price has support and resistance is very important - and keeping track of where buyers and sellers are doing business can give you a large advantage.
It‚Äôs just based on the fact that price is either range bound, or trending - that we can probably agree on right - and when price breaks a range it tends to move on until it needs to consolidate and become range bound again (at a key resistance). 
When price is consolidating - it tends to form patterns.
Ive noticed 100s of instances where the breaks of these patterns are followed by major news releases and other huge catalysts. It‚Äôs uncanny. I can show you some shit that would really make you believe it honestly."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Premise is false: If 90 percent of day traders lost money, only ten percent would remain. So 100 percent of day traders would make money."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I'm not an experienced trader or investor by any means but I agree, fully.

I've never attempted day trading or anything other than well thought over, thoroughly considered long buys on dips of specific companies I, subjectively, trust to be good business. By my own criteria, by my own reading on the various subjects and analyzing everything people say with my own mind. Learning from things I believed to be true and sound. Never invested in any tech stocks either.

Now, while many people I know who either invest or trade are running circles while being on fire, forums and Reddit screaming about their minus 35-40 losses on the portfolio I'm chilling. Lost 4% since the portfolio has been finished, which had been 2 wks before the correction (or bearish march, we're yet to see) as of now. The peak loss has been about 8% and it has been climbing slowly for some days now.

Now if I've started following *any* if thar ultra-harmonic second sequence to the fourth order of Fibonacci analysis, which many people advise you to, by rough estimates I'd be down 60% by this day and dropping heavily. Then you can hope for a surge because, well, the Fibonacci or Decart said so.

03/14/2021,stocks,"I use L2 data to see where the intraday buy/sell walls are and compare that to where I've marked support/resistance prices on the chart for the past.

For instance:

L2 data says 52k shares to be sold at $3.40, and only <10k on nearby price levels up/down on the buy spread. That indicates more resistance at $3.40 so if I wanted in I could buy in at, say, $3.42 to ride the breakout, and set a stop loss around $3.38.

If I had shares and wanted to sell for profit where I think the price will peak (from either chart TA or L2 resistances) at X price, I'd sell at X - 0.02 for a good chance to get out."

03/14/2021,stocks,Nice
03/14/2021,stocks,"My degree is in data science and analytics. I have studied statistics for years and very much know what I am talking about. You have time and time again shown that you do not know how the options market operates and instead of taking a step back and reading back to yourself what you are saying and seeing how illogical it is, you choose instead to dismiss what I am saying out of pride, an overinflated ego and above all sheer ignorance.

Just listen to yourself. You are so hellbent on the stock market being an exact 50/50 split and I have absolutely no reason why. If that were the case, why do you suppose hedgefunds exist? If there was no way to position yourself as the casino with a statistical edge, then how could hedgefunds maintain that very position? Obviously there exists a way to give yourself an edge. And it's selling options. 

Let me give you a trivial example so you can start processing how this works. AAPL is currently sitting at $121. You sell a CSP at two standard deviations out or further - let's choose the 105/25 cent option which has a 95% chance of expiring OTM and worthless and you collect that premium for free. Great, you just got a free 25 dollars. You do this 19 times and collect 25x19 = $475. Now statistically, the 20th time you do this, your put will end ITM. Okay, so let's roll your put out another week at an even lower strike price, let's say 100, which not only gives you another credit of 15 cents, but you now have an even smaller chance of the put ending ITM. You repeat this indefinitely, never have to risk your sold put being exercised and simply collect premium again and again and again. There is absolutely no possible way to lose money in this scenario. But wait, let's say you've been rolling your put and now your new strike is at 80. You go on vacation, forget about your CSP, and Apple dips to 79 when your contract expires and now you get exercised to buy 100 shares of Apple at $80. Guess what. All those weeks of rolling down your put? You were collecting premium over and over and over. So much premium that the cost basis of these shares is as low as $60, and you effectively own 100 shares of Apple, a $79 valued stock, for $60 and can do with them whatever you please.

Let's take it a step further. You now own 100 shares of Apple at a $60 cost basis. Well, Apple has been going down now for quite some time, so you decide to sell covered calls on it. With Apple sitting at $79, you sell a 85 call for 60 cents  for a week out and collect $60 in premium. Now over the next week there are three scenarios: 

1. Apple moves sideways over the next week, your call expires worthless and you get a free $60 and reduce your cost basis by 60 cents more. 

2. Apple goes up and ends above $85, you decide to let your call expire ITM, you make $100x25 plus the premium for a total of $2560. 

3. Apple continues to go down. Keep in mind your current cost basis after the premium is $59.40, so if it goes down past $59.40, then congratulations you officially have started to lose money. But wait, what if I just buy back my 85 call when Apple is at $51 for a fraction of what I sold it at and sell a new call closer to ATM for another $200 in premium? Now I made another $140 and reduced my cost basis down even further to $58 and will repeat this indefinitely as long as Apple goes down. Keep in mind the odds of Apple dropping this low are beyond lottery odds barring a complete implosion of the company. Multiply all of these numbers by 3 if we are going to talk about a stock with high IV.

You are just so disconnected with statistics and probability that it makes my brain physically hurt reading what you write to me. I don't know who told you every trade is a 50/50 but that is the most outlandish concept I have ever heard of in my life. If that were the case, why the fuck would anyone bother with doing any research or putting in any effort whatsoever to what they are investing in? Why not throw a fucking dart at the wall? Hate to break it to you but your professors have failed you by being as stubborn as you are. Go do some research before you make the claim that every trade is nothing more than a 50/50 and you will quickly find out how beyond absurd such a thing is to say. I recommend starting with Tastytrade's ""learn"" page on their website."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Of course the chance is 50/50, stonk either go up or down /s

The 50/50 was in reference to your casino comparison. My point is that any ‚Äûnormal‚Äú asset (excluding meme stocks and such) on the market will always be priced according to the probabilities you keep going on about. To put it really simple, if you‚Äòve got something with a 95% chance of making $100, you‚Äòll pay $95 for it. Maybe this discussion went a bit off the rails, but from your initial statements, it seemed to me like you were saying your strategy enables you to buy a 95% chance to get $100 for $94, which would, in my understanding, be the safe profit you‚Äôre talking about. That would be arbitrage, which, as I mentioned, is non-existent for retail traders like us. On that note, you also can‚Äôt compare retail trading with hedgefunds, since they have better infrastructure, and most importantly, much better information, both on fundamentals and market data, which is what they trade on. You can not do what a hedgefund does, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare yourself to them. 

I‚Äòm not saying that you‚Äôre completely wrong with your understanding of options, you‚Äôre just missing a few things, and from your explanation, I think I know which ones. 

The first problem is that your strategy disregards anything that happens after you ‚Äûstart‚Äú. Historical data is not as reliable as you seem to think it is. Apple‚Äòs history won‚Äôt help you if the interest rate changes or if apple announces another product or if Elon Musk decides to tweet a video of a Tesla rolling over an apple while announcing he‚Äôs gonna build phones now. The likelihood of your options expiring ITM change daily, based on what‚Äôs happening in the world. Especially if something big happens, your whole model won‚Äôt work anymore. 

As a side note, for someone in statistics, your interpretations of them are kind of sketchy at best - the chance of getting 19 consecutive wins on a 95% chance are only around 38% if I‚Äòm not mistaken. Even for 10 wins, we‚Äôre only at 60%. And now it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that a loss on any short option can potentially get pretty bad. 

Regarding the put - it tells a lot that you seem to think there‚Äôs a difference between rolling and getting exercised. Mathematically there isn‚Äôt, at least not in the moment your put expires. This explanation reads like you think rolling is free - it‚Äôs not. You buy back the option you sold, at a much higher cost since it‚Äôs now ITM. At the exact moment of expiry, it‚Äòll cost you exactly the difference between strike and market. If that difference is higher than the premium you collected, you‚Äòve made a loss. Yes, it‚Äôs possible. The premium you‚Äôll get from selling another one of your ‚Äûsafe‚Äú puts won‚Äôt make up for that in most cases. In fact, since losses on short puts are only limited at the very bottom (the stock going to 0), you might just wipe out the meager $500 gain you got from your $12k position. It would only have to fall a few more percent for that. Unlikely? Yes, but far from impossible. You can absolutely lose money by doing what you‚Äôve described. 

The reduced cost basis in your example only makes sense if we assume that you managed to get so many winners in a row that you somehow made $20 per share, or $2k overall. That‚Äôs 80 OTM $.25 puts in a row. Tell me, how likely is that? I‚Äòm getting under 2%. Also, it‚Äòll take a ton of time. Close to 2 years?

If I bought Apple years ago at $40 I could fuck around with my stocks however I wanted and still have a profit. Or if I say that my strategy is going to the casino, going all in on red, win, and after that I‚Äôll invest. If you base a strategy on getting extremely lucky at the start, of course it‚Äòll seem great. 

Now the covered calls - great choice of instrument, imo really the closest thing you‚Äòll get to ‚Äûfree money‚Äú. You‚Äôre correct with point number 1, point number 2 is where you‚Äôre missing something: opportunity cost. By selling a call, you‚Äôre selling your upside potential. If it goes to $90 and your call is at $85, you get the difference between that and your cost basis (not $60 since that‚Äôs just ridiculous), plus the premium, but you have lost $500 that you would‚Äòve made if you hadn‚Äôt sold the call. That means the call has lost you $500 minus premium. 

Again, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you roll it or it expires - the only thing that changes is whether you have stock or cash in your portfolio at the end of the day. I did a bit of research on that, and even in your own post on thetagang, people are commenting that the difference is mostly tax reasons, or wanting to keep the stock for some other reason. 

Just think about it logically, there‚Äôs no difference in getting exercised, buying back in immediately and selling another call, or rolling it by buying the call back and selling another call. 

Point 3 is just making up a random scenario where you still come out on top to somehow prove your point. As I said, basing your strategy on having a super lucky start doesn‚Äôt make sense. If the stock goes down, the call premiums you collect only soften the blow. That‚Äôs great, but you‚Äôre still losing. 

My whole damn point is, you haven‚Äôt found the strategy to play the market and beat the odds. There is no play that is guaranteed to make you money, or that makes it impossible to lose, at least in some way. Even the safest investment there is has some risk attached. Every cent you make is paid for with risk. That‚Äôs how the market works. You can minimize it, but not eliminate it. 

Even hedgefunds can lose money despite doing everything right. Casinos won‚Äôt, because they truly have the odds on their side. 

I‚Äòm not saying the analysis you‚Äôre doing is worthless. It‚Äôs a great tool to supplement your DD. But it won‚Äôt get you anywhere on its own. 

Oh and about your comment that you could just throw darts at a board to invest, you can not only do that, you can even have a [monkey](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickferri/2012/12/20/any-monkey-can-beat-the-market/) do it for you, and still have a great chance at beating a lot of funds and indices.

I also think Apple/Google will probably find a way to cut out Visa and Mastercard in the future and run their own transactions. They have so much cash available and need somewhere to invest it. I think payments processing will be a huge sector for them to invest in.

Some more nice colour about this company for folks, - this is a holding company for the [360 Jietiao](https://www.360jie.com.cn/) microloan app, a company from [Qihoo 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360).

I found this stock earlier this year, and I came across this - [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2075242/0/en/360-Finance-Inc-to-Hold-Extraordinary-General-Meeting-on-September-15-2020.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/08/07/2075242/0/en/360-Finance-Inc-to-Hold-Extraordinary-General-Meeting-on-September-15-2020.html)\- that they changed their name to remove **Finance** for no conceivable reason, without providing any feedback. The original name of the company was Qihoo 360 Finance.

A quote from a Nikkei article about the Ant IPO last year:

>Nikkei: Aside from the excitement of these recent days, two tectonically important points remain: firstly, that Ant's business model, unregulated, would have potentially created systemic risk at a global level; and secondly, that Ant's leadership tried to escape appropriate financial-sector regulatory scrutiny, even removing the word ""financial"" from their name just before their IPO application in July 2020.

Another thing that you haven't mentioned OP is what the new financial regulations are that came out of the Ant IPO knee-capping. Some but not all of the regulations microlending companies must now follow:

1. They need to keep 30% of the loaned amount on hand, instead of just 2%. Meaning their growth drastically cuts, because they cannot loan as much.
2. The balance of funds received by a microfinance company through bank loans, shareholder loans and other non-standard financing forms shall not exceed 1 times its net assets.
3. Licenses to be granted on 3 year terms, and subject to more scrutiny.
4. There's something Bloomberg mentions, that I can't find an original citation for from the CPP: *A shareholder cannot control more than one micro-lender operating nationally*

In general - please continue to approach with some caution.

The main thing id say is that I think you misinterpreted what I was saying re: microlending.  Only 1% of QFIN‚Äôs loans are micro loans - they‚Äôve moved away from that space (according to them). That‚Äôs why I like the stock.  I wasn‚Äôt trying to say that they‚Äôre 1% capitalized for their micro loans. 

If a significant chunk of their revenue came from microlending then I would not have the same opinion of the company.

The fact that so many people *think* that they‚Äôre going to be hit by the microlending regulations is exactly why i think the stock is undervalued."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Oh whoa gotcha, I really did read that bit upside down. Really interesting - I wish there was more to quantify this, what makes the 1% of ""microloans"" different from the remaining loans?  


From my impression reading the regulations in the CPP statement they had more to do with who finances the loan, how much you can loan out - rather than vocabulary around microloans specifically. Thoughts?   


Thanks for engaging in a balanced fashion!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Well that‚Äôs the real question imo. What are the regulations like for loans that aren‚Äôt micro loans? we have the ceo saying that micro loan regulations won‚Äôt affect them significantly but beyond that and the regional thing I mentioned, I can‚Äôt find anything extra. But just because i can‚Äôt find it doesn‚Äôt mean that it doesn‚Äôt exist. That‚Äôs why this isn‚Äôt a yolo.

Read this transcript. They talk about it some here: (omg I can‚Äôt post a seeking alpha link lol but just Google QFIN earnings transcript)

Another thing to check out is their market segment. They dont currently overlap with ant. Go to page 9: https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f

But I believe that is credit quality, not loan size. But is that me using the American definition of prime for Chinese loans where they use a different definition of prime? I‚Äôm not sure.

There are pieces of this I still don‚Äôt understand. The actual definition of ‚Äúmicrolending‚Äù is one of them. My faith is that the ceo would be dragged out and shot by the CCP if he was lying about the impact of microlending regulations... but there could be other things out there I don‚Äôt understand.

The key lesson was the importance of stop-losses, and of sticking to mental stop-losses when the broker doesn't allow them (e.g. penny plays).

Unfortunately I haven't really lost enough to learn it yet.  :DIt's a hobby.  Some people fish, some people hang glide.  I spend money on shady companies and ride pump and dumps.  :D

I'm guess I'm kind of lucky though.  Back in 2016, after a few years of screwing around with stocks and not making much (or losing much) I took about $7500 and picked up NVDA at around $24 a share.  I think it was a little over 300 shares.  I got in again with a smaller buy at $179.  Since then, NVDA has sort of beaten the market.  :)I use the NVDA war chest to fund my OTC bullshit.

I think probably the real lesson I've learned is not to be afraid to enter when the market is taking a giant shit.  For years I regretted not being more aggressive in 08 when the market was nose diving.  I knew it would bounce back, but just didn't have the balls to pull the trigger.  Taking that into account though, when the pandemic knocked everything down back in March and April last year, I jumped in and bought Ford, General Electric, Alaska Air, Marathon Oil, Taiwan Semi, Honeywell, and Google.  I'm out of GE and MRO with 140% and 240% gains respectively.  The rest I'm still holding.

So I guess that's it.  Have the balls to run into a burning building every once in awhile, and if you're seriously investing, stay away from OTC stuff."

They chose to move all their foreign investments to the Amsterdam stock exchange because it was simply getting too big for South African stock exchange. They invested in Tencent back in 2001 and have made an outstanding return, therefore the stake in Tencent has gotten very large. What I like about Prosud is that they ownt a lot of other tech-related potential unicorns in Emerging Markets such as Ifood and Mail.ru. It trades at a discount to Tencent and doesn't even account for all their other ventures. Hence I really like Prosus. Long term lots of potential."

03/14/2021,stocks,You should drink less koolaid. Apple has 200B in cash reserves that literally tells you they sell overpriced shit.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Stuff like dongles are overpriced. Their main things(laptops, desktop and phones are not.) 

There margins on their main products are not huge. I don't know how it's koolaid. There was a shift back in the early days where pretty much all the windows computers shifted into selling at near cost pretty much. They make their money in other formats. Dell with their miserable bloatware and cheap chasis and what not. It's like, imagine the ps5 was 700 dollars. I bet everyone would call it over priced, but it wouldn't be since the ps5 is currently selling at a loss. Because they know they'll make back the money up in psplus and other ways.

That's business. If you cheapen your stuff on the exterior, you can make everyone else look expensive since people don't really look beyond that.

Edit: in my opinion, I'd say people calling the mainstay products from Apple overpriced are the ones drinking koolaid. Since they're just repeating what everyone else is saying instead of finding out why there's an obvious discrepancy between them and literally every other manufacturer in price."
03/14/2021,stocks,"> there's an obvious discrepancy between them and literally every other manufacturer in price

You just answered it yourself. All other manufacturers are able to deliver much cheaper products.

Intel macs are not better than any other computer with the same specs, they have the same heating problems, keyboard problems, wifi problems, etc... (OK I admit the trackpad is really good and the best in the market).

You could make a hackintosh for a fraction of the price, and that is why they will never sell their OS (which means the rest of their software) without the hardware. 

Just look at original iphone SE and iphone 6S, everything expensive, and proprietary  was present in both phones, the main differences were some random components they don't even design, and the 6s was twice the price. Something similar again happened with the SE2 but to a lesser degree."
03/14/2021,stocks,"I've made a hackintosh. They are not the same as having a Mac and anyone who has made a hackintosh will tell you the same thing. Most people don't make hackintosh because they think it's the exact same, they make one because they want apple products/apps without being shuttered into the apple system and without having to buy products which don't let you open them up(the storage and what not.)

Other manufacturers are able to sell a cheaper product by reducing the price to cost or even loss. They make there money in other ways. I don't understand how you thought I answered myself with that. All that says is that other products are cheap and apple products are priced in a more regular manner. If I sell apples for 2 dollars and my neighbour sells it for 1. I buy my apples for 1 dollars from the supplier and so does my neighbour. Am I overpriced or is my neighbour selling for cheap? 


Nobody said intel Macs are better than other computers. Although, I will say that I have a pc I've built and I also have a 16 inch Mac for portability. I do a lot of recording, mixing and mastering and logic is an extremely smooth experience. There's things I don't like about it, but the MacBook beats the latency when compared to cubase on my pc and takes pretty much no tweaking to work(just connect your audio interface and go.) My pc is not plug and play where my Mac is. There's no doubt that the Mac OS is a smoother experience. I mean, all the apps are being made only for their computers, so it doesn't need to be usable and smooth on a huge array of different brands of computers. 

Depending on what you value, a Mac will be better and visa versa, a windows will be better. For me, when it comes to privacy(less tracking), and smoothness, there really isn't something comparable to Mac at the moment. 


I can't comment on the SE since my area of knowledge is only around the iMac(common in studios I've worked,) Macbook(what I use when I want to be portable,) and the iPhone(my business phone.)  

Nobody is saying they're not expensive, but from a business perspective, they're not overpriced. As I said, the margins on dongles and what not are humongous and those can be called overpriced, but not the mainstay products that I listed."
03/14/2021,stocks,"The market is incredibly efficient, there are professional arbitrage traders who take advantage of any disconnect from price to valuation, with financial models and insights far greater than retail traders have. Companies don't randomly buy back their own stock, they announce it to the market and the market (eventually) prices it in. 

In this case, everyone knows that Apple bought back $100B+ of stock last year and their forward guidance stated they would do the same this year. The more mainstream a stock, the harder it is to arbitrage because everyone has a financial model on it and supercomputers running algorithms trade it far quicker than humans can."

I mean, your last post was informative. I had no idea their forward guidance said they‚Äôd do another buyback this year. But I still can‚Äôt seem to make the connection between all that you wrote and why buying back shares won‚Äôt lower the market cap when it happens?

Even if people are expecting it, wouldn‚Äôt it still lower the market cap when it happens? There‚Äôs no way to ‚Äúprice it in‚Äù based on expectations and guidance.

Well, maybe there isn't a ""forever"" here, if there is a serious negative COVID development in the US, but if it's the usual stuff, any reaction will be short lived.

Boeing maybe, but banks have already passed where they were in 2020 before the fall, CVX is pretty close to where it resided for years (the best oil company), and XOM isn't too far away from where it was in early 2020 (another familiar oil company, although it's not as good as CVX is and was declining before ""that thing"" happened)."

But their is two reasons yield increases 

1. FED sells bonds > yield increase (interest rate goes up)

2. People selling bonds > yield increase (interest rate remains the same)

Maybe I am wrong but that's kinda how I understood it.

Now since FED says they are not touching interest rate, the rising yield is likely caused by option 2 and that's likely cos people are ready for economy reopen.

Now to go back to your point about growth stocks, will they be negatively affected by both reasons that I mentioned of what causes yields to increase? Since interest rate is the same I would assume growth stocks that are in fact getting affected by rising yield, is likely cos algos that sell growth stocks as soon as yield increases regardless of what FED says?

To my basic understand, people selling bonds causing yields to increase isn't inflation cos interest rate is still the same so stock market technically shouldn't be affected.

However if FED comes out and says they are rising interest rates and we see the yields go up then 100% makes sense stock market decreasing

From what your saying is regardless if whats causing yields to go up > yields going up = growth stocks decrease REGARDLESS of interest rate?"

At some point we are going to have another tech/biotech growth crash I think. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs been such a rotation to value.  I‚Äôve sold 50% of all my high growth stocks although I might lose in the next couple months, if you have a buy-and-hold strategy I think you got a lessen your risk.

03/14/2021,stocks,"Oh man. I can tell you that environmental science is a ridiculous meme of a degree. Climate science is all based on guesswork and is totally impossible to prove. Further, undergraduate students are incredibly unintelligent, and don‚Äôt even know how to think for themselves.

Now let me ask you some questions. 

Where did all this oil come from? Maybe from living creatures? Does that mean there used to be more carbon in circulation (more life)? Why would that be such a bad thing exactly?

More CO2 is directly correlated with larger and healthier and more numerous plants, is that a bad thing? Wouldn‚Äôt they convert that CO2 into oxygen for us as plant life increases? 

Who stands to benefit from climate change being considered such an emergency? Perhaps climate scientists, who will stop receiving grants if they fail to convince everyone how much of an emergency it is? Doesn‚Äôt that make you alarmed at all, that there‚Äôs a financial benefit for these scientists to make it seem scary?

Now let me tell you about the failures of ‚Äúclimate scientists‚Äù to accurately predict the future. 

Remember all the talk about ‚Äúpeak oil‚Äù over the last 20-60 years? Probably not, because you‚Äôre likely too young and uninformed, and it has quietly slipped away into the night (again!) because it was WRONG. We are finding more and more oil constantly.

There was fear of global cooling in the 70‚Äôs and an impending ice age. How‚Äôd that work out?

Remember al gore saying the sea levels would rise 20 feet soon? That was 15 years ago. Nothing has happened. ‚ÄúExperts‚Äù (educated guessers) are now saying 1-3 feet of increase in 100 years.

The numbers I quoted are from a source i read a while back, the source I linked you just does a better job at explaining but obviously has slightly different numbers since it is a 11 year old paper.

As for the rest of your comment, you can insult me and people who study environmental science all you want, I'd love to know what makes you qualified to claim that environmental science is bullshit. The amount of maths and equations within the subject are at a similar level to geography which is by no means a 'meme' of a subject.

The thing you're missing is that *no one* can accurately predict the future, not even climate scientists. The whole point of science in general is to use data and studies to create a best guess, thats all, so of course there are going to be errors and misjudgements of timeframes along the way.

Albert Einstein, Marie Curie and Newton all died believing something that later turned out to be wrong, does that make the work they did any less important or they themselves any less intelligent? Of course not, it was important groundwork for the future of physics, biology and chemistry similar to what modern day climate science (a science less than 100 years old) will be to the future of climate science.

Just an FYI too about climate change, there is thought (based on our best guess from data we collected) that there is a time buffer between CO2 emissions and temperature increase meaning that only in the next 10 or so years are we likely to see the exponential effects of emissions from the 50s onwards.

YES, you are getting it now, no one can predict the future! We used to call it weather, now every hot or cold year is ‚Äúproof‚Äù of the end of the world.

Not a press, die set, primer, powder bag, or casing in sight.


Also, the time it takes to learn how to reload, the effort put into it, and the dangers that come with shitty reloads have been factored in to the equation. Basically, reloading has done little to solve the ammo shortage.

03/14/2021,stocks,It still doesn't explain whey they are not BUYING if its a sure investment.  Like none of the officers are buying.  That just seems a little weird to me.
03/14/2021,stocks,"Man.  That's good information, thanks.

I honestly think that Facebook article is FUD.  They don't like Apple and Google dictating their business and will do whatever they can to keep the status quo.

While not as large, there have been other businesses (NY Times for one) that have removed behavioral tracking and saw no change in revenue based on ads.  Models that I looked at suggest it's not a big deal. But change is always scary.  


Ads will go to contextual and geo-location for now.

We shall see what happens in the long run."

03/14/2021,stocks,IDK what you mean? kinda new
03/14/2021,stocks,"Higher prices as a one-off impact of higher labor costs does not meet the definition of inflation and the sort of thing that federal monetary policy seeks to control. 

There would need to be a cycle."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Good article to read:

""In this case, a minimum wage could lead to firms passing wage rises onto the consumers in the form of higher prices. This will cause SRAS to shift to the left and higher inflation. Also, if higher minimum wages leads to an increase in consumer spending, it could cause a degree of demand-pull inflation as well.""

03/14/2021,stocks,"Thanks. There‚Äôs nothing there that I disagree with.  

‚ÄúOverall, the effect on inflation would be fairly limited because a minimum wage would only alter AD by a small amount...‚Äù 

All ‚Äúcost of living‚Äù wage increases lead to a higher cost of living. I do understand that. I just don‚Äôt think a minimum wage increase is some special case that instigates some cycle of inflation. 

Thanks again for the link!"
03/14/2021,stocks,"Give the wild ride said shares have taken of late, i would go with the RSU‚Äôs. Depending on the vesting schedule it would make taxes easier to manage as well."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Thank you

You've nicely exposed how overpriced the stock market is now.  It's scary.  I think only one stock I looked up had a future value higher than its current value."
03/14/2021,stocks,"If cathie buys I buy. I mean what sounds cooler:

Real estate millionaire

Dot com millionaire

Bitcoin millionaire

Tesla millionaire

GameStop millionaire 

Or Roblox millionaire"

03/14/2021,stocks,obviously spelling wasn't one of the three things
03/14/2021,stocks,i'm a casual gamer. learned about roblux when i started seeing posts about their IPO
03/14/2021,stocks,Read below my child. We‚Äôre going to make serious money this week.
03/14/2021,stocks,If we open 54-56 on Friday wouldn‚Äôt Tesla also be near 800
03/14/2021,stocks,Could be. But if you notice NIO moves about 30% higher or lower than Tesla not exactly the same.
03/14/2021,stocks,Damn Aussies. LOL Kidding. PLLseems to be rebounding though. Hopefully it will continue.
03/14/2021,stocks,"In every industry there is a potential risk of new competitors entering the market. 

From what I have seen, Amazon is really good in what they do but they fail to dominate markets that are not within their field of expertise (e.g. groceries). Im case of telehealth, Teladoc is too far ahead and established in my opinion."
03/14/2021,stocks,"From my experience with the service, it‚Äôs more or less a rebrand of CBS All Access. IMO nothing to be excited about. They are switching to have theatrical releases on the service after 45 days but still not very sold on the service as being something that will change their business yet."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Looking through posts rn mate , you able to link me something about this. 

Thanks"
03/14/2021,stocks,"It was a tweet by Burry. As Burry does often, he deleted it."
03/14/2021,stocks,"Oh ok , no problem mate. I know he does that, kinda weird."
03/14/2021,stocks,Only applies if you repurchase the same security within a 30 day period.  The IRS put in it place to discourage people from creating a loss for a tax year to offset gains.
03/14/2021,stocks,This is only available outside the US I believe. But important note for international growth.
03/14/2021,stocks,They‚Äôve got so many Marvel and Star Wars shows in the pipeline with Keven Feige and Jon Favreau backing as producers. I don‚Äôt see how people aren‚Äôt seeing this is a rocket ship about to take off.
03/14/2021,stocks,You and me both. Still ‚Äúsafer‚Äù than most.
03/14/2021,stocks,I think 5% of the fee you pay or something like that... so if you pay $450 on a transaction you should get $45 in stock.
03/14/2021,stocks,"50 % at $25,000
25% at $50,000

03/14/2021,stocks,"Depends where you are, I‚Äôm a Canuck so I didn‚Äôt specify. If you‚Äôre US then yes an IRA."
03/14/2021,stocks,"SNE ain‚Äôt going anywhere. PS5 best sales ever still won‚Äôt really move the dial for Sony. DIS is transitioning into growth with their subscriber numbers, and will jump when the parks reopen in April, then will fly with a fully vaccinated US by July."
03/14/2021,stocks,Thanks I just started investing my own money in a brokerage account. Obviously the money I'm depositing has already been taxed. I'm not sure how the rules work. Eventually I'm going to talk to someone at fidelity about it. I assume I take take out as much as I put in without being taxed on it a second time?
03/14/2021,stocks,Sne should go up when movie theaters re open though?
