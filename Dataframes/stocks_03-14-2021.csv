2021-03-14 19:58:27,stocks,"New to the investing world Hi, I’ve just started to try and study into the world of stocks. I’m 19 and don’t really have a great deal of complex financial knowledge. However I know my way around statistical analysis to an extent. 

So far I’ve been reading some books and having a go on demo broker accounts to get used to how trading works. 

I think Im mainly looking to invest portions of money each month to hold long term and I’ve seen things such as the S&P 500 as possible ‘safer’ ways of doing this. But I also want to try investing in other things as well. 

Any advise of how you first started off or some tips would be much appreciated. Thank you for your time!"
2021-03-14 19:35:16,stocks,"Stocks vs Options. Is it possible to make good money buying stocks or are options the only way to go. Greetings and salutations, 

It seems to me that any gain porn I've ever seen comes from people becoming millionaires in the space of 1-3 years by trading options. Being relatively new to stocks and trading, I've bought into a few stocks here and there but the only feasible way to great gains (and equally great losses) is through options. 

Am I wrong?"
2021-03-14 19:11:08,stocks,"IPO Hype Question In preparation for the Coinbase IPO I started to look into technology or Fintech companies that have IPO'd over the last 10 years. It would seem that many of these companies start higher then their close. In other words, the open price often falls by a couple of percent after a couple of days. 

Historical data seems to indicate this is a trend? Is it a fair statement to expect this behavior? 

Is this why people hold off from buying the first day only to buy a few days later? 

Note* I understand this is part data part speculation. Looking for opinions here."
2021-03-14 19:03:31,stocks,"How much of my portfolio should be ETF Ok relatively new to investing. I am 32 and previously have just had a 401k for about 6 years.  I took about 10 grand and opened an account that I have been slowly buying stocks with. So far I had only about 5k invested. 50% in AAPL, AMZN DIS and 50% in APHA and CHPT.

Basically I am looking to but the remaining 5k into EFT. I figured this would have me at 25% Growth stocks, 25% value stocks and 50% EFT.  The EFTs I am planning to buy (likely next week) are ARKF, ARKF and PRNT (not 100% sure about PRNT yet). Is this a good portfolio model to follow? I plan on adding about 4K-6k a year for now as well as diversifying more. Should I be investing more in value and growth stocks and less in EFT?"
2021-03-14 18:56:27,stocks,"Question about taxes So from January of this year till now I have been selling shares and options for profit and have been putting aside as much as possible so I’m not screwed by taxes next year. However, in this time I’ve also had a decent amount of losses mainly through options. The losses are not significant compared to my capital gains but I was wondering if I’d still be able to get a some kind of tax break from them. Like for example if I profit 10k off of something but I also suffer a 3k loss off of a completely different trade, am I simultaneously getting taxed and getting a tax break? Or is it based off of my overall capital gain by the end of this year?"
2021-03-14 18:43:05,stocks,"Best short term gains I try not to post anything about meme stocks because I just don't understand them that much. As a semi-new investor, I am so tempted to throw my whole stimulus check in and tomorrow am and pull it out within a few hours when it goes up. But I know there's no guarantee it will go up. I'm just hoping many people are going to do the same and drive the price up a bit. 

But then the realist in me thinks it's just too risky. That I have $1400 more than I had and I should be happy about that. I'm currently looking at the best options for short term gains. I need to pay off a large bill very very soon, and kinda desperately need the money. Anything look good to anyone? I'm doing my own DD, but would always welcome advice as well.

But, yeah, I am so tempted to go all in tomorrow."
2021-03-14 18:33:14,stocks,So what about BA? Thoughts So I bought Boeing a couple weeks ago around 200 now it’s up quite a bit. So I am kind of new to investing and I will switch from individual stocks to etfs soon but I really don’t know how high it can go? are there ways to predict it? Obviously no one can accurately predict it but what would be your range of high?
2021-03-14 18:27:29,stocks,"GoodRX (GDRX) - is a GOOD long-term investment On Friday (3/12/2021) GDRX fell sharply, at one point close to 14%. It ended up closing down just over 10%, on news of a 4th quarter loss. Not a good line to start a pitch, but when you look at one of the large contributing factors to the loss you see that maybe concerns are overblown. The CEO received $285 million in stock based compensation for the companies IPO. GDRX also donated $41 million to charity. And over the next two years there is still $160 million to award the CEO. That's a lot of money to be sure, but it's not a sign of something that is wrong with the fundamentals.

This is a company that was profitable in 2019 ($66 million in income) and is in space that will only grow.

GRDX helps consumers save money on prescription drugs. They partner with pharmacies, get their data from the pharmacies, and in turn help consumers save. With healthcare being such a large part of the US economy and so many people aging and needing more medication, helping people save money is a good thing. And more people will be turning to GDRX to save money as we have more people age. 

A threat to them is if Amazon or Walmart tries to enter their space. But do you trust Amazon or Walmart not to use your data? I don't. I would bet most people don't. GDRX doesn't. They partner with pharmacies and don't get any data from their consumers.

With the recent drop in price, this is a value play. GRDX is a long-term play. I see this company going up 5 - 10x or more in 8 - 15 years. I know that time horizon isn't popular but that's the reality."
2021-03-14 18:05:34,stocks,"How do I find out if some paper stock certificates are even worth anything? My mother is going through some old papers from my grandfather, she found old paper stock certificates for 5,000 shares of Tennessee Valley Oil Company bought in 1956. I have no idea of even how to find out if they are worth anything or not. Any advice is greatly appreciated."
2021-03-14 18:03:31,stocks,"Thoughts on defense stocks? I feel like defense stocks have a good potential, especially with Biden in office. I'm still new and I currently only paper trade so you shouldn't take advice from me but I think the military-industrial complex will prosper in the next few years."
2021-03-14 17:31:05,stocks,"Where do you monitor for the latest breaking company news, that isn't either garbage, or waffle? When it comes to shorting stocks, we know that bad news is often a catalyst for a price drop.

Where do you guys go for the most accurate and instant news? I monitor the news ticker on finviz which updates in real time but there's a lot of guff in there too. Like it just posts all articles, and around half are just nonsense.

What is considered a good media source for business news, and ideally one that springs news on companies that people don't keep an eye on.

Every media outlet going posts an article when Tesla do something, but I want news relating to the kind of stocks that only see interest when they start crashing or mooning."
2021-03-14 16:56:24,stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021 Good Sunday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 15th, 2021.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
> “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
> “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
> # Growth vs. cyclicals
> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
> “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
> “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
> “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
> “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
> “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
> Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
> “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
> # Bond volatility
> There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
> The program expires March 31.
*****
> “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
> “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
> “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

> March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

> # Signs of Life in Europe?

> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

> While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

> We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

> # Versatile Outperformers

> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

2021-03-14 16:47:43,stocks,"LNC or ALL ? I am currently looking at changing to long holds in different sectors. For insurance sector looking at LNC and ALL. Both look fairly valued with ALL being the bigger (I like that) and LNC having more potential upwards. It looks like ALL is more in up movement, currently at 115 going to 120. LNC looks like it is with 59 quite near their 60 price target. 

What do you guys think of these two? Or in other suggestions in this sector. I am not looking for high growth high risc stocks, prefer the slow growth less attention needed :)"
2021-03-14 16:32:59,stocks,"Any other books like Market Wizards or Money Masters? I’ve read all the Money Masters books, where the author interviews famous fund managers (Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet, etc.). The Money Masters and New Money Masters are fantastic books by the way if you haven’t read them. Each fund manager explains their style and experience trading stocks with a lot of insight provided. I am now reading all the Market Wizard books, and they are equally engrossing. Are there any other books or resources online that are like this, where they interview money managers and get their opinions on investing/trading? Hearing about other people’s experiences and successes is one of my favorite parts of being involved in the stock market, and I think that’s why I enjoy this sub so much. The amount of knowledge out there is incredible and we are all very lucky to have these subs."

2021-03-14 15:57:45,stocks,"Lump Sum Investment Right Now I’m curious to see what the opinions are on what to do with a lump sum right now (pension transfer to a LIRA in Canada). I’ve been debating a few different options and having a difficult time deciding. I will leave some of it for riskier investments, but for majority of it I would like to be smart with. The options I’ve considered are:

1. Picking one or a couple ETFs and throwing it all in now. (Very uncomfortable with this at ATH) I’ve considered protective puts with this approach but the price of those really eats into any profits
2. Throw a portion of it in now and leave some cash to buy if/when it dips.
3. Make purchases periodically to average in over a select timeline and sticking to it.
4. Buying Leaps of the ETFs I choose to capture some gains while preserving cash to buy if it goes south. I was thinking if I had money to buy 2000 shares I’d buy 20 ITM leaps.
5. Waiting for a crash. 

I appreciate any input. Thanks."

Lets say I don't have the cash available to purchase the contract woth the money in my TD account but still want to exercise the contract, could I use the profits from my option to buy the 100 shares at the strike price and pocket the left over $100? Or can you not double dip?

PSEC and SJT both came out on top

Quick Note: 777USD is the equivalent of $1,000 CAD with the -3% transfer fee

**PSEC:**

* $6.12 USD | 7.63 CAD per Month
* $73.44 USD | 91.61 CAD per yr
* PSEC: 777 / 7.55 (current price) = 102 (shares) \* 0.06 (dividend) = 6.12 (monthly dividend) \* 12 = 73.44 USD yr
* (When next payment is and how much) [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PSEC/dividend/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PSEC/dividend/)

**SJT:**

* $9.3 USD | 11.60 CAD for 8 months
* $74.4 USD | 92.80 CAD yr
* SJT: 776 / 4.17 = 186 (shares) \* 0.05 (Dividend) = 9.3 (monthly dividend) \* 8 = 74.4 USD yr
   * Stock normally misses a few months in the year so it's 8 rather than 12

2021-03-14 12:39:48,stocks,"My way into investing so far - loss 5% Hello and good sunday morning :)

This will probably be a long post, but then you can kill some time before market opens monday :D

I'm pretty new to investing, I got into it about 1 month ago. I'm trying to read up TA and FA, i'm not sure witch one I like the best tho. But I think maybe FA is best for beginner.

I have read, that I should try to diversify my portofolio and I have tried to do that. But those say, that it is best to only have a few stocks, when no investing more capital than I have. As said I went with diversify a bit, but meh that seems to have gone a bit wrong.

My portofolio so far is:

\- **Apple (AAPL)** \- 26 stocks - buyin price 123,15$ - my plan is very long hold on this one. Reason for buying. I liked the entery price, and I think for many years they will still be one of dominant players in phone market.

\- **Companhia de Saneamento Básico do Estado de São Paulo - SABESP (SBS)** \- 156 stocks - buyin price 7.67$ - My plan is long hold. Reason for buying. It is a water company so I saw this as a rater safe stock, as ppl will need water both now and in future.

\- **Corsair Gaming, Inc. (CRSR)** \- 60 stocks - buyin price 47,98$ auch - This one been expensiv learning lesson. With current price at 34$ this might turn into a very long hold. The reason for buying is I think they have oki position in market, and even tho that ppl will spend less time on gaming, once the world opens up, then I still think that new ppl have opened their eyes for gaming while being at home.

\- **Crayon Group Holding ASA (CRAYN.OL)** \- 125 stocks - buyin at 141.25 NKK - Plan to hold semi long. Reason for buying is that even tho I bought at high price, I still think that there is room for growth.

\- **Daimler AG (DAI.DE)** \- 25 stocks - buyin price 66,5 euro - Plan to hold untill start 2022. Reason for buying is that I wanted a luxury brand in portofolio, and I want to learn and see what happens when/if they but the truck division on the stockmarket.

\- **Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL)** \- 60 stocks - buyin 43,22$ - Plan is to sell soon, cause I'm up 15% in this one. I had hoped for the world to be more open, but I think 2021 will also be a bad year for airliners. If business travel goes down in comming years, and with more debt added to the company, I think it is time to run. Reason for buying was, that I had hoped for a return to ""normal"" in spring, but looks like it will be longer.

\- **Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (DBK.DE)** \- 125 stocks - buyin price 10,72 euro - Plan is to hold for 3-5 years. Reason for buying, is I wanted a bank in portofolio too, and was looking around and thought that this one could be oki. It has a name and pretty big and they are in the mid of a turn around. They have completed 85% of the turn around goals set out in 2019 and the golas should be done in 2021/2022, so I think they are on the right track.

\- **Norway Royal Salmon AS (NRS.OL)** \- 55 stocks - buyin price 202,42 NKK - Plan is to hold for 1-2 years max. Reason for buying I think there is more room for growing and with new factories opening up and with restaurants opening up later this year, I think will be positive for them.

\- **Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR)** \- 25 stocks - buying price 29,09$ - plan is for long hold on this one. Reason for buying not really any, was looking for a tech stock and this one was talked about alot.

\- **Pfizer Inc. (PFE)** \- 70 stocks - buying price 34,91@ - Plan is to hold till the annual report for 2021 and then dicide what to do with it. Reason for buying guess a stable company and was interested in seeing how the vaccines will influence them.

Overall i'm down about 5% for this roughly last month since I started. Still have some cash that I need place in something.

**My investment profile**

My investment profile is mostly semi long to long. While I do try to keep up most days I feel it can be overwelming specially for a new investor, so I plan to revisit and look over my stocks like every quarter and see if I want to change something. This portofolio is for pure investing, retirement account that hold bonds, etfs, stocks etc, I don't consider that account ""investing"" but more a passiv thing. So what I want to learn with this one portofolios is to look for ""bargins"" and companies I believe in.

**My plan for idle cash/shortlist**

I still think prices on many stocks are high, so I'm not sure if to put rest of money that atm is idle in the account into more stocks.

On my list of stock to maybe buy is:

\- **Hugo Boss AG (BOSS.DE)** \- I think when ppl can return to shops, they might get a high sale.

\- **Halliburton Company (HAL)** \- With olie prices up and it looks like Texas might open fully up, maybe this one, could be a bet if not buying BP, Chevon etc.  
\- **Index fonds** with focus on the european markets - if the US is ""overpriced"" compared to EU-markets then this could be option I think.  
\- **Essity AB (publ) (ESSITY-B.ST)** \- Is a women personal care mostly, and with ppl going out more women also needs more personal care products :)

**My questions are the following:**

\- Is my portofolio totally messed up?  
\- Would you cut down on number of companies and put the money from the sell off into the other stocks that is left after sell off?  
\- Is it oki to discuss european stocks here? I mostly see US stocks - that is great cause gives me information about the US stock market. I'm from Europe (DK), so sometime I miss talks about european stocks.  
\- When I started to buy the stocks I thought the prices on nearly all stocks were very high and was a bit scary of jumping into investing, but with the negativ rates in the bank, I though was better to invest. But in times like this when stockmarket is really high, is it then oki to be mostly semi-long to long, or is it better to marke more trades and taking small profits?  
\- How did you get started? Reading books? Podcasts? YT?  
\- Have you ever doubted your trades and how did you handel it? Sometimes when I see red numbers I feel like I suck at it, and to affraid to cut losses, is there a way to overcome the feeling and say enough is enough, let me just sell and move on?  
\- Based on my investment profile and shortlist/plan - do you have other recomendations? (the markets I can trade on is US, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Norway)

2021-03-14 11:00:59,stocks,"The Next Tech Software Play: Acquisition-Driven Vertical Market Software? Is the next Tech software play in acquisition-driven vertical market software?

[Constellation Software may cut dividend, plans to pursue bigger deals](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canadian-software-star-may-cut-dividend-as-it-pursues-big-deals-1.1563950)

Constellation Software (CSU) is a much younger version of Roper Technologies (ROP).  Think Berkshire Hathaway plus technology.  Also, the scope of the software offerings is broader for the former than for the latter.

This little-known Canadian play in vertical market software returned at least 3600% between mid-2010 and mid-2020.  More importantly, the stock went up *even as interest rates went up in 2016*, because all acquisition targets were already profitable and cash-flow-generating businesses, and were also bought at a discount.  In other words, all acquisitions were a corporate exercise in value investing.

In turn, this company has a little brother of its own, Canadian-based Enghouse Systems (ENGH), and has also spun out European-focused Topicus (TOI).

The earlier question isn't about any of the aforementioned companies specifically.

Is there potential for one or more ""next Constellation Softwares"" that are in the business of acquisitions for building vertical market software empires as lucrative as the above, especially as we come closer to 2023-2024 and beyond?

[Such plays could ""stonk"" even while the rest of the tech bubble pops, so long as their acquisitions are corporate exercises in value investing.]"
2021-03-14 10:48:06,stocks,"AudioEye (AEYE) DD - The digital accessibility SaaS leader # Overview 

AudioEye is a SaaS company operating in the niche and fast-growing digital accessibility industry. It provides a software solution for businesses to make their websites ADA and WCAG accessibility compliant using AI / machine learning without modifying website design or code. This helps companies steer clear of digital accessibility lawsuits (which have been sky-rocketing in recent years) for not providing a suitable website for persons with disabilities. AudioEye also has a help-desk for customers and provides legal support in case a digital accessibility lawsuit occurs. 

Past and present customers include Uber, GameStop, Samsung, Kia, Tommy Hilfiger and Square.

# Management and employee satisfaction

The company was founded by Jim Crawford and Sean Bradley in 2005. Jim Crawford is no longer involved with the company and Sean Bradley still owns shares of the company (very minor stake), but is no longer on the Board or on the Executive Team (no involvement with the direction of the company).

The current Chairman of the Board and third-largest individual shareholder is Dr. Carr Bettis. He has been at the forefront of the company’s operations in recent years. He’s a serial entrepreneur with previous experience in developing financial science and technology innovations businesses that have been acquired. He received his Ph.D. from Indiana University and is a former tenured professor and researcher. 

The current interim-CEO and largest individual shareholder (through Sero Capital) is David Moradi. He is an entrepreneur and founder and CEO of Sero Capital, a private investment firm focused on growth opportunities in the technology sector.

Recent notable hires include Rob Ulveling as Chief Business Officer (former Product Marketer at Pinterest and Facebook) and Zach Okun as Chief Product Officer (former Product Manager at Facebook and Oracle).

The company has a 3.4 rating on Glassdoor (24 reviews), 44% approval of the Interim-CEO and the reviews highlight the employees alignment and approval of the company’s mission. However, there are many complaints that the company is too profit-focused and that the recent executive team reshuffle has brought along plenty of unwelcome changes and layoffs. Employees speculate the company is being prepared for a possible buy-out or acquisition.

# Industry and competition 

AudioEye is the largest and only publicly traded company specialized on providing B2B digital accessibility solutions.

Notable competitors include Siteimprove, accesiBe, Silktide and other small private businesses.

# Moats and competitive advantages 

AudioEye offers the most complete and comprehensive solution for websites to become accessibility compliant. Their use of machine learning and AI is a big moat when measured up against the technology of competitors. They currently have around 32,000 customers, representing a 370% increase over 2019, which further exemplifies their business strength and relevance.

In an industry with little serious competition, AudioEye’s current financials, brand, customer base and technology represents a huge advantage over competitors. There’s also the advantage that this industry is still small enough that none of the big tech players will bother with it just yet.

# Areas of growth

The digital accessibility industry is still in its early-stages. AudioEye should remain at the forefront of any industry tailwinds and grow accordingly. There’s a ton of potential internationally for their suite of products as more and more countries crack down on and further scrutinize digital accessibility. 

A possible expansion into App accessibility could provide a huge catalyst for growth for the company, in my opinion.

It is estimated 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability, so you can probably see how huge the market opportunity is for a company that provides a suite of products like this.

If AudioEye continues investing into AI and machine learning, they could develop superior technology that would improve margins exponentially, facilitate rapid expansion and possibly be used for other product suites or applications.

# Potential headwinds 

The biggest threat for AudioEye would be a big tech company suddenly becoming interested enough in the industry and deciding to launch a competitor (specially if they have good AI technology to use as leverage). Although I don’t see it happening any time soon, it would be fatal for a company like AudioEye at this stage.

Also, there are some reports that AudioEye’s technology isn’t that complex and that their recent growth and adoption is mostly based on a culture of fear and ignorance businesses have developed to avoid getting sued. There might be some truth to this, and if a scandal broke out discrediting the technology, dragging adoption down, AudioEye as a company would become worthless pretty quickly.

Tech experts argue that AudioEye’s customers could easily develop the same solution in-house if they really wanted to and without too much hassle and/or added cost.

# Institutional and insider ownership, short interest

* Institutional ownership sits at about 15-16%.

* Insider ownership and major individual shareholders: 

- David Moradi, including indirect ownership through Sero Capital (Interim-CEO): 3,119,600 shares (29.13% of total shares outstanding)

- Jamil Tahir, including indirect ownership through TurnMark Capital (Board Member): 229,564 shares (2.14% of total shares outstanding)

- Dr. Carr Bettis (Executive Chairman): 155,773 shares (1.45% of total shares outstanding)

- Sachin Barot (CFO): 134,834 shares (1.26% of total shares outstanding)


**- Total % of outstanding shares held by insiders: 35-36%.**

* Short interest is currently 20.28% of the total floating shares

# Earnings

**From the latest earning report:**

* Quarterly net revenue was $5.6 million, up 57% YoY
* Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) was $1.9 million, up 58.33% YoY
* Quarterly gross profit margin of 73%, up from 66% YoY
* Quarterly net loss of $3 million, up 114.29% YoY

* Full-year net revenue was $20.50 million, up 90% YoY
* Full-year gross profit margin of 71%, up from 59% YoY
* Full-year net loss of $7.2 million, down 7.69% YoY

* Guidance for full-year 2021 of revenue between $30 to $32 million, representing a 46.34%-56.10% YoY increase over 2020

* Spent $2,134 million of quarterly revenue (38.11% of total) and $4,138 million of full-year revenue (20.19% of total) on Stock Based Compensation expenses, which is the principal cause for the widening quarterly EPS loss and the lackluster full-year 2020 EPS improvement.

* Spent $430,000 of quarterly revenue (7.68% of total) and $1.230 million of full-year revenue (6% of total) on Research and Development expenses, which is unusually low for a SaaS company (specially one with AI and machine learning components).

# Balance Sheet

* $9,095 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents 
* $14,631 Million of Total Current Assets
* **$18,254 Million of Total Assets**

* $9,015 Million of Current Liabilities (including $6,328 Million of Deferred Revenue)
* $1,083 Million of Long-Term Debt
* **$10,620 Million of Total Liabilities**

# Valuation metrics

* Market cap: $305.10 Million
* Total shares outstanding: 10.71 Million
* **PE Ratio: N/A**
* P/S Ratio: 14.88
* P/B Ratio: 39.98
* D/E Ratio: 0.17
* **Negative Free Cash Flow (estimated): ($3.5-4 Million)**
* **PEG Ratio: ≈ N/A**

# Principal financial metrics of closest competitor (all competitors are private companies, so I’m comparing it to a smaller-cap, more mature SaaS just for reference. AudioEye should, ideally, achieve gross margins on the level of PagerDuty at some point):

**NYSE: PD**

* Market Cap: $3.461 Billion
* Revenue: $210 Million
* Gross profit margin: 86.20%
* PS Ratio: 16.48

# Price action 

AudioEye currently sits 35.77% below its 52-week high. It’s a highly volatile stock and has corrections in the double digits on a semi-frequent basis. Only fit for investors with a stomach for short and medium term volatility and extremely high risk tolerance.

Current valuation is by no means a bargain and the stock is probably close to fair value or maybe a tad overvalued due to several fundamental risks.

# Pros

1. Fast-growing, possibly huge industry in its infancy and this company has the strongest moat and resources to grab up major market share in years to come.
2. Interim-CEO has a ton of skin in the game with 29% total ownership.
3. 50% insider and institutional ownership (with growing institutional ownership and interest).
4. 90% revenue growth, 71% gross profit margin. Rapidly improving margins and good guidance for 2021.
5. Committed to becoming cash-flow positive this year and will probably become Non-GAAP profitable this year as well.
6. Healthy balance sheet with little debt and enough net cash to sustain the current cash burn for at least 2 more years without diluting shareholders any further.
7. Encouraging recent hires of talent from Facebook and Pinterest.

# Cons

1. Extreme levels of Share Based Compensation expenses is a huge problem in my opinion. It’s dragging very heavily on EPS and Free Cash Flow. The company should aim to pull way back on these expenses at this stage.
2. It’s urgent that the company generates positive Free Cash Flow this year. Things could get nasty otherwise.
3. Lack of continued executive leadership and non-involvement from the founders is a problem.
4. The company is being led by Private Equity firms and owners. I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re working towards the company being sold so they can cash out. There’s also a risk that all of these people could cash out at any time and leave the company stranded, diluted and with no leadership to speak of.
5. Not profitable, not cash flow positive.
6. Burning $3.5-4 million in cash per year with a net cash position of $9 million. 


Disclaimer and conclusion: I’m cautiously bullish on AEYE at this point and have a small exploratory position. I truly believe the market opportunity and projected growth for the industry they’re in is insane, but there are several fundamental risks and challenges with the company that need to be acknowledged. Current valuation is probably fair, but not a bargain. Invest at your own caution and discretion."

I’m not sure how to feel. Most of the articles I’ve read only offer one sentence type explanation for why the price is down so much. So I thought it’d be cool to ask y’all.

Bear Case:

- It has a ~50 P/E which is super high for a value stock but maybe average for a tech growth stock. 

- Up about 40% 1 year (Reference SP500 is up ~50% and QQQ is up ~70%)

- TA shows pretty clear 6 month bearish channel 

- Bond yields rising so growth stocks are taking a hit. CRM down ~12% (reference QQQ down ~6%)

Bull Case:

- Goldman just moved CRN into their conviction but category. The average analyst rating implied an upside of ~20%.  

- CRM seems to be a dominant leader in CRM and SaaS. 

- Has grown revenue ~30% YoY. Super crazy profit margins (don’t remember exact numbers but ~ 60%). Very low debt and asset/liabilities.


I should note that my source for the second point in the Bull case is from a couple YouTube videos and articles I’ve looked at; I’m not an expert so I wasn’t able to make sense of Salesforce lead in CRM or SaaS yet.

One example I can think of is low-volume stocks. If person A shorted that low volume stock with their 100k, wouldn't they be able to cause a relatively large drop in price since the volume is low and their capital can short a lot of shares? What about vice versa?

Again sorry if this is a stupid question, just tryna learn (also sorry if this the wrong flair, not sure which was one more suitable). Thanks!"

2021-03-14 03:26:15,stocks,"Triterras $TRIT DD **Summary**

* Triterras is a global trade finance company that is using blockchain technology to bring financing opportunities to parties with who banks do not want to work with due to increased regulations and thus lower margins with traditional systems.
* Recent price action is due to accusations of fraud in a short report which caused a 50% price drop.
* My belief is that many of the allegations are not substantive, and the ones I haven't dismissed are highly speculative.
* Recent events have added support to the companies reliability and future growth and have, in my opinion, resolved the worry of fraud.
* Recent filings show the short float might suddenly jump from 36% to 45%-50% due to a decrease in the float.
* If this is the case, then a strong price reversal is imminent.

**Company Overview** 

[Triterras](https://triterras.com/) is hoping to address the market of small and medium-sized companies who do global trade but who do not work with large enough supplies to qualify for traditional financing with banks. This is largely due to new stricter regulations to protect the parties involved. Such regulations are beneficial in avoiding cases of fraud, but make it less worthwhile for banks to work with companies who don't make enough money to qualify the increased effort and thus lower profit margins on the bank's side.

Triterras is using blockchain technology to more efficiently provide financing whilst still meeting the new regulatory requirements. They're not the only company trying to do this, but they're the one who is furthest ahead. They are also largely focused on bringing traders to the platform, fully aware of the fact that the network effect is both the greatest hurdle and greatest advantage in situations like this.

**What happened?**

A couple of short reports ([A](https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-triterras-trit)) ([B](https://phase2partners.egnyte.com/dl/bZMK5uwx27/)) were released with accusations of fraud. The former is relatively speculative, but it has been shared on Reddit before so I included it. Many of the concerns seem far-fetched, especially given the renewed support recently (discussed later). The later report is far more detailed. Many of the accusations are directly discussed in Triterras's [announcement](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/33/triterras-company-statement-in-response-to-short-report) and have in fact already been brought up by the SEC in an earlier [form](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-033318/). Obviously, Triterras didn't provide as much of an answer as I would have liked, but again I think many of the accusations are speculative. A seeking alpha article provided a very thorough look into the situation and much of the comments section furthered the discussion with really valuable perspectives (written by 1035 Capital Management, I cannot link the article per sub rules). I highly recommend reading through all of these resources in full.

As a result of these reports, the share price fell from the $11-$14 range to the $6-$8 range. I believe a large number of short positions were taken out during this time, see [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/TRIT) and [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/trit). The current shares shorted is around 8 million shares with a float of around 24 million shares.

**Recent Events**

Recently, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/37/triterras-announces-strategic-partnership-with-western) a partnership with Western Union, a massive leader in money transfers and financial services. The description of the partnership provides renewed support in Triterras being a sound company with a hopeful future. 

Moreover, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/38/triterras-signs-letter-of-intent-to-acquire-invoice-bazaar) the intent to purchase Bazarr, furthering the regional expertise of the company and providing renewed support for future growth.

**Institutional Ownership and Buyback**

Here is where things get a bit more speculative. With the drop in share price, Triterras [announced](https://ir.triterras.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/34/triterras-authorizes-50-million-share-repurchase-program) a $50 million dollar buyback. The verbiage used is 

*""Triterras’ recent share price has created an attractive opportunity for the company to institute a stock repurchase program. The Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase of up to $50 million of the Company’s common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions, which may or may not be conducted through 10b5-1 plans.""* 

The key is that the buyback may be done through privately negotiated transactions, remember this.

Looking at the holders on [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TRIT/holders?p=TRIT), we can see that Fidelity owns a large number of shares through both FMR LLC and Fidelity Advisor Growth Opportunity Fund (I'll call them FAGOF, lol). On 02/08 they submitted a [SC 13G form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001327/) to the SEC detailing their new positions (this data is not accounted for on yahoo finance yet). We see that FMR LLC's position is essentially unchanged, while FAGOF more than doubled their position, from 2.2 to 5 million shares. A month later, on 03/10, they submitted another [SC 13G/A form](https://sec.report/Document/0000315066-21-001436/) detailing their new position. Now, we see that FMR LLC owns only 56 shares. During that time, the share price was around $7. That brings the value of their position during that time to around $50-$60 million. Now the trading volume during that time was only a couple million a day, and we see a steady decline from mid-February to late-February. So, and here's the speculative part, my belief is that FMR LLC sold a majority of their position to Triterras as part of the $50 million buyback previously mentioned. The remaining shares were slowly liquidated from mid-February to late-February.

But wait, why would FMR LLC sell all their shares, especially when the price was so low? Well first, so far as I can tell, we don't know what they paid for those shares. It's entirely possible they still made a profit even at this price point. In general, I imagine, Funds like these don't like to participate in stocks that are so crazy volatile and not super reliable. Triterras is a growth company, and the recent news and everything going crazy may have encouraged Fidelity to back out of the craziness. On the other hand, Fidelity's fund focused on growth, FAGOF, which can take the volatility and risk, more than doubled their stake.

Let's assume that 6-8 million shares of FMR LLC's position were sold directly to Triterras through an off-market deal. Triterras already said this was an option, and FMR wouldn't want to trade that many shares on the open market with such a low average volume since it would tank the price. That means the buyback is complete, and the float is now around 16-18 million shares. Further, this means the short float, which was 36%, is now around 45%-50%. Also, right now, the daily volume is low, so the days to cover is around 3, according to the latest [short interest report](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/trit/short-interest).

**Now What?**

Well, if the accusations are true, then the company will probably go bye-bye, or at least get another drop and take a while to recover or just fizzle away into nothingness. But, if instead, the accusations are false or insignificant, then I expect a good price reversal. The current price is only depressed because of the belief in the accusations. So, with a renewed sense in the companies outlook, and a potential 50% short float, the price could easily go back to its past levels or higher.

**Closing Remarks and My Position**

I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter. I didn't go into many specifics about the short reports, especially the analysis of the actual blockchain transactions in report B. If anyone here is familiar with the data I'd love to hear your opinion.

I currently have a few short, medium, and long-term call contracts and a handful of shares. And of course, this is not financial advice and I am not encouraging you to buy this stock. I'm sharing my findings and am eager for feedback on things to reconsider."

Funko is well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market “fairly soon.”

(TL;DR at the end)

=====================================================================

Here are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):

· Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release

· Funko’s CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market “fairly soon”

=====================================================================

FUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS

o Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019

· Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019

· Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%

· Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.

o Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.

o Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys

o Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a “major master toy announcement” fairly soon

FUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC

· Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it’s brand and products

o Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don’t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)

o As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development

· Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule

o FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns

· Funko’s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance

o Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year

o Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019

· Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible

\-- “Virtual cons” in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases

\-- Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness

\-- In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual “Funko Fair” where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.

· The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.

· Funko launched “Funko Pop Albums” in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers

o For example, the AC/DC’s classic “Black In Black” record was Funko’s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers

MULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS

· Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng

o Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)

o Q4 EBITDA beat expectations

· Truist analyst Michael Swartz

o Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)

o Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance

o Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform

o Strong Q4 results

===================================================================

*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis / information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT’s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn’t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and “gut feel.” Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*. That’s all for my PSA. I’ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT’s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*

===================================================================

FUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs “FAIRLY SOON”

There aren’t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT’s right now other than Funko.

*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT’s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*

After today’s [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company’s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko’s valuation.

I don’t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT’s on Funko’s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT’s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Potential impact of NFT’s on Funko’s go-to-market strategy (speculating on how Funko MIGHT implement NFT’s to expand and reinforce their business model):

· Digital items have the ability to move globally in an instant; increasing the total addressable market. Both for Funko and for collectors.

o For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don’t have immediate access.

o For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. 

· All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT’s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.

· NFT’s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items.

o There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.

o Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.

· NFT “artists” or “creators” can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).

o Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko’s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.

Quote from Funko’s CEO [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) about NFT’s:

“We’re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we’re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT’s to our fan base and link NFT’s with physical products. And that’s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT’s. I won’t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we’re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That’s disruptive. That’s new. It’s different. It’s only what Funko can do. And we’re really excited about what the future of NFT’s are. We’re certainly all over this. And I think you’ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.”

TL;DR:

As expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko’s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko’s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko’s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this.

While Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, thier CEO's interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that the company soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT’s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a “toy company.” They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market. (Some examples: [Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30), [Funko 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Freddy-Bloody-leatherface-POP-Exclusive-12-PIECES-EXTREMELY-RARE/143968624938?hash=item218532e12a:g:RgIAAOSwEiNgQco-), [Funko 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FUNKO-Pop-Games-Fortnite-VALOR-463-Vinyl-Figure-NIB/392842180285?epid=15027456221&hash=item5b7737f6bd:g:wRMAAOSwc7Ve6lE9), [Funko 3](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-POP-Star-Wars-Holographic-Darth-Maul-SDCC-480pcs/133480926875?hash=item1f14154e9b:g:JjMAAOSwfYpfJMGL)). Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT’s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.

2021-03-13 23:29:30,stocks,"What is a stock that only idiots would invest in right now? We see a lot of discussion on what stocks will grow and explode over the short, mid, and long term. I don't think I've ever seen a discussion thread on what stocks to avoid completely.  
 
What do you think is a good example of a shit stock that will go nowhere but down?"
2021-03-13 23:05:44,stocks,"Could a successful GME squeeze trigger other memestock short squeezes? So like many other GME has made me interested in the stockmarket and though I've recently started reading up on things I'm obviously still unknowledgeable, so I'd liked to hear from more experienced traders about this speculation of mine.
It's rather simple and I'm sure many of you have already thought about it. 
I don't think it will be happening all that soon but lets fantasize that the squeeze is squozen and one, if not the, largest redistribution of wealth has been completed. That would mean that from one moment to the other there are suddenly now a lot of rich redditors and also normal people. The scenario which I envision is that a lot of them would instantly reinvest their wealth into other stocks, fairly likely other meme stocks. Do you guys/guys having girl avatars, think that right after the GME squeeze other heavily shorted stocks will shoot up and be triggered?"
2021-03-13 23:02:51,stocks,"A daily rundown of my DD schedule.. are you putting in the work? I wake up and immediately check where my watchlist (a group of 30-40 stocks) on seeking alpha are doing to start the day. If it's an up day, I pay less attention and focus on news coverage from various sources.

I check all the politico newsletters, NYTimes (+ DealBook), Axios, CNBC Pro, Forbes business articles (JJ Kinahan Is great), and then check the reddit investing/stock boards/threads and topics. That should take about 30-45 minutes.

Another look at the watchlist, but also with an emphasis on my current portfolio. For stocks I have w less confidence in, on a major up day will track them even more closely (every 5 minutes or so) and look to sell one or two for profit only.

Another swipe at more news articles. Barrons, WSJ (especially Heard on the Street/Stocks/Market section), TheHill finance, Washington Post, ReutersMarket, and 3-4 Twitter stock people I follow from different POV's. 

A quick 10 minute break, and back to Watchlist and Portfolio looking. At this point I've already copied and pasted various quotes I found from all the news sources that total 3-4 pages. 

End the session by looking at Benzinga, TipRanks, and a quick swipe through twitter for any major breaking news. Also will start to zone in on certain stocks on SeekingAlpha (and articles authors I like), as well as a look at Yahoo Message boards to see people's satisfaction or annoyance at stocks they own. 

By now the market should be closed. I do a quick swipe through all the sites again, particularly Barrons and Forbes as they tend to post articles after the bell closes.

By the night, I do a cycle through all the notes I highlighted and copy pasted, to have a gameplan for the next day. I review my watchlist stocks, and place number evaluations I feel comfortable buying at, levels of aggression I want to go at certain stocks depending on earnings reports and sector news, and a general idea of which stocks in order I'd like to go at to start the next day assuming all things are equal. Also another review of my portfolio and which stocks I'd look to sell.

At all times I'm fully prepared w enough cash to spend like crazy if the market were to tank, but in general I limit myself to 2-3 sells/buys a day. Especially recently with the market appearing to be on an upswing. 

On weekends I skim news, but generally try to find a stock book related to psychology and human behavior to gain a deeper understanding of things. I also place a HEAVY emphasis on doing as much DD as possible on my top watchlist stocks, that way if a stock goes down 4-5% in a day, I have full confidence to snatch it up ASAP rather than second guessing myself. 

I'd encourage everyone to construct their own gameplan as well! We're competing with legitimate financial advisors on one level as well as meme stock ""no DD"" people too! The harder you work, the better your odds. With COVID I'd say 80% of my day revolves around stocks and it's very easy to do instead of playing video games, watching TV, or whatever.. especially if you enjoy it. 

Not to mention the most important rule: Keeping a level head and staying unemotional. More than anything, that is far most important.

Now compare this to (no disrespect) some of the people in the general stock discussion thread who have some variation of: ""I have 10K to spend! Do any of you have stock recommendations?"" or ""What tech stocks do people like? I'm thinking of investing!"""
2021-03-13 22:39:34,stocks,"Getting in early - trends of the future I'm interested in thinking about what is just in its infancy now that will become big in the future and why.

EVs: OK, yeah, everyone knows this already and a lot of EV stocks are way overvalued at the moment. But among the winners in this space, I think we'll all look back in 15-20 years and you won't even be able to see a bump on the chart. We're talking about the entire fucking world moving from ICE to EVs. Of course, all the existing automakers will transition too, taking a big part of the pie, but right now is the disruption period where new companies can come in and take their piece too. Looking this far ahead, it'll be hard to lose money no matter what price you get in at now, provided the company is one of the ones that survive. TSLA is an obvious choice.

Fake meat: This too will take over in the next 15-20 years. I'm really noticing a lot more vegetarian and vegan products as well as restaurants popping up everywhere. The move to stop killing animals for food is growing at a faster rate now than it ever did. 30 years ago, I literally didn't know one vegetarian. Today, you meet new vegans every day. I'm not saying meat will go away completely. Probably not. But a large part of our diets will be plant based. Especially once boomers die off. The younger generation has grown up in an environment of sustainability and compassion for animals like I've never seen. Lab grown meat may someday take over (probably) but the technology is not here yet so for now it's plants. Here too, the obvious choice is the only big player on the market: BYND. Also TTCF but I'm not sold on them just yet. Probably worth a bet though. If/when Impossible IPOs then I'll sell my soul for some stock.

What other things do you think will happen in the near future that will change the landscape of our lifestyles?"
2021-03-13 22:39:28,stocks,"Analyst ratings that are up to date?

 Some of the the biggest rebuttals people are saying is the ceiling in SK and the competition. This is defiantly something to keep in mind and look into.  As for me. I don't think this changes much in my eyes. I will wait a few weeks or months to buy because (as people have also said) it does seem pretty overvalued RIGHT NOW. With that said I still think this company has great potential and to me, most of the arguments being made against Coupang are arguments you can say about a lot of companies as well. Thanks again for the Feedback and the upvotes. Much appreciated!

**---------------------------------------------------------------DISCLAIMER--------------------------------------------------------------**

This is my first ever DD, with that being said please be nice, and let me know if anything is wrong and or if I didn't include anything important. Would love some **constructive** criticism, thanks. Also with that being said I don’t know anything about anything. I'm just some guy who read some stuff and compiled it all here. I can’t tell the future. I am NOT a financial advisor. I’m just an ape like all of you. PLEASE do your own research. Humans are known for being wrong and I’m no expectation. I’m bullish on this stock but it did JUST go public therefore there isn’t a ton of history for how the stock performs. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

With that said. I hope you enjoy and learn something from this.

**Coupang Inc DD**

**Ticker - CPNG**

**Initial bullish info (for the apes who can't stand to read more than 100 words)**

* Talked about and known as the “Amazon of South Korea”
* Coupang has been the second largest e-commerce IPO since Alibaba
* Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018
* IPO jumped more than 70%
* Company was valued at $9B back in June 2020 and now is valued at around $90B with a market cap of 86B (at the time of writing)
* CEO’s a Harvard grad of the dropout (just like Zuckerberg)
* Coupang has the highest market share of Korea's E-commerce business
* Improved cash flow by almost a billion dollars in a year
* Similar to Amazon in early years with no GAAP profitability but massive cash flow
* Coupangs the most used online shopping platform in south Korea
* Coupang has continuingly growing branches in Food delivery and grocery services
* Coupang has same day and dawn delivery (place an order by midnight and get it by 7am)
* Eco friendly packaging
* Customer Base has grew by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Now for people who want wrinkles in their brain please continue on reading

**Quantitative:**

* Net Revenue for 2020: $12B up more than 90% from 2019
* Customer base Grew approximately 14.8 Million from 2019 to 2020
* Total net Revenues per active custom increased to approximately $256 in 2020 from $161 in 2019
* Gross profit for 2020: $2B also up more than 90% from 2019
* Operating loss for 2020: $500M down from $600M in 2019

Revenue Loss decreasing year after year since 2018

2018: -1.5B

2019: -698M

2020: -474M

In November 2018 Softbank's Vision Fund invested over $2B with a $9B valuation which has since been increased to $86B

**Use of Proceeds:**

* Net IPO of Class A common stock was $35.00 and jumped to $69.00 (nice) once it was available to trade. However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.
* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.
* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.

I really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.

📷

* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.

**Opportunity:**

Korea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.

The total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)

Total spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.

**Management:**

Range of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46

* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.
* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?
* \*\*Thuan Pham - (\*\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)

Other members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.

**Qualitative:**

Company Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”

* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.
* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)
* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.
* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.
* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)

**Services:**

* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.
* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.
* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*
* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.
* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)

Part of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*

**Top Risks:**

* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth
* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)
* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.

I have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.

**TDLR:**

In my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.

Thanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?

Thanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE

2021-03-13 21:19:55,stocks,"Fidelity Spire Has anyone used this for trading yet? I just downloaded it and see that everything from my fidelity is there and it seems to have trading now, but I can’t test it being the weekend. Once they have reoccurring investment I will no longer have a reason to need robinhood anymore.  I like being able to buy a little bit of my favorite stocks every day automatically, and besides the ui it’s the only reason I have robinhood now. Fidelity spire looks a whole lot better than the crusty old fidelity app.

Edit: I see that it just says reoccurring deposits not that it will buy for you like robinhood. I hope that one day fidelity will have that. At the moment you can do that already on fidelity, but it’s just deposit once a week or month I think, and then you have to go buy the stock yourself."
2021-03-13 21:03:15,stocks,"I've never seen CNN Business do this for futures before https://www.cnn.com/business/markets/premarkets

TLDR: Everything is listed as NaN. I've always seen it just list the futures around the time of closing on Friday. It might not mean anything, as nothing that out of the ordinary was happening on Friday as far as indexes went. Hope it doesn't mean there's a lot of red coming if they start listing them again on Sunday evening."
2021-03-13 20:58:26,stocks,"Dixie Group Inc. (DXYN) Looking for any DD I am strongly considering buy some shares of DXYN. Dixie Group Inc.  It's basically a furnishings company leaning strongly to floor coverings, and they also are parent company to a few brand names. They had some issues with earnings reports if I understood correctly, and the stock took a major dump. Other than that, it looks like a solid company. Their website is totally professional with investor information. On google maps their facility looks great. But other than that, I have no information other than they have dipped, and the stock is going up. Estimating to possibly 30% gain returning to previous historical performance.  (my uneducated guess).

Can anybody provide input and insight to this ticker?"
2021-03-13 20:21:25,stocks,"$YELP still undervalued 
Survived pandemic shut downs and will have continued strength with reopening. Expanded their business to grow home and local services segments not just restaurants. 
Close to 1 billion estimated revenue for upcoming year, market cap is only about 3 billion. Buying back shares, almost 600 million in cash and no debt. 

Held through past year and doubled down around 20. I think it is still worth double 

Long 1k shares"

Now they are removed from the blacklist and US investors don't have to sell it to november, which means with 100% accuracy, that they will climb back again and continue their rise! I am in with 10k since 1.70€. so get in the boat and make some money."
2021-03-13 20:02:38,stocks,"Tax Advice — capital gains I’ve been trying to make some sense of how to bring down capital gains tax for a stock sale. I’m rebalancing my portfolio, and I have a stock that I’ve held for years and years that’s just too much of my portfolio. However, if I understand correctly, selling it to buy other stocks will trigger capital gains tax. That sucks, but such is life. 
From what I understand, if I also sell stocks at a loss, the losses will subtract my capital gains tax obligation. 
So here’s my theory on strategy, but I’m wondering if this would really work: 
Let’s say I owe $2,000 in capital gains tax for 2021 taxes. I have no losses to sell. I could wait until next tax season and owe $2,000 ... OR... and here’s my idea: 
If I have to pay uncle sam $2,000 anyway, why don’t I try putting $2,000 in to some very high risk stocks. Best that could happen is they make big gains, and I make more money. Worst that could happen is they tank and then I can sell them for a $2,000 loss, which cancels my capital gains tax obligation. 

Will this strategy work? Is it a good idea? Somebody here has probably got some good suggestions. 

Thanks for the ideas."
2021-03-13 19:59:01,stocks,"I have an ITM option expiring the 19th but I have a question! Option Strike is ($9)..The option is for AMC which is currently on a bullish run the option also expires of the 19th (quadruple watching day for AMC)...Let's assume AMC continues its bullish run ($11+)and on Wed its $13 or something like that. Let's say I sold the option on Wed, Thurs or Friday..I know the value of the option decreases as time goes on. If I sold it Wed, Thurs or Friday would someone purchase it from me? Or is it too late? I don't wanna be stuck having the option expire ITM because I'll have to purchase the shares and I don't have the money to do that. Would waiting that long have me run the risk of not being able to sell it or do they sell near instantly like selling and purchasing shares? (Using TD)

Thanks!"
2021-03-13 19:46:39,stocks,"Up volume indicator Martin Zweig was a great proponent of momentum indicators including the up volume indicator. Up volume refers to the amount of volume that is on the upside on a given day, it is a significant sign of positive momentum (i.e., when 90% or more of the volume is on the upside it may mark the launching of a bull market). 

I have been searching all over the internet and have had no success in finding the ratio of daily up volume to down volume of any given stock. Is there any source that provides this info?"
2021-03-13 19:24:42,stocks,Need Stable Short Term Investment Advice I know no investment in the market is “safe” but I had to sell 15k worth of stock before a company blackout that I won’t need until May 1st. Is there somewhere I can park it besides a checking account that would be relatively safe but still provide opportunity for short term growth. Not looking for huge gains but 1-2% even would be nice. I can afford to lose a little bit if things go the wrong direction.
2021-03-13 19:24:02,stocks,"Bank Stocks in 2021 I picked up shares in a couple of regional banks earlier this year, mostly in anticipation of improved business and conditions after the reopening. I've gotten a healthy return from both so far. Does anyone have any predictions on how much more alpha we are going to be able to squeeze out of this sector? Indicators seem to be pointing toward riding the wave. However, trying to understand the banking sector feels like reading tarot cards sometimes."

2021-03-13 19:16:09,stocks,"Need some help finding a publicly traded company... Aluminum-ion batteries Ok, so I may be blowing my own spot on finding the next Tesla/Netflix/Amazon... but, after weeks of searching, I seriously have come up empty.  So I'm turning to you dear Redditors, for help.  I need a company that is primarily involved with producing aluminum-ion batteries.  From what I've read, they're more efficient, smaller, charge faster, and are overall cheaper.  But I can't seem to find a company that produces them.  Obviously, some company that is involved in mining and/or aluminum production like Alcoa may be a suggestion.  But those are so highly diversified, that they will not gain the benefit of explosive growth that a pure play would.  Key example is, I own Pfizer, and it barely budged after having the world's first covid vaccine.  It barely budged because of being highly diversified.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"
2021-03-13 19:09:44,stocks,"Interested in buying stock Hi, for a little perspective I currently max out a Roth IRA and put 10% into my 401k but me & the wife have some extra funds that we would like to start investing into specific stock. I would be new to this type of investing as I currently just invest into index funds. My Roth IRA is with Vanguard so I’m curious if would they be a good option to start dabbling with stocks? Any advice is appreciated!

Edit: I understand there is a chance I could lose it all very quickly! These are excess funds I’m looking to invest!"
