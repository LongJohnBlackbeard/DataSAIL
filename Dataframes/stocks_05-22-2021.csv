2021-05-22 16:34:08,stocks,Debt to Equity?
2021-05-22 17:04:37,stocks,what are your thought on THOR Industries?
2021-05-22 19:50:24,stocks,"I don't know if this info is good or bad, but about 3 weeks ago Cramer recommed it as a re-opening stock."
2021-05-22 17:09:03,stocks,"Looks interesting, but I believe CWH is trading at better value relative to its earnings, as most of THOR's earnings seem to be priced in. I also feel like CWH has a head start in their dividend potential."
2021-05-22 17:20:08,stocks,Think im leaning towards THOR but Dang that market cap is cheap on CWH
2021-05-22 17:22:42,stocks,"THOR seems like a great hold for anyone who got in early, but it's still reasonably valued atm."
2021-05-22 17:24:33,stocks,CHW earnings history is a little choppy so maybe its not so cheap atm
2021-05-22 17:28:04,stocks,"That is another noteworthy con, but I have no reason to suspect they'll slow down. They're still a relatively young stock, and the past few Quarters have been good."
2021-05-22 19:18:10,stocks,"I'd say the premise is wrong.

When one holds their capital in cash or cash equivalents, they are exposed to the risks of currency value swings. The currency *is* the value store, so the holder is exposed to all the risks associated with currencies.

When that cash is used to purchase ETF shares, that currency is no longer the store of value; the ETF shares are. The stored value then fluctuates with the value of the shares, not with the value of the currency with which those shares were purchased."
2021-05-22 16:30:35,stocks,"Countries that survived the pandemic nearly unscathed are likely to have undervalued economies as a result of adapting their economies to a 2 year market cycle that is priced in to 1st world stock exchanges but not necessarily developing ones. 

&#x200B;

EX: Vietnam, Taiwan, Bhutan, Laos etc."
2021-05-22 16:21:23,stocks,"And the video in question: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwTHLtuToSY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwTHLtuToSY)

(Could not add to original post due to board rules)"
2021-05-22 16:27:49,stocks,That'd be the impact of currency on international ETF performance. Wisdom Tree has a line of international ETFs designed to reduce or eliminate that effect. I checked that long time ago. You can take a look at them and their prospectuses.
2021-05-22 15:49:59,stocks,"For ten years? Man complete honesty. No one can say with certainty, this is all best educated guess. But those are usually the ideal choices for what you’re trying to do here."
2021-05-22 18:10:48,stocks,I’m betting tech gets me to retirement early. I put most of my roth contributions towards vanguards VGT
2021-05-22 15:59:43,stocks,"some of the best performing stocks of the past 20 years are not IT/tech stocks. Monster Energy and Tractor Supply have beaten most of the hot tech stocks. 

those are not terrible choices, but IMO they're mostly over-valued and trendy. I'd prefer more of the portfolio in broad funds/indexes covering more of the market rather than being so heavily concentrated. what goes up tends to come down. going forward, boring stocks like insurance or utilities could easily beat the hot stocks of 2020. 

I have some tech funds, but they're a minority of the overall portfolio."
2021-05-22 17:50:11,stocks,Yeah I hope so cause this looks like a lot like my portfolio 😆
2021-05-22 19:15:56,stocks,A number of your holding are very overvalued right now and a number are somewhat undervalued; are you planning to ignore these holdings for 10 years or actively rebalance based on shifting valuations among them?
2021-05-22 17:49:42,stocks,Yes you'll be fine. Tech is going to (continue to) dominate the world.
2021-05-22 16:02:37,stocks,"Your portfolio consists of some very high quality companies. You’ll likely do well in the long run, even if tech goes out of favor from time to time"
2021-05-22 16:04:03,stocks,For the relative near future you’re okay. I have kind of the same portfolio atm. Long term anything can change. Example apple in 90s was a struggling company… apple today is dominating.. the cycle could repeat but no one knows. That’s the same in everything sector.
2021-05-22 15:58:08,stocks,This is the wrong place to ask this question....the Apes in here cant even spell stonk !
2021-05-22 15:57:35,stocks,Can I give you an advice?
2021-05-22 16:06:33,stocks,"Why try to pick which stocks will do best?  Are you going to follow these stocks, vs the ones you don't pick every day intensely?

I'd go with a tech etf like qqq or something else"
2021-05-22 18:01:06,stocks,"Honestly I would be comfortable being 25% apple, 25% Amazon, 25% google, 25% Microsoft but I’m 40% apple, 30% Amazon, 30% google"
2021-05-22 16:14:17,stocks,Thanks.  I like living on the edge I guess. 😆
2021-05-22 16:12:36,stocks,Thanks.  I have HD UNH SHW HON UNP ODFL.  ODFL has returned 30% for many years.  I also have 10% total market.  I may increase it as I trim and stuff.  I don't like much more than 5% in each stock although MSFT and AAPL constitute about 20% right now.
2021-05-22 17:52:03,stocks,"I think we'll be ok.  Hey if those stocks are the same or less 5 years from now the whole market will be hurting so it won't matter!

 I have faith in the Fed!"
2021-05-22 17:53:19,stocks,I hope so.  I can't imagine all those companies going under 5 years from now.
2021-05-22 16:08:54,stocks,Thanks.
2021-05-22 16:09:54,stocks,Yeah as I accumulate I may trim and put more in sp500 or whatever.
2021-05-22 16:13:16,stocks,😆
2021-05-22 16:13:39,stocks,Yeah.
2021-05-22 16:08:23,stocks,I like picking my own.  I think fangs will do well.  That's why.  Thanks.
2021-05-22 16:14:26,stocks,"Well 65% of my portfolio is in an s&p 500 index fund, 25% in a blue chip growth fund, and the rest is invested in tech stocks that I think have potential to beat the s&p (apple, google, Amazon, nvida, and Netflix) and crypto. FYI I also have cash savings which is kind of significant."
2021-05-22 16:26:11,stocks,"It's more of a question and I'm thinking how to say it....

Have you ever considered that maybe, there will be time when all your stocks will be worthless and unavailable because something could happened? Like I don't mean apocalypse, but it's a good idea to be diversified into stocks, cash, bonds, crypto, valuable metals but also to invest some of your money and time into building your skills and buying tools that could be usefully if the system we are living in wouldn't work, so you would be self reliable, I don't want you to be a prepper, build bunkers or buy tanks, but reasonably prepare so if the grid would go down you wouldn't be hopeless (like people in snowstorm in Texas, or oil scarcity, major drought, big economic collapse, supervulcamo eruption, or just breakdown of current system, because it happens a lot of time in our history and it can happend again)"
2021-05-22 16:16:43,stocks,"Thanks.  If I add my savings I have maybe 28% cash.

I only have 10% FSKAX Total Market.  I've noticed that volatility can be in the few thousands for me from month to month, but I'm not at 6 figures yet.  1.5 years invested.  Starting late with money left to me by grandmother.  Wished I had started at 30 at least. Mid 40s.

Maybe eventually I should trim tech to 30 to 40% or so.  But I feel like once I trim MSFT AAPL GOOGL or whatever, they'll go higher! 😆"
2021-05-22 18:32:37,stocks,"...what are you talking about?

1. None of this has anything to do with investing in stocks

2. Even if you are developing survival skills, you don't need to not invest in stocks. You can go learn how to survive in the wild, shoot guns, Hunt, grow food, build shelters, etc. But why wouldn't you invest?"
2021-05-22 16:29:48,stocks,"Nope.  I'm gonna be dead someday.  Maybe a few years from now.  Not sure.  I don't think like that.  We're all in the same boat so if what you're describing were to happen is just deal with it.  If I became homeless or broke so be it!  If I died, well than that's the breaks.  We all die in the end.

The things you're describing don't worry me in the least.  Actually if it happened I'd say oh well about time I guess!"
2021-05-22 16:19:42,stocks,Yeah that’s about what I keep too.
2021-05-22 16:31:00,stocks,"If you are gonna be dead someday, why do you care about your stock portfolio 10 years ahead ?"
2021-05-22 16:25:34,stocks,"Yeah I like NVDA MSFT AAPL.  Even PYPL and SQ.  SQ is beaten down lately, but hanging in.  I'm negative slightly in SQ right now.

I like LRCX and ASML too.  They've done well in my ROTH since I added them months ago.

I stumbled across ODFL.  It's returned 30% yoy I think since 2010 or before.  It's a trucking company.  Then I added Sherwin Williams."
2021-05-22 16:35:24,stocks,"Because I enjoy life and hope for the best.  But I realize all of this is temporary.  If I make lots of money great!  If I die next week great!  It's gonna happen to you and me sooner or later.

If it happens next week I won't know about it cause I'll be dead.

But I still go about living my life and trying to make as much money as I can.  Maybe some day I can get a hot hooked to ride me to death when I'm 80."
2021-05-22 18:20:34,stocks,Lol don’t listen to that guy he sounds crazy
2021-05-22 16:15:54,stocks,"Sounds like your trying to drink from a fire hose, maybe just pick a few that you know best and get to know them inside out. Then you can broaden your scope.

In duck hunting what you are doing is called flock shooting. That guy leaves empty handed every time."
2021-05-22 19:54:43,stocks,Swing/day trading is a lot of work.
2021-05-22 15:34:42,stocks,"I started out as a day trade. Then a swing trader. And now I’m a buy and hold investor. I’ll say this. The more you trade, the more you’ll lose. Just buy good companies and hold and you’ll be more profitable"
2021-05-22 14:57:57,stocks,"I love the idea of VT and while I consider ETF fees as somewhat trivial, it is cheaper fee wise to buy the Vanguard ETFs that make achieve the same as VT: VTI, VEA and VWO. Owning these 3 instead of VT also allows you to tweak the balancing."
2021-05-22 15:06:06,stocks,"VXUS+VTI will get you there, pretty much.

Or just VT."
2021-05-22 14:43:36,stocks,"ACWI but it does not track small caps, and expense ratio is higher. The index is different too, but for a world index it may not matter much."
2021-05-22 15:28:36,stocks,"FSPSX is Fidelity's global ex-China fund

ACWV is a global low-volatility ETF."
2021-05-22 17:57:25,stocks,LCTD
2021-05-22 16:39:21,stocks,Or simply VTI and VXUS.
2021-05-22 15:09:21,stocks,Thank you!
2021-05-22 17:22:52,stocks,"If you hold VEA and VWO in the same ratio as they are represented in VXUS, the fees are lower than VXUS alone."
2021-05-22 18:09:12,stocks,"Sure. But we're talking about picking up pennies in front of the steamroller at that point. There's also a theoretical rebalancing bonus (which means you can break out VEA into Europe + Asia/pac), but the OP was inquiring about global funds, so simplicity is probably key here."
2021-05-22 19:01:10,stocks,"Another key to splitting to VEA and VWO is that it is better to be more heavily weighed to VWO than what VXUS is, as VXUS heavily weighted to developed while emerging is the better long-term bet."

2021-05-22 13:44:10,stocks,"This is why I tend to shy away from investing in Chinese companies. I like to be at ease and at least have a solid feelings that what I invest in will do well...because of the CCP I just don’t get that feeling with Chinese companies. In my opinion, baba is in a tough spot...they can grow as a company ...as long as they grow exactly how the CCP wants them to grow."
2021-05-22 13:12:09,stocks,"Good insights, may I ask you how did you get in contact with Chinese people to know that"
2021-05-22 16:15:48,stocks,"I avoid China as much as possible, because it's a communist dictatorship with extremely high levels of government and business corruption. 

Go watch The China Hustle."
2021-05-22 13:18:02,stocks,BOOOOO ccp
2021-05-22 15:33:57,stocks,I just don't trust the CCP. I would rather invest in crypt if I'm going to take bigger risks.
2021-05-22 16:20:16,stocks,"The biggest problem is not the Covid right now. Both sides need a comercial agreement as soon as possible. If there isn't, both sides will suffer the consequences. USA is fearing with the inflation (people have realized the inflation is real) and China can't survive without USA and EU (although they think they can ingenuitly)"
2021-05-22 16:59:25,stocks,"I think a lot of Western investors are used to thinking about companies in a certain way that don't translate to BABA's situation very well. They expect a free market where companies rise and fall based (mostly) on their merits. In that world BABA is severely undervalued and will inevitably go back up to ATHs. However in China the government is above all and anything that might threaten that control is targeted and eliminated with brutal efficiency. BABA was the nail that stuck out and got hammered down.

The government will never allow BABA to amass as much power in China as a company like Amazon has in the West. So where does that leave their future? I don't think anyone knows. But this could very well hang over their heads forever. They should recover somewhat but could very well stagnate for years with their growth potential severely limited. In the worst case they go too hard again and the CCP really screws with them. Basically a no-win situation."
2021-05-22 14:11:22,stocks,"Chinese economy could be the future but they F'd up .
Watch China Hustle for an introduction. 

But the reality is much darker .Uyghurs in concentration type camps + surveillance state to the max + no human rights to talk of. Hong Kong invasion and probably Taiwan next."

This was a joke/ friendly troll, why am I getting down voted…"
2021-05-22 16:11:41,stocks,"yep, same reason I don't invest in Facebook. Too much uncertainty around the way Congress will regulate them. 


Although I'm more bullish on some smaller chinese stocks as they won't be hit by anti-monopoly regulations."
2021-05-22 13:39:43,stocks,I use a language learning app and talk to many each day that way
2021-05-22 16:24:39,stocks,"I totally agree, and think Biden is in a tough position politically.  Republicans attacked him as being easy on China; His base want China to address Uygher issue and Pelosi wants boycott of Olympics.  I think he will stay far away from China for a while...but would think a new agreement would benefit both"
2021-05-22 15:15:19,stocks,"Definitely not a surveillance state to the level you talk about. I have friends and relatives in China and we regularly talk over WeChat, talked shit on the CCP as well. Openly talking shit about CCP in tv/news will get you fucked up, but talking shit privately is ok. You seriously think they have the ability to monitor every call/text sent?"
2021-05-22 14:18:14,stocks,"It's like any organization.  You can control it and make it super efficient but it will have limits due to the control.  

As for the other two issues...it's a bit more complex.

Uyghers were bombing and attacking chinese some years ago.  They wanted independence.  In a sense, like Tibet, it started a type of civil war.  CCP fought back in their way.

Taiwan will never be invaded, and if there is anything from the HK disaster it's that it's made Taiwanese come closer together against CCP."

2021-05-22 16:25:25,stocks,"> prison system

the difference is that anyone working in the US prison labor has been through due process system and has some legal protections, while China is a one-party communist dictatorship that slaughters people wholesale. 

there's absolutely no comparison."
2021-05-22 16:05:02,stocks,Bro I was joking. My reply to another comment below should make that obvious
2021-05-22 16:12:44,stocks,you're delusional
2021-05-22 16:17:16,stocks,Because when ever the word China is said someone has to spout off some conspiracy theory. I don't understand why China cannot be discussed like any other country.

2021-05-22 00:00:00,stocks,"$SPCE Virgin Galactic Test Flight 5/22/2021 is currently successfully proceeding as planned! FINAL EDIT: VMS Eve has landed safely. Thanks to our pilots Kelly Latimer and Michael Masucci for flying the mothership today and their vital role in helping VSS Unity complete today’s spaceflight!

Twitter link for direct updates from Virgin Galactic team -> [https://twitter.com/virgingalactic](https://twitter.com/virgingalactic);

\-  Take off! VMS Eve and VSS Unity have taken to the skies above Spaceport America, New Mexico.

\- VMS Eve is taking VSS Unity to a release altitude of 44,000ft. The climb to release will take approximately 60 minutes.

\-  VMS Eve and VSS Unity are now at 30,000 ft, nearly half-way to release altitude.

\-  Approximately 10 minutes from release, VSS Unity switches to its own battery power for avionics and control systems, and performs electrical, feather system and flight control checks.

\-  VSS Unity is in its launch configuration and pilots are readying the rocket motor system. Awaiting clearance for release from Mission Control.

\-  Release, release, release! VSS Unity has successfully separated from VMS Eve.

\-  VSS Unity’s rocket motor has been ignited by our pilots CJ Sturckow and Dave Mackay.

\-  Rocket motor shutdown. Momentum will keep VSS Unity travelling upwards towards apogee.

\-  VSS Unity enters coast phase. Tail-booms raised into “feathered” re-entry position.

\-  VSS Unity, our two pilots and [NASA\_Technology](https://twitter.com/NASA_Technology) supported experiments are now in space.

\-  VSS Unity reaches apogee.

\-  VSS Unity is descending back to Earth.

\-  The feather has been lowered and VSS Unity is now gliding smoothly back to the runway at Spaceport America.

A successful test flight + landing!

EDIT: - Touch down, VSS Unity.

EDIT2: Their smoke trail looks the same as their stock will do in the next week (had to insert this joke, sorry).

EDIT3: For people who were panicking on twitter due to motor shutdown - it's per procedures, it's what the motor HAS and HAD to do, everything is perfect.

Congrats to fellow bagholders, this was a fun one to watch!"

2021-05-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Want to invest in biotech? A quick guide. Short answer: don't. I work in the industry and learned early on not to touch it with a ten-foot pole. If you want to invest in the pharma/biopharma/biotech industry, investing in small-cap biotech stocks - MBIO, VKTX, ATOS, etc. for examples is basically gambling. Here are the alternatives I suggest.

Supply chain. TMO and AVTR are the two biggest suppliers of consumables in the life sciences industry and essentially hold a duopoly. Both are basically trying to position themselves as the amazon of the industry. TMO is more diversified offering various services and high-powered equipment and is on the cutting-edge of R&D in a lot of equipment fields (MS and cryo-EM). AVTR owns VWR which is basically like an Amazon/costco hybrid for companies and academia. I highly recommend choosing one or both.

Equipment. TMO/AVTR kind of fall into this category but I wanted to make a different section because they pretty much own the entire consumables market. Instrumentation has a lot more competition. While something like TMO has its hands dipped into everything, almost nobody would choose a TMO HPLC over Agilent (A) or Waters (WAT). PCR? Bio-Rad (BIO). Centrifuges? Beckman Coulter (DHR). A lot of companies have carved out niches for themselves whereas something like TMO is a generalist. You also have companies like DHR that hold brands like Beckman Coulter that have a lot of brand loyalty.

Services. CROs like IQVIA, PPD, manufacturing services, instrumentation (calibration, maintenance) services etc. One of the most expensive things about the industry is the regulatory hurdles, especially clinical trials. CROs help companies save money on clinical trials by outsourcing them to companies already equipped to handle different parts of them. Equipment has to have records of being ""up to spec"" for audit purposes and a lot of companies do this stuff in-house or let the vendors send service techs out. You also have companies like TMO with their unity service that do this stuff. They also recently bought out Patheon and PPD so they're expanding the services side of their company a lot.

Tech. This sort of falls under equipment and services so I won't spend too long on it, but companies like Illumina have revolutionized things in their fields (DNA sequencing for Illumina).

In terms of innovation in tech/equipment, chromatography, mass spec, sequencing, cryo-EM and Big Data are the future.

Big pharma/biopharma/biotech. You can still benefit from the excitement of a positive clinical trial result without the volatility. The issue with small-cap biotech is that you'll bleed out 70% over the course of a few months, and by the time you get that 25% bump from a positive trial result you're still extremely deep in the red. These companies completely hinge on a very small amount of drugs which is why they're such a gamble. Companies like PFE, ABBV have blockbuster drugs under their belt that keep them relatively stable and allow them to pay dividends. The 25% bump from a positive result you'd see from biotech is buffered to be more like 5-10%, but at least you know you won't (probably) lose 90% of your investment.

Last but not least... ETFs. Pharma, biotech and medical devices ETFs all hold a lot of these aforementioned categories/companies.

Disclaimer: I own TMO, A, AVTR and BIO."

TAK, BEAM, TMO, AZN, CRSP, PFE, VRTX... 

All doing revolutionary biotech work. All up between 100 and 600+% over the past five years. Yes, they dip, because progress and news of new products are staggered and sporadic. 

I'm long on most of the above. Not all biopharm stocks are the same, and shouldn't be bunched together in one generic post like this. Some provide everyday biopharm products/services (VWR, TMO), others are making leaps and bounds in scientific progress that are essential to our future in health, but come with a little unpredictability as to when the next price leap is going to come. 

Think of the changes to regulations around stem cells, the new existence of mRNA vaccines, psychodelics to treat mental illness... 

It's not if, but when.

Biopharma and Biotech are not going away anytime soon. They are all growing, expanding their product lines, and producing new health tech/drugs/therapeutics continuously. You don't see what's happening behind closed doors unless you're on the inside, but the earnings from each of these have had positive outputs for a while.

After 2020, I can't think of a better industry to be long on besides medical research and healthcare."

After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I loaded up shares at $212 after these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

&#x200B;

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that cause no harm to the environment, something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yes (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, just 10% off it's 52 week low.

&#x200B;

Now what REALLY caused me to go all in was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO.  For Munger to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

&#x200B;

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."" $BABA fear has been baked in, and now I plan to back up the truck."

They will be ok for some time till the government sorts our things, but the competitors will start getting more favors and the licenses for the company will be slowly reduced or outright denied.   What happened with Ant financial should be a warning to anyone who wants to look at BABA as a longer-term investment."
2021-05-22 09:55:30,stocks,Now if only you could actually invest in the company instead of some unrelated holding company based in the Cayman islands.

2021-05-22 13:17:17,stocks,Genuine question here: Do we think the CCP will allow a company to become “too large” or out compete state run firms? I think the company is A+ but may become a victim of its own success. Thoughts?

2021-05-22 11:05:10,stocks,"I like BABA. I bought it at its IPO, sold it in Jan for 264. I’ll probably get back in to it, just haven’t determined my re-entry price yet."

2021-05-22 16:55:02,stocks,"I totally agree with your ”bullish” points. However I believe Amazon currently deserves a much higher P/E because of how their profit will increase in the years to come. They are still investing extremely much, a small amount of revenue is currently profit. Amazons P/E could therefore decrease substancially because of profit explosion during the years to come. Alibaba is already extremely profitable, hard to increase the percent of revenue that goes to profit. But Alibaba is at a forward P/E around 20 I think, so they don’t need to be more profitable to be a extremely good stock. They are growing extremely much so if they just maintain there profit margin, their P/E is what it should be years ahead, so if they grow revenues like 25% per year their stock should grow similar IMO."
2021-05-22 11:47:30,stocks,Black sheep!
2021-05-22 11:32:15,stocks,BABA is a party-controlled enterprise and no amount of public data can overcome the fact that fiat determines its fate.
2021-05-22 14:37:54,stocks,"The discount is not deep enough for me yet to start investing. The CCP and Jack Ma have stated that companies exist to serve the country, the party, and its people. Where does that leave its shareholders? Along the same theme, BABA has not been spending, acquiring companies wisely probably because it is more interested in growing China's GDP via inefficient market activity (digging holes and than filling them) rather making the most financially sound decision for its shareholder. At this discount, any Western companies interested in serving its shareholders would have announced a massive bb program already. The fact that BABA has not tell me that it and the CCP view the company as an extension of the State apparatus, private in name only and can be repurposed if and when the party wants anytime. This is something that westerners have a difficult time comprehending: companies in Asian societies exist to serve the countries and its people. Private property is respected only to the extent that it immediately benefit society. When push comes to shove, respect for private property goes out the window.

Hence, my personal catalyst is when BABA announce how it plan to reward its shareholders in the form of bb or dividend. That's when I know the company and CCP is serious about a long term vision of capitalism and not as an opportunistic tool. At that point the stock might already have become fairly valued, but I would okay knowing that I did not take the unnecessary risk."
2021-05-22 17:02:10,stocks,"According to Yahoo Finance, BABA's future 5 years EPS growth is 3.69%, which is fairly low..

2021-05-22 14:06:37,stocks,CCP intervention risk. No thanks.
2021-05-22 10:55:48,stocks,"You also have to understand that Munger and the rest of these bigwigs were aware of the revenue drop in BABA due to the Chinese government. You also mentioned the fact that Munger holds BAC and WFC… two financial institutions with an unscrupulous reputation for ripping people off. 

That being said, BABA is like it’s own country at this point and can continue to expand if allowed to prosper. Be wary of what billionaires like to do because they are not doing everything in good faith or out of good intentions when it comes to money"

I believe that the CCP is more than willing to let Alibaba suffer because of its connection to Jack Ma and him falling out of favor."

2021-05-22 14:51:22,stocks,There are no state run e-commerce and cloud computing firms in China. There *are* huge state-owned banks tho. So there are limits on what Alibaba can do in the fintech space.

They also squashed the Ant IPO (pun intended) so I think they've made their point. It's been like 6 months, so the tensions have cooled, so at these rock bottom prices, I'm more than willing to take that bit of risk."

So it's not really the same - there's a lot more risk involved if you're a foreign investor."

2021-05-22 10:26:50,stocks,"You're absolutely correct. However, from a personnal point, as a very very small shareholder of the total market cap of BABA, I don't really mind that much having no voting rights (and as long as the CCP is in power, I don't expect foreign investors to be able to take managerial decisions for a while). 

As for BABA going belly up, it is of course an additional risk, but we're talking about Alibaba here. I doubt very much that BABA would go bankrupt, especially with their market strength/position. 

Finally, the political risk. This one has been around literally since BABA first listed on NYSE. While this one definitely is the biggest risk as a foreign investor, I'm confident that a 500B market cap company **won't** get delisted from an American Exchange as it brings in way too many liquidity. They'll always come to an agreement. And for the anti-monopolistic violations, it's already in the past. Although it might occur again, I seriously doubt it would affect BABA in any significant way. 

At these extremely low prices, I'm very willing to bear those risks, especially since they are in part superficial and exaggerated."
2021-05-22 10:54:34,stocks,"Agree, but at the same time Munger, who's like the most risk-adverse human on the planet, just made it his 3rd largest holding. THAT was the tipping point for me."
2021-05-22 17:44:03,stocks,"Let me get this straight... you’re worried about recouping a sliver of your investment if baba goes belly up? How much do you think shareholders of Enron got back when it went belly up? This is a ridiculous reason. Whether its a us or Chinese company, if the company goes belly up, your investment is fucked. Not buying a stock bc you get 0% back vs 1% back is pretty funny to me"
2021-05-22 17:54:46,stocks,">no voting rights

Using the GOOG/GOOGL ratio we can say investors are willing to pay a 2% premium for voting rights of internet companies. That's going to be well within the error margin of most DCF models for BABA so I really don't think that's such a big concern.

The other aspects of course do add considerable risk, which I guess is partially why this stock is so cheap."

You’re not guaranteed anything in any company you own that goes belly up. In most bankruptcies stock holders get nothing. 

The China crackdown is a concern but it is not true China doesn’t want foreign investors. They’re happy to take foreign money. It’s more of a risk that the US delists them or China breaks them up."
2021-05-22 17:32:00,stocks,Was that a stroke?
2021-05-22 12:35:29,stocks,"Hmmm...  Could it be that hedge funds with large amounts of cash have more to lose from inflation than retail investors so they are looking for slowly declining stocks in a bear market.

Im not saying that is what it is, but it sure feels like a bull market to me."
2021-05-22 10:43:49,stocks,"Is it the word 'support' that triggered you? Is it because you can't find that yourself? You know it's extremely simple to find the support of a stock, right? Is that precisely why it's putting you off?"
2021-05-22 10:34:38,stocks,"Yeah I also think those levels would be good buys. I initially set up an order at 205 after the crash last week, but modified it at 210 after the dip yesterday"
2021-05-22 10:54:35,stocks,RemindMe! 2 weeks
2021-05-22 11:10:10,stocks,"Because China hurrdurr

Remember that reddit is mostly comprised of Americans. Im not saying all Americans are dumb or anything but; there is a huge amount of fear mongering in the US. 
A lot of people just hear mainstream media talk about potential outcomes of US-China conflicts and truly believe in those outcomes.
Whereas big money is seeing through it because they know the actual details of the inner conflicts. I choose to believe people like Charlie Munger, i actually bought 3 shares (im poor) of BABA a couple weeks before the news came of that Charlie Munger bought and now i have never felt more confident about an investment. 

We will see in time."
2021-05-22 10:35:50,stocks,"Precisely. Those trying to time the market will always be on the loser side. (Or at least a lot more often, luck can always get you out)"
2021-05-22 10:32:53,stocks,"Of course; but you can't predict that. And if when you bought the company, it made sense fundamentally speaking, then it should also make sense to buy at 195."
2021-05-22 12:19:19,stocks,i’d also rather be psychic! who else?
2021-05-22 12:02:58,stocks,It is hard to believe due to the fundamentals of the company but the gosh darn CCP and government are meanies :(
2021-05-22 14:42:37,stocks,170 at current ttm EPS would put the PE right around 20.  Some folks might call that a return to a reasonable multiple.
2021-05-22 12:55:18,stocks,"Well like with any investment, there's risk. And I'm rolling with Munger on this one."
2021-05-22 11:10:37,stocks,"Well I generally look for growth stocks so going stock for stock with Buffett and Munger, two of the most risk adverse investors in history, never interested me. However, I had $BABA on my watchlist (as a growth stock) and couldn't pass up the fact that Munger viewed it as extremely undervalued."
2021-05-22 11:07:55,stocks,"Well I can't argue that there are companies that are shady AF, but at the same time, Munger has mad a fortune off of WFC and BAC. When it comes to money, I make sure to pay attention to what billionaires do."
2021-05-22 10:53:23,stocks,"China would never recover from the damage to its reputation. No one will touch a Chinese stock ever again, which would cost their companies hundreds of billions in investment capital. Not something you can easily replace."
2021-05-22 10:37:03,stocks,"Yup.

China's Holdings of U.S. Securities

 As of June 2019 (the most recent period for which complete data are available), China's investment in U.S. securities totaled $1.5 trillion, down $63.4 billion (4%) from June 2018 levels, making China the fifth-largest foreign holder (Figure 1).Jan 15, 2021"
2021-05-22 10:35:31,stocks,"And it's that sentiment that has caused me to invest. Like most feelings, this too shall pass."

2021-05-22 12:17:47,stocks,the amount of fear mongering that happens about china is literally insane. but totally expected as a rival imperialist power to the west. why would it be any other way? like i expect the US to have anything good to say about their soon to be #1 enemy? lol
2021-05-22 11:07:09,stocks,He downvoted you for that lmao. You’re 100% right.
2021-05-22 12:08:10,stocks,But you’d still rather have shares at 215 instead of 233 if you waited until it reversed its downward trend from 195. Right now BABA is a falling knife.
2021-05-22 13:26:38,stocks,Username checks out
2021-05-22 13:51:18,stocks,"He made that play over a month ago, and not a large one.

It's safe. The party isn't going to tank BABA unless Jack Ma steps out of line again.

But they will also manipulate the fuck out of it for their own purposes. No gain in it can be expected or trusted.

You're gambling on what their personal goals for it will be."
2021-05-22 11:18:00,stocks,"Personally, i think BABA has been undervalued since it’s inception. I remember my mom telling me about it as a kid. She was so passionate about Ma’s story. Still makes me emotional because she was just as passionate about his business as she was about his character. I think they have a good future ahead of them but there are uncertainties when it comes to the CCP and the government"
2021-05-22 11:13:14,stocks,"I’m in the same boat actually. I look for undervalued growth and production based stocks with high market caps and good balance sheets. These are like hidden gems of stocks. Gold and silver miners are oh so fabulous right now, in fact most commodities will catch a bid soon as inflation accelerates."
2021-05-22 17:12:54,stocks,The dude only invests in 5 stocks....pretty elite club to be in.
2021-05-22 16:14:57,stocks,There is no more proof of trust in a stock than to put it in your own personal portfolio. Plus Munger is hands off BRK now.
2021-05-22 14:17:29,stocks,The fact the FUD is so high people think Ma is dead makes me more bullish even tho I have no stake in BABA.
2021-05-22 12:22:10,stocks,"Well, since the US are part of the reason China has prospered- it makes no sense for them now to hate them. If the US wasn’t so paranoid and reactionary, they would have made China their closest ally and work with them back in the day. Instead they took advantage of all the manufacturing and industry of the Chinese while turning a blind eye to everything else they were doing. 
Now they act all shocked pikachu face when China is establishing itself in the world. 

I dunno this all is so silly. Why can’t we humans just work together to grow as a civilization. It’s so cringe & dumb, literally only holds us back to hate and spread war."
2021-05-22 17:50:54,stocks,They literally arrested and possibly imprisoned or killed their #1 businessman for implying China should look to the west in terms of business practices so they can catch up.  Can you imagine the US doing that with Bezos?
2021-05-22 12:25:32,stocks,"And if it went to 300 you'd be pissed off you thought you could get a better deal from the 233 point even though when you made your analysis 233 was an undervalued price. Of course I'm talking hypothetically here, not about the company square, I have no idea if 233 was an undervalued starting point or an overvalued one"
2021-05-22 14:30:51,stocks,"Not a large one? It's now his 3rd largest holding. But yes, there's no doubt China wants the Yen to become the world currency, and with Alibaba being the dominant player in their economy, I'm willing to bet Alibaba continues it's expansion into other Asian nations with the help of the CCP, and I plan to at LEAST profit from it."
2021-05-22 11:19:49,stocks,Imagine what Ma could've accomplished had he run a company in the U.S.
2021-05-22 14:35:39,stocks,Makes sense but I think the political situation in China is still a clear and present risk given they’re outcompeting state run firms. Where do they go from here? What’s the probability that the CCP reverses course and allows the expansion needed to grow revenues and profits?
2021-05-22 13:25:59,stocks,"China isn’t simply “establishing itself in the world” it’s:

Committing outright atrocities towards its own people (Uyghurs).

Constantly threatening attack of its neighbours (Taiwan, India).

Threatening economic consequences against countries who don’t bow down to it (Australia, Canada - On Twitter a Chinese diplomat referred to the Prime Minister of Canada as “Boy” and called Canada a “running dog”.)

Claiming almost the entirety of the South China Sea which is international waters as party of Chinese territorial waters.

Locking desperate developing nations in to economic servitude with predatory lending via the belt and road initiative (much of Africa, Bangladesh).

Outright hostage taking of foreign nationals (Canadians Michael Spavor and Michae Korvig of Canada, held since 2018 without council in windowless rooms with the lights on 24 hours a day).

And that’s just a fraction of what China is up to on the world stage right now. It goes far beyond “establishing itself”, it is outright antagonistic and hostile, and unchecked it will only get worse from here.

This isn’t a China vs. US thing, this is China vs. the World."
2021-05-22 13:02:29,stocks,"because people stand to make *a lot* of money by keeping the world parceled as such. the west literally perceived itself as “owning” china before the chinese had their revolution and kicked out the western colonial ties. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_China that’s how distorted the western sense of global possessiveness is from the history of rampant colonialism (that continues to this day)

i would say china is the reason china has prospered. had the relationship between the pre revolution government maintained into modern day w/o the communist revolution, china would likely still be a underdeveloped country, as western colonial powers have a long history of establishing *deliberately unequal exchange* with underdeveloped countries, to *keep* them underdeveloped relative to the empire at large, and thus dependent & subservient"
2021-05-22 18:32:05,stocks,"We can only dream, man."
2021-05-22 11:22:45,stocks," Because unlike Amazon, that was founded by Bezos via a lot of angel investment and insiders who liked the idea, MA actually started from the very bottom. He has my respect."
2021-05-22 11:21:22,stocks,"Honestly man, in the future if he has a chance to move his company he should take it. He would of outdid Amazon 100000000000000000000 times over and manage to retain a large customer base."
2021-05-22 15:23:45,stocks,"Makes sense but I think the political situation in China is still a clear and present opportunity given their state has political and economic ties to the prosperity of their large firms which contributed to their emancipation. Where do they go from here? What’s the probability that the CCP reverses course and stops the expansion of their companies' revenues, profits and taxes, meanwhile even bringing an ocean of money from the globe, I'd guess US mainly, straight into the corporate China? 

Stock markets are based on trust. Corporate China (and hence political authorities too) benefits from their involvement in domestic and international stock markets. If China kills Alibaba for whatever reason you think (I wonder how they are bigger then the state, when their state stopped a spin-off, for instance), they'll make themselves uninvestable, and I don't see why they would go for such a thing. To me the risk with Chinese stocks is more on the reliability of their accounting and auditing, to some extent that political involvement can lead to sub-optimal decisions for the shareholder (cue Ant)."
2021-05-22 17:51:55,stocks,He called Canada’s PM what he is?
2021-05-22 13:18:56,stocks,"I realize my comment undermined Chinas achievements a bit with the “the US is the reason” so i fixed it. 
You are right and i agree with your comment, it’s so sad how the world really works. 
They don’t tell ya this kind of shit in school and i think it’s part of the reason why we have so many ignorant people in the US. A lot of people will blindly hate other humans without being able to provide 3 reason for the hatred they feel. 

I wish the world was more united and strived to make our civilization evolve. 
Imagine if there was no countries and humans just worked together. 
We’d probably be in other parts of the universe… have cities under water for potential survival of meteor, etc."

2021-05-22 10:17:32,stocks,No
2021-05-22 09:41:45,stocks,Nope. In my opinion there was nothing special about ark. Look at the market in 2019-2020 everything went up you could pick pretty much almost any investment blindfold and it went up.
2021-05-22 09:45:38,stocks,hahhahha haha loading up on coinbase is not a wise decision at all.....

2021-05-22 10:36:59,stocks,"I'd love to be Ms. Contrarian but based off what I've observed and at least my opinion about the market, they probably peaked for a few years back in mid-February.

The ARK flagship has usually been a pretty good fund year by year but they don't always have to crush it, these are some of the performances YTD (might be slightly off as I'm just using Google):

2015: -0.68%

2016: -2%

2017: +85%

2018: -0.84% (although in fairness, QQQ entered bear market territory that year and the other 2 of the big 3 flirted with it)

And we all know what happened in 2019-2020.

To me, the sample size is enough to show that she performs the best in a deflationary environment. And while I'm hopeful that most of the reason for the bad April inflation print is because that was peak COVID panic, I do NOT buy what she is selling on deflation being the biggest thing you're going to see.

Hate on me if you please, but this is an opinion and we all have opinions."

2021-05-22 10:09:34,stocks,Honestly I think she is worried about keeping the doors open not hitting all time highs in the next 12 months.

If you are an investor and not a trader; the goal for high growth is to buy 10 stocks that could go through the roof and hope just 1 does.  This is what ARK does well; which means ARK is highly unpredictable year to year, but will outperform long term as I believe Cathy is better than most in the hunt to find the future 10+ baggers of the next 5 years."

""You could pick pretty much almost any investment blindfold"" or even with study and DD and it'd still go down."
2021-05-22 14:40:50,stocks,"Worth noting many of her funds have existed 2014+ and have 4x the S&P500 over this span. None of her holdings exceeded 10% either in any fund, although she did recently remove that cap. 

This isn't to say the growth rate will continue though. It is to say however that if you match your holding period to 5 years as ARK does and you invested mid 2020 you're in the 2nd inning of a 9 inning game. Even if you bought at the peak earlier this year you'd be ~10% through that 5 year period. Are you down? Obviously, but you still have 7-8 innings to go before you actually know if you've won. 

I have 7.5% invested in ARK funds since late last year. Yes I'm in the red, but I also allocated less than 10% because I knew it was a 5+ year hold. Anyone complaining or having buyers remorse should look in the mirror and ask themselves why they bought in the first place."
2021-05-22 17:16:32,stocks,Long term disruptive trends. She saw ev starting in 2014 and invested accordingly.
2021-05-22 10:42:57,stocks,Well thought out. Makes sense.

2021-05-22 14:14:47,stocks,"Perhaps those stocks will be decent investments in 5-10 years. But right now, there are much better ways to utilize my capital imo.

but what's her batting average on *other* stocks? if less than 50% of her predictions come true, you'd be just as successful flipping a coin. 

I've been reading about investing for years, and have never seen anyone else make *specific* predictions like Cathie Wood does. it verges on hubris to say her funds will earn over 20% per year going forward. 

in contrast look at Will Danoff at Fidelity, for one example. he has regularly beat the market averages but *never* makes calls like Cathie does. he'll say ""I think Company X is poised for growth"" or ""Sector Y has been overlooked"" but in 30 can't find that years has never said ""I'll earn 21% next year."""

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 24th, 2021.

# **Stocks could be volatile in week ahead amid turbulence from cryptocurrency - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/21/stocks-could-be-volatile-in-week-ahead-amid-turbulence-from-cryptocurrency.html)**
*****
> The trading pattern of the past two weeks – particularly alongside cryptocurrency’s movements – suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead.
*****
> Investors are watching the wild swings in b/itcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 were lower in the past week, but Nasdaq was slightly higher, helped by a positive move in tech, as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like FANG members Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix.
*****
> A steep plunge in b/itcoin after China announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week. The U.S. also called for stricter compliance with the IRS. Further, on Friday, China said it would crack down on b/itcoin mining and trading.
*****
> “What’s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where b/itcoin goes,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer with Bleakley Advisory Group. B/itcoin plunged by as much as 30% on Wednesday, to about $30,000. Though it recovered to above $42,000, it slid again on Friday.
*****
> The cryptocurrency was down about 9% late Friday, hovering around $36,000, according to Coin Metrics.
*****
> “B/itcoin is a poster child for risk appetite,” said Boockvar. “It tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground, if we’re getting dragged along by b/itcoin.”
*****
> There is some key data in the week ahead. Consumer confidence, home price data and new home sales are out on Tuesday. Durable goods will be released Thursday, and the consumer sentiment report is issued Friday.
*****
> But the most important data will be the personal income and spending data, which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.
*****
> “The key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers. The inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance,” said Boockvar. “What will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers, is where the inflation expectations go.”
*****
> The consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week, showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3% in April. The core PCE price index was up 1.8% year over year in March.
*****
> In the week ahead, earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers, like Best Buy, Costco and Nordstrom. NVIDIA and Dell also report.
*****
> # No correction yet
> As the market has chopped around this month, dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains.
*****
> Some strategists do not see a correction just yet, though pullbacks could continue.
*****
> “For me, my framework is we can only get a 10% correction when we have a liquidity set back, when we have a policy tightening,” said Barry Knapp, managing partner of Ironsides Macroeconomics. “In any of the little disturbances, we are getting about a 4% to 6% pullback.
*****
> Knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies. “You should be in the cyclical parts of tech,” he said. Knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound.
*****
> Tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week, gaining 0.1%, but semiconductors popped nearly 3%. Software was up 0.2%.

> The Nasdaq was 0.3% higher on the week to 13,470, while the Dow was off a half percent at 34,207. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% to 4,155.
*****
> The best performing sector was real estate investment trusts, up 0.9%, followed by health care, up 0.7%. Biotech was higher on the week with the IBB iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF, up 1.1%.

> “It wouldn’t shock me if we went straight back to new highs,” Knapp said. “Part of the reason I thought we would trade in a range, was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging.”
*****
> He said earnings for the S&P 500 are now expected to be up 7% more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began.
*****
> Knapp expects the Fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its Jackson Hole meeting in late summer, and that is the likely trigger for a correction. Back to World War II, he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the Fed normalizing policy.
*****
> “Last cycle, we had eight of those,” he said. “Every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events.”
*****
> Knapp said it’s natural for investors to be focused on the Fed now. “It’s an uncertainty shock,” he said. “It will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it. The Fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic.”
*****
> Knapp said Treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in Washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending. But he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks, since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and Democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit.
*****
> The b/itcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from Washington, and the infrastructure spending could be positive. “The thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then the spending blowout,” he said, noting b/itcoin gained on the potential for inflation and big deficit spending.

> # Economic Surprise Index Tips Negative For The First Time In A Year

> While the overall trend of economic data has been for further improvement, things have slowed recently relative to expectations. In the charts below, we show the charts of the Citi Economic Surprise indices for the US, Emerging Markets, the Eurozone, and the entire world. Broadly speaking, positive readings indicate that economic data is coming in better than forecasts while negative readings indicate the opposite. Every region of the globe has pulled back over the past couple of months but for the most part, current readings remain at the high end of their historical ranges. In fact, the indices for Emerging Markets, Eurozone, and the whole globe all sit in the top 3% of all readings in their histories. The one place that is not the case is the US. Since last summer, the surprise index has been trending lower off of record levels, and just yesterday, it hit it tipped negative for the first time since June 2nd of last year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/CESI.png))**

> Lasting 248 trading days, this was the longest streak of consecutive positive readings in the index's history dating back to 2003. The only other streak that lasted nearly as long was a 189 day long one which came to an end in June 2018.

> # Post-Election-Year June: Third Worst S&P 500 Month

> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 50 years as a rule ranking sixth with a 0.9% average gain, up 28 of 50 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking ninth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

> In post-election years since 1953, June still ranks poorly and its average loss for DJIA increases to –1.1% while S&P 500′s modestly positive performance becomes a 0.6% loss. DJIA struggles the most, advancing in just four post-election year Junes (1977, 1985, 1997 and 2017). Russell 2000 fares best, up seven times in ten years with an average gain of 1.2%. NASDAQ lands in the middle, advancing 50% of the time with an average gain of 0.4%

> # May Manufacturing Starting Off Strong

> The first manufacturing data for May came out this morning with the release of the New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey. General business conditions remain at historically strong levels although there was some slowing in May as was expected. After hitting the highest level since October 2017 last month, it was expected to fall to 23.9 in May. The index did in fact decline, but only to 24.3. While lower, that is still around some of the strongest levels (excluding last month) in three years as more businesses continue to report improvements in business conditions than weakness.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-1.png))**

> Breadth in this month's report was pretty mixed; namely with regards to current conditions versus expectations. Every index is still showing an expansionary reading with particular strength out of the indices for the present situation. In fact, most of those indices still sit in the top decile of their historical range with a few like those for unfilled orders, delivery times, and prices even at or just off of record highs. But there were a handful that moved lower: delivery times, inventories, and number of employees.

> Regarding expectations, it was much harder to find an increase. Delivery times and technology spending were the only two of these indices to rise month over month. While many indices for expectations still sit at historically strong levels, there are more that are middling within their respective historical ranges. Overall, the report showed that New York area firms have seen a peak in optimism even as they continue to report strong conditions.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-Table.png))**

> Demand certainly appears to be one area without much in the way of weakness. New orders rose 2 points month over month to 28.9. That is the highest level in just over 15 years and the only other readings as high occurred throughout late 2003 to mid-2004. Those orders are making their way out the door at an increased rate too as shipments climbed to 29.7. That index has been making a vertical climb since the winter as it reached its highest level since August 2007.

> Despite this, NY area firms are not fulfilling orders fast enough. Last month saw the Unfilled Orders index rise by one of the largest amounts in a single month on record, and it continued to climb albeit by a much smaller 0.2 points in May. The only month on record with a higher reading in unfilled orders was September 2001. Inventories were one of the few current condition indices to fall in May, although the reading still indicated growth. In other words, those unfilled orders are not necessarily drawing down on inventory levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-2.png))**

> Supply chains are one of the main areas that are likely holding things back. Higher readings in the delivery times index mean that businesses are reporting that it takes longer for products to reach their destination. Even after falling 4.5 points in May off of the April record, the current level sits well above the prior record high of 16.2 from March 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-3.png))**

> In addition to taking longer for products to get to where they are going, the price point is on the rise. Both indices for prices paid and received rose to record highs in May. In fact, over the past two months, there has not been a single respondent to have reported a decrease in prices paid. That is the first time that has occurred since February and March 2012.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-Empire-4.png))**

> Last week saw a blockbuster job openings report and the Empire Fed survey is showing a similar willingness to take on more workers. The current conditions index for the number of employees continues to show that businesses are on net increasing their workforce, though at a slowed pace from April. Additionally, the index is at a much less elevated part of its range (the 81st percentile) relative to other indices within the report, but the much more elevated reading in expectations (98th percentile) would indicate the businesses would like to take on far more workers. That is, there appears to be a bit of a disconnect between the actual number of new hires and businesses' expectations to take on more workers. Potentially as a result of an inability to hire enough workers, the average workweek has continued to climb. At 18.7, the index is at its highest level in a decade.

> # Homebuilder Sentiment Holds Steady

> Our new Constitution is now established, everything seems to promise it will be durable; but, in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes,” Benjamin Franklin

> The national average on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage currently sits around 3.06%, little changed over the past month. Homebuilder sentiment as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index similarly went unchanged in May staying at 83. Although it has been six months since the record high of 90 without much of a push back up to those record levels, homebuilder sentiment continues to come in well above anything observed prior to the pandemic. Commentary from the NAHB noted that the strong reading on homebuilder confidence is thanks to the low housing inventories, low rates, and strong demand, despite the headwinds of rising costs. While that could have played into the small decline in traffic, future sales did tick higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-HL.png))**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Table.png))**

> Whereas the headline number was flat on the month, readings based on each region saw much more variety. By far the largest move was for the Northeast. Since running back up to the record high back in February, homebuilder sentiment in the Northeast has fallen for three straight months and is now at the lowest level since January. The decline in sentiment in the Northeast is relatively recent. Whereas the region tied its record high earlier this year, the other regions all peaked out in the fall. For the Midwest, the declines have kept coming with 3 point declines in each of the past three months alone. The West and South, on the other hand, have found some respite. The South has ticked higher by 2 points in back-to-back months as it reached the highest level since December. Meanwhile, the West was unchanged at 91 in May.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051721-NAHB-Region.png))**

> As for homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) had been trading in overbought territory throughout most of the spring but in the past couple of weeks, it has come back down to Earth. Last Wednesday, ITB successfully tested its 50-DMA with a small bounce at the tail end of the week. So far today, it has turned lower alongside the broader market with a 1.35% decline. While that means Friday's close marks a lower high, for the time being, the uptrend is still intact.

> # Increased Caution Across Sentiment Indicators

> The S&P 500 has been holding up at its 50-DMA in the past week while more speculative areas of the market (i.e. crypto) have experienced wild swings. As a result, sentiment on the part of individual investors has not seen much of a move. The American Association of Individual Investors' weekly reading on bullish sentiment was little changed this week climbing half of one percentage point to 37%. Although that was not a large move in the past week, sentiment has taken a big hit over the past month having fallen from well above 50%. In spite of that big drop and even though sentiment is around the lowest levels of the past half-year, the current sentiment level is within one percentage point of the historical average. In other words, optimism is low versus recent history but is very much middling from a longer term perspective.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull.png))**

> Meanwhile, bearish sentiment fell 0.7 percentage points to 26.3%. Unlike bullish sentiment, that is a bit lower than the historical average of 30.5%

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Those corresponding moves meant the bull-bear spread climbed to 10.7 from 9.5 the prior week. Excluding last week, that is still one of the lowest readings since February.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Neutral sentiment has been the star of the show recently. The gain this week was tiny at only 0.2 percentage points, but nonetheless, it marked the fifth consecutive week in which neutral sentiment has risen. At 36.7%, it is now at the highest level since the second week of 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> The Investors Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers took a less optimistic tone this week as bullish sentiment fell 4.1 percentage points to a ten-week low of 54.5%. Bearish sentiment was unchanged at the highest level since the end of March. The survey also questions respondents on whether or not they expect a correction. That reading rose 4.1 percentage points to 28.3% in the biggest one-week uptick since the last week of April when it rose 4.7 percentage points. That leaves the reading at the highest level since the week of March 10th. Before that, you would need to go back to September 23rd to find as high of a reading.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/052021-II-Correction.png))**

> Another sentiment reading that has taken an even more dramatically negative tone lately has been the National Association of Active Investment Managers Exposure Index. This index measures how exposed to equities managers are where readings of 200 would mean they are leveraged long, 100 would be fully invested long, 0 would be neutral, -100 is fully short, and -200 is leveraged short. This week saw the index fall another 2.65 points after a massive 40-point decline last week. That is the lowest level since last March and April of last year. Altogether, while sentiment still favors bulls, there has been a more cautious tone that has been reflected in managers reducing exposure to equities.

The first part is a tautology. Stocks could be volatile over any period anyway. Just needs a better word than ""could"" to indicate the effect of billions of dollars rotating out of wooden nickles.

The second part is inaccurate. Zorkmid isn't turbulent, it's crashing. The turbulence is the wind it's causing as it rushes past your window."

The company is overvalued by any metric.

You are pushing a conspiracy and posts like this convince other people to put money into this scam, many putting in money they cannot afford to lose. You need to stop."
2021-05-22 12:30:18,stocks,"You have to learn that yourself, for programming I will most certainly not give you a full tutorial.

For Excel, use the googlefinance functions which allows you to get the price of the opening and closing price of today, or the opening price and current price of today (depending on if you want to make it after market closes, you can also use closing price of the last day to include after hours and pre market changes).

Now you need to determine what company belongs to which sector, I assume this is manually done, but there could also be a google finance command. None that I know though. This is used for grouping them together.

Once this is done you have to add the total of the sector to get the percentages of for each company within it's sector. If e.g. Amazon is 10% of it's entire sector, then your goal is that the volume of the box is equal to 10% of the entire sector it belongs to. By setting a standard size for the entire sector box you can determine what volume is needed for the Amazon box (in length and width) while attempting to keep length and width the same size (at least to gain boxes, though it looks like this is flexible here to make fit for everything. Point is it's supposed to be accurate and similar for most, at least).

Now comes the more complicated part of what belongs to what. This might be possible via some sort of graph I am not familiar with, but if I had to do this I would do it via a VBA macro. Since I calculated the length and width I can use a sheet where I use the cells as squares, meaning same length and width. Each square is supposed to represent a certain measuring size, like 0.1cm x 0.1cm. This would also represent 1% market cap. Note that this is super simplified and the actual sheet might require thousands, if not more, single 0.01cm x 0.01cm to give an accurate picture.

Back to the macro, you take the length and width and fill out these areas. There is a ton of fine tuning that can be done here, e.g. pre-calculating where the top 10 have to be to make a fitting image (if you have a total of 10cm x 10cm and 2 companies combined have a length of 6cm and 3cm, then this will look weird as 1cm is left unused). I assume here scaling would be effective, or simply morphing values to make them fit. Morphing can't be done to all values, so it would be off by a slight amount. In above example of 6 and 3 cm that would be 66% of the 1cm for the 6 size one (6/9=0.66=66%) and 0.33 cm for the 3cm to keep the same ratio. Scaling is technically the same, except it would be on all sides equally.

Lastly the macro only has to take in the original calculation you did (current price/opening price or whatever you are looking for) to calculate the difference. Depending on the value you can choose a range of colors to use. VBA allows you to use RGB colors, meaning you can simply use a basic number, multiply it by the outcome of the division and based on that color the cells. That will lead to darker red if its deep negative and darker green if deep positive. Now you just take the hight of the cells you just colored and add a title to it, I would probably just use the top row of it, type in the ticker name (here: AMZN), add the profit or loss behind it, then combine all the cells that belong to it's width and finally select all cells I colored and put a frame around them. This can easily be done since you calculated in the beginning what cells are supposed to be colored, so you have the measurement readily available. For something like the title you just take less cells. You can even set a font size depending on the amount of width and length to make it fitting, so a 50x50 cell would have a larger font than a 10x10 would have."

But, I also have a ~ 25 year time horizon so if there is a correction in the next few months, I should be all right long term.

I like that it doesn't hold Apple or Microsoft (but does have Google) so maybe it'll perform a bit differently than similar ETFs, especially adding diversity for investors that already hold those companies individually.

Also, for those who’ve invested for several years, have there been any stocks from your past that fit this category? If so, what did you eventually do with those stocks?

I’m only less than two months into my investing journey, so take what I say with a grain of salt, but my top three so far are…

3) MA - Talk about a stock that swings wildly. At its peak, MasterCard was as high as +300 for me. At its bottom, it fell to almost -200. Right now it’s sitting at around -100. I saw MA’s chart before I bought, and I noticed the wild price swings, but I also saw the general upward trend of higher highs and lows, which is why I’m not worried about its ability to eventually recover again.

2) SBUX - The stock was climbing from the moment I bought it…until its earnings report. Then it recovered. Then it didn’t. Yet despite its ridiculously high P/E ratio, it’s Starbucks. Its brand is as loud as Coca-Cola or Disney. I doubt it stays down for long.

1) OPY - When I was trying to find undervalued stocks, Oppenheimer’s numbers made it an attractive buy. Then the recent panic over inflation hit, and OPY wasn’t immune from the fall. Still, all indicators point to it being undervalued, and it’s already shown the ability to recover at least once. It seems as though I just got in at a bad time."

Here is my question. 

I have a Roth IRA through Vanguard. I chose the Target Retirement 2050 fund. I am able to max this out every year. I wanted to start investing more and opened an account with Merrill. My  plan, so far, is:

60% ETF’s 
Within that 60%, 50% is growth and 50% is speculative.

40% Individual Stocks
Within that 40%, 50% growth and 50% speculative. 

Question 1.) Is this a good plan? I have a tendency to overthink and over complicate things. 

Question 2.) For my growth ETF positions, I already have some shares of VTI. Is this position redundant since my Roth IRA is Vanguard Target Retirement 2045(which I max out.) From what I can read, the 2045 target retirements holdings are 50% VTI. If it is redundant, would anyone happen to have a recommendation for growth ETF that would offer different exposure. 

Thank you in advance. This community is a great resource."
2021-05-21 21:27:53,stocks,Sure there is nothing wrong with your plan. But why do Growth and Spec. In both ETF and Individual?  I would add some Value / dividend stocks.

2021-05-22 10:02:42,stocks,"IMO you're way overthinking it.  You already have a target retirement fund that you're maxing out every year.  That's your diversified backup.  

If you like doing research and want to work at learning to invest, put the rest in stocks.  If not, just put it in VTI.  Fuddling with asset allocations is a complete waste of time and effort.  It's like cutting supermarket coupons to save five cents on milk.   You're better off learning something fundamental about companies or markets or economies.  

I'm 100% stocks for over 15 years and have done well.  I don't bother with canned methodologies like ""growth"" or ""value"" or ""dividend"" investing or sector allocations or bonds or any of that crap.  Just buy stocks in strong companies when there is a good price opportunity and sell the same way.   

I've read many Buffet books.  They were great in terms of learning about how to read financial statements.  But in the end his complicated valuation strategies don't provide much return on the effort.  Over the last 20 yrs no one cared about AMZNs ROE or whatever, they bought the stock because it was screaming upwards, and it was screaming upwards bcz AMZN was growing revenue stupidly fast.  For AAPL and GOOG the same, with profit also important for them.

There is actually another bottleneck in the supply chain which is the Dutch company ASML that supplies highly advanced manufacturing equipment.

There is a chance that the acquisition is blocked. USA and Europe are both trying to get a better grip on the semiconductor supply chain. Europe's main levers are ARM and ASML.

They charge their customers by the number of units that the software utilizes, and they gave me their model, and my job was to improve it so that they could present it to investors.  It was an entire biz model, but for here let’s just assume it was revenue only.  Here are the questions I asked, which were asked to test the underlying assumptions of their forecast. 

1. Is the price that you charge competitive with the market?
2. Is your product better or disruptive to the market therefore demanding a higher price?
3. Is your product commoditized which means you are only competing on price?
4. How many customers are in the market and how many are you acquiring and how quickly?
5. Does the number of customers that being acquired make sense?

There were more questions but this gives a general idea.  Based on these answers the model can be fine tuned, or built from scratch.  The more we understand the underlying business, the better we can financial model."

This week, the next Papa of EV World, Herbert Diess, referenced this bit of news from earlier this month:

[Hydrogen instead of electrification? Potentials and risks for climate targets](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/hydrogen-instead-of-electrification-potentials-and-risks-for-climate-targets)

The CEO of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, stated that hydrogen fuel cell technology won't be feasible for cars for at least a decade:

[VW CEO Says Electric Batteries Are Better than Hydrogen Cars](https://interestingengineering.com/vw-ceo-says-electric-batteries-are-better-than-hydrogen-cars)

> The German newspaper Handelsblatt was the first to report on the PIK's research, which in turn sparked Diess's Twitter post, stating (in German) ""Such fuels as a universal climate solution are a bit of a false promise. While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification. Hydrogen-based fuels are likely to be very scarce and uncompetitive for at least another decade.""

And just yesterday, the original Papa of EV World, Elon Musk, agreed.

> Diess's Twitter post was supported by Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who also takes a firm stance on electric batteries as the method to power EVs. Musk wrote on Twitter that ""Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use.""

Because whole fkn Europe is supposed to get CO2 neutral by 2050 and the Nordic countries in Europe are constantly building their hydrogen infrastructure, to be the supplier for core countries like Germany and France. 

2. Hydrogen will eventually be profitable, our oil and gas infrastructure took trillions to build up and it would be great if we could use parts of it in future too. Ohh and btw, to all ppl who say that hydrogen is to expensive, yes, you're right, but look at the development in PV  and onshore wind market, it's now not only competitive to fossil fuels, but is outcompeting them.

Hydrogen fuel cell manufacturers are a bit of a lottery ticket. I'm heavily invested in APD because they produce the hydrogen that will be bought, alongside plenty of other industrial gases, all of which I see a bullish future on. The historical arguement against hydrogen is that its inefficient to produce, but that's green/grey hydrogen. Blue hydrogen is what I love, not green hydrogen, and APD are making the move to that. Although I would love to see a move to green hydrogen in the future, Blue hydrogen is far more efficient, with essentially no pollution.

2021-05-22 00:31:28,stocks,"Pros of hydrogen compared to battery:

* very high mass density of energy.
* Electrolysis is simple and can help solve problems with unreliable renewable energy generation.

Cons of hydrogen compared to battery:

* low volumetric density of energy -- very difficult to store.
* Hydrogen distribution is pretty piss poor.
* Round trip efficiency of hydrogen is poor. Power -> hydrogen -> power loses a ton, especially if you add distribution costs and storage inefficiencies (compression or liquifying).
* Most cost effective way of generating hydrogen isn't electrolysis, it's using methane, which isn't exactly green. Also shows how inefficient electrolysis really is.
* Most efficient way of generating power is from fuel cells which require exotic metals, much more so than batteries (there is research on both sides done to minimize this cost).


The only way I see hydrogen ever being possibly feasible is if renewable energy becomes so successful, we need to find ways of dumping excess energy during non-peak times -- such that hydrogen becomes practically ""free"" except for electrolysis and distribution costs. Even then, I'm not sure."

Hydrogen gas is an expensive foray into extending the life of a desperate oil dependent petro dollar driven industry. Refineries need an excuse to stay relevant if the oil money is to continue and as a result the only people who care are oil producers. Trust me bro, with enough energy storage and prolific renewables all gasses and combustible fuels turn into hobbyist-only materials.

Carbon neutral gas and fuels are coming, you think every house in Europe is going to suddenly switch out ever valve and mechanism to handle hydrogen explosive instead of methane??

You should probably look at index funds. They are very low cost, diversified, and passively follow specific segments of the market OR the entire market. This makes it easy to track the market’s overall performance rather than relying on stock picking, which can be very risky.

Depending on the brokerage you use, each one has similar products. The total US stock market fund at Fidelity is FSKAX. It’s VTSAX at Vanguard, and SWTSX at Schwab.

S&P 500 index funds at these brokers are FXAIX, VFIAX, and SWPPX respectively. 

An ETF is a fund that may be traded in real time like a stock. Many of the same products are available in ETF form. VTI is the Vanguard total US market ETF. VOO is their S&P 500 ETF.  

By the way, you likely will not cash out - people don’t typically do that. You will instead withdraw a safe amount annually to help fund your retirement."

ETF- Can be sector specific, geographical, asset etc.

An index fund or even index ETF Follows a particular index.
Ex. S&P500 Index ETF's will match as close as possible these companies to equal the index. Minus fees of course.
Mutual fund. Usually a fund of funds like some ETF'S. 
More managed than passive.


The best fit isn't what you think. The best fit is what type of investor you are. Other than mutual funds for us Canadians for the most part these just fleece us.
They are all equal in risk. The risk is what is held not the type. Nuanced though an index ETF of canada would have less risk than an all bank ETF.

2021-05-22 14:04:34,stocks,"- a mutual fund is a collection of stocks, bonds or other assets. these are ""mutual"" because they're owned mutually by a group of people. 

- an ETF is also a collection of stocks or other assets. the main differences are (1) ETFs trade in the middle of the day like stocks, so the price can fluctuate mid-day, but mutual funds trade only on one price at the end of the day and (2) ETFs will have an additional fee called the ""bid/ask spread"" -- bid is the buyer price, ask is the seller price. there's always a gap even if it's just a penny (but it can be much larger_, and you pay this fee to whoever handles the trade each time you buy/sell. IMO the only major advantage to ETFs is in a taxable account, because they're structured to minimize capital gains taxes. in a tax-sheltered retirement account, capital gains doesn't matter. 

- an index fund is one strategy for mutual fund or ETF investing -- an index tracks a sector of the market and doesn't do detailed stock-by-stock or company-by-company analysis. for example the Russell 1000 is just a list of the largest 1000 companies that trade on the US stock markets. every 4 months, they adjust the list as companies get bigger or smaller. the type of company, or if the company is profitable or not doesn't factor into the list. in contrast there are growth stock funds (companies growing faster than average for their type), or value investing (companies where the stock is on sale relative to the value of the company, like buying a $10,000 car for $5,000). there are sector funds (healthcare stocks, energy stocks), or other strategies. indexing will have lower management fees, and over time it's difficult to beat the averages of the overall market. so there's a wide agreement that most of your investing should be in low-fee funds."
2021-05-21 20:42:21,stocks,"Others have already pointed out that index funds are a type of fund that could be an ETF or mutual fund. That said, index funds are our best bet for high returns over time, because even most of the best actively managed mutual funds can’t consistently outperform the market (and the ones that can have expense ratios that will eat away at your returns).

Whether you choose ETFs or mutual funds is up to you. ETFs are easier to trade since they function just like stocks, but the best index mutual funds actually have lower fees (Fidelity’s FXAIX is only 0.015%, and Schwab’s SWPPX is only 0.02%)"

2021-05-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 21, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterday’s rally. It’s encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterday’s gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserve’s April meeting minutes, “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals”.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted “a number of participants suggested” that as the economy continues to quickly, “it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase”, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.
* Snap (SNAP) said it will acquire WaveOptics, a British Augmented Reality company, for over $500 million. The company has recently been making a big push into the world of wearable AR technology.
* China's internet watchdog said on Friday that companies including ByteDance, Baidu, and Microsoft (MSFT) improperly collected user data in the country.
* Yesterday, the US Department of Treasury announced it was taking steps to crackdown on digital assets by requiring any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
* China’s Financial Stability and Development Commission, which is chaired by Vice Premier Liu He, released a statement today saying it is necessary to “crack down on digital asset mining and trading behavior and resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.”

how do I convince him?

just to clarify, I am worried that he is going to give me a rather significant number to invest with, as he clarifies that my  3,000 portfolio was not ""real money"" so I am somewhat worried that he is going to hand me 10,000$, as he has mentioned something similar in the past.

Inflation concerns are nonsense. When rates increase to a healthy level it will be a non issue. Again, short term corrections are possible but long term we are looking at a period of strong healthy growth incoming.

We recovered from a deep dive this year. We didn't see unsustainable growth as much as we saw the whole market gap down and then spend the last year filling that gap back up.

In any case, if you are worried about a correction investing in index funds OBVIOUSLY is safer than individual stocks because of the inherent diversification. There are defensive funds that you can buy into as well such as consumer staples and value funds.

Maybe the market will pull back reflexively to some short term catalysts.

While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification. Hydrogen-based fuels are likely to be very scarce and uncompetitive for at least another decade.""

Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use.""

VW has gone all in in electro because of pressure from politics. And now they can't do anything else than push it forward at any costs if they don't want to lose a big bunch of money and prestige.

The electro motors and the electro power train are not the problem, they are very efficient right now and still room for improvements. The biggest problem the electro has right now is the battery and the charging process either in effectivity as well as in infrastructure.

Additionally the ecological footprint of the electro cars from the very beginning to the end of life is not that lower compared to conventional cars.

All three technologies... combustion, Hydrogen and Electro have pros and cons right now and are more or less in the same cathegory if you see the big picture.

I can recognise that combustion is a bit on the top of its development, I don't really expect a real technological jump in it. But IMHO it still (at least right now) is better than the others in many ways.

If both alternative technologies (electro and hydrogen) would reach the relative development status that combustion has... I think that hydrogen would be better than electro. 

Sadly, I see too, that its current development status is still far from the maturity point of electro.

If I could decide for VW... I would not deprecate the combustion yet, I would get into electro right now and try to reach a top position in market share in it, but I would create an I+D division for hydrogen because it has more potential.

Lithium ion batteries are essentially a 30 year old invention in the form we know them today, and they’re at their very limit. They’re only advantage is that they had the head start and have a relatively widespread applications today, But their properties simply don’t compare to the energy properties of hydrogen in terms of flexibility of application. 

I mean there are companies making high quality graphene and hydrogen from natural gas cracking, an extremely basic chemical process (complex to innovate and optimize though) the prevalence and extraction of natural gas is extremely broad today and the issues you cite are not different form the problems presented at the onset of widespread LNG use, it was essentially an economic blue print for a better form of itself. Where it really takes the cake is when cracking uses renewable energy and produces no CO2 when moisture is not present during cracking. Not to mention batteries are too heavy to use for flight and high power applications like mining trucks and ocean traversing ships already use the best available fuel cells. This is all without mentioning that hydrogen is the most prevalent resource in the universe and also may form the future the basis of fusion energy technology here on earth.

Technically, an electric turbine *could* work at high altitudes, BUT it would have to spin at a much, much, higher rate than a gas turbine to overcome the low atmospheric pressure to generate thrust. Think of how helicopters are pretty much incapable of landing on Mt. Everest due to the low pressure of air at those elevations. The helicopter blades could spin faster to overcome this, or you could use propulsion (as in a jet engine). Right now kerosene jet fuel is about 15 times more energy dense than liIon batteries, and so you would need an incredibly substantial jump in energy density of batteries to overcome this. Think 30 times better than kerosene. That's not even remotely feasible right now, even with the best solid state batteries on the horizon."

2021-05-22 03:14:02,stocks,"Here’s a few suggestions.

1) use bonds, etfs and a few “boomer” stocks. 

2) if your stock or etf is trending up and it dips, this is usually hedge funds/MM stop loss hunting. Companies will sell. People will shit themselves, like yourself, and sell. Then those firms will buy back in. This is illegal in most cases but rarely enforced and usually the media will provide a scapegoat for those companies (I.e “fears that the migrant caravan, causes S&P500 to drop 5% in the last week”) 

3) stop looking at your account every 5 seconds. 99% of the profit you’ll make is through after hours trading and trends that you miss out on if you sell. Seriously. If you buy a stock without being 100% convinced that it’s a stock that’ll go up, you’ll sell if it drops 25%

4) “never” use leverage (I personally use a 2x leverage on a bunch of my trades and then use excess money to extend the Stoploss/margin call, but if you’re not certain or sure then don’t use leverage). 

5) don’t throw good money after bad. Just because a stock drops 25% in a month doesn’t mean it’ll immediately rocket up again. Investing in consolidating stocks, deep or under valued plays and balancing that will stable stocks,bonds and etfs to maintain capital is better than chucking your savings at half a dozen sinking companies and praying that one of them does a 10 bagger.

6) your biggest focus should be on capital preservation, then making profit, then limiting losses. Keeping your position sizes to 7.5-5% or less and DCA (dollar cost averaging) into plays can help ease those dips and balance out your capital. Even tho lump sum investing does make more profit. Gradually investing in 1/4 chunks or 1/3 chunks means if a stock dips 10% you can still break even by investing your capital as it dips, then your positions you invested at a lower price can be compounded by selling at the point the stock breaks even and investing in another play/saving. Or holding if you feel like it.

7) if none of these appeal to you, just invest in VTI and VOO and stay away from the casino. The years you’ll save on your life probably outweigh the profits you’ll make trading. I’m not a boglehead but they seem happier 😂"

Shoppers will still be able to get fast delivery on the Amazon app or site.

This is actually a good news. Some of my friends have been doing this before the pandemic and they said amazon is losing money due to this program.

2021-05-22 10:12:05,stocks,"I have been thinking about this every time I read a post like this or see a chart of almost any stock. I am a glass half-full person but the government is telling us they are getting ready to taper their help. Maybe we should listen? 

Look at the 20 year or older chart on any stock or index. The hills and mountains go up sharply but gradual when we went from paper to computer (about 1994ish) which opened up the market to anyone with enough money and a computer. Gone were the days of calling your broker and driving to the bank. 

You can see when QE and the “FEDs printer goes brrr “ were added after 2008. You can see the affect of lowering the interest rates. 

All this additional money combined with recent low tax policies on corporations and individuals, extremely low interest rates, and you have the market climbing large mountains very easily. 

When we get to 2020 and COVID you see the fear drop but then with low tax business friendly policies, low inflation, additional stimulus money, additional printing & treasury buying, easy margin access because of low interest, retail investors jumping in with their cool new apps and stimulus checks, government interventions (EV and green energy money) added to the market and it looks like Mount Everest. Straight up. 

What happens when that goes away? Taxes are about to change and the Fed wants to stop adding. We are being told interest rates will go up and inflation needs to go up 2 or 3% in the way the Fed measures it. 

How many more stimulus checks do we think we are getting? What will finally pass in Congress regarding infrastructure? Do we think this has no limits? Even if the government withdraws help really slow? 

If you draw a trend line from 2000 to 2021 you can see the extreme nature of this pattern. 

So my question is how long do we trade sideways or will we go down the other side of this mountain? 

I can’t see the market going up like it has without all that help from the government and they are telling us they want off the mountain. 

Am I missing something? Maybe I’m looking at this all wrong?"

The two that are doing badly are one I bought stupidly and another I’ll hold on to..
One that’s doing badly is Tesco a U.K. supermarket I bought because people convinced me it was a no lose after the special dividend and a consolidation well let me tell you that went shitty and I’m 10% down where I was before... I’ll get a 4% div this year and I don’t mind just collecting that going forward...

The other that isn’t doing great right now is due to my thesis, I went for the roaring twenties trade so I bought Ferrari. The kicker here is it wasn’t a bad trade, I bought Ferrari 6 shares at 211.65 sell price is 211.19.. I know I should be down what? 2.64$ nothing to complain about, the problem here is that I’m as you may have guessed U.K. based so I’m actually 30£ down due to the strengthening of the pound to the dollar... 
the same can be true of Pfizer 44 shares at 37.31 .. it’s now 39.94.. not a bad swing right... except due to currency fluctuations that only equates to profit of 13.91£ whereas in dollar terms it would look more like 110$

People blame the stocks, market rotations and any short term media induced noise instead of taking a step back and realizing you are investing for the long term and that means patience. 

Practical advice is make sure you actually understand the risk and volatility of your portfolio. Most would fail here because we think we know until things go to shit and then you're freaking out. There's a reason over half of my portfolio is in index funds. Not because I think they'll provide a higher return (yes I know this is debatable) but mainly because I don't want 5% daily swings.

2021-05-22 08:53:09,stocks,"Totally agree. But try seeing the other side: as you call them great companies, you believe in their business model and probably want to hold them for some time. As they stay cheap, you have more time to accumulate and buy more shares. Nothing annoys me more than a company I own beeing overvalued."
2021-05-21 22:10:05,stocks,that’s a symptom of the market being wayyy overblown.

They will have to eat a loss for the devalue of them just to get rid of them to move the 2022 new line of cars and trucks out. Whos going to pay full price for a truck thats a year oldand will loose thousands in value soon as you sign the papers Elon dont have that problem his probem is he cant build the cars fast enough to make delivery on time.

2021-05-22 13:34:05,stocks,People are no Homo oeconomoecus. Markets are more psychology than they are Hard facts. Maybe people expected even netter news ? There is so much to consider. I know it doesnt makes sense but think about the psychology.

2021-05-22 08:03:10,stocks,"This can be true and apple can still be way overbought at the same time you know. 

For example look at cisco, great growth company in the 90s and early 20s then the dot com bubble happened in 00. In 21 years they have been included in the NASDAQ, DOW and sp500, enterprises still use them to connect to the internet and they have beaten earnings every year, generates around 11 billion NET income making them a  220 billion company. Cementing them the worlds most valuable internet network company.

But still even after 21 years, those that bought at the top in 00 have yet to see all time highs again. Not saying apple is stagnant I'm saying good companies don't necessarily mean good investments depending when you bought and at what price you brought. Companies can be overvalued despite being great companies because the market is not the economy."

The ministry of education doesn't want classes after 9pm on school days. One source talked about a ban on classes during the weekends, which would have a detrimental impact on the online K-12 tutoring business model. 

The goal is to put less pressure on children and lessen the financial burden on parents. The government wants to stop the decline of the birth rate and doesn't care about the impact on after school tutoring companies.

2021-05-22 09:55:13,stocks,">If you compare Netflix to Disney, it's easy to see Netflix doesn't take advantage of IP the way Disney does. Disney has games, merch, theme parks oriented around its characters. Netflix has built all these universes, but they only go as far as a few seasons of streaming.

As far as I understand, Netflix doesn't necessarily own the IP's of those Netflix Originals. afaik Netflix Original typically means they order the production or license existing content to have exclusive distribution rights in a given country; doesn't mean they fully own the IP. Netflix Original can mean multiple things: self-produced/co-produced content (like with Stranger Things still doesn't necessarily mean they own the IP) or licensed original programming that is exclusive to Netflix (though not necessarily worldwide).

It doesn't mean they also acquire the IP under the contract they signed with the production company/creators/IP owners even for co-produced content.

Case in point for some of the most popular shows on Netflix:

* Stranger Things is owned by the Duffer brothers (creators and exec producers of the series)
* Cobra Kai is owned by Sony Pictures
* The Crown is owned by Left Bank Pictures (Sony Pictures Television)
* Lucifer is owned by Warner Bros./DC Entertainment

Same thing for some of the older popular shows like House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Narcos. All owned by external production companies.

Netflix biggest advantage over the other streaming services is by far and away their brand."

2021-05-21 21:17:41,stocks,"Whatever Epic Games was doing is an example of how not to do it, and at the moment looks like they slowed down to halt and already burned through their money while they conquered absolutely nothing.

What you said is a neat point, everyone wants a peace of gaming cake, yet nobody actually offers anything that gamers want. Yet another generic and mediocre title is just not the way, especially if there are better alternatives to play instead. If they ever inovated, put out something groundbreaking, offered something people can get only there and nowhere else, then i would believe.

Honestly they do take a risk with wanting the peace of cake, yet when actually developing anything gaming related they stop making the risks entirely for some reason. Amazons and Googles take on it leaves people scratching their heads and saying ''who the fuck asked for this ?''

On smaller scale even Blizzard and Valve are struggling with chasing trends to have that peace of cake, later to realize it didn't bring insta billions and abbandon their games.

If Netflix originals are any kind of indicators, then i have absolutely no trust in their next adventure."

For example, we went with GC at my current job (last year) despite it being the most expensive service. Why? Because the difference in price was irrelevant from a practical perspective. Even though it was 10%-30% more than competitors, what is $15k a month vs $11k a month to a company that gross millions a month? Its literally nothing and more importantly, GC is the easiest to scale worldwide (along with AWS) and provides, by far, the best performance and redundancy due to owning their own systems.

BABA is far too late to the game just like Oracle and IBM. Too late. They might capture most of China and maybe a few other smaller countries but that is all. They will have almost no market in the USA or EU because all the major businesses have already gone online. They arent going to switch."
2021-05-22 13:52:32,stocks,I don't think you should count the tech bubble in.
2021-05-21 23:18:42,stocks,"Lol, I work with the largest companies and multimillion $ cloud projects every day so I know a thing or two.

https://cntechpost.com/2021/04/21/alibaba-cloud-market-share-overtakes-google-to-become-no-3-in-the-world/

""Alibaba Cloud's market share reached 9.5%, ranking third in the world and first in Asia-Pacific, surpassing Google Cloud Platform's 6.1%, according to data recently released by research firm Gartner.""

Are we going to see the US Army or European hospitals using BABA? No, but it doesn't matter, the global cloud market is massive and there is room for aws, msft, gcp and baba (the stock with the biggest upside)"
2021-05-22 16:09:01,stocks,"Im not saying there is no growth but all indications are that it has already started slowing and the big guns (and money) have already moved. The stragglers are also more likely to use MSFT/Google/AWS for both trust and technical reasons. 

BABA is sort of a hard sell. When we started talking about moving last year, Alibaba wasnt even considered (though surprisingly a few smaller componies were) and mind you our company is Korean and my group is Euro. My point is that its a mistake to assume cloud growth will be split evenly. 

Again I am actually ok with investing in BABA. I think they are indeed a good price. But I am simply pointing out that its a mistake to valuate it based on other countries PE's or comparing it to Amazon."
2021-05-22 17:37:15,stocks,There are requirements like gdpr which necessitate storage of data within a country. China and Russia have similar laws. If you want to scale or do cloud in China you have to use baba or tencent. You can’t spin up gc azure or aws to have an internet presence in China. 1.3 billion people using the internet... almost twice the population of USA and Europe combined... and alibaba leads cloud in China. It’s really that simple.
2021-05-21 21:40:13,stocks,"something like VXUS will buy the majority of major company stocks apart from the US. 

there are also things like country specific funds/ETFs (FNORX is Fidelity's Nordic/Scandanavian fund). the FTSE 100 is the major UK index, DAX for Germany. FSPSX is non-US, except China. there are innumerable variations: Asia ex-China, Asia-ex Japan, Developed Europe vs. Emerging Europe, etc etc."

2021-05-22 02:07:50,stocks,I bought NVDA in 2008 at $10.80 a share for 20 shares. So glad I held on. No clue what I was doing when I bought it. All I knew at the time was they made sick graphics cards and I figured there was always a need for better graphics. Turned out to be a good decision.

2021-05-22 07:17:52,stocks,NVDA saved me today. It is by far my largest holding. Some retail investors will buy NVDA more now that the shares will be cheaper. Odd thinking I know. NVDA should continue to rise on this news.

2021-05-21 21:55:28,stocks,You'll should end up with 1.2 shares.
2021-05-21 22:57:57,stocks,"Hard to say. If it was in a bullish phase already, nothing has markedly changed in the backstory, then I’d say yes. 

Opposite of it was in a bearish phase."
2021-05-22 01:14:21,stocks,"Generally speaking, a forward stock split is seen as a positive sign for a company, and tends to rally the price for retail buyers. 

However, in cases like Apple which is widely held by institutional funds, the increased share count becomes an attractive opportunity to sell and capture some profit. In the run up to its stock split last August, Apple share price boomed, but subsequently, the price has stagnated — even with excellent earnings — and is about where it was 6 months ago. (Which, should make it more attractive.)"
2021-05-22 01:06:40,stocks,"Stock splits have both a practical and psychological effect: on the one hand, as you note, it adds to liquidity, although it reduces the EPS. However, more important for stock holders is that a lower stock price makes it more affordable, and tends to increase the value over time."
2021-05-22 02:28:53,stocks,"Yes and no. Your shares are worth less but you get 4x after the split. This typically indicates a company is strong and wants more investors, so more people will likely buy at the lower price and it’ll rise."

2021-05-22 09:12:37,stocks,"You’re basically repeating what I wrote: Apple has stagnated because as the most valuable company in the world, it is also among the most widely held by funds (around 57-59% of its 16.6B shares are institutional-owned)— and thus the gains it earned last year have also made it attractive to sell off, as needed to capture profit; typically to offset losses on other stocks. 

The announced $90 billion share buy back will eventually drive the price up, so long as the company continues to make massive earnings. It’s just taking longer to appreciate than much smaller stocks.

But to bring it back to NVDA, a similar thing could happen to that stock after the split: it’s already more than doubled in price over the last year. And while its market cap of $350B is 1/6th that of Apple, NVDA is actually even more widely held by funds— with estimated  66-68% of shares in institutional hands."

U never hear “reverse split, management pay cut”!
I know of an oil exploration co. $PDGO... they did that crap... ppl making $350k a yr. while if u didn’t get out, u got the shaft.
BEWARE penny or cheap oil/gas co. I’ve found them to be crooks. One was just in the news—“Zona Energy Inc., a Dallas-based company that claimed to be focused on the oil and gas industry...”—SEC investigating lies, fraud, etc.
SEC needs more help. Instead we class action suits which hurts a stock while shareholders get ¢ on $... of course lawyers do ok.
Search: ‘sec charges oil co. with fraud, misleading investors’ and see how many r under investigation."
2021-05-22 00:43:32,stocks,There is also a stock dividend so there is a small percentage of free stock in addition. So one share becoming 4.017 (based on previous CASH dividends of $0.64/share)shares at $149.50  is reasonable.
2021-05-22 06:54:54,stocks,No one actually makes money with a split or reverse split itself. If you had 1 share then you still just have 1/4th of 2400

2021-05-22 05:21:20,stocks,"If he originally bought @ $150, then his cost new basis will become $37.5 after the 4:1 split. This is automatically done by the broker.

Since NVDA is currently trading @ $600, the new share price will become $150 after the 4:1 split.

So the person was saying that he can buy NVDA @ $150 again but his own cost initial cost has dropped to $37.5 per share.

Hope the makes sense."
2021-05-21 23:56:31,stocks,"Even with fractional shares, this will make options more affordable, as well as conservative plays like CSPs and CCs more easily accessible."

Did you folks even [check the data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?p=TSLA)?  It didn't hit 800 until January.  Are we talking trading or investing??  Because I sure as hell don't hold an investment position (i.e. 4+ months) based on a freakin split.  Swing trading over a couple days or weeks, yes... and that would have worked out miserably even holding TSLA those 3 months post-split.

2021-05-21 22:52:40,stocks,"so if you were to actually believe in intel for your reasons outlined, you would have invested in it quite a while ago, but here you are invested in the past months with a thesis that has been adopted since they started building foundries a decade ago. they can barely keep up with their own chip production so what makes you think they’ll be able to make chips for everyone else? i get that intel is pivoting into IoT which has value, but arguing that their new plan will somehow shift the paradigm because of SOFTWARE related attacks is preposterous. most security flaws in hardware are in the designs of the chips themselves, and making legislation that gets in the way of capitalism is not looked at fondly in the US. sounds like you got caught up in the hype around intel news and decided to buy in, which i don’t mind, but too cite concerns about international relations as a reason to buy a company and then backing out signifies that you have more homework to do."
2021-05-22 04:57:08,stocks,open a history book please
2021-05-22 00:20:46,stocks,"I just started investing this year and continue to buy more as the price goes up and down. I was initially curious because Pat was their new CEO and I happen to also be looking into VMW at the time. I think he will lead the company in the right direction and have my other reasons for investing. I doubt there will be legislation beyond some funding for the industry, but the Biden administration will sure as heck have all government contracts buy American.  Also, this does not mean I think AMD, NVDA, or TSM are bad companies, just for me they look like riskier investments."
2021-05-22 11:55:32,stocks,Fuck yourself please
2021-05-22 05:07:38,stocks,"idk why you think that there aren’t already contracts set up with the government. intel is not going anything new, it’s just building more foundries because it wants to prove that it hasn’t been wasting money all these years. it’s effectively a double down situation, not a reason for growth using government contracts. government contracts are not going to make a noticeable difference in its balance sheets, as it already has profitable parts. i’m just trying to put everything into perspective because it doesn’t have much more room to grow without acquisitions, like at&t. there’s elevated levels on the stock price have been pushing the new ATH, but if they don’t execute, then the stock will be in limbo like at&t. just don’t view it as a growth stock, but more of a KO, stable dividend with minimal growth. pretty much don’t think it will 2x because it’s already such a large company, but if you understand that, then to each their own"
2021-05-22 15:47:44,stocks,sick comeback lmao
2021-05-21 20:21:41,stocks,"I invested in Verizon, Altria, and a high yield dividend ETF. My Altria returns are like 25%. My average return is like 6-7%"
2021-05-22 03:16:06,stocks,"It's ok, I have a small account and I bought 1k of ko, xom & t Just to have something a bit more stable. I'm break even on t and up on xom & ko but not much. 

As others said there isn't much room for a lot of growth. Even if you held it 39 years the returns probably wouldn't be that good even if you reinvested the dividend back into the stock compared to other stocks."
2021-05-21 21:54:16,stocks,Not any more. Lol
2021-05-22 07:56:10,stocks,I think the assumption of KO products not going away in 50 years is wrong. Cracking down on obesity and diabetes will absolutely happen in our lifetime. I would not be surprised if Soda drinks get banned some day. The question is if KO will be able to transform their products
2021-05-22 03:21:07,stocks,"so you're telling me you either split $1k into three different things or you bought 1k of ko, com, and t? dude you're rich as fuck. no wonder you're buying that many. you can get good money from the dividends with 1000s of those"
2021-05-22 01:37:53,stocks,Why on earth is this downvoted. Totally agree. Dividend stocks are appealing only if you have a lot of shares and want a regular payout without eating into your initial investment.
2021-05-22 04:54:15,stocks,yeah the payout is higher but the fees are about 2%higher as well
2021-05-22 14:50:56,stocks,"You plan to ban sugar? Or is it carbonation? Or is it the salt? Which do you plan to ban exactly? Or is the specific combination that offends you?

The idea you have doesnt work, which is why even the most obese of countries dont do it. If you think about it, it wont slow obesity at all. Further, the entire anti-obesity war is made up to begin with. Its not really about fat people, its about healthcare cost.

Healthcare costs will not come down no matter what you try because insurance itself thrives on rising costs. in fact, the higher the cost the bigger their profit and the more dependent we become on them. And of course drug companies want to charge more too so those two just play off each other. In other words, your soda ban will have exactly zero effect on costs."
2021-05-22 03:30:34,stocks,"Sorry I meant $1k each, so $3k total. I wish I had enough money to buy 1k shares of anything other than a meme stock. 

I'm trying to buy some more sensible things in my td Ameritrade account that I want to just hold long-term and never sell. Only have a couple shares of apple/amd/tdoc in there. Thinking of putting more money in there and buy a share each month of something like hum/coo/tdoc(im in the medical field and want to invest there). 

I have about low $20k invested in both accounts but I have so much money spread apart in some investments. Need to consolidate some of them."
2021-05-22 05:08:02,stocks,Yeah weird. People with 3k accounts hunting dividends that will pay them like 10 Dollars a year.
2021-05-21 21:55:31,stocks,Every financial news site.
2021-05-22 15:05:06,stocks,I’m not offended why are you being so weird? Of course it won’t stop obesity  but when have governments ever taken perfectly working measures ? Cola is the symbol of obesity (literally every lesson  about a healthy diet tells you how many sugar cubes are in cola) and so it will be the first to fall. Diet Soda is even worse since it’s addicting and makes you hungrier. Returns by KO and Pepsi are way way too low for me to ever consider investing in them. They’re morally not much better than cigarette companies so 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-22 01:29:42,stocks,"Why is this downvoted? You suggested one share, that seems totally reasonable."
2021-05-22 09:47:39,stocks,"I’m not sure, I thought it was a pretty reasonable ask, imo it’s like not buying a lottery ticket that’s a guarantee but again just my opinion, etfs are boring anyways"

2021-05-22 09:48:57,stocks,yes but you also realize that all of technical analysis is a metric by which to gauge the probabilities of a certain event occurring? Sure we can’t 100% predict what will happen but I can tell you for damn sure that retail owns the foot atleast once over

Also, SI is obviously being surpressed, AMC is at 20 and gamestop has been at 1% for four months while being traded at a constant 6:1 or 5:1 ratio for four months? 

You might not like it but this is how the system operates, to convince you that it’s a crap investment. Banks only started changing ratings in 2008 after they had repositioned to come out on top, what makes you think the same won’t happen here?"

Do you really think with all the media attention telling people to not buy gamestop for four months has led to less than 24.33M shares? Because jesus Fidelity reported over 4M new customers in Q1 following the RH disaster, if each one of those people held 10 shares there’s the float.

I'm not a software engineer so pardon butchering of terminology or misunderstanding, but I do work tons of patient data and realize the benefit of PLTR.

Are we going to get a magic box in the end where companies dump petabytes of disparate legacy data in it, and previously unseen or unfeasible decisions matrices get pumped out that facilitate decision making.

example, I feel as if their is a relationship between a sub supplier of a sub component that goes into one of our devices and noisy impedance signals in patients implanted with our devices, however, the analysis is current infeasible since our supply chain data is one system and our device data and it is hard to correlate the two and our company does not wan to fund the analysis (unless it becomes an actual issue).

A sharp dip in the near term increases their long term profit predictions by many multiples, it’s understandable why they love a good dip. 

When inflation and interest rate speculation news is reiterated over and over and over again, that’s what it feels like to me. Those with professional level information on the market just pumping fear into the market to scoop up cheap shares. 

And after the huge nasdaq run last year, makes total sense. at some point it’s less and less institution and more and more retail buying interest. Which institutions HATE buying into, they want to sell into that

You are only in the game a month or two and investing long term so you're going to have many more learning opportunities. We all have them, I've left hundreds of thousands on the table by selling out too soon or too late, I don't see them as regrets because I know that next time I'll have a well thought out strategy and stick to it.

Your portfolio looks good. The market will be volatile for the next few months which is fine, you'll live through it, gain the experience and be a lot less emotional when you have more cash in the game over the next few years."
2021-05-22 19:22:41,stocks,"From what I’ve read that’s pretty normal. I started in January by buying/selling  memestocks at the absolute worst times, losing most of my $$ then withdrawing the rest. I came back in early March after learning about stocks for a couple months, and I’ve made the $$ back plus 2% profits. I stick to dividend stocks mostly.

2021-05-22 09:55:02,stocks,I think I would have but it in my opinion it’s too late. If you look at what some of those sectors have done YTD from everyone else rotating they appear to be overbought. Energy and Materials are up like 40% YTD which is nuts for those sectors. Consumer Staples still has room to run and so does Consumer Discretionary.

Another example: profit of -$100 = $150 revenue - $250 cost. So in this case you have a loss of $100. 

Now I double my revenue to $300 but my cost also goes up to $500. 

Profit of -$200 = Revenue of $300 - $500 cost.

So yes, your revenue went up but your cost/expenses went up a lot more. So you are more in the hole. 

Now... I don’t know how this works in some crazy, speculative, potentially crazy growth company like SPCE.  Maybe it is ok to increase your expenses times a hundred to be able to open up a tourism bureau on the moon 10 years from now. That I don’t know. But for normal companies, you care about profit."

Similars attract. Those who are lovable themselves, because they have a beautiful inner makeup and in their nature to cherish and love the good (in both themselves and others), are spontaneously enthusiastic to see and express it.

They are the “good” ones.

While those who care too much for themselves to humbly appreciate and honor the good of others … well, they get the unloving company of their ilk.

Many don’t understand love.
For example, someone who believes loving means subjecting oneself to be another’s possession, he could easily complain that no one wants to “love” him/her.
Others think that the only loveable qualities are physical.

Love is too subtle to define with words, it’s exalting and intoxicating, uplifting and healing, and externally expresses itself in cherishing the beloved and their greatest good.

It’s full expression is rare even between friends and in married couples, because there is often an element of self interest stacked on it, a conditionality: “I’ll want your best as long as you are good to me”, “as long as you don’t become a more accomplished person than me”, or something similar.

PS:
I slightly debated with himself if it’s appropriate to post this here, to go lyric on love in a place that shows little attunement with the sentiment, but hopefully someone will appreciate. Cheers."

It's one of, if not the, best product in its space and it's a growing space. Dairy farmers lobbied hard to get legislation passed to make cow products the only thing legally allowed to be called milk for a reason. 

Beyond is undervalued. It has much less competition in the not-meat-that-tastes-like-meat vegan product space (basically impossible). It, however, is fighting against a very real disgust effect that some have when they find out it's not actually meat. The same market that you would think would be all about something like beyond is the market that's unreasonably petrified of GMO and nothing sounds more GMOish than meat that isn't meat. 

Both are ultimately going to benefit from a very real worldwide issue. There are too many cows (CO2), but not enough cows to feed the worldwide meat demand. This is a long-term thing though and we're not exactly good at long-term."

I use oatmilk daily for about a year now. and tried several brands. and ys there are differences. BUT: as long as its not extra sugar or oil in it, they all are the same. 

I only buy organic (aka sustainable) brands and Oatley isn´t even sold at our local ""Bio""-store. It´s ok, but it´s certaily nothing special about it."

But that's a different topic.

I agree. We'll see how long it takes until Oatly is a true consumer's staple. Before that it's just a gamble on the far future that might turn out either way (or you keep the stocks for a shorter amount of time, as long as the growth prospects are still greater than for ""similar"" comps like Beyond etc).

I am also consuming oat milk since a few years (seems like a good base for Oatly and the likes if so many people like you and I are drinking it, eh?). I find there are differences in terms of taste - of course you have to pay a premium for Oatly compared to e.g. the store's own brand, so I went with them, but sadly they lack the creaminess and are rather bland (not nutty). There's only one brand that comes close to Oatly and they also produce a lot of other milk substitutes like cashew etc. But obviously subjective, just my two cents.

Which country are you from if I may ask? In my region in Germany for example I can find Oatly in every supermarket and bio store with several variants being sold - it wasn't like that a year ago but now it seem like it's here to stay"

2021-05-22 03:33:12,stocks,"As I said, the 9.5B is online sports betting. It doesn't take into account in venue betting. If it does, the margins would be much lower."
2021-05-21 20:11:30,stocks,"Yes and No. 

Daily is going to stay a strong market because it's a highly skill-focused game. While winning the big prizes is basically gambling, some absurd amount of the money won overall is won by a small percentage of the players. Adding in that they're moving toward becoming a place for the non-gambling fantasy market, they may be able to turn the non-gambling market into gambling. 

But yes, they'll lose straight gamblers to sports betting when it becomes legal in their states. And that's partially because of the above. It's a very different game to figure out spreads on teams and pick winners or props than it is to craft a team with appropriate stacks and correlates."
2021-05-22 12:35:27,stocks,"I'll say this, I understand the bear case with DraftKings and I think you present a good case, but it's just not how I would evaluate it. You're really basing their entire valuation on one segment of revenue then. In-venue betting has the potential to be far more lucrative then traditional physical sportsbooks in places like casinos. They will get a lot more casual foot traffic than traditional books that typically only get people that are specifically going to the casino to place a sports bet. Will the overhead costs be higher than online? Absolutely, but I'm not fully convinced the margins will be that much worse. If they are, these places can always scale back to just kiosks and still get the increased traffic.

Honestly, I think $9.5B is still far too low even just for online betting as well. Newly expanded states generate roughly 80% of their revenue from online/mobile betting. For my previous estimate that puts it in the range of $8.6-$16B in the future once full roll out. With the exposure to people who don't use illegal sites, the end number should be higher than that range. That also doesn't take into account the growth this industry is still seeing YoY. 

I will admit though, there are certainly bear cases to sports betting as a whole. One of which is they have to convert all of the people using illegal sites. That'll be more difficult for people who are comfortable on the platform they are already using and/or want it to be easier to dodge taxes. I think you will see the vast majority convert as it will offer them better protection, but there will certainly be hold outs. I could see state crackdowns on illegal sites in the future since it will impact the revenue they'll generate. Another is I think people assume widespread legalization is going to be easier. We are mostly left with the states that have more complex issues and rollout from here could be slower in the remaining states. I do eventually expect widespread physical and mobile betting throughout the US, but I think it could take longer than most people anticipate.

There are risks associated investing in DraftKings. But I still think the potential of this market is immense and DraftKings has a good opportunity to expand to other areas as well."

There are always going to be writers/editors/publishers who hold stock positions in some car company, be it Toyota, Ferrari, Ford, GM, Tesla, or whatever. So what do you have to do? You look for whether or not there is actual evidence of their positions actually influencing their ratings/reviews, of which there doesn’t appear to be any. Consumer Reports car ratings are pretty in line with real world results and experience. 

Also, this piece is purely a critique of a specific Tesla feature, and a well reasoned one at that. It isn’t like he is sitting here saying “Fuck Tesla, buy Ford” haha."

2021-05-21 21:03:36,stocks,"Seriously, your best bet is ICLN to hedge risk since green stocks are still pretty speculative.

Another possibility I have done well on is MGA - they will be a major manufacturer of electric car components. They have a long history in the auto business, have strong fundamentals and reasonable valuations (unlike Tesla).

If you can stomach the risk on a more speculative play, I bought into EFLVF. They are the only maker of lithium ion batteries with UL991 and UL1998 safety certifications given by Underwriters Laboratories (a premier standard certification group) which makes the batteries valuable to businesses weary of the fire risk of the otherwise superior lithium ion battery technology. They are currently putting batteries in forklifts, but are planning on expanding to the bus market. Interesting play with potential multi-bagger upside, but again, risky."

I tried kia, Hyundai, honda and Nissan but I wasn't nearly as impressed with the reliability.

You pointing to this rule and claiming it proves short ladder attacks is silly. It would be like me saying that the Loch Ness Monster undeniably exists, with my proof being that biologists agree that “water mammals” are real. “The EPA says so!”

It's unrealistic to think a considerable amount of even multi millionaires are going to shell out that kind of money for a day trip. It's going to be billionaires or people close to being billionaires. And how many are going to do it more than once? It seems like skydiving, something that people will cross off their bucket lists and never do again. So yea, I think 100 is a fair estimate. Preorders are of course going to be higher than their regular numbers btw, that's how it works for every product and service, you make your most money on opening night. 

To be clear, I of course believe that one day we'll figure space travel out. I just don't think it's ever going to be something that makes people money. Unlike airplanes, where there was an economic incentive to make people get from point a to point b faster, there is no economic incentive to take people to space. It's an endless vacuum and hell scape, so far useful for nothing besides satisfying curiosity and pissing contests between rival nations."
2021-05-22 10:48:39,stocks,"> I of course believe that one day we'll figure space travel out. I just don't think it's ever going to be something that makes people money.

Virgin Galactic is not currently involved in space travel, not sure how many times that needs to be said lol. It's tourism, in the same way that cruise ships aimlessly wander around the oceans and coasts, and helicopter tours hover around arbitrary areas and then land back exactly where they started, accomplishing nothing (objectively speaking) yet charging extravagant amounts of money.

> there is no economic incentive to take people to space. It's an endless vacuum and hell scape, so far useful for nothing

Could you tell me what cruise ships and $50 million yachts are useful for? What about about luxury resort vacations, are those useful? To use your own example, how ""useful"" is flying a plane up to ~15,000 ft and then literally just jumping out of it? Certainly no economic incentive in any of those things (like the skydiving market which is *easily* over a billion dollar industry).

That is all not to mention that, on top of tourism, Virgin even has a potential business model to [literally as you put it] **""...get from point a to point b faster""**, however I'm not even arguing for that. As I said, those $250k tickets will become significantly lower in price and their demand will increase, that's how it works for every new product and service after all. Remember when Tesla began and they only offered a very high priced sports car with new untested battery technology? Yea."
