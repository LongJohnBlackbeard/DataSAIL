03/19/2021,stocks,In at 13... it’s been a good ride 🚀🚀
03/19/2021,stocks,I bout roughly 40 shares at $4 I’ve got 532.74% total return going but I think they can get to $30 a share then I’ll consider selling some
03/19/2021,stocks,Got in at 14!!!! Though it might be time to get out now that Reddit is realizing it’s a good buy. Idk. Drastic growth... Great earnings
03/19/2021,stocks,"In at 21 this week. Looks like I got quite lucky, although I'm going to hold even though there may be a pullback. Would definitely buy more at your mentioned price range as well!"
03/19/2021,stocks,How did you come across it and why did you buy? Trying to get better at getting in earlier
03/19/2021,stocks,"Signed up to ark investment trade alerts, it’s sent daily, they’ve been buying bucket loads since it was at 13 and got in then. You can sign up to their trades on the ark website. Will be picking up $Bfly on the next dip"
03/19/2021,stocks,The interest would cut into your gains or negate them
03/19/2021,stocks,"Borrowing money to buy borrowed money sounds dumb.

That’s like taking a mortgage out to buy someone else’s mortgage."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Multiple problems here. One is that your margin interest rate will be high compared to your yield on bonds unless you get lower rated stuff.

Secondly if you go out in duration to get more yield on bonds, you run the risk of getting a double whammy where interest rates rise which fucks over your bond position as well as stock position."
03/19/2021,stocks,Horribly dumb. Where you getting less an 2.5% on margin and where you getting more than 2.5% on a bond
03/19/2021,stocks,True true! Didn’t think of this
03/19/2021,stocks,They don't give me any trouble with my VPN so I'd guess you'll be alright. Just be careful on tourist wifi spots
03/19/2021,stocks,Your credit cards wouldn't be rejected unless you tried to use them in one country and then five minutes later in another or something like that. Fraud detection is better than that now.
03/19/2021,stocks,They wouldn’t care unless you are not a citizen/resident anymore.
03/19/2021,stocks,Use a VPN whenever you are using anyone's internet other than your own. It's just good security hygiene.
03/19/2021,stocks,I am now on Mexico and bothe my Robinhood account and my Merrill account work fine through a VPN
03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/19/2021,stocks,"Oh for real? It’s been 5-6 years since I’ve been out of the country, last time it was a real bitch to let my card get unrestricted. Thanks"
03/19/2021,stocks,Thank you I will get on that
03/19/2021,stocks,"Also, I write down a couple of my backup two factor authentication codes onto a card and hide it somewhere separately from the rest of my stuff (e.g., on my body when traveling with luggage, in my hotel while traveling around). I had my phone stolen once while traveling and I couldn't get into my accounts without my phone as the second authenticating factor (no sms, no authenticator app)."
03/19/2021,stocks,Bet
03/19/2021,stocks,"Your calculations look correct on the top and low end. If it closes on that date between $195 and $300, you're out the $800.

Otherwise, what you're missing is waiting nearly two years to collect any gains.

Personally, I'd consider selling a near the money call for the June 2022 expiration. The $230 call is going for around $50. I could collect $40k now and either have the shares in a year if it closes below $230 or collect another $184,000 should it close above. I prefer the money now and still take advantage of capital gains for 2022 tax return. 

I may even go ITM and pull out $200/share now by selling the $40. Long term gains would still apply if I let it expire."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've just now started to notice things on Walmart's website are cheaper on Amazon. Looking up car seats and I was kind of shocked. Same models, but Walmart was $20-$30 cheaper. 

It's going to be interesting to see how Amazon vs Walmart plays out."
03/19/2021,stocks,Walmart should be smashing amazon but cares more shareholder cash grabs. SMH
03/19/2021,stocks,"I dont see walmart winning unless they start building order warehouses like amazon. Going to physical stores is going to be gone in 100 years. The question is, who will have the existing infrastructure in 20 years when the tide starts to turn?

Truth be told, it wont matter in our lifetime but the answer is to have the ability to get fresh perishable food delivered to your home by autonomous vehicle that was also picked and packed by autonomous warehouses. Kroger has the right idea with Ocada.

Stock wise, I'd go WMT. Seems like a lot more room to grow."
03/19/2021,stocks,Quad witching could be the reasoning
03/19/2021,stocks,"🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️🧙‍♀️

Quadruple witching. Lots of options expire today."
03/19/2021,stocks,DIS lost 1.2% in the last minute of trading
03/19/2021,stocks,"Closing out trades for the day?

I open weekly positions on Monday open and close around Friday close."
03/19/2021,stocks,I think it’s market on close
03/19/2021,stocks,"FANG lost 3.5% in the last few minutes.  Still thinking about an after hours trade but they move with oil prices.  Seen lots of volume spikes, but that size drop is unusual."
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s day traders closing out
03/19/2021,stocks,Triple Witching
03/19/2021,stocks,"That’s a massive order.

I follow a couple of print tickers, and it said that this a transaction worth $166,268,027.84"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Its Quadruple Witching today. There are some great podcast episodes on Market Makers delta hedging, price pinning, gamma, etc."
03/19/2021,stocks,Would be interesting to see if the market gaps open
03/19/2021,stocks,What stocks are you referring to that went up 50x? I bought into travel and entertainment and I’m only up about 2x or 3x.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Next major economic collapse or recession, I'll treat as a major sale and load up."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Don't beat yourself up about missed gains, it's pointless. Learn from your experience as an investor and use that knowledge to improve your future returns."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Last year was my best actually. It helps if you've been through a major panic atleast once. I lived through 2008 as I started in 2005 so that set you up for the rest of your life. The only difference since then has been that Federal Reserve intervention has been much faster so you now have less time to take advantage of mass panic compared to 2008 which a drawn out affair into early 2009. Also this time unlike previous market panic, the federal government got heavily involved through Fiscal intervention.

I have a low 7 figure portofolio so I was a little worried if it would be cut in half like 2008 but in 2008, I just had a low 6 figure portfolio  so it was bearable. I started restructuring my portfolio by selling questionable balance sheet companies and companies that would clearly be affected by travel, country ETFs, sector ETFs, bond funds etc. Raised some 500K all in all and then started scaling into long term quality and some growth

Some of my best returns have been during mass panic like Dec 24 2018 and last year. I was trying to get redditors to invest during those times and searching through some old posts to see how I reacted and I found some of these recommendations based on what I had bought:

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fh9jhl/anyone_else_thinking_enough_is_enough_i_mean_the/fk9smb4/

>>Nah, not even thinking about it's effect on the stock market at this point. Retirement accounts are DCAing every week and I've raised a lot of cash from my brokerages last week and this week to buy some quality for a once in a blue moon opportunity. So much fear going around it's hard to pass up if you have a long term view. Ready for another -20% drop. Have a Kovid19 watchlist ready and have started scaling in at every major drop. Assuming that we'll reach peak Kovid19 by summer, economic impacts felt all way into Thanks giving and Christmas shopping season and business as usual by this time next year.
>>yeah, they are assumptions but it's safe to assume we will reach peak Kovid19 at some point. Then the question is how long the downturn would last... all over by Christmas season? effects felt all the way into next summer? triggers a decade of stagflation and NIRP? who knows. I can afford to take the risk. Will be a buyer at different levels while the stock market goes through a rout.

>>Tech: GOOG, MSFT, ADBE, TEAM, FB, NOW, CTXS, DOCU

>>Financials: V, MA, AXP, JPM, PYPL

>>Don't really need a subscription to Motley Fool to make money during this bull market but hey, if that makes you feel confident ...okie dokie.

>>There were a lot of names that looked very attractive during Pandemic panic ... just a whole bunch that I had a watchlist but just couldn't end up buying all. I sent the below list to someone else a while ago after being asked through a DM about what I hold. All these have had quite the run up since March so I'm not a buyer at these levels since I already have large stakes in them:

>> • Growth/Cloud tech

>>They look very overvalued now and they are priced at many multiples of revenue and currently don't make a profit but they are growing fast. So basically you are buying fast growing companies that are increasing revenue but generating operating losses every quarter and net income is also negative. These are smaller companies that would have been small cap or mid cap but they got bumped into the large cap segment only because their share prices have ballooned like crazy. Keep an eye on them.

>> Fastly (FSLY)

>> Twilio (TWLO)

>> CloudFlare (NET)

>> • Remote infrastructure & platform as a service/cloud

>> Shopify (SHOP)

>> Citrix (CTXS)

>> Adobe (ADBE)

>>VMWare (VMW)

>>Mature companies with lines of business in providing Cloud services

>>AMZN

>>MSFT

>>IBM

>>Google

>>Data Center Infrastructure:
>>Digital Reality (DLR)

Bought WBA in September at the exact bottom though I was planning to buy a lot more lower but that has done really far better than expected on the rebound. I was expecting a buyout but looks like that didn't happen

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/itanf6/why_havent_highdividend_stocks_recovered_like_the/g5dhecp/

>>I had some cash...so i put 20k of it into Walgreens at 34 when WBA was valued at 30B. In normal times I would never look at a crappy company like Walgreens but at some point with so much cash floating around looking for value, there has to be an oppertunity here. I'm expecting it to get privatized or bought this year after KKR passed up a leveraged buyout discussion last year when it was valued at 55B (with ~17B debt) as that was a very costly transaction they had no appetite for. KKR has had a close relationship with Walgreens for years so they seemed like the most likely candidate. Also the largest individual shareholder Stefanno Passina has a ~16% stake in the company so there were rumors that he wanted to privatize it too. They will have a lot of flexibility at cutting costs once they are privatized. It's valued at 30B now way below the 55B it was valued at when talks about privatization were public last year. Badly managed company with a large retail footprint, good balance sheet and earnings hammered due to impact from Covid19 and not adapting to competition and technology changes in the landscape. Sales are stable or growing very slowly. Forward PE of 7x. Earnings are expected to trend up late next year after cost cutting measures are implemented. You have to expect more sales once covid19 is behind us even if it means next year."
03/19/2021,stocks,This probably won’t help but I did exactly what you hindsight wish you did. I leveraged myself up the wazoo during March/April. While it helped my net worth it also resulted in a significant about of stress during the summer and early autumn. Margin calls aren’t fun.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nobody was expecting JPow to turn on the printers for months which really helped things along.

Some companies (looking at you AMC) are worth more than before COVID despite zero revenue for a year so it will be interesting to see if they can hold their gains."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've been cringing the last month seeing my AMC shares still there with a 60% drop in value... it was a roll-the-dice move that I regretted pretty much instantly.  Thankfully it climbed enough yesterday to where I could sell at a 8% profit.    
Even if GME and AMC rocket up to insane heights, I'm really relieved to have that monkey off my back."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Not really. Losing money hurts more than merely potentially getting it. Positions played:

TSLA
NKLA
RMG

Missed: PENN, CROC (mainly because I didn’t know those funky slippers were public traded.)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"No I don't cringe. Maybe because I was saving up cash for down payment on a house and renovation so I didn't have much cash to invest in March 2020, but even if I did, I learned to move on quickly.

It would be a different story if I had lost money, but I still had my gains, and to me that matters more than missing an 'opportunity' to 5x my investment."
03/19/2021,stocks,I'm was glad to go deep into oil ETFs until tax season rolled around. Who knew Section 1256 partnerships could be so complicated?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but if you had banked on those you'd be telling yourself ""damn, I'm one smart mofo and I'm sure glad I  bought those covid stocks"".  The market is a gamble no matter what stock you buy.  All it takes is good or bad news to drive it one way or the other.

This is not advice coming from someone that bought  a $75 June 2021 call on PLUG  back in November that cost $2000.  I think I've lost around $1900 on it to date.  But, who knows maybe the stock will go to $75+ by June?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"two things:

- missed gains is a whole lot of a better than potential losses

- if I could have the knowledge that I have now I’d be a fucking millionaire, hindsight is 20/20 

Too bad I’m on the buy high sell low gang for life, but I’ll get my chance next economic recessions where i won’t get in and will try to time the market and inevitably miss the bottom"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I bought oil stocks when they dipped and held for like 9 months, sold off before they went up like crazy a month or so ago. Feels good man"
03/19/2021,stocks,I picked up airline stocks and haven’t had any regrets as far as that’s concerned. I’m however kicking myself I didn’t pick up more! Live and learn.
03/19/2021,stocks,You will learn more asking people what they did during the crash. Those are the tougher decisions imo.
03/19/2021,stocks,"if you would have never realized that you missed out, you wouldn't have been given this opportunity to learn from it. bob ross and his happy accidents

&#x200B;

edit: i'm in the same boat. i blew $7k on gifted twitch subs this pandemic. imagine i had put that $7k in the market. it's not something to hold myself ransom to, it's an opportunity to be gentle to myself and accept that yeah i could have made a better choice, it's ok."
03/19/2021,stocks,"If I had a time machine I would throw everything I had and my kitchen sink on the way down a year ago, then play it all the way back up."
03/19/2021,stocks,Not really. I just kept contributing to my 401k every paycheck and my Roth when I could. I’m up 30% from last year.
03/19/2021,stocks,I got into investing during the first lockdown. I had no job but like 20k € savings. Mistake after mistake later I lost 10k and missed out on opportunities to cash out for over 50k (GME etc etc).. now a year later...I have learnt shit loads and am juuuust about to make back the 10k I lost. I have had 5 different jobs this year..it's been a fucking ride
03/19/2021,stocks,"I have a minimum amount per month that I try to invest, when I can I try to beat it. I follow the news, but that monthly investment is going in regardless. I took a chance and bought Amazon at the start of the shutdown and Disney before it and they worked out well, but most of my money goes into index funds. Losses in my individual stocks don't bother me as much."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Hey OP I hear you. I actually started investing in March 2020 after the colossal dip. My very first trade was EVRI. I'm up 605% on it, but I only put in like $400. I still kick myself for not going in a LOT more. But I try to absorb all of it as a learning experience too. Who knows what the future holds?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but mostly because I had to sell a bunch to pay rent"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I was waiting for the crash for about 2 years, so I could finally deploy. When it happened it suddenly stopped and I was not satisfied. So I waited one more year for it to continue. After all, the world economy burned. Surely, any day now, this ridiculous fed policy will backfire and... Nope. So I finally deployed at the all-time high. What can possibly go wrong?"
03/19/2021,stocks,""" beg, borrow, or steal every single dollar I could get my hands on and slam it into the market.""

I took out a loan (3.8%) on my paid off house. While waiting for the paperwork to go through, I found a few friends who were willing to accept a 5% gift (didn't want to call it ""interest"" gains, for the sake of taxes) in return for a 45-day loan in the meantime. I had never traded on the stock market before, and I was in middle of completing my finance degree and digging into all the numbers as the world went to hell.

Before investing the first dollar, I carved out 12 months of payments and put it into a new savings acct that direct-deposited the loan payments. There's two months of payments left in that account, and my brokerage acct is now 2.5x the outstanding balance on the loan.

I'm in no rush to pay it off. I may just cash out my position in BABA to get me through the end of the year."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Bought Boeing. In July.

 ++ 25% now and many airplane crashes / engine failure"
03/19/2021,stocks,I cringe that I didn't buy more when stocks were down a year ago.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yea op is high, 3x is a fantastic return for those of us who really lucked out"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Wayfair would’ve been a good one, ugh. Seems almost as “obvious” as Zoom"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Same here, took a gamble on some good airlines and doubled my money (and then slme). Still kept most of safe ETFs cause shit happens"
03/19/2021,stocks,"There were some esp. brick and mortar retailers that went absolutely parabolic like KIRK, TUP, and OSTK. Plenty of 5x stocks too like TLRY and PLAY. It wasn't easy to see these 1000-2000% gains coming though."
03/19/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/19/2021,stocks,"Those come around about every 10-15 years, but definitely keep your eyes open. I don't think we will see a COVID style dip for a LOOONG time."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Every time it's worse than before and different than before so it takes real stones to dive in at that time. One thing to hold, another to go max out a HELOC and buy."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Great post, thank you"
03/19/2021,stocks,">Nobody was expecting ~~JPow~~ any chairman for the last 20 years to turn on the printers for ~~months~~ years

FTFY.

Also still holding some AMC. Hoping it reaches my last buy point to at least get out with bleeding much."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Haha, oh yes AMC! I sold 400 shares at the peak then like an idiot bought 40 more right at the $14.xx peak. Not great decision making skills on that one :("
03/19/2021,stocks,">CROC

Wow, 8x return on CROX just standard stock purchases. Apparently the Croc haters have only succeeded in getting more people to buy those goofy things."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Same. Although after house secured, threw 5k at NKLA at $33 and it spiked to $90 at market open the next day. Paid for entire new flooring lol"
03/19/2021,stocks,But you don't
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would be perfectly fine even with a Gary Hobson setup, just get tomorrow's newspaper today."
03/19/2021,stocks,Glad to hear you are digging out :)
03/19/2021,stocks,It's also easy to forget the fear and panic that enveloped the country after the 1st announcements. People were thinking 6+ million Americans would die and such. It was also very easy to panic and try to hold onto every dime not knowing what the future landscape post-COVID would look like.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Plane crash in January and market crash in March. I don't hold Boeing, but have friends that bought at sub $100. That must feel amazing."
03/19/2021,stocks,Kirk and Tup good examples. Thanks.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Screw fundamentals, learn TA. Buy at support. Always.   


Fundamentals told us not to buy travel/entertainment at the beginning of the pandemic cause so many companies had their revenues screwed for the year. Stocks are only indirectly correlated with company fundamentals, I'll argue with anyone on this. Stocks are directly correlated with public *sentiment* about the company fundamentals.   


Buy at support and set a stoploss. If there is any real value to the company, that's where big money and smart money is buying at. If the company is not legit, you get stopped out below support. If the company is legit, the news always comes out *after* smart money has bought at support. By that time you're buying in the middle of the ramp up, which is precarious and emotional. Take profits at resistance. 

If I had used TA last march it would have been easier to be confident set buy orders at each support level. I would have been stopped out maybe 2 or 3 times because you don't know which support level is the bottom. lose maybe 1-3% of your account each time. But at some point support holds cause big/smart money has also decided to buy at that level.

Like you I lost a lot of sleep thinking about all the money I could have made last year. But screw that, if you can do some basic TA, you can make money in any market."
03/19/2021,stocks,Wrong
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right but what was the narrative during the panic of March? Retail stores are dead, it's only online shopping from now on, get out of those old economy stocks while you can.

Same with others - flying will never be the same (Buffet's words), oil is dead, traditional banks are dead, etc. Too much FUD in the news and social media that of course turned out to be complete BS.

But at the time it was easy to follow the herd and sit in cash until May or June waiting for a double dip because that's what most crashes were like in the past."
03/19/2021,stocks,Nope but if it does happen I'll know what to do.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Well, we did see a 30-50% pullback in high-growth stocks just a few weeks ago. They're still expensive depending on how you value them but if you bet on future growth, they were a buy. The point is these dips or sector rotation can happen throughout the year"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you listen to this sub we're going to have crashes every week, so load up"
03/19/2021,stocks,Famous last words...
03/19/2021,stocks,I think we are going to see one soon in 1-2 years with fed printing money
03/19/2021,stocks,"Take it as a learning lesson. This is a good opportunity to look for values since we are in a transition period from COVID to recovery, so there is still lots of movement between sectors in the market, and investors aren't quite settled in yet."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Some of those decisions just became ""long game"" stocks. I have 1 share of GME left that I would like to get a physical copy and hang it on my wall to remind me not to be an idiot."
03/19/2021,stocks,"From my vantage point, you’re a financial wizard.  I managed to buy at $17.25"
03/19/2021,stocks,They are comfy to wear at home when you don’t have to worry about people seeing you
03/19/2021,stocks,Doesn’t mean he won’t find one
03/19/2021,stocks,That’s exactly what someone with a time machine would ***WANT*** you to think 👀
03/19/2021,stocks,Same but ohh maan the cringeee
03/19/2021,stocks,"100% agree with you. I think you hit it right on the mark. I always wanted to begin investing (I've always had an IRA but wanted something a tad sexier) and was so lost in the uncertainty of the situation we were going through. At the end of the day, all I can say is I'm just glad I'm not holding a bag right now, and that's enough for me to be optimistic regardless of a 'what-could-have-been' situation for me."
03/19/2021,stocks,Dead on.  It is all TA.  Fundamentals take a huge back seat.  Buy at htf support within the current trend with a stop loss below the level that needs to hold to create a higher low.
03/19/2021,stocks,"You say that, but the catalyst for the next dip may look too terrifying. That's why the market dips.

In this case because a killer plague was dropping across the globe and looking to wipe out 5-10% of humanity. In hindsight it wasn't so bad, which made this a great buying opportunity if you took the other side. Who knows what the next black Swan will be, and if it is worse than the market predicts?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Next 6 months.
03/19/2021,stocks,"That is a very real possibility. Main concern if its obliterates market prices, the additional effects and system failures that would go along with it in society might make any stock gains seem rather meaningless."
03/19/2021,stocks,"> when you don’t have to worry about people seeing you

From the hate messages about Crocs, you would assume they must be illegal in certain states as well."
03/19/2021,stocks,">but the catalyst for the next dip may look too terrifying.

That's completely true. A scenario like Sum of All Fears, or something similar, would make market dips of 95+% overnight a real possibility and stocks might be worthless in the post aftermath world. I hope beyond anything we never see a ""dip"" like that :("
03/19/2021,stocks,"He says ""it wasn't so bad..."" 🤣"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Compared to what it could have been, the numbers are not as bad. 

That said, the market could have dipped down again at any point had it gotten worse (eg mutations) so you never know."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Correct, it wasn't so bad if you lived in a sane country that locked down early and enforced masks. My state had about 110 cases and 2 deaths... we haven't had to wear masks or socially isolate since June or July."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Jaja for sure. For a while I was expecting zombies so yeah, could have been a lot worse, or better."
03/19/2021,stocks,Dang lucky you! I wonder if it was not so bad for the rest?
03/19/2021,stocks,"It wasn't luck, just following health advice. And yes, most of the surrounding states and countries in Oceania did very well combating the virus with minimal loss of life."
03/19/2021,stocks,"What are you accused of doin?
Are you suspected of money laundering or being a terrorist?
Too many failed deposits?

03/19/2021,stocks,"I had a fairly big paper loss in QCOM for three years and ended up in a good spot, but I had a good reason to hold and buy more.  

Seriously,  I haven't paid much attention to NVDA, but why in the world do you expect it to go higher? It trippled in a bit over six months,  it has a PE of 75!  It's dividend is miniscule.

QCOM was paying me 5%.  They had governments questioning their licensing of their IP, AAPL took them to court and hadn't paid them for two years.   My thought was that even if they lost, it would be a pain to renegotiate all their deals, but they still owned the IP, they still had 5G tech coming,  and did I mention that they were paying me 5%?  I bought more as it fell and trippled my investment.   

That's not where you are with NVDA.  Other than a general feeling that you like the stock,  or it makes good products,  or it's been going up a lot in a raging bull market with all the momentum people piling in,  do you have a reason that it is going to go up?  Do you expect their earnings to triple next year?  Does a giant company owe them two billion dollars that hasn't been paid,  but will with intrest?  Do they have a new product line that isn't going to cannibalize what their selling now?  

Think hard, I haven't looked,  but unless there is a reason for it to go higher it's just as likely to be back down to where it was in June."

So it does happen...

But on that same note, when I heard about 23andme going public, I bought into VGAC at $14.80, then bought some more at $15.40.

03/19/2021,stocks,AAPL is not blue chip
03/19/2021,stocks,"I agree with all the posters who recommend a low fee passive index fund.   You rarely if ever want to put all your money into a single stock.   The basic reason is that there are very low probability things that could go wrong and you'd lose all your money and humans don't properly evaluate risks for low probability events (black swans or long tail risk are the  buzzwords).

Low fee passive index funds are great,  if you want to see,  keep a little out (<$1000) and see how you do picking stocks,  sure,  put 1K in AAPL, or whatever.   After a year,  see how you did compared to your VOO or whatever.   If you are ""beating the market "", then sell 10% of your VOO and buy something else.   If you're good, you might be able to get higher returns,  but most don't consistently.  If you are though,  you want a diversity of about 25 stocks because you'll usually have one or two that surprise you by going up a lot more than you expected to counteract the one or two that drop for reasons you don't understand. 

For example, since February AAPL has gone from $140 to $120, while VOO is up in that same time frame,  AAPL has run up a lot faster in the last year,  but drops faster too.  OBTW,  VOO is market cap weighted so about 6% of VOO is AAPL anyway."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I am a strong advocate of an 8 to 20 stock portfolio with good diversity.  Look at p/e ratios, look at projected growth metrics for the businesses, consider market dynamics and social factors.  I for one firmly believe we will never give up our electronics and semi-conductors so I am and remain heavier in tech (long-term holder).  With that said, I hold 1 bank (just got out of a second), 2 industrials, 2 consumer, 1 fin-tech, 3 semi/semi equipment, 2 mega tech, and a few other positions that should grow market and have acceptable p/e ratios, all to help keep diversity in my portfolio.  I like to hold about 80% of my portfolio in solid/seasoned companies that should grow 10-20% per year and then speculate with about 10% of my portfolio (space, ev, SPACs, arkg, etc.) always leaving me free cash to invest on downturns."

That is just bad investing. Yes, diversifying your portfolio is important, but there is a such thing as over-diversifying. This is that example. If you had 10-20k for investing I would put at least 1k into each company. 300 dollars is gonna get you a couple shares of each company AT MOST. That’s way too diversified when you’re working with 10-20k."

03/19/2021,stocks,Ppl confuse dca with investing when they get their paycheck.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I literally just posted the info below on another thread but it is relevant here. I made a big mistake keeping a lot of cash out before covid crash happened but never actually putting it back into the market at the bottom. I kept waiting for the next ""covid variant"" to kill the momentum, etc. When January rolled around I realized I just flat out missed out and here I am. I am hesitant as ever to just stick the entire sum into the market right now so I committed to the idea of DCA. At some point it will pay off. 

I am trying to put a good chunk of money into the market and I have been picking anything with a ""fair value"" and buying 20 to 30 percent of my position depending on my confidence level. For instance, if I want in on AMD but it is an overheated sector then I am a bit bearish in price over the next few months. Of course I could be wrong. Let's say I want to have 3 percent of my portfolio (let's just say that would be $1000 for example) in this position but for starters I am going with 20 percent.... $200. I buy 3 shares @ $80/ea for $240.

I will then wait for a pullback of over 5 percent below my last purchase price. Higher depending on how volatile the stock is. Let's say I purchase an additional 5 shares every time it drops 8% below my last purchase price for AMD. This is a really conservative example and could be done with a number of different ratios. I just don't want to get burned in a sell off everyone keeps talking about so I am treading lightly on my positions. It also can drop 5 percent in a single day without much trouble recently. My ""bottom"" for this would be back to pre-covid levels which would be a really severe sell off and almost completely unlikely.

3 shares @ $80 - $240  
3 shares @ $73.60 - $220.8  
3 shares @ $67.71 - $203.13  
3 shares @ $62.29 - $186.87  
3 shares @ $57.31 - $171.93

Total position - $1,022.73

Cost basis - 15 shares @ $68.18/ea

Obviously this is a bit rough when the price is only $57 and you have a $68 cost basis but this would be worst case scenario. You also didn't over leverage yourself into a single position and were able to ride the price down roughly 30 percent over possibly a couple of months. On the flip side if the price goes up... and up... and up.... you only have $200 in and wanted $1000. I personally say ""oh well"" and wait for a serious pull back in the future but I won't chase the price up. I will be content with my small position and put money into a different company.

I am a bit more bearish about the rest of 2021 so this is my strategy getting into new positions. I will go with 30+ percent on my opening position if I really believe in the company regardless of share price. Hopefully I am wrong and I have a bunch of small positions doing really well!

This was never practical when there were $6 fees for every transaction!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Research suggests that lump sum outperforms, but most of us are forced to DCA due to the nature of work and pay cycles."
03/19/2021,stocks,Dca is good not because it beats lump sum but because it helps people deal with the emotions of lump summing and instantly seeing it drop after. Those people might get demotivated from that and give up on the market. If you dont care about any of that must lump sum in and hold. If you know you are vulnerable use DCA. It will counter the emotion.
03/19/2021,stocks,Not necessarily.  You are thinking of lump sum investing as having all of your money in now but also it can mean leaving it on the sidelines trying to time when to put it in.  DCA can also mean just putting a little in each month as it become available rather than waiting until you have enough to buy your whole position at once.  However I agree that the idea of buying only a part of your position now and then DCA vs putting it all in now if you can afford to would be in conflict and I would go for the lump sum now in that case.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Youre assuming people are investing with lump sum savings or some fixed amount, youre not accounting for future buying power. DCA is just buying dips when you have the cash and the price is below your average cost. It doesnt mean hold on to the money and wait for dips; in fact there was a study where one investor invested the same amount each week for 10 years into an index fund without looking at price, that person beat the other investors who waited to buy and who more actively managed their holdings. Its not wrong to hold cash, it can be much more profitable, but if youre going long on something, who really cares? So long as the deposits continue and youre investing consistently 🤷‍♂️"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’ve been umming and ahhing about what to do personally. 

I have a decent lump sum that I want to put in SPY, VOO and IVV and potentially very small positions in ARKK and maybe a couple of others like QQQ or VTI but I keep thinking we’re due a decent correction so if I DCA and invest it over the next 12 weeks then that’s a good idea but only would work better if there was a decent sized  correction coming.

I put the first lot in today but still tempted to just put the rest in in one go. Really not sure in this current market state."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Just FYI, SPY VOO and IVV are the exact same, you only need 1 of them in your portfolio. All three also have ~80% overlap with VTI."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah someone posted the overlap website which is pretty handy. More research for me it is!
03/19/2021,stocks,"For retirement think on VTI and VXUS for us and international exposure. 60/ 30

The rest can be bonds, industry ETFs, and any long term stocks"
03/19/2021,stocks,The notion isn't that the stock market has nothing to do with the economy.  It is that the stock market is disconnected from the economy.  This is because the stock market is trading on what it believes the future of the economy is going to be.  This is why we were at all time highs with double digit unemployment last year.  Based solely on the economy the stock market should have been down last year but it wasn't because the signs were there that the economy was going to improve.  People who are losing their jobs and can't find work and still see businesses shut down or at limited capacity have a hard time reconciling that fact with the one that the market is also making new highs.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nobody is saying they're unrelated. You're twisting the quote. The actual quote is ""the stock market is not the economy."" *That* is true."
03/19/2021,stocks,"“The stock market has nothing to do with the economy.”
Nothing?  Says who?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you’re not missing a thing. The overall economy is very intertwined with the stock market. Basic micro and macro Econ 101. Why is it when unemployment is high, inflationary concerns, large funds and investors move money into more stable and investments (treasury bonds) when available? 

The stock market can have an inverse relationship with the economy it’s still a relationship nonetheless.

Edit: The stock market is part of our economy. Corporate taxation, employment within those sectors, income tax revenue of employees. Whoever said the market and economy is separate, don’t listen to them, they don’t understand lots of the variables at play. For every cause there is an effect, for every effect, there was something that caused it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The stock market has everything to do with the economy. they are inherently linked. 

What most people don't understand is how to actually analyze the economy and how you can't really just sum it up in one or two key metrics and call it good or bad. It is a myriad of things. 

we can use the pandemic as an example:

Looking naively at the unemployment charts, last spring we spiked with shutdowns all the way to a crazy 14+%. then immediately started trending downward to now  about 6.9%. obviously not great but huge improvement. This figures point to a bad economy...

but then go take a look at tax revenues for 2020. they are up from 2019, actually up quite a bit, almost $300 billion nationwide. 2019 had 4% unemployment while the majority of 2020 ranged from basically 7% to 14%... how does that sync?

The WHO. only certain sectors absorbed the brunt of the unemployment, namely travel, some retail and food service. 

Aggregate numbers don't tell the story of how millions of good paying jobs kept on. they adapted and figure out how to work from home. It doesn't tell the story about how the pandemic opened new markets and exploded other sectors while some faltered. 

The economy is complex where people get tripped up is properly analyzing it and it's outcomes."
03/19/2021,stocks,"It’s because politicians always point to a bull market and claim they are good for the economy, and bear markets to claim their opponents are bad for the economy.

This leads most of the voters who don’t know much about markets or economics to think the stock market is the leading indicator of whether the economy is doing good, which it isn’t. This disconnect then causes people to overcorrect and make ridiculous statements like your title when what they mean is the stock market doesn’t represent the strength of the economy on the whole.

Tl;dr: ignorant people think the stock market is the economy, politicians play to this, “smart” people say “the stock market has nothing to do with the economy” when really what they should be saying is “the stock market is not an infallible indicator of a healthy economy”."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Look at GameStop. Sales have fallen 10 of the last 11 quarters, but the stock price is higher. I think in today’s world, the price of a stock is driven more by what someone is willing to pay for the stock, than the performance of the underlying business. There’s a lot of money out there trying to get a return - that would traditionally be in bonds - but bond yields being what they are, that money is now in stocks. Fixed supply of stocks (mostly fixed) more dollars (demand) chasing a return above inflation, leads to higher stock prices. 

22 million lost jobs since COVID, and The stock market has never been higher. Not trying to argue a point. I don’t get it either"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Speculation, hype and manipulation have nothing to do with the economy. Those have been the focus of media in recent months which, I believe, has influenced you to think this way"
03/19/2021,stocks,Didn't I tell you yesterday that it is not falling because of unemployment numbers
03/19/2021,stocks,"Long term GDP growth and long term S&P returns correlate exceeding well.  

Short term GDP growth and short term S&P returns hardly correlate at all."
03/19/2021,stocks,because new media is in pocket. Its all a legal scam to steal money from retail or accounts under 1 million
03/19/2021,stocks,"Also for those that are following the UWMC 👌 and RKT saga. Unemployment numbers were slightly higher, big money moved from speculative plays bond yields, BUT for the average Joe struggling with mortgage and refinancing, now it the perfect time to refinance or take out a mortgage (if needed) because the interest rates have not caught up yet. This will go on for a while longer until unemployment numbers drop and the FED can raise interest rates. They stated that short term inflation will probably not be a problem.

If there is any talk of rising interest rates I may pull out of mortgage stocks, but the rise may not be as impactful because 2-3% interest rate is still great imo. 

That’s just one example of gauging the economy to a invest in stocks. I’m still learning myself but know the players, know their game. Anyone who says the stock market operates independently from the economy is stupid."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Speculation! But where did the speculators get the capital to invest in the markets? The economy, which encompasses the stock market, provides that capital. It might not make sense but some services and business are built to thrive in times of despair. Think defense stocks. The country (US) can be tan to shit but the remaining GDP or issues debt will still protect our national defense industries. Everything doesn’t move in sync."
03/19/2021,stocks,Ok thanks.

03/19/2021,stocks,"All of this is routed in the bullshit that the economy you see today is the same one you saw in January 2020, when you could walk into a theatre and eat at a restaurant. 
Also at play is Republican propaganda that these stimulus packages will ruin the economy... because only Republicans are allowed to give stimulus.

The reality is that the economy can still fall off a cliff, there’s a real 3rd wave and a few virus strains that are not responding to vaccines, which means that this mess isn’t over.
There is still at least 7million people unemployed from 2019 high. 
There is rent and mortgage assistance, there are eviction moratoriums, and this is occurring the world around.

These assholes are literally looking at a Government supported economy and saying that things look great, so let’s make more money, while completely ignoring the massive amount of social assistance going on in the US and around the world (we’ll call these customers of the US).

So it’s literally punch a banker in the face month.  If you see some idiot going on about inflation, then punch them in the face.

Powell isn’t talking code. The economy stinks, it’ll take SOME TIME to get back to how things were.

All of these store price inflationary events are linked to cargo management problems due to poor management decisions at the onset of the pandemic. They laid off 30% of their workforce and then tried to automate some systems, and this backfired at the ports when demand went through the roof. They fell behind.  It’s the same level of stupidity as car company management, where they cancelled CPU contracts with a 2-year lead time, to save a few bucks, and then they were suddenly swamped by demand due to the move from cities to rural homes. They didn’t sell it like they made a stupid mistake though did they, they pissed and whined and framed it like a CPU shortage and made it political. 

Major economic reorganizations are always coupled with a recession. You simply can’t have everyone move into the suburbs at the same time without causing a loss of income in some sector of the economy (like downtown services). We’re also looking at huge deflationary events that are getting stronger.  Please point to a job that cannot be replaced by a computer or a robot, there are few remaining."

Maybe I misunderstand something but aren't bond yields really high right now due to the treasury auctions going really poorly so yields are high due to low demand since price and yield are inversely related.

03/19/2021,stocks,There is no way to see what you are saying without knowing how much you have actually invested and how old you are now.  Also you should be contributing more money each year not just one lump sum once.  But the fact that you think 11% a year gains isn't a lot is silly.  If it was as easy as you think it should be no one would ever have to work.
03/19/2021,stocks,"It's a symptom of low capital, not a symptom of poor returns on index funds. A simple index returns the average market return, it's not going to provide you a tenbagger on your 1000 dollar investment.

03/19/2021,stocks,Lol I think Wall Street bets was created upon a conclusion similar to this one
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you have $10,000 right now and commit to investing another $10,000 every year, in 10 years you will have $200k assuming 10% return. S&P historically has higher return but let’s say 10%.  

If you assume 5% return, you will have $150k. 

With 1% you will get to not quote $120k (savings account)

So it makes a huge difference compared to savings/cash.

Hopefully you can save more than $10k as you get older and hopefully get a better job. 401k max is $19.5k and then you can stash another $6k in an Ira. So that’s $25.5k/yr. 

If you start today with $10k, invest $25k/yr for 25 years at 10% average return, you will be sitting at almost $3m. 

It all works out but obviously you need to save a lot too."

What exactly are you expecting to retire with?  1 Million is honestly pretty good and better than most end up with at the end.  Nobody wants to be a wage slave but that is life so suck it up or change careers if you hate it so much.  You should be investing a lot more than you are in my opinion or adjust your expectations

03/19/2021,stocks,"After reading through the responses i only have to add: if it's retirement security that concerns you, and your time horizon is long enough, you could try finding a public sector job that still offers a pension. Pay is generally lower and you'll most likely feel that ""wage slave"" feeling intensely, but with enough years of service you will have your living expenses taken care of after you retire through the pension, and your investment income whatever it is will be on top of that. 

I don't know your personal situation but a partner with a similar outlook to you can be helpful as well - not only to split living costs but to perhaps provide value to your life beyond dollar net worth :)

If the issue is that you feel you should end up wealthier after a lifetime of work, well, that's the fate of those of us that weren't born with money or luck..."

My friend is a FA for a major company. He gets a certain % of what customers pay. So if customers pay 1.5%, he gets let’s say half, so .75%. 

But if he puts his clients in an index fund, he doesn’t get .75%. He gets much less because the company gets kickbacks from expensive funds and they push their FAs to allocate clients into them. 

So he himself is sitting in index funds. But he can’t put his clients in them because he doesn’t want to lose income."

03/19/2021,stocks,"If you are making 110K when you are 30 you should be able to invest more than just 6K a year.

i mean how much you contribute really depends on your personal situation- goals, income etc. 

investment calcs where you start from 0, or aren't looking super long term aren't going to look too appetizing.  if you were say starting from 50k and contributing 6k a year, or starting from 0 and have a 20 or 30 year timeframe then youll really start to see growth rack up more.

if you are only 10-15 years from retiring youll want to be investing a lot more aggressively, definitely aiming to cap out your tax advantaged accounts. if you are young then you want to consider more than 10 year timeframes for retirement etc.

you also again want to focus on maximizing earning potential. if you were to say invest 20-40k of that getting a degree that lets you earn 70-120k out of college and grow to 150k-200k+ over the next 5-10 years thatll net you huge returns far far faster than an index fund would."
03/19/2021,stocks,Ill definitely go for it - will never settle with wage slaving - 30 fuckin years - my whole energetic middle life given away for 3 millions when Im old and CANT DO SHIT ANYMORE
03/19/2021,stocks,dude okay say I double contribution - 200K in 10 years - still what kinda shit is this - some guy is making that right now with a stupid YOLO play and has just gotten 10 years ahead of me - this cant be
03/19/2021,stocks,">some guy is making that right now with a stupid YOLO play and has just gotten 10 years ahead of me - this cant be

you are risking basically nothing by investing in an index with a long term outlook.

he is risking a shit load of money on options or extremely low value stocks that could easily be worthless."
03/19/2021,stocks,Or that yolo play (or worse yet the next one after that)  loses him money and he wage slaves for 50 more years.
03/19/2021,stocks,I know hes risking it - but is he not deeming himself worthy of winning it all by doing so? - I dont want to wage slave 30 years - I just cant - after doing the math... what I get with indexing is just not enough.. I was always rootin for indexing.. but these years I have to give when I know I could erase all the waiting time with a good play - I guess I have to try
03/19/2021,stocks,"yeah or it doesnt and it doubles again - can go both ways 

and Id rather be him than being 60 with a lousy million and no life left"
03/19/2021,stocks,"what do you mean by worthy?

>I dont want to wage slave 30 years 

ok so find a job you like. or, work your ass off for 5 - 10 years and save and invest aggressively. you can retire by 30-35 as a high earner. you could retire earlier than that if you wanted to live VLCOL or move to a poor country. you can probably scrape by on 25-30k a year if you were to live very frugally, which realistically only requires 500k to continue to grow the overall investment. or, way way less in a poor country. 




Or, better yet find something you like doing and do that or half retire.

like say you work from 22 to 35 starting at 70k and retiring at 200k. instead of retiring at 40 you just half retire and do contracting at 10-30 hours a week avgd over the year, enough to leave the money saved from 22-40 untouched and grow while still paying your living expenses and maybe still paying down a mortgage or capping ira contributions. 


if your job is wage slaving then yeah, find something better."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Think of it like this:
You are walking up a steep hill and move at a pace of 10 steps up, 3 steps back. you have a friend that stays 5 steps behind you at all times as you go up to make sure you don’t fall, but as you go down 3 steps your friend doesn’t move until you get back to that 5 step distance. So you are continuing to walk at that pace until you slip on a rock and now you fall 5 steps back and your friend is there to catch you. That is how a trailing stop works.
So basically, as you go up the stop moves, but as you go down the stop stays still in case things get bad."
03/19/2021,stocks,"A trailing stop essentially has a ""following"" threshold that follows the price of the stock below(sell)/above(buy) by the set amount(% or $)... but the threshold will not go down(sell)/up(buy).

So say your sell trailing stop is 5$ and the stock is 100.

This means that it will sell if the stock drops below 95$. If the stock goes to 110$ then it will sell if the stock drops 110$-5$ = 105$. If it goes to 200$ then it will sell at 195$. 

So basically you will loose 5$ whatever the stock does because if it was 200$ you could have sold it at 200$ but it got sold automatically at 195$. 

This is good if you want to ""lock in"" your gains. You won't get the maximum theoretical gains but you can at least lock them in. 

Buy work exactly the same except everything is mirrored.  If you put in a buy trailing stop of 5$ then the threshold is always 5$ above the stock price and if it goes up past the threshold you'll buy before it gets any higher.

Think of the trailing stop as a sort of ""automated"" of what you do. As you monitor the price you will say if it goes down below 5$(or whatever) I'll sell it but as the stock guys up in price you keep saying this. 

&#x200B;

The math is basically, for a sell, ""if Last Maximum Price - Threshold Price > Price then sell""

The idea is very simple, you want to sell when the stock reaches it's maximum price(that maximizes your returns). The problem is that a stock fluctuates quite a bit so you can't just set the limit to what you think the max is because it will almost surely sell off immediately(that would be a limit order). So you allow some ""cushion"" for the stock to vary. If you set the threshold to low, say 1% and the stock is jumping 2% around as it goes up then you'll sell the stock before you can recognize the gains. The downside is that you limit your profits because you lose the threshold. E.g., if you set a 1% threshold then you will lose 1% of the max profits. (this isn't a huge deal because you can never predict the max)

&#x200B;

The real problem is that in volatility  you can lose a lot more than than it looks. I set a trailing stop at 380$ for 360$ for GME and people sold off and I ended up with 317$. I didn't get the 360$. The reason is the shorters sold off so much so quick that the price dropped too fast to trigger the sell in time. By the time the brokerage got to my order the price dropped from 380$ to 317$. That is a significant loss of profit. This is why HF's pay to get their orders taken care of first so they don't have these problems. It's also why they do these short attacks so they can make people lose money this way."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Trailing buy does essentially work opposite to trailing sell, yes. With a buy, your stop line is above the current price (as opposed to below with a trailing sell.)

Stock goes from 100 to 105. Buy executes.

Stock goes from 100 to 90: 5% trailing buy moves down to 90x1.05 = 94.5. Stock moved up to 94.5, buy executes

Edit: And of course remember that your order executes at market price. So no guarantees on what you’ll buy at once the condition is met. But unless it’s stupid volatile, prob not an issue."
03/19/2021,stocks,What about a limit offset order with trailing stop? Does a offset limit stop it from buying higher than what I want it to be? For example stock is $100 and I put the offset limit to be $101 and the trailing stop at 5%. Stock goes up to $120 but it wont execute the order because the offset limit is $101. Is that how that works?

Take 6 months to read books and Reddit post and then decide if you want to do something else, like individual stocks.

Also, you can open paper trading account with nearly any broker and play with individual stocks using paper money, but only use the money that you actually can invest in next 1-2 year, that would give you very good picture of stock market and future earnings."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right off the bat you chose way too many things.

Stock picking is when you actually pick something. If you don’t have conviction on a particular stock or three then don’t stock pick at all. You’ll never match the diversification and overall risk/reward payout of mathematically diversified funds. So just buy a mathematically diversified fund. One, singular. 

I’m not sure if you chose dividends because someone told you to or because you actually have a low risk tolerance. Just realize dividend stocks offer smaller returns and are less aggressive than growth stocks. Nothing wrong with that if that’s where your risk tolerance is, but the question of *what is my risk tolerance?* is something you definitely need to answer, and only you can answer it."
03/19/2021,stocks,You picked a good day to jump in but I think you are little too diversified relative to the amount of money you put in. Concentrate your money a little more and you’ll grow your money faster.

Whenever there’s a change in political offices the first 2-3 quarters of the following year tend to be rocky, with new policy and a lot of uncertainty.   Good buying opportunities, but also be aware we’ve had an incredible run this past year and it’s not guaranteed to continue.   With democrats in full control the policy will shape growth in the market, and until that’s clear I would expect some ups and downs.   There could be a correction, crash, or bubble pop pretty soon, or things could stabilize and continue on for a while longer.

03/19/2021,stocks,"That's a really far way to spread $500. I saw your other replies saying you'll condense your picks and that's probably a good idea. I'd avoid fractionals if possible.

Personally, working with $500 I'd go more aggressively and do some swing trading to up your capital a bit. 

But it really depends on how much you're hoping to make. I don't work with ETFs much but I'd estimate over a year, with $500, you're looking to make between $25 and $75. Does that sound right?"

03/19/2021,stocks,"Agree with other posters about consolidating your positions to simplify based on your risk tolerance, so I won’t go further into that.  For most of not nearly all people, the simpler, the better.  I have AAPL as my value stock and the rest are in very low expense ratio index funds through Vanguard (Roth IRA and brokerage) and my employer 403b through Fidelity.    The vast majority of my index funds are VTSAX and FXAIX.  I highly encourage you to read The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle, the creator of Vanguard and of the first index fund.  Then read about the Three Fund Portfolio. 

I had a question regarding the type of account you are investing in.  Is it a regular brokerage account or a tax-advantaged account, such as a Roth IRA?  I would add for picks (generally funds such as VTI/VTSAX/BND) that you want to buy and allow grow over the years for retirement, max out your Roth IRA ($6000) every year for the tax benefits before. For individual stocks, keep it in your regular brokerage account. Also be aware of short and long term capital gains taxes if you plan to trade stocks often, as well as how to harvest any losses.

However, I would advise you set up an automatic investment program, so you regularly buy shares in whatever funds you end up with. Even if it's $50/month, it all adds up. Also takes the emotional component out of investing.  Like they say, Time in the Market is better than Timing the Market.

03/19/2021,stocks,You seem pretty spread out for 500 dollars.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Not advice just different perspective. When you only have $500 and you have small positions in this many companies, you need each stock to go up a lot in order to grow. You won’t be making much in dividends with just $500 invested, so you really need to just add money to it every month and grow that way. Don’t forget you have to pay taxes on your dividends and on whatever stocks you sell. Early on in investing I picked stocks for this reason. If I bought 50 shares of a $10 stock, and it went up 10 pts, I made $500. I found it easier to put bigger positions in a few stocks that would then go up significantly than to find multiple that would do the same. With that being said, when you are tied up in a few companies you can very easily lose it all."

I've recently drastically improved my income flow which is why I'm so confident right now going 50/50 cash savings/investments until building up my emergency fund to a full six months. There are a lot of moving parts within my life right now but most or all would be considered objective wins.  

Also worth noting, I'm very much a ""nothing to lose"" kind of guy, not in a hopeless sense, but like, I don't have a wife, I don't have kids, I don't own a home, I don't *want* a car until I can afford an EV, I'm actually back in college in the fall as well.

03/19/2021,stocks,"I've set up my accounts with Fidelity, so I'll look at the Fidelity equivalent so as to reduce fees I guess? I've learned that there's really no need to diversify in indexes, so as long as I'm invested in a reputable one, I should be good. 
  
Also nothing against Vanguard, I've actually heard nothing but good things about them and largely the same about Fidelity. Fidelity just has a pretty strong local presence in the area in which I grew up, and many important people in my life have careers at Fidelity. So when it came down to picking one, I just picked. But I'm heavily invested in VOO through Fidelity so I guess figure that one out lol"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would say my risk tolerance right now is probably a low/medium, like a 3/10 on the scale right now, just because there are other things I'm trying to plan for such as my return to college in the fall (mostly government/institutionally funded but I'm still on the hook for some, and there's never been help from mommy/daddy and daddy's dead now anyway so is what it is).  

I chose some dividend stocks because that's what I'd heard I should do as a *portion* of a portfolio, especially as someone who doesn't quite have the room to lose a shit ton of money right now. Perhaps I went about it the wrong way. I do have personal convictions on T, PEP, and TM, so maybe those are the three I stay with.  

I knew it was important for me to post this today because I knew I was going to be missing something important, and it looks like the thing I most severely overlooked/got wrong was the inappropriate diversification of ETFs. I've been given advice/resources elsewhere in this post to ensure that doesn't happen anymore.

So that's where I'm at in life and in investment.  

Thanks in particular for the heads up regarding policy change. From my super basic understanding of the market and much deeper understanding of politics, this term will likely be *decent* for the market and much better for the average worker. The next Republican we get will shit on the worker and the market will take off. Is what it is."
03/19/2021,stocks,"So basically rock and roll with VOO and maybe one trustworthy stock (I really *really* like T) and just go from there? Thanks for your advice, it certainly makes sense that concentration is necessary in the early stages, I guess I just missed that memo lol"
03/19/2021,stocks,"That is correct. There were a few that I was able to buy multiples of based on their price of course. My average position size is roughly $30.  

I've learned over the last hour or two that I've likely highly overdiversified, and at this point my current move is to first wait for all funds to settle, then reduce my positions to VOO, T, and PEP over the course of the next five trading days. So that's the development since OP."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Shit, might as well be"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Much appreciated on the lookout. Unfortunately, oil companies and defense contractors are off my radar for single-stock purchases for ethics reasons. Which sucks because I *really* thought XOM and Chevron looked pretty good, but I gotta be a man of my principles in at least one way. Thanks again for the advice, at minimum I can look at other tickers with similar information as LMT and adjust for industry differentiation."
03/19/2021,stocks,"TLDR Yeah basically. And the only fractional I'm looking at is maybe going .5 at a time on VOO until I get that first full share, just so I can more heavily invest in T, which I do have faith in as an investor and as an actual consumer of AT&T's product.  

Importantly - and maybe I was stupid in thinking this would be the assumption - I'm continuing to add 10-15% of my current income to this, and in fact I got paid today so the first transfer was initiated today and I'll be ready to invest that money next week. It's only $60 this time since I was sick last week, but it is still money every two weeks. So over the course of the next year I'm looking to actually invest several thousand dollars, and ideally this remains the case from now until the end.  

With that said, what I'm looking at is 10% a year. If I can make 10% a year happen, I'm happy. And the reason for that is at no point in my life do I ever plan to retire. I'm a musician by trade, and I plan on earning a degree in another marketable field and maintaining a career. Teaching has always been a passion of mine. If I can make more than 10% a year on the money I invest into the market, that's great, but I want 10%.  

Later on down the road, opening my own business is not out of the cards either. I'm also a highly skilled pizzaiolo, I can make you the best pizza you've ever eaten in your god damn life and I can make it six different ways. I can bake fresh bread - great bread, actually - completely from scratch. So opening a restaurant/club/live music venue later on down the road is not out of the question.  

I now understand the importance of investing, something I didn't have during the first ten years of my adult life, so I have nothing to show for the work I've done. But I have passions in life that lead to work income, and my plan is to put the majority of my physical and mental energy into those fields so I can continue to better myself as an individual and as a skilled artist, rather than attempt to actively manage my money on a daily/hourly basis."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks a bunch, much appreciated. It feels good knowing that I'm finally taking control of my life, both financially and otherwise."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've actually only just learned about Roth IRAs this week, so the plan is that once I actually start earning the income from this second job, I'll open the Roth IRA and start putting stuff in there. Probably keep the standard brokerage account just to have it, but yes, the plan also involves opening a Roth IRA and heavily investing in that, probably to the tune of . I was unsure if this was an appropriate place to discuss that, but yes, it is 100% on my radar now that I've actually learned about it.  

I'm also aware that selling a stock for any sort of profit within a calendar year of purchase necessitates the taxation of that gain as regular income, rather than the standard rates for long term capital gains. It's important that I mane the necessary sales now to consolidate my positions, while the gains are in the pennies and the taxable amount won't even put a dent in my refund next year. That's in the cards."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I put $5 in the other day so my boss would stop yelling at me about it and I took like $3.60 out the other day with a big ""told you so, asshole""."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah I only recently learned about Roth IRAs, definitely before this post but also definitely this week, so over the next week I'm gonna open one of those and move probably the ETF and the like funds over there, keep T and PEP in a brokerage account but once I reach a certain amount on those I'm not even gonna look at them anymore, probably go 70/15/15 on ETF/T/PEP for the foreseeable. But yeah, Roth IRA is in the immediate future, like next week type shit."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Understood. That was largely the plan, except I didn't know I could do it automatically, but the plan was to basically buy every other Thursday from now until the end of time, and sell when I need to (hopefully never) or want to (likely not for a decade). Of course it's important to keep cash, and long term I'm looking at other tangible investments, but right now everything that isn't cash is going into stock/ETF. And I am opening a Roth IRA soon, I learned about those this week and $6000 a year is feasible if not this year then possibly next."
03/19/2021,stocks,"There are websites out there that allow you to input etf’s and it will show overlap. Very handy tool until you learn what all of these tickets are. Some overlap won’t hurt anyone but like the other poster said, some of these are identical because they follow the same indexes."
03/19/2021,stocks,"No problem, we've all been there. Your picks are very US-centric, so I'd also encourage you to look at VXUS for some non-US exposure."
03/19/2021,stocks,"in general spy and qqq have heavy overlap too


in your boat i wouldve just gone 100% into spy spy+qqq if you really think tech is gunna carry the next years. maybe diversify once you have a little more money. by picking indexes you already get lots of diversity."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Only up 16,3%, please help /s"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you can, focus on adding another $500 to keep $1000 in cash ready for any emergency may pop up while you’re working things out. 

You’re way too diversified, buying a single SP500 index like VOO and 2 other big companies you’re interested is enough diversification for $500.

My strategy has been to buy VOO while my stock picks are rising and on the days my stocks fall, I consider them “on sale” and sell some VOO to buy more shares of my chosen stocks. Rinse and repeat."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Fidelity is great as well. I do have account with Fidelity/Schwab/Vanguard. They all are amazing.

Agree, just pick one index and done with it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"No problem at all. 

Based on what you say about your risk and cash needs, I 100% agree on emphasizing dividend stocks. Especially at this point in the market where a huge drop is not impossible.

 For what it’s worth AT&T is imo the best dividend stock in the market. Pepsi is good too. Your choices all seem solid, but none of them will really give you anything if you are spread so thin."
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s 500 bucks man. 🤣
03/19/2021,stocks,"I stuck with one ETF until i was over 20k, then i diversified into another geographic region."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I don’t have any comments specific to the party policies, and frankly I’m not sure it really matters that much to the markets once the playing field is stable...   We have good runs under D’s and R’s both, but the transition between them always introduces uncertainty of what’s coming next, and can dampen the markets as the playing field is redrawn.

The policies of the last 4 years are colliding with changes for the next 4 years right now.   Some believe we’re due for the 2008 crash that got cut short, some think it will continue on for a bit longer.   I’d just say study the environment and make up your own mind, be aware of the opposing sides argument and then proceed confidently with your convictions.   It usually settles out before Q3 and I’d expect we will be on a trend at that point we can expect to continue.   

With all the mess of an economy right now due to shut downs, stimulus, unemployment and leveraging of debt, I’m not terribly optimistic for the first half of this year, but I believe it will stabilize as those continue to unwind and we will see stability or growth through the second half of the year."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yup. It’s better to have a large position size in 1-4 holdings than smaller positions in multiples of positions. Then as your wealth grows you slowly diversify by shaving some profits and entering new positions when you see a good opportunity that potentially offers better performance. And most of us get diversification drilled in our heads but that advice tends to come from people who have already amassed wealth. Ask them how they got there and they likely took a large bet on a select few companies.
03/19/2021,stocks,Ok that's what I thought.  Good luck with your investments!  Ive only been in the market since last February so I am also fairly new to it all as well.  It is definitely addicting lol
03/19/2021,stocks,"There are ethics etfs out there too. I don’t invest on oil or defense companies for the same reason, but I don’t use these etfs so I’m not sure on their performance. But it could give you some more diversity without fear that that etfs contains some of these stocks"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm pretty sure all brokers have a way to set up automatic investments. Also, $6000 is the maximum. You can do less. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and are on the way to financial success."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiit see this is the real OG advice here. This is why I'm not afraid to post my noob self here, because I wind up with incredible people like yourself dropping knowledge nugs in my brain. Thanks again."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Good looking, I'll put that on my radar. Thanks again."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yup, I'm definitely keen to Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps. Should not take me very long at all to hit the $1000 emergency fund, I just started working a second job (the job I had before the pandemic) that pays really well considering the industry, and the goal is to work between 50-60 hours a week until school starts up in the fall and just sit on that money for as long as possible through college while working part time during the semester to meet my current needs.   

I'd heard mixed things about whether or not I should be diversified at this level of investment, and I'm learning that I overdiversified. No big deal, we just correct at the earliest correction point. Good news, I'm largely holding relatively even, so barring a nuclear catastrophe before the end of next week we should be gucci.  

That's a decent strategy that I might actually rock and roll with. And it's only a Good Faith Violation if you were to resell those stocks before cash settlement, right? So it can literally only bite you in the ass if you change your mind, which you should really never do if you're actually knowledgeable.  

Thanks for all the advice."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'd wondered whether or not it was worth just straight dropping $400 into T, because even though that is on paper a **scary** thing to read, it's fuckin T, and $400 would give me one free share in the first year, which compounds from there. Going 80% on T is probably overkill, but it's good to know that we have the same opinion on that stock. 

I'll look at probably reducing my position quantity by roughly half over the next week, on top of clearing up the ETF mess I've created, and strengthen positions in VOO, T, and PEP. Thanks again for your advice."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Believe it or not, that is a lot of money to a lot of people.

If OP wants to start investing, I think he should get into good habits and diversify. 

Sure, maybe he randomly pick a winner and turns 500 into 800, but he could pick a loser and go home 500 to 200."
03/19/2021,stocks,"God damnit Charlie, you're right. I'll be honest, I was high key wondering how in the hell I'm supposed to make any money off dividends on fractions, I'd even specifically searched how to start investing with low starting amounts but even those videos/articles where they take $100/500/1000 and start a portfolio are all written/produced by rich guys. And they may be entirely well-meaning when they tell you to split a grand between 15 different tickers, but like, when you're rich, you're rich.  

So it looks like next week is as follows for me, in order:  
1) Wait for all funds to settle  
2) Clear up the ETF overlaps  
3) Reduce quantity of positions by 50% or more  

I'll likely wind up staying in VOO, T, and PEP, and call it a day. I have IRL business relations with Pepsi, I can tell you from on-the-ground experience that given enough time Pepsi WILL beat Coke based solely on customer service. So those will be my three, and once I start hitting like three-five stacks in the game I can start looking elsewhere.  

Thanks again for your advice, today's actually been huge in my learning process, and I can't have done it without people like yourself taking the time out of your day to educate someone who you don't even know in such an important field."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks a bunch, same to you as well. Wouldn't quite go as far as to call it addicting - call it taking control of your own financial success, and the feeling of freedom that comes with it. It's very much the difference between choosing what your money does and feeling like you have no control at all. If anything, the game to me is watching shit go up and down and maintaining the fortitude to just hold, and make macro decisions independent of the micro status of the market."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Here is one such website:

03/19/2021,stocks,"VT as well. Don't quote me but I think it's 59% US, 41% non-US"
03/19/2021,stocks,I’m not saying YOLOing it all on one stock. But over diversification can be bad too. Pick 5 stocks with your 500 instead of 15. Good habits are being able to actually follow the stocks you invest in. Don’t diversify just to diversify. When you’re first starting out there is no way you can legitimately keep up with 15-20 stocks.
03/19/2021,stocks,"No problem man, good luck on your journey. Never stop learning."
03/19/2021,stocks,Absolutely agree about taking control of my finances.  I'd much rather have my money invested to where I can control it and see decent returns vs letting it sit in a savings account earning .1%.  of course I still do have some in savings just in case.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Bookmarked, thanks so much."
03/19/2021,stocks,"When I say he should diversify, I am not saying he should buy any number of single stocks. He should pick 2-3 ETFs max, get his feet wet, and maybe learn how the market works.

500 bucks isn't enough to buy into single stocks IMHO, and I think he would be much better of buying 5 shares of VT or something like that."
03/19/2021,stocks,"As you should. It's important to have money you can access outside banking hours. But yeah, this is the move."
03/19/2021,stocks,Then you are saying what I’ve been saying this whole time🤣 he doesn’t need to diversify as much as he has and should concentrate to a couple of his picks rather than 15. I never said anything about single stocks
03/19/2021,stocks,Two ways of saying the same thing. Always a happy way to end a discussion.
03/19/2021,stocks,"A CVR isn't stock.
You might not be able to sell it.
Have you reviewed the terms of getting a payout?"
03/19/2021,stocks,I didnt get anything from robinhood about the stock I finally looked into it today after not being able to do anything about it for a few months. It was for mgen which I think now is miragin and I think I read something about it ending on October 30th.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Itd not a stock it's a CVR and you're stuck with it.
It was part of the buyout of Viridian Therapeutics, Inc.
You probably received it on Oct. 30 2020 or around then."
03/19/2021,stocks,How do I access it?
03/19/2021,stocks,"It appears you're ignorant about what you're dealing with.

03/19/2021,stocks,Sorry if I come off rude I am not the smartest I am just wondering how I can see what I have since it isnt on robinhood. It says it could be past the expiration date. It was only 5 dollars but I also like to learn this.
03/19/2021,stocks,"They're is no way it's expired.
There's about 4 and a half years for it to play out.
If you had shares of Viridian.
Start bothering your broker until you see your CVRs in your portfolio.
Did you read the article?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah I read it and robinhood said they cant speak or do anything on behalf of a company action so I have no way of accessing that stock. They offered a penny for the lot transaction but I dont know why anyone would take that deal.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Well, you can find the average P/E ratio of the S&P500 on the internet. You also know the P/E ratio of Tesla and the weight of Tesla in the index. The average P/E ratio of an index is simply calculated as the weighted average of all P/E ratios. So just multiply Tesla's P/E by its weight and subtract that from the P/E of the index."
03/19/2021,stocks,This would actually be interesting to see.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Use a weighted average of everything else in the index besides TSLA. You know TSLA's PE, SPY's PE, and TSLA's share of SPY, which should be enough"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Negligible. Using trailing 12 months earnings and todays' market caps from Cap IQ:

PE (SPX) = Price(USD 33,071,295 million)/Earnings (USD 789,291 million) = 41.9

PE (SPX excl. Tesla) = Price(USD 32,444,357 million)/Earnings (USD 788,570 millions) = 41

EDIT:

To clarify what I am showing above

* PE ratio equals \[Price\]/\[Earnings\]. 
* For an index, this is   ∑ \[Market capitalisation\]/ ∑ \[Earnings or Net Income\]. 
* For the S&P500 excl. Tesla, this is \[ ∑ \[Market caps\] - Tesla Market cap\]/ \[∑ \[Earnings\] - Tesla Earnings\] (see table below).
* P/E for S&P500 is not the weighted average of the individual ratios (how would you weight it? By Market Cap? By Earnings?) and so P/E the S&P500 excl. Tesla can't be calculated by excluding Tesla's weighted PE.

|Entity|S&P 500|Tesla|S&P 500 excl. Tesla|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Market Cap (USD millions)|33,071,295|626,938|32,444,357|

03/19/2021,stocks,"SP500 is around 39.23 trillions, with PE ratio of around 39.92


Tesla itself is 617B with PE of 1000


So tesla is around 1.57% of the SP500



So i'd estimate whitout tesla, we might see about 1.57 less PE Ratio"

03/19/2021,stocks,"If you don't want to be too heavily invested in TSLA, Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc. then equal weighted funds like RSP, EQAL, or QQEW are good."
03/19/2021,stocks,Do a long squeeze for tesla become a good stock again
03/19/2021,stocks,P/e is price/earnings. You can't just ignore the price components.
03/19/2021,stocks,Would that be 1.57% less of the current PE or just the number like 38-1.57?
03/19/2021,stocks,"My math may be wrong but I got a p/e of 24.6 of the s&p 500 - TSLA.

03/19/2021,stocks,It is more than 1% of the s&p500 and it has a p/e 25x the average. Without tsla the p/e of the s&p 500 goes down a lot more than 1.

03/19/2021,stocks,Certainly for anyone who experienced the disaster in '08 it would seem like a potential repeat. I lost a home due to my ignorance. Bought into the whole goofy voodoo financing that seemed fine at the time. Expecting to refi at a later date. By the time I realized what was happening banks only wanted to offer refi on my automobile. That should have given me the first clue something was strange.Then my better half lost her high paying job to a buyout. But this is different. Some people will surely lose their property. Some will maybe be offered the opportunity to put the past due on the back end of a restructured loan. All be it at a higher interest rate. Maybe? This is also different because everyone knows that it's a possibility. Most had no clue it was coming last time.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've read good arguments from both sides on whether or not the bubble will burst. Thanks to 30 year fixed rates I don't think it will.

At sub 2% interest your way under market inflation (how much inflation is coming is a whole other debate) so why sell? 

 I was listening to a podcast last night where the guest proposed the idea that should rates go up people will just stay in their houses they buy now forver to not lose the 2% rate. So supply will remain low and drive prices up further. It was also pointed out that more and more old people can stay in their homes rather than go to a nursing home."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I thought so too, but mREIT MORT has been my best investment ever.  High dividends too.  Up over 14% since Feb 1."
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you're really interested in property, there's podcasts by two guys called ""the property podcast"". It's.on YouTube and Spotify.

They're so good and they clearly explain fundamentals.

IMO real estate is a very good ""stock"" to own, because it grows (capitals gains) and also pays dividends (rent)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the context! I was 10yo in 2008 so I don’t remember much. Even if interest rates eventually increase and people can refinance in the back end of loans, there would still be a bubble burst right? People are overpaying at crazy rates that just aren’t sustainable. I guess my question is, would mortgage backed securities remain stable despite this? Like are they separate/balance enough to wether major shifts like the one predicted?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"The 2008 crash is ideal as it sets up a fresh start for the 18 year property cycle. Some people have recently dissected EVERY year and property growth rates from 2008, and it follows the cycle remarkably well.

Apparently were in the first year or a 5-7 year boom phase. 

Wouldn't worry about a crash especially if you're renting and in for the long game as opposed to flipping properties."
03/19/2021,stocks,Sub 2% ? Maybe I'm confused. Seems to me from what I'm seeing 30 year rates have risen twice in recent days. 3.45% today is what I'm seeing. Surely those who manage to keep their homes during the pandemic at the lower rates should stay put. Or at least maintain the property as a rental. Even that seems a little risky. Rental money isn't a sure bet for sure. Maybe you are referencing the Yield rate ? Nursing home avoidance is usually either the result of good health or a reverse Mortgage. Older people can't always keep up with property taxes and upkeep issues. Even HOA fees. Even an HOA can initiate a foreclosure. Although it would be foolish and not in anyone's best interest. Especially the banks. I remain hopeful that people don't start losing their homes in large numbers but the possibility does exist. Fixer uppers will end up sitting vacant due to the rise of material cost. Unless your a DIY type with extra drywall laying around. Not really arguing with you. Just thinking outloud.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Property bought right and rented right in the right market is good to own. 

Property bought too expensive where rents don't make sense are not good to own. 

It still takes DD and many places property has been priced above where it makes sense to rent.  Right now we are just holding. We own our home but no rentals at the moment.  

Now is a good time to exit rentals that no longer make sense though with the run in real estate prices."
03/19/2021,stocks,Property buyers are paying cash. Either asset backed cash or straight up cash.  The reason for 2008’s crash won’t be the reason for this crash. (If there is one)
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm definitely no expert on the subject. I can only imagine that it could affect the supply and demand problems that currently exist in some areas. If there's a huge change in availability come September when the moratorium ends then prices could fall significantly. Might even things out if interest rates are higher. If we can expect inflation to remain around 2.4 percent and wages don't keep up then homebuying may get further out of reach for many. May not even have any real or imagined effects on things overall. I don't like the term ""transient"" however. Only Walmart does ""rollback"" pricing. As if anyone remembers the original price."

03/19/2021,stocks,"TL;DR: Metrics look promising and they are also doing something good.

Agree. There might be some volatility because of low volume, but the dividend is the most interesting thing anyways. 

There’re some negative things to look at. PEG is above 2. (high is Bad) That points towards an overvaluation, but just for perspective Tesla’s PEG is +30! 
Also dept to equity ratio is +5, but in the financial services sector Dept/eq is the highest anyways (it is still above average in this sector)

I guess the highest risk involves rising default rates in the aftermath of the pandemic. OMF provides loans for people with non-prime credit score who usually get rejected by traditional lenders. Sounds risky but if you consider that approx. 100 Million Americans don’t have non-prime credit score and how easy it is to loose prime credit score, it’s no surprise that OMF’s default rate is pretty much at industry average (about 9%). 

Also, and for the next part it would be great if someone who dealt with this company personally could confirm this, it looks like that OMF doesn’t require the usual larger upfront payments, fees, and—of course—higher interest rates, if a non-prime person wants to take a loan. 

This would mean that you invest in a good cause. If you’re struggling to begin with, taking on a high-cost loan or using credit cards just perpetuates a cycle of debt. 

Also they deferred payments from customers in Texas after the Winter Storm put people in jeopardy. 

Overall it looks like OMF is not the typical loan shark and is actually aware of their social responsibilities."

03/19/2021,stocks,"SQQQ a leveraged short etf. So it consists of mainly derivatives shorting the main index-tracking fund QQQ, which follows the Nasdaq. 

In general, you should avoid these instruments when first starting out, in particular the ""ultrashort"" funds. Unless you time things perfectly and stay in only a day or two it's a really good way to lose your shirt. They are subject to something called leverage decay, due to how they are structured and how they rebalance the fund end of each day.

Some of the safer leveraged long ETFs are ok to hold for a couple weeks/months if you buy at the right time (e.g. TQQQ, the ultra long Nasdaq fund, though now I'd definitely not the right time to buy that). But the short funds decay really quickly.

EDIT: the one you are looking at is basically the same thing as SQQQ except shorting US Treasuries."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Generally the wash sales work themselves out.   It can get strange depending on if your shares are all together or if you’re selling and buying the shares at different price points depending on your share management.   Eventually if you sell all your positions and wait 61 days then the math should work out.   

For example if you’re using fifo management of shares, and you buy 100@$10 then average down by buying another 100@$5, your cost basis would be $7.50 per share for your holdings.   If the stock rises to $7.50 and you sell half, the first shares you bought would be sold in fifo management meaning you’d show a loss of $250 on the sale, but your remaining position would be comprised of shares with a cost basis of $5, showing a gain of $250 in your current holding.

If your shares are set to LIFO then you’d realize the gain of $250 and your remaining position would show a loss of $250 or a share cost basis of $10.

Obviously it gets more complex than this the more you trade various costs and lot sizes, but at the end of the day when you close your position and wait for 61 days it all balances out.  If you’re planning to hold long term then it can be advantageous for taxes to pick the shares you want to sell in a given year to either realize a gain or loss in the year.   Mostly I worry about that on long term positions around Halloween if there’s a reason to."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would just worry about it near the transitions between tax seasons; about November through February.

It you want to claim the taxes on a certain tax season you need to stop trading the security for a month during the transition to the new season."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've been worried about this, too."
03/19/2021,stocks,As long as you keep good records for calculating taxes don’t worry about it.
03/19/2021,stocks,"The problem for me is that I’m not waiting those 61 days. I’ll average down, sell all for a gain. Buy back, trigger wash sale, average down/sell all again for a gain, rinse and repeat. I’m just not sure if these wash sales are screwing me in the end"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Edit - decided to rewrite this. The wash sales are lowering your basis in closed positions, increasing gains. If you still have wash sales at year end, to net out you would need to close the positions and not open new ones for 30 days."
03/19/2021,stocks,"They can definitely mess you up for tax time if you don’t manage them, there’s an art to making sure you’re holding the right value of shares vs what you’ve sold especially if it’s a volatile stock.   You can look into whatever share management your broker provides to investigate further.   It’s not the end of the world either way, it’s mostly tax optimization strategy and making sure you are holding what you want to be holding.  

Personally I just set it to fifo and don’t worry about it much if I’m trading very actively.   That way your most recent trades tend to be the ones reflected in your active holdings and your older trades tend to be reported for taxes (when you stop trading that equity actively).

An example of that would be if you’re trading 100 shares and buy/sell as follows:

 b$50, $b60, $b100, s$110, b$90, b$110, s$120, s$125, you’d wind up holding 200 shares with a cost basis $95, and having sold off 300 shares with a cost basis of $70 you sold for an average of $118 per share.   So you’d get taxed on a $48 gain per share sold if you did no further trades on that equity until the wash sale expired.   Obviously if you continue trading more and increase your position, the older trades will come into play again.   But all the wash sale rule does is carry your gains or losses forward for you at the end of the day.

This way, even though the stock has run up (or down) significantly, your holdings and taxables are managed in the order they’re done and you wind up holding value around the current price and being taxed on values around the earlier prices.

Is it a big deal?  Maybe.   If you were holding tsla for years since $70 and now decide to start daytrading it at $700/ share, if you’re using the fifo method then your first buy and sell at $700/$750 would trigger a $680 per share taxable long term gain that you may not want to take right now.   Essentially you bought a share at $700 and kept it, raising the cost basis for all the shares you already owned at $70, then sold one of the $70 shares for $750 triggering a capital gain.  In this case it would probably be advantageous to use last-in-first-out, or just directly select the shares you want to trade.   But if you’re unaware of the possibility you could easily wind up taking all your gains from a long term hold while daytrading it or simply repositioning it, and instead of taking them as short term gain / loss you’d be cashing out long term gains in this case and eventually taking short term gains and losses if you continued trading actively.

Another example that could mess you up is if you sell a put on a long term hold you bought originally for $50, then it dips more than expected and you get assigned at $100.   So you decide you want to sell those shares after it pops back up a bit, and you may wind up selling the $50 shares instead of the shares assigned from the put.  Again it’s just a tax implication, but you’d see your cost basis of the original buy go up a bit due to the addition and hold of the $100 shares.   And in 6 months when your $50 shares are eligible for long term gains tax levels, you’ll have the freshly added shares that will be taxed as short term gains if you sell the entire position.   This ain’t exactly the wash sale rule, but they’re related and easy way to accidentally owe more tax than you thought you would.


I’m not a tax or financial advisor, and this isn’t intended as advice, I’ve just learned the hard way."
03/19/2021,stocks,"No I still have the wash sales in my cost basis but seems like every time I sell. It’s always green. 

As long as it’s always green with wash sales, I should be fine right? Idk if I can wait 30 days of not buying back into this stock (at this time).. for opportunity reasons."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You’re just racking up taxable short term gains, which is probably what you’re expecting to do.   It’s unlikely to be an issue with the way you’ve described trading, you’ll just have short term gains or losses to pay on which all active traders do.

I’ve done the opposite too where I buy a new unknown stock with poor DD on a bull run then panic sell lower, then rebuy at the bottom, which turns out to not be the bottom so I panic sell again.   Then when I’ve done research and buy the stock at the price I want a few days later, my cost basis includes all the losses of the earlier blunders.   It’s nice in that I don’t take those as losses immediately and have the opportunity to make up for them, but it can be confusing at first when I know I bought a stock at say $10 but my cost basis is $10.35."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You might have a profit overall on the transactions, but half the shares sold could have been at a loss. Wash sale rules would apply to the loss shares."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah that’s super confusing. A lot of my tickers show diff cost basis but when I sell entirely it’s like that cost basis change didn’t matter? Like I’ll look into my history and subtract buy and sell difference and it’s a greater gain than what my gain/loss tab shows for that wash sales ticker...Idk super confusing
03/19/2021,stocks,"Should I be concerned though? Overall is profit and some shares are indeed sold at a loss from DCA. But if I want to re buy and do the same thing, I should be fine right? As long as overall transaction is a profit again"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah it’s a bit confusing, but think of it as going back to the very first time you ever sold that ticker.   So if you buy $5, sell $10, buy $12, sell $15 then your gain from the first sale would show $5, and your gains from the second sale would show $8, when your total gains are only $8 and you technically realized only $3 of that gain on the second sale if it weren’t for the wash sale rule.   It just keeps your gains or losses current for you until you let it reset.

The reason it exists is so you can’t sell all your stock on December 31 and buy it all back moments later to claim a gain or loss but still hold the equity in the same position.   If you do that you’ll have to wait 60 days or whatever to claim it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You buy two shares first for $10 second for $20. You sell both for $15. Your profit / loss is $0. If you rebuy within 30 days, tax man says your profit is now $5. Brokers don't always add in adjustments when they show you your net income"
03/19/2021,stocks,"But from a profit stand point this doesn’t matter right? Just from a tax standpoint. 

If you sell your wash sales equities for a gain, your profits are greater than what your brokerage shows?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah it’s no change to profit or loss, only tax implication and reporting of those gains.   If you go through and add up all the gains on a sale with the wash sale rule you may convince yourself you’re doing better than you actually did.   Just look at the last sale to see your total gains to date in the wash sales you’ve been doing.

In the example above you might be tempted to add $5+$8 and then believe you somehow came out with a $13 gain, when your actual gain is just $8."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right I went and added up and looks like I’m profiting. Idk how this will affect taxes, but I feel like I’m overthinking this wash sale rule as something horrible for me. As long as I’m making profits on my overall trades even when averaging down and selling some of the shares of the trade at a loss, wash sale shouldn’t matter?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Pretty much yeah.   If you do simple math on your buys and sells, the wash sale will “wash out” eventually when you stop trading.   Your brokerage may show different cost basis and gains / losses than you’d expect on a specific transaction though, because it calculates the washes every day."

This past week has been very tough for a lot of people as the Fed chose not to extend the bank leverage ratio and bond yields have been rising.  It's a tricky game they're playing, and a lot of investors, particularly in tech have been burned, myself included.

As I look at my portfolio, a lot of the winnings earlier in the year with innovation, tech, and EV have literally disappeared in the past 4 days. All I've seen lately are negative posts in the red, and questions about what's happening in the future.  I put a bunch of money in innovation ETFs like ARKK, and have been killed over the past little while.

Like many of you, sometimes I suffer from mental health issues, and weeks like the past few can be devastating. You should know, there is **NOTHING WRONG with closing your brokerage accounts** for a day or two. I typically check about 10-20x a day, and its clearly not healthy. When you're up it seems great, but it really has a negative effect on me.  I'm forcing myself to work out, to get outside, get some sun, and focus onw what really matters in life.

If anyone needs to chat - by all means shoot me a note. Until then - enjoy your Friday. Love the ones close to you. Try your best to view this in perspective - life is so much more than the value of your portfolio. And so are you.

1) If you're not buying STRONG VALUE stocks, you're gambling. 

2) If you're investing with money you need, you're gambling.

3) if you have a short term time horizon, you're gambling. 

Paint it whatever pretty picture you want with fancy words like swing-trading, flipping, day-trading,*INVESTING*, blah-blah. In essence, you are gambling.

With that being said, my point is that you need to have the mentality *BEFORE BUYING THE STOCK/OPTION* that you are GAMBLING if you don't buy stocks with value. I understand ""value"" is a vague term, and that's because it is. Value can be in many forms, either through financials, future potential, revenue, etc. So if you have done your DD and you like the stock 😏, red days should only mean opportunities to buy. Don't invest with money you need, and you'll be much happier for it. Otherwise, understand short term plays and high-risk stocks is GAMBLING, and treat it as such.

The issue is people overextended themselves into the market with money they actually need in the short term or they dumped everything in all at once and now have no money to average down. Either of those scenarios creates a major panic when you're seeing your life savings start to disappear. I would love to see more posts from seasoned veterans on strategies for entering a position and exiting. Also more on balancing between money you can afford to lose vs money you can't.

&#x200B;

Since the sheet is impossible to get into these days with so much traffic (unless you're the lucky 50 - 60 that seem to get in) I thought I'd send screen shots of the pertinent info. If this seems like something everyone is interested in I'll keep it up. 

&#x200B;

Positions: [Here are the stocks I bought yesterday using this method.](https://imgur.com/gallery/oWLoqnj) If I had bought at the end of the day rather than getting impatient and buying around noon I'd be up a LOT more than this

&#x200B;

Today's data isn't really changing anything:

1. Reddit is still the best category
2. The score grouping of 500 is the most successful, with 250 being the next
3. Holding past the average **% to Max** date starts losing money, so sell quickly
4. The average number of days from the day it pops up on the list to max profit is 6 days (the 500 category is showing a REF error but I looked at the data and it's about 6 days)
5. The average % return you should expect is 15.81% - 17.70%. Because that's an average I usually start considering selling once it hits 10%

&#x200B;

Using the above criteria I did what I always do: 

1. Filter it down to those items, highlight the ones in the 500 category, then start searching Reddit for every ticker. 
2. I filter all posts by New so that I can see what the most recent conversation is.
3. I filter out any obvious bots or 1 person spamming multiple subs
4. I make a note of any ticker that is being discussed in at least 4 different subs. Extra points if there is a decent amount of conversation
5. From there I narrow it down to about 3 - 5 stocks that just *feel* good to me then spread my money out on all of them
6. Then I sit and wait until 10% - 15% or 6 days, whichever comes first

&#x200B;

I included the tickers for today in the link below in case anyone is interested:

If so Black hill corp is trading at 66 dollars pr. share[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila,\_Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquila,_Inc).[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BKH?p=BKH&.tsrc=fin-srch](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BKH?p=BKH&.tsrc=fin-srch)

I'm not from the US - so I don't know the rules what happens with stocks, when companies get taken over. But maybe try call the companies Investor relations team, talk to your bank, or a lawyer, that knows something about company take overs.

Hope it this will get you a bit further on your research.

2021-03-19 18:56:27,stocks,"Is it just me or do fears of market problems cause more downward movement than the actual problems? Edit: Thanks for all the replies! This is becoming very educational. You guys rock!

Leaving out major events like COVID-19, it seems like at least twice a month on average there are rumors or stories circulating about the overall market.

Either there is a fear of a bubble, there's a fear of a correction, there are sell offs, now everyone is worried about bond yields. The market dips 1 percent and everyone starts worrying about a collapse. Then people worry about oil prices. Politics also come into play.

Is it just my perception, or does the fear of the problems cause more movement than the actual problems?"

There's also the amount of rumors and speculation of ""this is about to short squeeze"" ""you have to get in now"" and poor saps actually listen and buy in, for the price to drop a dollar, they sell. And the cycle repeats.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Someone I spoke to recently put this quite nicely - A lot of newer investors are not patient enough to hold onto a company that is doing better fundamentally than their stock price. There seems to be a sentiment among some that if the market is not recognizing a firms value, then that firm must be dead. But we see it time and time again, the market goes through periods of euphoria where lots of disruptive and emerging technologies sweep up investors in a wild ride based on promises of future profits 5-10 years down the line. All the talk is ""disruption, tech, new paradigm, etc."". Then inevitably the market turns and companies with REAL CASH FLOWS and good balance sheets come back into favor. These are the investments that do well long-term - companies that have steady and increasing cash flow. This was Buffett's genius - if you pick a couple great companies that will be around for 20-30 years, they can increase cash flows over that time at eye-watering amounts. And that cash eventually gets returned to the investor by dividends, buybacks, and the market recognizing the hidden value that may not have been priced into the multiple. This is not even simply value investing - the best growth investors found great companies with positive cash flows that were able to grow over long periods. I use the term cash flows so many times in this post because when you look at the market long-term (in 20-30 year periods) - CASH FLOW IS NEARLY THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS!"

03/19/2021,stocks,People love to speculate about everything. The stock market isn’t an excpetion. The media loves to create buzz around it and bearish news are a lot more interesting than bullish news. Fear and uncertainty are one of the biggest enemies for the stock market and will always be.
03/19/2021,stocks,"The uproar over bond yields is infuriating because

1) even with the recent rise yields are absurdly low still, HISTORICALLY absurdly low. It's like if gas prices went to .01 a gallon for a year, and then bitching about having to pay .05 a gallon when it started to creep back up

2) They are going up because of how GOOD the economy is and how much more attractive the rest of the market is."

Well, enough people did so that it caused a failure in the water system and some people turned their taps on and no water came out. This caused a mass panic and more and more people turned their bathtubs on. I think it was in New York."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Even a broken clock is right twice a day. When you speak of a crash every week, eventually you’ll get one. 

Sentiment changes, but it’ll change again. It sucks but everything seems to be fueled by over reactions, things are wanting to crap the bed or over perform and it can’t seem to make up what it wants. And the news doesn’t help, they’re not going to tell you what’s in your best interest. It’s always to someone’s benefit who isn’t the little guy. 

I just tune out the noise. It sucks having these down days, but I never bought the majority of my holdings with the intentions to sell them anytime soon. Just ride the wave. I really don’t see how we’re worst off than last year, sure there’s worries, hurdles, the whole deal, but things suddenly flipping overnight because of minuscule raise in yields doesn’t really equate to some of what’s happened in my opinion. Worrying about tech being overpriced to be selling still for significant drops from their highs, to than put into “recovery stocks” already trading at pre covid levels, with all of the uncertainty doesn’t make much sense to me. 

Maybe I’m wrong but the conviction makes it all the more easier to deal with and ignore."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I don't think it's necessarily fear and that's over simplifying the dynamics. 
A crash is mostly rebasing expectations and it isn't different from any business or endeavour you partake. For example, someone expects a new highway to be sanctioned near a land you own. The price would go up even before the road is build ( speculation based on assumption)  and if for some reason the road isn't going to be built, the price would crash back to the original value.  

For example, during the first covid crash last year, the selloff wasnt as much fear as it was the unknown future. All the future growth expectations until that point had to be thrown out of the window and new financial models had to be created which could only be built based on information available to that point. They had to base it on the last major shock in 08 where the fed stepped in very late. The speed at which fed reacted produced a new model.

The clean energy growth model is based on a modern of high adoption rate of clean energy technologies, govt regulatory support and low interest and if any of these falter the valuations have to be rebased. 

As with anything there is going to be some froth around as information isn't always readily accessible or even understood in the right manner but markets are quite efficient for the information that's available to it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"It’s always valuations. 

The S&P at 40x earnings is fragile. A serious, *serious*, problem arises? It could get pummeled. On top of that, interest rates are low, which is often the medicine for economic slowdowns. 

Right now, we basically have every economic tool already out. Infinite QE, low rates, huge stimulus, low taxes, all with expanding deficits and lower productivity. We’re eating dessert, not our vegetables, and we've been doing it for > 10 years so it feels normal.

We could be fine (this is the thesis of MMT), but the likelihood of some economic boon doesn’t seem reasonable, while the likelihood of a serious economic crisis does seem plausible. 

It’s all about the consequences of possible outcomes. At current valuations, with everything being fine priced in, there’s not a ton of upside to the markets as a whole."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes like others have said you are right that media create fear on purpose, what you are not right about is what it does to the market because I garentee you that no reputable firm is making decisions based on what cnn or cnbc says."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The actual problems are actually not from the market. It is more likely from ourselves. If the uncertainty of whether we can earn the same amount of profit in real life/personal investment far less than from the market, we are more likely to gain more in the market.

That's why the address of risk management is far greater than just buying and selling/looking at uptrend/downtrend.  What's important to me is the mentality to lose, either time or the invested money.  Some don't have a target in a fixed time frame with fixed amount to be put in. And even one does have such, they still have emotion as to see the companies they invest in, failed to meet their targets in certain time frame.

Those are what retail investors have to face.    If we can swallow the risk and hold onto those we have done our dd and research and made decisions on, we simply ignore all the noises."
03/19/2021,stocks,"As someone who's been investing for a minute (or two or three..) I can say 100% without a doubt, no.  1% movement is nothing.  When the real problems hit, you could have the market down 5%, 10% or even more in a single day."

03/19/2021,stocks,For sure it causes more movement than problems. This is why I usually wait it out unless it provides a golden opportunity to rebalance. I have also come to realize a lot of this is the big players manipulating the financial media behind the scenes for their own gain. So it is often safe to ignore.
03/19/2021,stocks,"to me this downturn appears to be an algorthemic based selling and such selling invoking more selling. Institutional traders set up algos for buying/selling on sognificant events triggers.  10 Year bond yields crossing 1.75 can be one such trigger.  When that algo triggered selling, others are selling on sentiment, more selling is forcing margin calls by brokers, which in turn induces more selling.  selling is a downward spiral staircase."
03/19/2021,stocks,Today OP learned stock price is driven by human psychology
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think it’s more related to people’s understanding of the “market” and the forces that drive it. I’ll bet at least 50-75% of people think the “market” is buying a STOCK on one of the equity indexes. However, people need to realize that the “market” is A LOT more than just stocks. There’s a bond market, by which most measures is at least twice the size of the equities market. Like literally a 2:1 ratio from a capitalization perspective. There’s also a forex market, commodities, etc. On top of that, there are GINORMOUS state/federal pension funds, mutual funds, etc. that have huge amounts of money invested, for purposes other than making the biggest gain at the expense of risk exposure. The managers of these funds need to provide a stable return (i.e. fixed income) while minimizing as much risk as possible, to ensure retirees, or whoever their customer is, get their return. Basically, there are a lot more forces/interests at work in ALL of the various markets, with different strategies and desired outcomes, than just you or I trying to grow our brokerage or IRA accounts. So, when these huge “whales” move large amounts of capital out of different markets or sectors, I think a lot of folks are unaware of, or don’t understand all of the implications, these moves can have on their “corner” of the investment world."
03/19/2021,stocks,"True but bears are an important part of the market. When bears are all converted to bulls, you get something like the 2000 bubble. You need an healthy balance of bears and bulls, which is what we seem to have right now."
03/19/2021,stocks,Bond yields going up a little causes a 3% drop to the nasdaq. Omg went from 1.7 to 1.73 got to sell apple now they won't make a profit.
03/19/2021,stocks,Totally agree.
03/19/2021,stocks,Fear is a great motivator in all aspects of this world.
03/19/2021,stocks,I like how any negative news is just irrational. This market should just go up to infinity right?
03/19/2021,stocks,"I mean they are one and the same. Also while covid 19 was terrible to the economy (which definition do you use?) and employment/personal poverty, apparently the financial markets thrived during it."
03/19/2021,stocks,Every reaction on the stock market is an over-reaction. That's why some people are able to day trade and consistently be successful.
03/19/2021,stocks,The only thing to fear is fear itself. That and the  manipulating of the markets for the gains of the institutions.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, you have it exactly right. You’ve probably heard “buy the rumor, sell the news” applied to purchasing stocks before they get a lot of attention from a catalyst. The same works in reverse for selling: people hear a “rumor” (see a small dip, etc.) and panic sell before the “news” (a big loss, an actual depression, etc.), if there is any, can affect them."
03/19/2021,stocks,I think as well people are very aware of how popular stock trading is right now. I think you can become a bit hypersensitive with such rapidly bullish and bearish days.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that's why public sentiment is one of the better indicators.  I do a lot of earnings plays and it comes in there all the time, where they blow earnings out of the water but the price tanks because it's ""not good enough""."
03/19/2021,stocks,One thing I don't get is how there was a fear of a major economy crash because of the original GME squeeze. Like how would one stock going up turn into the great depression?
03/19/2021,stocks,Fear is the mind killer.
03/19/2021,stocks,That is what the market it.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, the market usually overreacts to problems so there's buy opportunities, but today I was surprised since Biden promised to screw banks and increase capital requirements, but the DOW only went down 0.71% today.  I was shocked the down was so small."
03/19/2021,stocks,"When the Nasdaq dropped this month, so called correction I googled .. Nasdaq drops 2020, 2019, 2018... 

You get the point.. always a new story of crash followed up everything is fine.. 

News is noise."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Fear of problems > actual problems

Hype of success > actual success

Works both ways."
03/19/2021,stocks,Been debating this with regards to Visa. Buy low opportunity?
03/19/2021,stocks,"The last year especially has seen one overreaction after another by media, governments, and regular folks. The fear of doom absolutely causes more problems and stock crashes than the actual events themselves."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah just like uptrends, too. Stocks generally rise on speculation and rumors rather than the actual news"
03/19/2021,stocks,The market is driven by future predictions so it's legit.
03/19/2021,stocks,Fear IS the actual problem.
03/19/2021,stocks,"The us economy isnt in great shape
You have few bubbles who didnt lose air for quite some time.
So fear might be reasonable?"
03/19/2021,stocks,They are pricing in the probability of those actual problems coming to fruition. The market is forward looking.
03/19/2021,stocks,Just hodl.
03/19/2021,stocks,People panic leading to other people to panic in one big over-exaggeration party. I think this is why there are value investors? Who think that stocks may be undervalued due to exaggerated investor sentiments
03/19/2021,stocks,"EVERYTIME the markets are in a Bull faze, people come out saying The Sky is Falling,, and even though it may be years before it's actually happens, they will always say,,, See I told you so. Just the opposite when the markets down turn, but then it's, I predict the market's will rise (eventually),, then they will be on the news as a person with foresight"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Generally speaking it is underlying problems that cause the fear in the first place, setting up the conditions for panic and a crash.

Humans are more motivated by fear of loss than by hope of gain."
03/19/2021,stocks,Speculation at its finest
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think it's a combination of everything! And we need to add that today market is not longer a place for investment, but gambling! Worst of all, almost everyone want to be rich... all of this makes the market not stable and people crazy."
03/19/2021,stocks,Duh
03/19/2021,stocks,Well yes the market is a future expectations discounting machine.  Once something is clear/ known the price already reflects it
03/19/2021,stocks,The market always overreacts in both directions.
03/19/2021,stocks,The stock market is simply emotional. Expect it to overreact to anything that might even remotely cause worry.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Monkey see, monkey do"
03/19/2021,stocks,"You could say the same about the other side of the coin. Expectations of positives causes more upwards movement than the actual positives. Which is what causes things to be ""overvalued"" which in turn causes investors to overreact more to fear. The only way this wouldn't happen is if stock price was fixed directly to a companies financial performance."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Sometimes it’s good to adjust and just hold
And think long term."
03/19/2021,stocks,All the active traders are trying to buy or sell before everyone else so stuff swings hard and has stampedes.
03/19/2021,stocks,Welcome to the laws of supply and demand.
03/19/2021,stocks,I've always liked the thought that the market is always self correcting. It often over corrects which causes another correction. When news comes out it can wildly swing to correct meaning it has to correct it's over correction. Kind of like a string on a guitar after a pluck.
03/19/2021,stocks,More $ is lost predicting crashes than money lost during  crashes.
03/19/2021,stocks,Markets have turned more into narrative driven than fundamentals driven in my opinion.
03/19/2021,stocks,You mean buying opportunities
03/19/2021,stocks,"Are you not considering the hope for a better market that largely drove the upward movement in 2020 even though most world economies were nowhere close to fully functional?

The market is forward looking, and always has been"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes but the entire market is driven by psychology. The opposite is also true, where any optimism (such as the development of a vaccine) drives stocks irrationally higher than what the fair value should be based on historical standards."
03/19/2021,stocks,This may be stupid but eventually the economy will continue to go up or just collapse. I don't ever think it'll collapse so why do I care what happens rn or even in the next year. I chose my companies that I feel would grow with time and I'll check back in a year or two to see if I should sell some shares and diversify more. I don't understand constantly checking and worrying unless you feel your company might tank.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, and it’s just like hype for a stock causes the price to rise more than actual performance of the company."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yes
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you want to read more about this I recommend [Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism](https://books.google.com/books?id=2Rz_cuu88DwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=animal+spirits&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gb_mobile_search&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjcsL-ljr3vAhXJJzQIHUm9CMMQ6AEwAHoECAMQAw) by George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller.

>Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism (2009) is a book written to promote the understanding of the role played by emotions in influencing economic decision making. According to the authors, economists have tended to de-emphasize the importance of emotional factors, as the effects of emotions are difficult to model and quantify. The book asserts that a variety of otherwise puzzling questions can be answered once one allows for the effect that emotional drives, or ""animal spirits,"" have on economic factors.

03/19/2021,stocks,"In many ways this is the dark side of the Information Age/rapid advancement of technology. I can have my phone ping me with alerts every time a stock moves, or catch Jim Cramer talking about a particular company, or news networks treating every little price change as the End of Times because they have a 24-hr news cycle to fill and ratings to chase, so before I stop to think about it I can press a button and sell. So we're seeing a sort of distorted acceleration of market movements because normal everyday movement is broadcast and everyone becomes focused on the minutiae, when historically you would have weeks with wild swings and never know about it, because by the time your statement showed up the market would have returned to normal. Not to mention the barriers to entry have been removed--which is good!--so now you have a lot of uneducated folks investing with their emotions and panicking every time there's a red day."
03/19/2021,stocks,Every reaction in the market is an over reaction.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Bro over the years I've gotten so trained not to care about market movements based off fear or speculation. In the last week I bought 200 shares of apple, and 100 shares of Nike."
03/19/2021,stocks,It's a self fulfilling prophecy.
03/19/2021,stocks,That's like the whole stock market. Public perception drives stocks more than anything else I'd say. Everybody is just speculating on what the best moves are gonna be. This drives price down out of fear and up out of excitement. It goes both ways.
03/19/2021,stocks,Your title has described how the stock market works exactly.
03/19/2021,stocks,"There is an old saying ""buy on the rumor, sell on the news"". Markets don't really trade on what's happening now, they trade on what people expect to happen in the future."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Classic. Same as good news causes more upward movement than the actual worth. So, the important thing is to learn how to ride the waves"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Markets can be and often are irrational in the short term on a fundamental basis. You have to also consider that a lot of big money needs to show quarterly, or even monthly results. 

Long term, fundamentals almost always win out."
03/19/2021,stocks,"There's a reason why original recessions are called ""Panics""

the great depression also started because people feared the speculations"

03/19/2021,stocks,Bruh I tuned out of the market for today and grabbed me a burger a poutine and some wine watched the new falcon and winter soldier show chilled out with my family and the opened up my portfolio at 4:03 and I'm up 2.59% what a good day.
03/19/2021,stocks,Welcome to the stock market.
03/19/2021,stocks,I think you just described the chicken and the egg.
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you look long term, everything will have gains. Just gota drop those emotions and make good choices"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Self fulfilling prophecy

The market is nonsense and bad algorithms"
03/19/2021,stocks,Yes the markets are like a panicky old man who hears a rumour in the papers and won’t stop going on about it.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Fear has always been the defining factor. You sell because you can't trust your fellow man not to. 

Then you feel stupid and vow not to do it again."
03/19/2021,stocks,The stock market is at least 50% psychological. Probably more than that.
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s all just fake shit I swear all done to cause fidelity and other money makers to not have to pay out as much. One day it’ll be unemployment. Then we’ll lose 5%. Next day back up 3% with no mention again.

03/19/2021,stocks,Market is suply and demand...so yes
03/19/2021,stocks,“Buy the rumor sell the news”
03/19/2021,stocks,"Why are you asking, what do you know?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Institutional Investors have considerable assets in the media and politicians that help drive a narrative and regulatory policies that provide an overarching advantage for them to steer the markets to their favor.

So yes, fears (and greed!) swing markets, but over the long term good companies tend to rise to the top. Of course it's a very messy process."
03/19/2021,stocks,"No, because I don't believe there is this ""consensus of fear"" the market reporters would have us believe sweeps through every so often. I realize they have to report the news and their audience expects them to summarize the market movement across thousands of issues and millions of investors and trades in 30 seconds or less, so they come up with sound bites like ""fear of interest rates"".  Learn to tune it out, its noise. There are thousands of things that move stock prices that have nothing to do with one another. Everything that happens in the market in one day cannot be summarized in a few sentences on a nightly recap."
03/19/2021,stocks,Idk I just keep investing. Hope I make good picks. Even with this panic crap I am still in general trending up in value.
03/19/2021,stocks,Isn’t that because the market is so propped up by sentiment ? If it’s high because of sentiment it can go low
03/19/2021,stocks,Yes..it’s all drama...
03/19/2021,stocks,Well ya..
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right now a lot of people are worried that the country is actually fine and doesn’t need stimulus and that the relief is completely overdoing it because the markets are fine so the economy must be fine right? They think they know more than Powell and that all this stimulus is going to overheat and wreck the economy in short order. They don’t trust Powell’s decision-making.

(Typed on supermarket line, sorry for run-ons, sloppy writing)"
03/19/2021,stocks,I think a part of why markets are so hyper reactive is the mass prevalence of trading on margin
03/19/2021,stocks,So.. what if we just all stopped being scared?
03/19/2021,stocks,Fear is a conviction while initial reaction to changing reality is denial.
03/19/2021,stocks,"There's some fundamental reasons behind dips, like the average of a sector of companys being valued more then the established stats show that they should and vice versa for come ups. Then like you said theres covid where noone knows if it's the end of the world or like 2007-09 with the mortgage backed securities. Major events cause crashes and downturns and nobody knows whether media is pumping it or not. Do you know how often the next crash was touted from 2010-2020? Quite a lot of times, there was huge dips in there too like in 2018 but overall it was a bull decade. The last thing people feared for that crash was a global pandemic, but there it was, it happened.

To answer your question from my point of view, yes fears of problems spark market downturns along with a number of other factors but the bottom line is crashes usually only happen during major events, which probably won't happen anytime soon. The market moving a percent or three each day is just the current state of the market, it's pretty volatile and swings are here to stay for a bit, if your long you shouldn't lose sleep."
03/19/2021,stocks,Weird. It's like you just invented behavioral economics or something.
03/19/2021,stocks,Just keep buying!!
03/19/2021,stocks,The market climbs a wall of worry.  Always.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I‘d say, you are right"
03/19/2021,stocks,Buy the rumor sell the news. Pretty much tells us all we need to know about this.
03/19/2021,stocks,"The problems lie deeper than those that you listed but it's all about fear/greed. Other reddit posts mentioned about it. My thoughts are:

\- Big institutions manipulate the market through self-serving news/promotions and insider trading. Example, TSLA and ROKU stock are mostly held by institutions. They shot up through the clouds, then crashed within days.

\- Stocks are also influenced by supply/demand law. With more supplies from IPOs, new issues, and SPACs, and less demand due to the world wide pandemic, the bear is more probable than bull.

It is scary to be in stocks now but don't worry too much about it. The 1% have all of their money in stocks and will never let them fall, just stick with mutual funds/ETFs and you'll be fine."
03/19/2021,stocks,Remember COVID? Like when we had huge surges of unemployment but a record high stock market?

Thankfully the new generation of investors see through the BS but unfortunately the boomers are the ones with the most money in financial institutions and managed markets"

No doubt nerve racking too!  😂"

03/19/2021,stocks,The stock market is heavily traded on emotion overall. Doesn’t mean you or anyone as a trader should trade emotionally. Money moves around for buying power based on what people are trying to predict in the future. It’s noise from the “bear side”.

03/19/2021,stocks,"You're likely right but: So what?   

Like the fear itself, when it influences market volatility/prices, is a very real uhh fear. The fear can be just as dangerous to your trading as the actual thing that the fear is about, maybe more so, so you have to factor it into your decision-making.   

 - If the fear is justified then fear the fear.    
 - If the fear is unjustified then fear the fear.

My prediction is that GME again is going to go down to 50. And when it does people will post their gain porn at 300 this time aswell as if selling before 350 was always the play."

 Markets are future looking because when you buy a stock, what you actually buy isn't a piece of paper (yeah, i know, boomer me :) ), but a ""right to share of future profits"". So any time there is any news or even possibility of news about something that may change the likelihood or the amount of these future profits, it's completely rational for people to re-evaluate their investments and either buy or sell, which then moves the prices.

Add on top of that second order effects (I know people would react to news in certain way, so if I buy it now I can make money), and third order effects (I know other people know that other people would react...) and so on... and that's how you get daily volatility based on rumors, hints of news, reading the tea leaves of Fed announcements, and so on."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Sentiment is actually a contrarian indicator.  Extreme bearish sentiment is bullish for the markets, and vice versa.  But you have to get through the initial selling before it reverses.

I would think about it differently.  The prevailing direction of the markets over time is always up.  Pullbacks are common and normal.  New investors aren't quite used to it because 2020 has been such an unusual year in the markets.  But the reality is there has to be a major catalyst to cause the markets to crash.  We had that catalyst a year ago with the initial COVID fear.  We had a decent selloff in late 2018 caused by rising interest rates and Trump's trade war.  We had the bear market of 2008 caused by the sub-prime mortgage crisis.  What you'll notice from these examples is two things:

1) Major selloffs/crashes don't happen very often

2) They're caused by big macro events

What we have right now are the rumblings of some potential catalysts but nothing major.  The rising bond yields are putting a bit of a scare into the high growth tech sector, but you have to realize that this is within the context of these stocks putting up incredible one-year returns.  So most of what is happening in the markets right now is rebalancing - investors are taking profits in high growth tech and finding other places to invest.

I do think we're due for a major selloff some time in the next year or so.  The economy is improving and that will eventually lead to the Fed raising interest rates and tapering their support of the markets.  When that starts to happen, people will panic and sell...and smart, long-term investors will take advantage of the opportunity and snap up stocks at discount prices.  Just like they did a year ago."

The MJ sector was so hairy and so much unknown (for an amateur investor like myself). I did exactly that, I split my eggs into baskets thinking it was the tried and true.... And then reality hit that lots of these companies were going to make it and I took a lot of losses. 

So yeah, your right and your also wrong. Concentrating doesn't mean pick 1 stock, and diversify doesn't mean throw a net and bring back every scrap you can find!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I agree, but is also depends on how good you are as an investor. You’ll never beat the market with index funds, but you’ll never under-perform it either.

I for one simply don’t have the time, and I’m not convinced I have the correct psychology, discipline, or aptitude to be educated enough to “stock pick” successfully to make it worthwhile. Therefore, I pick index trackers to follow the market.

If you are a skilled investor, then it is quite possible to beat the market. However, to be able to do it consistently you need to be incredibly disciplined, have access to a lot of data, and at times luck helps too.

Those with less than a million may be able to achieve very high returns, but as your net worth increases it becomes harder and harder to maintain that growth level.

The vast vast majority of people would do better to use my process, but then again, most people also think they are “above average” at every task, skill, or undertaking. Sometimes you need the humility to recognise that, whilst there are always opportunities, you don’t have an edge or the necessary insight to make use of most of them, so should use your own skill set accordingly, and use the talents of others to make up where you are deficient."

People were saying they were thinking it would shift to online sales but my question about that is ""how""? I was talking to a friend who games and his console doesn't even have a disk drive anymore. The games are downloaded directly from Microsoft. I'm sure all console makers are following suit since they lose money on console sales and this would lock in profits for game sales.

So most players are just downloading games. If you want to play old Nintendo games for nostalgia you can just download an emulator on PC and even buy a USB controller that looks just like the original one.

The only thing we could think of was them trying to get into e-sports. But they don't have a rep like EA. And most of that industry seems to just rent existing venues.

The market for console sales is already saturated.

The only other thing I could imagine is them announcing some new unexpected direction like deciding that they're going to just become another electronics retailer and rebranding. But the downside to that is their brick and mortar locations thrive on loyalty and that would crush it.

If it comes to PC games the online market is already dominated by Steam.

I don't think anyone in GME is really looking at fundamentals at all right now though, I think they're just hoping it squeezes. But I looked at some numbers and I don't think it's going to and even if it did this isn't Europe like with VW where the regulation is much stricter in preventing any influence."

So, with how things are currently going everyone and their grandma expects a bear market to come sooner or later within the next decade. My question is, say one were to invest monthly in an ETF that tracks the performance of the world market, would compound interest and dollar cost averaging be enough to hedge against the market being bearish?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you have a steady paycheck and you take a small percentage of that and buy a low fee index fund every payday, you win.  Always.   When the bear comes (>20% down) you see red, but your buying more shares with each paycheck.   When the recovery inevitably comes (months or years later) you're in a better spot.   

If the recovery never comes, well, you've got other things to worry about. 

If you don't have stable income (like retirement or venerable to losing your job in a recession) then withdrawal during a bear will ruin your investments. (Buying low good, selling low bad).  That's why having money split into stocks and bonds is recommended,  you aren't forced to sell stocks low, and bonds move in the opposite direction. 

At least that's the way I understand the theory."
03/19/2021,stocks,"If your other option is holding the cash and trying to time the bottom, then yes, DCA is going to be your best choice.

03/19/2021,stocks,"DCA doesn't beat lump sum. Time in the market beats timing the market (and, no, you cannot predict the bear market/bottom otherwise you'd be committing to *that* instead).     

If you're DCA because the capital isn't available until later (e.g. future pay-checks) then that isn't really a *choice* anyway. It is only a choice when you are intentionally sitting on cash you aren't investing to DCA it slowly.  

DCA makes people feel better, that is its core reason for being and the only purpose. If you're looking for mathematical efficiency, lump sum into a low fee highly diversified index fund is the solution. If you need to, simply stop checking it for a few years."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You can back test your strategy using https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Dollar cost averaging does not give you any downside protection in fact you will lose more money during the bear phase if you do it because you are buying more stocks.

Without dollar cost averaging you either ride it down and then back up and only end up at even or you have to perfectly time the market to buy at the bottom.  Dollar cost averaging takes  away the need to try to time the market which is something most people are really bad at.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Not sure what you mean by ""beat a bear market.""

DCA during a bear market means that you will be buying some more when the prices are low, which is a good thing.  When the market recovers you'll be in a better position than you would have been if the market stayed about level the whole time, since you were able to get more shares for the same amount of money.

Also, since nobody knows where the bottom of the market will be to buy-in, by DCA all the way down and back up you get roughly half the extra return from buying low (more if it stays near the bottom for a while), which is a pretty good deal.  It can also be done consistently, unlike trying to time the market which is very hit-and-miss."
03/19/2021,stocks,"When done correctly averaging into a position involves timing the market, otherwise you're just losing out on time in the market compared to lump sum.

Really the best averaging in strategy in to average in a bit whenever something looks undervalued, and sell a bit of it whenever it looks overvalued. That strategy reduces the issue of luck for the greater market movement since you're effectively only buying low and selling high. Of course you'll still be catching falling knives as you average in during a bear market, but you'll be catching them at lower points than you would be if you didn't try to time it at all, or just lump summed it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've committed to this idea. I am trying to put a good chunk of money into the market and I have been picking anything with a ""fair value"" and buying 20 to 30 percent of my position depending on my confidence level. For instance, if I want in on AMD but it is an overheated sector then I am a bit bearish in price over the next few months. Of course I could be wrong. Let's say I want to have 3 percent of my portfolio (let's just say that would be $1000 for example) in this position but for starters I am going with 20 percent.... $200. I buy 3 shares @ $80/ea for $240.

I will then wait for a pullback of over 5 percent below my last purchase price. Higher depending on how volatile the stock is. Let's say I purchase an additional 5 shares every time it drops 8% below my last purchase price for AMD. This is a really conservative example and could be done with a number of different ratios. I just don't want to get burned in a sell off everyone keeps talking about so I am treading lightly on my positions. It also can drop 5 percent in a single day without much trouble recently. My ""bottom"" for this would be back to pre-covid levels which would be a really severe sell off and almost completely unlikely.   


3 shares @ $80 - $240  
3 shares @ $73.60 - $220.8  
3 shares @ $67.71 - $203.13  
3 shares @ $62.29 - $186.87  
3 shares @ $57.31 - $171.93

Total position - $1,022.73

Cost basis - 15 shares @ $68.18/ea

Obviously this is a bit rough when the price is only $57 and you have a $68 cost basis but this would be worst case scenario. You also didn't over leverage yourself into a single position and were able to ride the price down roughly 30 percent over possibly a couple of months. On the flip side if the price goes up... and up... and up.... you only have $200 in and wanted $1000. I personally say ""oh well"" and wait for a serious pull back in the future but I won't chase the price up. I will be content with my small position and put money into a different company. 

I am a bit more bearish about the rest of 2021 so this is my strategy getting into new positions. I will go with 30+ percent on my opening position if I really believe in the company regardless of share price. Hopefully I am wrong and I have a bunch of small positions doing really well!

Lump sum is returning dividends while it follows the market, up *and* down. DCA only beats dividend returns if you time the market correctly."
03/19/2021,stocks,Let's say u started dca on the sp500 on May 2020 all the way to December 2020. Your average cost value keeps going up. If you lump sum on may 2020 it would've been a way lower average cost. DCA refers to buying more with your dividends and new disposable income that you didn't have.
03/19/2021,stocks,If you lump sum it now and the market goes up over the next 12 weeks then you make more now.  If it goes down you would be better off waiting.  To me that is still trying to time the market so I would just dump it all in now if I was going to go ahead and dump it all in within the next 12 weeks.  My assumption is that the market is going to trend up over time so eventually I will make it back if it drops short term but if it only goes up then I have missed out on that gain possibly forever.  That being said I am never 100% invested so I can still rebalance and buy more lower but that is not the same as DCA.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah thats true. I think over time you win anyway so it would be just that you win *less* but ultimately a decent profit is a good one. I’m leaning to lump sum. The S&P500 came close to the 4k mark but it is only a matter of time before it goes through. The market will work out what its doing with increasing yields, and rotation soon enough. Looking back 12 weeks, the couple of dips we saw would not have gone below the level it was 12 weeks ago so I guess that confirms lump sum."
03/19/2021,stocks,A hedge as in you have less exposure to an immediate downside than lump sum investing
03/19/2021,stocks,"So it isn't timing the market, it just relies on timing or ""intervals"" to make more money than the alternative..?   

DCA loses money 100% of the time unless your market timing off-sets that. Thus, it is a timing of the market strategy that relies on bear conditions to offset its innate loses.    

DCA costs money. That's just a mathematical fact. DCA offsets those loses (and even seeks a profit) with *timing*. Thus, DCA is a market timing system.  

Is it an actively managed market timing system? No. Is it relying on market timing? Yes."
03/19/2021,stocks,Depends on what you're investing in. If its an individual stock that's slightly volatile then DCA is fine but if its an index fund then lump sum is better.
03/19/2021,stocks,"DCA performs worse regardless, you just may *offset* that with *luck*.

03/19/2021,stocks,"> they do it because they get paid every month and thus invest a bit of money every month   

That isn't what is being discussed.   

If that is the case you literally have no *choice*, therefore ""DCA vs. whatever"" isn't actually a question, you're just investing *new* money. 

The question was DCA vs. lump sum because OP believes it is a bear market. Which is a market timing strategy since it relies on market timing/conditions to offset the innate losses from DCA."
2021-03-19 17:12:02,stocks,"Understanding margin When you get into margin or maintenance calls, and you pay the call off, dose the money go toward reducing the margin you borrowed? 

So, if I buy 10 shares at 1$ each, 5 on my own money and 5 on margin and get into a 5$ margin call with the market down, would I become cash only after paying the call off?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Margin is just a loan.  So lets say you put $100 in your account you now have $100 cash and 0 stock.

You buy $100 worth of stock.  You now have $0 cash and $100 stock.

You buy another $100 worth of stock on margin you now have -$100 cash and $200 stock.  (They are willing to do this because they know their $100 is safe because you can sell the stock to pay back your loan).

The stock market drops in half and now you have $-100 cash and only $100 stock.  (This scares them because if the stock drops any lower you can't actually pay back the loan so this is when you get a margin call but in this case it is probably only for $50 to get back to that 2-1 ratio)

You deposit $50 to make up the margin call you still have -$50 cash and $100 stock (they are now happy because your stock can cover the loan).  (Note if you don't deposit more money they will sell your $100 worth of stock at a 50% loss to you to make sure they cover the loan at which point you would be at $0cash and $0 stock.  Also it doesn't have to be this extreme they could issue a smaller margin call sooner).

The actual margin percentage will vary by broker and stock based on how risky it is and how likely it is to drop fast.  You are only out of margin when your cash balance is greater than zero but that isn't usually true if you just meet the margin call as they still want you to have a loan so they can make interest but they are only willing to loan you a percentage of the value of your stocks."
03/19/2021,stocks,Don’t use margin that way until you really understand what you are doing. You’ll just end up burning a lot of money
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes basically you borrowed $5 originally, if you put in another $5, you don't owe anything (not considering fees / interest). But you ended up spending $10 for 10 shares, so its no different than if you bought the 10 shares for $10 when they were are $1 (again not considering fees, etc.)"

(Hoping to learn here) but if I buy 10$, half on margin and then fill a margin call for 5 and come out without a loan + a little interest. Wouldn’t it be worth the leverage I gained initially? I’m trying to understand where the money gets “burned” because a lot of people warn against that"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right, and after looking at statements it seems like the interest rates are actually pretty good under 10k of margin use. So just to make sure I’m getting this, it’s not that bad of a situation, more that the bank wants to make sure you can cover in cash when shit goes down and then pay interest for the time I held the “loan”"
03/19/2021,stocks,"they gon get their money, you can be sure of that

(meant to reply to op not you, but whatever)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Because your broker can force you to cover at any time and they often do at the worst time. Even if you always pick the right stock (which is unlikely) short term volatility will lead to you having to sell at a loss many many times. Then you’ll never be able to get that money back because with less money comes less borrowing power. 

For example, look back at the Nasdaq in early-mid March and imagine your broker forcing you to sell at the bottom of that.

If you really want to leverage it’s better to just get a real loan from somewhere. I won’t recommend you do that either but it’s a lot less risky than using margin, assuming you find a good borrow rate."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Your broker doesn't want you to owe them money. So they will make sure you are always above $0 net. In your example, you borrowed $5, and own $10 of shares, balance is $5. If the value of the shares approach $5, then you get close to owing them money, so they are going to want you to put in more money or sell some shares."

Simple tax issue. So how do you keep these prices down, by raising the bids on bond auctions. Keeping prices lower and they can drive them down.

As I understand it banks are already not lending anything, interest rates being low is a sign they want the most liquid instruments rather than are competing to give out loans."
03/19/2021,stocks,"It's also very possible that banks have been considering this for some time now and may be the culprit for the sudden spike in yields leading up to now.  If this is true, we may be through the worst.  I don't think we'll 100% know until the April 12 10-year bond auction."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I guess it depends on how well banks prepared for this.  If they didn't do enough and now have to scramble, I guess this means they might sell their bonds to get them off the books?  As you noted, I think it could mean a downward pressure on bond prices, and so yields going up a bit more.

Either way I expect bond yields to keep rising this year."

03/19/2021,stocks,"After the 2008 crisis federal regulators required banks to have a min. 3% capitol to book value ratio. They relaxed that requirement during COVID to free up some of the capitol at the big banks for loans and to help stimulate the economy.  Now they just announced that the requirement will go back into effect when it was kind of expected that the FED would extend it because we're not out of COVID yet.  But they didn't and banks book values have swelled during COVID (more people making deposits, more loans made, savings have grown, equity values have grown significantly, etc.)  They are not going to want to purchase bonds at this point further increasing there book value, in fact many banks will probably start looking to offload them onto other smaller banks.  Treasury yields move inverse to price so as bonds look unattractive, yield prices go up.  And we know how the yield prices have been destroying the NASDAQ.  I think this might be the catalyst to start the real correction in tech and growth stocks."

This is the feds thinking and of course they could be right and the recent spike over the last 2 months may have been the banks raising capitol and accounting for this.

If you are betting towards the downside you may need at least mid April to realize the drop (if it happens)."

2021-03-19 16:55:47,stocks,"What are the benefits of CRM after Covid-19? Dear Mate,  please share your thoughts about the benefits of CRM :-)

In this modern digital era, it is critical to attracting new customers, nurture the existing customers and retain the customers. After the covid-19 situation, brands have moved their business from physical location to online digital platforms. For such reasons, brands are getting advantages to implementing automation on the website. The automation is so powerful that the brand doesn't let any customer lost through the custom relationship management software, commonly called CRM software.

Moreover, CRM helps a brand in multiple ways to optimize the brand's effectiveness in treating its customers to satisfy their needs and requirements. However, there are some benefits that encourage brands to implement CRM software on their website.

1. **It collects multiple data from multiple sources in multiple formats and stores them in one place to serve better and provide recommendations to the clients and users as well.**
2. **The CRM software automatically engages with the existing customers or subscribers about the event, promotions, or discounts. So no more extra efforts consumed to inform anything to customers.**
3. **Via CRM software, brands can target subscribers and customers with better promotional tools via email marketing. CRM also provides data and information about the movements of the customer from email to website.**
4. **CRM software integrates with social media marketing, gives the power to the brand to optimize all the campaigns with automation.**
5. **The major benefit of CRM is to give customer support service to the clients. Even during the purchase cycle, customers won't be lost because they will be communicated and supported by the automation throughout the process. This makes a brand more authentic via CRM software.**
6. **Analytics of big data captured via CRM software gives valuable insights to the brand to target and re-target the according to the target audience's preferences.**

There are few advantages, but the giants are exploring the CRM tool to make it more effective to achieve their primary goal by reducing the cost and expenses of hiring human resources when it can be done in a very professional, effective, and efficient way.

2021-03-19 16:48:10,stocks,"SEC Pattern Day Trading Rules (Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts) SEC PATTERN DAY TRADER RULES

Cash Accounts vs. Margin Accounts

Cash accounts have unlimited day trading, but cannot trade with ""unsettled funds"", which require ""T+2"" (trade day, plus two more days) to become useable again. Brokerages will always use your settled funds first. You will be flagged for a ""good faith violation"" if you buy and sell a stock on the same day, but only if that stock was purchased with unsettled funds (proceeds gained from selling another stock that same day that did not sit for two days after purchasing it). If the stock is more than three days old, then when you sell it, the funds are settled immediately, and ready to use right away.

So to be clear : with a cash account, you can always buy and sell the stock same day, no matter what, but at a slight penalty to your operational liquidity. Account restrictions will be imposed for 90 days on the second good faith violation occurence using unsettled funds (no time limit). On the third violation, you are permanently branded with the PDT (Pattern Day Trader) label. They will not physically stop you from buying with unsettled funds until these restrictions are already triggered. It is up to you to keep up with it. Many times, you will not be notified in a timely manor, and will discover your account locked at the worst possible time.

The margin system was actually created as an end around loophole to the T+2 system (used to be T+3). It was created as instant micro loans to allow people to use their stocks as collateral while settling. But times have changed. In this age of instant everything, where buy and sell orders are not hand written, mailed, or over wire service, it really is preposterous that we do not have instant settled funds, just like we would at our bank, online, or at a casino/dog track.

Solutions :

Use two or three brokerages to spread out your day trades, thus avoiding the ""three strikes in one week"" PDT label and limitations at any one brokerage.

...or...

Only use one third of your money on any given day, on a rotating basis, at one brokerage, same result.

...or...

Get your account balance over $25,000 by any means necessary, then the PDT label will be meaningless, and will become your badge of honor."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The one thing I've never been clear on is, Do you have to have the $25k Just sitting there unused?  Or does just your total account value need to be over 25k?  So as long as the value of all your holdings stays over 25k, you can day trade as much as you want?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Not to be pedantic, you get the good faith violation on the SELL. just to clarify that. It inherently means you have to buy then sell like you said, but I see people get worried about buying with unsettled funds.

03/19/2021,stocks,"A part thats missing here:

If you have the 25k and get flagged as a PDT you get 4x your account in spending power for day trades (you just have to be out of the trade by the end of the day).

03/19/2021,stocks,"This is very interesting.

We need a little more info.

Let's say for easy math that you bought 100 shares of XYZ on Monday morning for $10.00 each.

You immediately set up ONE auto sell order for all 100 shares at $11.00 each.

When the stock spiked that day, the system recognized your auto sell at $11.00 per share, but did not sell it all, instead selling part in two separate transactions?

The only way you would end up with two separate transactions and/or prices, is if you were using the MARKET price function (never use) instead of the LIMIT price function (always use).

Now, sometimes when your auto buy/sell order triggers, then pops up on an algorithm to process, or occasionally comes across a real live broker's screen to fill... sometimes they cannot find (buying) or get rid of (selling) the stock in question all in one lump, which results in two or three transactions to fill the entire order.

But again, the price will usually be the same (or better in your favor) if you are calling your shot by using the LIMIT price function. Market is quicker and easier, but allows you to get screwed during quick volatility swings."

2021-03-19 16:28:47,stocks,"Peloton (PTON) DD and Analysis I’ve only been studying stocks for the past year, and this is my first in-depth DD, so please feel free to point out mistakes or leave me constructive criticism.

**Warning:** This is very long, but there's a TL;DR at the end

**Disclosure:** I bought 18 shares at $113.8 halfway through doing my DD. I plan to buy more if the price drops below $100.

I’m long-term bullish, but I’ll be trying to look at the negatives too. I’ll be going over Peloton’s background and future goals, its target market, competitors, financials, and where I see it going in the long-term.

First, here’s a very basic overview of the bull vs. bear arguments on this stock as I see them.

**Bull Hypothesis**: Peloton will be the future of connected fitness, essentially becoming the Netflix of the fitness world. It will dominate in the commercial gym and higher-income market as well as among fitness buffs, and it will also branch into the lower-income market/casual exercisers taking a section of that market share also.

**Bear Hypothesis:** Peloton’s stock price is grossly overhyped, and its PE ratio is unreal. This is a pandemic stock, and after we recover from the pandemic, it’s going to come crashing down to reality. Other big competitors such as Apple will undercut Peloton preventing it from dominating the market. Or, there will be so many competitors that no single company will gain significantly. Either way, Peloton can’t sustain these levels and will crash long-term.

Arguments for bullish stance:

1. At-home exercise has increased and will continue to increase thanks to the convenience and cheaper cost compared to a gym, and therefore, Peloton will continue to grow as a company over the coming years.

2. Covid will have more people going back to the gym gradually, but many will still be more cautious, and still others will have already bought into the at-home fitness system. Some will use a hybrid of gym and at-home workouts.

3. Peloton is looking to become established in gyms. If they are able to succeed in this, it would make people more likely to subscribe to their app personally as well.

4. The health and wellness industry is valued at 6,033.2 billion dollars, so there is plenty of room for growth for this stock. Peloton is branching out into apparel, and will likely also do nutritional products in the future. Subscriptions, apparel, and nutritional products are going to greatly increase revenue.

Arguments for bearish stance:

1. Peloton will not continue to grow after covid, or it will grow at a much slower level which will drop the stock value over the next 1-2 years. Right now the stock value is overblown and needs to be brought back down to a reasonable level based on its current financials.

2. People enjoy going to the gym and once covid is over, they will be happy to go back, and at-home fitness will stagnate.

&#x200B;

* **Peloton’s Background and Future Goals**

So, a quick overview. Peloton is an 8-year old company that founded the pairing of gym equipment with online workout classes. It started with a bike and cycling classes. The idea is that you buy the bike (fitted with a screen) and subscribe to a monthly membership that gives you access to livestream or recorded classes, allowing you to exercise at home. You can track things like your heart rate and compare your progress to others via the leaderboard. There’s also a community/social media element to it wherein you can follow other people to see their profile/workout progress, video chat with friends, send people virtual high-fives to support them, etc.

The CEO, John Foley, is a health nut who founded Peloton after he didn't want to fork out for a personal trainer. He found classes better, but as he got busier didn't have time to attend. That's how he came up with the concept.

The aim of Peloton is to create an online version of real-world gym classes without the hassle of going there or paying as much for the membership/fitness classes. Currently, Peloton is branching out into other gym equipment. They have brought out a treadmill, and in December 2020 they acquired a fitness equipment maker, Precor (one of the world’s largest suppliers of commercial equipment), indicating they plan to make a variety of equipment adapted to their concept. They also provide a subscription-only service which allows people on a budget to exercise without the expensive equipment, and they also provide classes that don’t need any equipment at all (e.g. yoga, body workouts).

&#x200B;

* **Target Market**

Peloton has started out aiming at a higher-income market as well as serious fitness buffs. According to the CEO, this is because they knew their equipment was too expensive to appeal to the average consumer. However, they do plan to branch out into the market of lower-income consumers as well as those who exercise on a more casual basis. They’ve started by creating their app-only subscription which doesn’t require equipment and is cheaper at $12.99/mo (the all-access membership on equipment is $39/mo). They are also working on making cheaper versions of their equipment.

Peloton is not only aiming to target at-home fitness users, but also to get its equipment in the commercial sector. This is where the real money could potentially be made. While at-home fitness is a more accessible market for competitors, whoever becomes the dominant system in the commercial sector is more likely to become the dominant system in general. The online community and content are going to be crucial for every company in this sector going forward since it will make or break whether more people wish to join up and stay within that community.

*What would be the benefits of the commercial sector?*

If Peloton becomes the established name in gyms and hotels, users will be able to access their own personal account and stats from anywhere in the world. On holiday? No problem, you can still continue your workout. Already joined a gym? That’s cool. You can still create an account for free on the gym equipment with access to the Peloton classes for that equipment. Maybe it’ll get you hooked. Maybe you’ll get your own subscription so you can access the other classes. Commercial Pelotons also give you the option of buying your very own Peloton equipment while you use it, so if you’ve never tried Peloton and discover you like the experience you can conveniently buy home equipment for yourself while you’re on it.

So, we see here that Peloton has a lot of potential, hence people’s excitement. At-home fitness was starting to gain ground before the pandemic, but of course the pandemic really made it rocket. This is an exciting growth sector, but like any business it comes with risk. One of the biggest risks is competitors, so let’s look at them next.

&#x200B;

* **Competitors**

There are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:

Apple Fitness +

iFit/NordicTrack

FIIT

&#x200B;

**Apple**

First, let’s tackle the behemoth – Apple. Apple brought out its Fitness + app in December 2020. It caused a bit of a stir since, let’s face it, it’s Apple. They have a fantastic track record of being innovative with excellent marketing, and as a company they have plenty of money and clout to invest into their product. They also already have a market share of ready-made consumers in the form of Apple product owners. Anyone who has an ipad, iPhone or Apple TV can start using it for a cheaper $9.99/mo.

In my opinion, there’s no doubt that Apple is going to get a share of the market, but the question is how large will that market share be, and is it really a threat to Peloton?

Currently, Android controls the mobile OS market with a 71.93% share.

Apple has 28.07% of market share on phones

26.4% of market share on tablets

2% market share on TVs (Apple TV)

Even if Apple manages to convince all of its current users to subscribe to Fitness+ (which would be fantastic for Apple), it still leaves a massive share of the market open for non-Apple users.

Also, an Apple Watch is required if you want to be able to track your workout progress in a similar way to Peloton. Otherwise you have to input your information manually. An Apple Watch is cheaper than buying Peloton equipment of course, but it does provide another obstacle for those wishing to have the whole experience. For everyday fitness users or those on a budget, something like FIIT or iFit will probably be more attractive.

Another very important factor is that Peloton subscriptions can also be used with Apple devices including the watch, so people can just as easily sign up for that although the monthly cost is slightly more expensive.

Apple certainly has its advantages, and I think if they invested in integrated gym equipment they could be a real contender against Peloton, but as it stands, it appears they are focusing on a content-only style, and are aiming at the more casual fitness user who don’t need top-notch. Using an Apple Watch and ipad with some other adaptable gym equipment is not going to allow for certain metrics in the same way you’re going to get with a Peloton. As a result, Apple has a much more basic leaderboard, less of a social community, and more basic metrics. This is fine for the everyday casual user, but Peloton is going to be preferable for those who take their fitness seriously, or who have the income to drop some extra money into a more expensive, but higher quality experience.

According to Ben Williams, global CXO of the innovation consulting agency [r/GA](https://www.reddit.com/r/GA/), who has worked with brands including Nike, Equinox, and SoulCycle on designing connected fitness products and services. *“Peloton is a little more on the performance end of the spectrum, and Apple’s more of an everyday fitness kind of audience. There are certainly users in the middle, especially among Peloton subscribers who don’t own the hardware; if Apple and Peloton butt heads, it’ll be over that group.""* ([https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes](https://www.theverge.com/21454265/apple-fitness-plus-competitors-gyms-exercise-fitness-workouts-watch-bikes))

**FIIT**

FIIT is a UK-based app that is now available in 175 countries including the US. It does classes with and without equipment, as well as barre classes. It's £20/mo, although it's £10/mo if you get a yearly subscription. I couldn’t find the US pricing, but as of writing, £20 should be equivalent to approx. $28 and £10 approx. $14, so prices should be somewhere around there.

Fiit has lower barrier to entry since you can use it with any equipment, it comes with a heart rate chest strap, and it also syncs with Apple Watch and Fitbits. Like PTON it has a leaderboard and personal board to try and beat your own rankings. However, it is less detailed than PTON's leaderboard. Fiit also offers both live and recorded classes.

One downside for Fiit is it only plays on phones, so in order to watch Fiit classes on a TV, tablet, laptop, etc. you must manually connect it to your phone. This wouldn't be a big obstacle for people who are focused on budget over convenience, but might be for other parts of the market (e.g. those not technologically-minded or those who just want an easy setup). You can use it on the TV without a manual connection to your phone if you have SkyQ.

FIIT has some potential in the content-only sector, but it doesn’t appear to be competing in the equipment sector, so, like Apple, it is a competitor for the mid- to lower-income/casual fitness user market.

**iFit/NordicTrack**

Currently, this is the competitor I see as a bigger threat to Peloton. Unlike Apple and FIIT, iFit does pair with NordicTrack gym equipment. NordicTrack is a bit cheaper than Peloton bikes, and they come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).

While NordicTrack is currently focusing on at-home equipment and not commercial equipment, it could draw some of the less-tapped mid-range market (e.g. fitness buffs on a budget and more casual fitness users with a mid-range income). Then there’s the threat that it moves into the commercial market later.

Some other pluses for iFit are –

It uses terrain mapping data drawn from Google Maps API to emulate i

1. Its terrain mapping system. *(""iFit uses terrain mapping data drawn from the Google Maps API to emulate the inclines and declines of the map you've drawn, and it also pulls scenery from Google Street View so you can see where you're biking. Maybe you don't need to go outside during quarantine after all. "")*

2. It has a faster repair service than Peloton at this time. Customers of iFit report that repairs take a week with Nordictrack vs weeks with Peloton.

You can read about Peloton vs. iFit here ([https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/peloton-vs-nordictrack)).

iFit/NordicTrack are trailing behind Peloton at the moment with regards to brand awareness and spreading its product. Whether or not it can catch up is going to depend on its marketing skills over the next few years. However, while it’s possible it could gain some market share for the commercial sector, it will have a tough time beating Peloton as market leader, and I believe it will not be doing so for the high-income sector since its focus is on appealing to the low to mid-income sector by making their product more affordable. Peloton has achieved a cult status, and much like designer goods, that can make it more desirable even (or especially) for lower incomes, whereas being initially seen as the more “affordable option” makes it harder to rank up.

So, while I expect NordicTrack to take some decent market share in future, I think there is more than enough of the fitness industry market to go around, and it will not hinder Peloton’s growth in any significant way over the next couple of years.

&#x200B;

* **Financials**

Ok, so that’s competitors. Let’s look at financials.

Peloton doesn't have a long history yet, and the pandemic obviously gave them a boost, so financials will only take us so far here. So far, their financials have seen a significant increase though net income amount is quite small in comparison to revenue.

We saw a 104.4% increase in revenue from September 2019 - December 2019 before the pandemic had emerged on the world stage and been seen as an issue. The net income, however, did decrease by 5 million and operating income decreased by 11 million.

This appears to be due to an increased amount of investment in R&D. By Q1 (March 2020), operating/net income increased slightly despite R&D expenses also increasing, which is a good sign imo. In Q2 (June 2020), the company was well into the green and R&D expenses dropped significantly, increasing again in the 2nd and 3rd quarters. This on top of increased S&G expenses seems to have reduced their general operating profit although it is still firmly in the green (59 million operating income as of Dec. 2020).

I've taken the year from Dec. 2019 - Dec. 2020 as measurement of the company's financial health since from Dec. 2019 shows a small slice of its progress pre-pandemic after the initial furore of going public.

· Revenue increased 99.55% (-446m to 1065m).

· Net income increased 216.4% (-55m to 64m).

· Operating income increased 195.2% (-62m to 59m)

· Operating expenses increased 41.3% (259m to 366m)

· R&D Expenses increases 128.6% (21m to 48m)

As we can see, operating expenses have increased much less in relation to the revenue/income. R&D expenses, while having a high percentage increase, are acceptable to me since it is a growing company, it is not putting it in the red financially, and it's a reinvestment into the company's growth.

Debt has slowly but steadily increased per quarter also. Net debt is currently at -619 mil. If PTON were to continue at a growth of debt of 59mil per quarter (as was reported last quarter) it would take 10 years to pay off. However, taking into account that it is currently in growth phase I'd expect PTON to increase their net income within 2 years (thanks to their subscription service), hopefully putting it at a steadier pay-off phase.

Retained earnings showed a dip in Dec. 2019 and Mar. 2020 after IPO, but is steadily increasing (albeit still heavily in the red). As of Dec. 2020 retained earnings are -561 mil. This does hold risk, but I'm personally positive on their growth and am giving allowance for their reinvestment and growth at this early point.

It's not good for shareholders at this point though as there is a lot of uncertainty over whether Peloton can maintain the level of growth that they had during the pandemic. I am of the opinion, that while they might not maintain the same level of growth, they are still going to grow considerably, especially over 2021 when many of us are still locked into the pandemic. Also, looking at their financials, they were heading in the right direction pre-pandemic. The fact that they were given a boost in 2020 is a bonus. If they can continue to maintain their ratio of income to operating expenses, which they have been doing so far, then they’re in a strong financial position imo.

Added to that, they have spread into Australia and have plans to spread into Asia, so providing this goes successfully, their income overall should only increase.

&#x200B;

* **Fundamentals**

You can check out the fundamentals in this article - [https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/](https://www.investors.com/research/peloton-stock-buy-now/)

I haven’t studied fundamental analysis yet, so I’m relying on the experts for this information. As far as I can tell it seems pretty positive.

&#x200B;

* **Management**

First here’s some background on the leaders.

The founder John Foley is a health nut who came up with the concept. He’s described as a jack-of-all-trades having worked software, hardware, e-commerce, content production, marketing and gyms. He went to Harvard Business School, and is the founder of pronto.com and proust.com which, by the looks of it, didn’t succeed. He was also the president of eCommerce at Barnes & Noble. As founder of Peloton, he says he emphasises a focus on approachability – not having the hierarchical approach where the big bosses are lording it over the rest of the employees.

The current Peloton president was ex-CEO of Barnes & Noble which oversaw the launch of Nook. He resigned due to poor sales, though both he and Foley state that it couldn't win anyway since they were too late to the game behind Amazon. He was also a co-founder of gifts.com, and was Executive Vice President of Marketing and General Manager of [HSN.com](http://hsn.com/) He also served as VP for HSN, running the growing HSN.com e-commerce site. From 2000-2004, Lynch was vice president and general manager of e-commerce, for Palm Inc., where he oversaw Palm's Web properties. His earlier career included brand management positions at Seagram Universal and Guinness.

Peloton has generally high reviews (4-4.5 stars on websites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Peloton-Interactive-Reviews-E734449.htm) and [indeed](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Peloton/reviews)). It’s reported to have excellent employee benefits such as a no-vacation policy (people can take time off whenever they like for as long as they choose), 401k, medical and dental, college loan down payments, as well as child care and mental health telemedicine services. Another positive point to note is that on Glassdoor, one of the approval points (most voted for) is that people approve of the CEO.

I checked out the negative reviews, and a lot of them complain about a clique-y culture amongst staff, as well as disorganized or unfriendly management (often playing favourites). Most of these complaints seem to be in the lower-tier jobs of assembly/retail.

&#x200B;

* **Price Target/Conclusion**

Although I think Peloton will be volatile as lockdowns end and potentially go down for the short-term, I believe Peloton will do well long-term.

The difficulty right now is in how disconnected the share price is from the actual value, and deciding if it will, as the bears say, crash down to reality (aka a price that more accurately reflects its financials). In this area, it’s mainly speculation as far as I can tell, since growth stocks are held up by belief in the future of the company. This means a lot of the tangible growth may already be price in.

PTON’s LTM PE ratio is currently 190.9 x at time of writing which is ridiculously high, but with the expected growth in revenue is forecast to make it a PE ratio of 4.3 x in the next 12 months.

While I’m very leery of the fact that the stock is so disconnected from its underlying value at this point, the P/CF ratio and future forecasts put me more at ease. I think it’s still a riskier stock so I don’t plan to invest heavily, but I’m of the belief it will adjust long-term.

Analysts are expecting PTON to double its revenue over 2021, which, providing they maintain their same consistency in expenses, would put them at approx. $1.2 billion in net income. Compare this to 2019 when it was at $-53 million.

It’s difficult to compare this stock to others since it’s a leader in a new market niche. However, if we compare it to Netflix (a similar leader and disruptor) which has a net income of $2.76 billion and a current share price of approx. $530 per share, half that would have PTON around the $200 - $260 mark. Another point of note for me is that PTON accurately forecast there would be 4 million members out there in 2017, which it has now gained. Now the company is forecasting 100 million PTON members out of the 200 million gym goers. This would be a massive gain although, of course, it would take several years. [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/06/peloton-commercial-at-ces/)

At the moment, Netflix has 203.67 million subscribers. If Peloton could eventually get even half of the amount it is forecasting, it would put its share price in excellent standing.

As a pessimist, I don't think it will reach $200+ in 2021 with a $1.2 billion income since PTON is a different business model, has a different product, and other financials vary. Also, due to fears about the ending pandemic, overhype and competitors, it may progress more slowly and volatilely.

I’m conservative about Peloton’s optimism of gaining half the market, but I’m overall bullish for their future. I’m of the opinion that, while Peloton may drop in the short-term due to FUD, I think it will do well if held over 2021 so I see these next few weeks and months as a buying opportunity. I have a price target of between $200-$300 within the next 2-3 years. If it goes higher, great. Analysts seem to support the bullish view – many of them putting price targets of $130 - $200 (I think that’s the max) for 2021.

I consider Peloton a buy now, although personally I’d like it to go a bit lower before buying more since I think short-term FUD has the chance of bringing it down a bit further, and also because I’m a newbie at this and it’s a volatile stock. If it goes sub-100 at any point, I consider it a moderate to strong buy, and if it goes sub-90 I consider it a very strong buy. I myself, will not be putting a large amount into it, but I may add a few more shares to my position gradually as it falls (if it continues to fall). All this uncertainty over the pandemic ending seems like an excellent entry point for PTON.

**\[Note:** *While I was writing this DD, news also broke about a child dying due to one of the treadmills. Of course, this is a terrible thing to have happened to the family, and I feel bad to have to talk about it in terms of what it may do to the stock, but sadly that’s part and parcel of DD.*

*There are not details at time of writing as to how this child died. It is listed in Peloton equipment instructions for children and pets not to be near the equipment, and there is even a safety key that is to be removed when not using the equipment. I personally do not blame Peloton for it. Sadly, treadmill deaths, while rare (3 deaths per year on average), have happened with other companies in the past, but there’s no denying it’s a terrible loss for the family and that Peloton will also likely pay for it in terms of bad PR and a possible lawsuit. They may also need to begin work on making their products more child-friendly although I’m unsure if that will be required since they’re stated as only being for users 16+.*

*Stock has already fallen upon the news, and I won’t be surprised if it drops more between this incident and the general FUD. In my opinion, the next few weeks/months may be quite negative for PTON until they are able to restore trust with consistent earnings, but I still hold to them being a good long-term investment*.**\]**

Anyway, I hope this DD helped someone, and if you have any constructive criticism or advice I’d love to hear it. This was a slog for me since I’m learning as I go, but I enjoyed it. I’ll be practicing DD on other stocks in future so that I can “git gud”. I plan to study renewable energy next, so that may be my next post (providing this post doesn’t get downvoted to hell lol).

**TL;DR:** PTON stock go up, but maybe fall for short-term (Weeks? Months?) Current FUD = Good entry point. PTON be higher end of 2021. PT around $160 EOY, PT $200-300 in 2022-2023."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Solid DD and I'll add a couple of things.  I'm a convert myself - 9 months ago I thought PTON was just another BYND, but I've come around to really believing in the bull thesis.

1) The valuation actually isn't that bad.  The company is still in the growth phase so using earnings multiples is unfair.  On an EV/sales metric, we're looking at trailing EV/sales of 18 and forward EV/sales of only 9.  While they aren't direct competitors, just for reference you can compare those numbers to other growth stocks like ROKU (25/17 respectively) or ETSY (16/12) or DKNG (40/26) etc.

2) The one thing missing from your DD, and the major differentiator between PTON and any other competitor, is the brand value.  I'm not a PTON customer myself, but every person I've spoke to is absolutely in love with it.  Peloton has a cult following, not because of the hardware, but because of the content.  Their instructors are fitness celebrities and people love being part of the community.  Competitors can easily recreate the hardware but copying the content and cult factor is much, much more difficult.  In this regard Peloton is like Tesla, Lululemon, or Apple (at least in the earlier days)."
03/19/2021,stocks,I appreciate seeing a bull and bear case.
03/19/2021,stocks,I think people are missing that Peloton has become a brand name for fitness equipment. I would be interested in seeing how they use there multimedia screen. Could it morph into an app store for content creators? Quite possibly.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Super job for your first DD! Well written and good understanding of key drivers. 

One idea is also to look into what analysts are saying about the stock (to see if maybe they have some additional thoughts to add to your analysis) and it’s also good to have an idea of their price targets for context. 

Another is to actually make a DCF. E.g what kind of revenue growth, margins, etc do you need to reach your expected price targets?

Peers are of course the best to compare with, not sure if Netflix is the best example. They operate in different industries, have different margins, and are at different levels in the business cycle. But I understand it may be difficult in some cases.

Good luck!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Just to add to your bearish sentiment you need to consider that peloton is a fitness fad and all fitness fads fade eventually. For instance I have a side gig as a personal trainer. 5 of my clients have pelotons, and all stopped using it regularly. I know it's a small sample size but I've been in the fitness industry for 15 years now and I've learned that all fitness fads die eventually. Also you mentioned them opening gyms. Gyms actually have terrible margins, the most successful gym chain is planet fitness and that's because they specially target people who are lazy and never use their gym membership. That's why they can charge such a low rate. Over 90% of planet fitness members don't use a gym regularly which means lower overhead for the gym. They've managed to capitalize on the fact that most people are lazy when it comes to fitness. Peloton won't be able to capitalize on this ""lazy"" market share. 

That all being said if they stay out of gyms and focus their capital on their app and in home equipment I think they can be a real market changer. If they decide to go a head and open gyms ill bet against them. I think they truly have a chance to own the entire in home fitness market, but physical gyms will be the death of them."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Well done!! I don’t own a PTON but I run in  that circle and the biggest bull case for me is that those who own are PTON  evangelistic about it !! It’s like a cult which is always a good thing for a company! Plus, competition doesn’t make me nervous-the biggest moat this company has is it gives the owners (majority women) the chance to tell everyone they worked out on their PTON!!! Trust they never say oh I was working out or I’m going to work out! It’s always “I worked out on my PTON the morning”.   I also think it’s wildly overpriced rn but I still own a few shares and plan on adding if there is a massive dip!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nice post! Personally I was thinking that PTON was definitely heading lower but you've given some great food for thought.

My bear case is related to the high valuation of the stock in terms of PE compared the high cost to purchase a bike and the high cost of subscription. The barrier to entry seems to high and the stock rallied on COVID demand which is likely to steeply decline once things open up and people can go back to the gym. Already there are so many fitness bikes up for sale on places like craigslist and FB marketplace as people sell off the bikes they purchased to exercise during quarantine. This doesn't bode well for Peloton, and I have a feeling people are going to have a harder time justifying a $500 per year subscription or making a new purchase for a $2000 bike when gyms and other fitness opportunities open back up in full. 

I think the two things you mention that could make for a bull case are the brand name and possible penetration into commercial gyms. I don't really know anything about how commercial gyms select equipment, so I can't really comment on this. Peloton has definitely built a brand name and I think it is interesting to see the social media aspect of fitness that they have captured but I wonder if that alone gives them a strong enough foothold or not. I would hope to see them build off of this and continue to develop their network and brand, but it's not totally clear how this would work and whether it will be profitable enough to drive the stock price upward. 

Definitely some good ideas and question you bring up here!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nice DD. The financials could be better but frankly that stuffs kinda hard so I don't fault u. Idk how to approximate that stuff either for a early stage growth company like peloton. 

With this company I think ur either one of two ppl. U think it's a fad cause of wfh and are out. Or u think it's here to stay and got first mover benefits and a fantastic branding. 

I'm of the latter. Out of the competitors u posted iFit while it looks good, no one is buying that over peloton due to branding and marketting. Even echelon exists which is much cheaper but ppl still want to buy 'the real thing'. People call their pelotons , a peloton, not their indoor bike. The business model also features a lot of charismatic and popular (on social media) influencer type instructors which I'm a big fan of. On the employment side I've also seen them hire some legit ppl for R&D engineering which is a good sign for me. 

I think FUD this year will be a good entry point. Before it took off it was trading at around 70. But even at 90 is a really good buy for someone long term bullish.

One bear case for peloton and any real fitness related thing is the fad nature. Personally while I believe in the business look at soul cycle. But then again there's things like crossfit which became mega cult like so who knows."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Great analysis! I came across Peloton in January 2020 and after reading their earnings report I realized what an incredible company it is, and it looked quite cheap from a P/S standpoint. I started buying shares hand over first around $30, when everywhere I looked people were hating on it. Who's laughing now, shorts?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Not gonna lie... for the longest time I got Palantir and Peloton confused...
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’m averaged in at around 75 and it’s been a wild ride but after finally getting my own bike; I’m a believer in the long term value of this company. It’s an absolutely superior product and their software is pretty refined. 

Will be picking up more for the long run."
03/19/2021,stocks,"There isn’t anything to prevent the more established fitness equipment companies from entering this space. Nordictrack and Percor have more know-how with building durable workout machines, all they need to do is attach a wifi connected screen.

You also missed that on youtube there are a ton of content makers who hope to get subscribers by offering free live classes like the ones PTON is charging for.

Most importantly i think you haven’t mentioned anything about the recent “cancel and reorder” nonsense new users have complained about on social media. Making so many people re-order causes normal people to question PTON’s customer service, but savvy investors see that and wonder if what really happened is PTON trying to count sales twice by having people re-order instead of just changing the earlier order.

Great DD but i can spot a hype stock trading at nearly 200 earning from a mile away. IMHO this is a $50-60 stock."
03/19/2021,stocks,BULLISH on PTON
03/19/2021,stocks,"Excellent DD, maybe a bit too much text but it reads well and has all the important stuff in there. 

Nice one!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Excellent write up, very interesting to read all prospective.
My biggest concern for PTON is, competing with Apple and specifically Apple One.

PTON is targeted towards somewhat rich/premium audience, but that audience would already be on Apple train(most likely)
I use Apple fitness and liking it and would not be surprised if it growing more as more content gets added."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the thorough writeup. I'm very ""medium"" on PTON. The biggest thing is if they can establish their brand. If so I'll stay in long.

Disclaimer: bought a tiny like 5 shares at the beginning of COVID when I saw everyone and their sister buying a $2k bike with subscription. Became more bullish when they released an app."
03/19/2021,stocks,devil's advocate take: this stock will not recover after the bad PR from the child dying from their Tread+ product
03/19/2021,stocks,"Holy shhh, did you write all this just to post it on Reddit ?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I have had zero faith in Peloton since their IPO, I've obviously been wrong so far, but I am perfectly happy being wrong and never putting a penny into a company I don't believe in."
03/19/2021,stocks,"you made me read all this nonsense, now I know even less than when I began reading this.

full disclosure : I am short PTON. I am shorting the shares. I am in profit 50%. 

&#x200B;

this is a totally BS company, absolute not needed in this society. What is next for PTON ? an elliptical with a screen and a cracked out instructor ? OR, a rowing machine with a screen ? 

AND THE NAIL IN THE COFFIN FOR ME, is that sooner or later, subscription models will be replaced with 'pay to play' models. 

this company is fragile."
03/19/2021,stocks,uh didn't a child just die on one of the treadmills?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Your final point is huge. My fiancée got us a peloton in November and I was like yea whatever, I guess I’ll do more cardio. Gotta admit I love it now, not because I’m in love with indoor biking, I had never done it before actually and had never done a group fitness class with an instructor (probably still won’t). The peloton is a ton of fun, great music selections, the instructors are knowledgeable and motivating, inspiring even (not to mention they’re all beautiful people). While I don’t openly preach the peloton to people, when I connect with someone and it turns out they have one they’re usually ecstatic to talk about it with me. I’ve even imagined getting the treadmill and I don’t fucking run lol. They have a great thing going and as long as they continue striving for growth they’re going to be huge over the next 5-10 years. I don’t have any positions either but now I think I’ll look into buying in"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks very much for the info! I'd class myself as a convert too. I wasn't bothered about the product and just chose it to practice DD on, but researching it has made me want their product and see the potential. 

I see what you mean about the brand value. I'm not their target market, but even I want one, and somehow I want it to be Peloton and not a different brand. It just has an image of being better. What that tells me is that their marketing psychology has worked on me. I'm too poor to buy it, but providing they still have that good reputation for their content and classes, I probably will in the future.

I didn't go much into the brand value since I view it as a variable that could change easily, especially in these early days, but you're right that it's a major factor that should be accounted for. I'll keep that in mind for future DDs.

Thanks for the info regarding valuation. That makes sense that multiples can't be applied in the same way for a growth stock. I'm still learning all the metrics, so I'll look more deeply into the ones you mentioned for my next DD."
03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks very much for your feedback and advice! Noted on the analysts and DCF. I'll take that on board and try to apply it for my next DD.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I really appreciate hearing this insight from someone who has been in the fitness industry. I agree - they need to stay in their lane and focus on owning the entire home fitness market. I will say though: we've had a peloton for about 6 months now. I was an avid gymgoer before but once COVID hit and two kids later, it just makes more sense for me to work out at home and save on that commute time. I imagine there are a lot of people in that situation. If there were a gym in walking distance that would be one thing, but the convenience factor is huge."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your input. It helps me to hear another take on it. I'm going to need to look more into the fad side of it since that's a fair point. I've been more focused on the potential of the technology, but the staying ability of Peloton as a brand name is also where a lot of risk lies and it's a lot harder to predict.

With regards to the gyms, I was more thinking that Peloton would supply the current gyms rather than open their own gyms so overhead wouldn't be an issue. I believe they've already started, but I'm undecided as yet, as to how gyms in general would respond to adopting Pelotons. What do you think?

On the one hand, it may save them some overhead in paying for their own fitness instructors and classes, but on the other, it could have the disadvantage of taking those ""lazy"" customers you mentioned from the gym altogether if they decide it's easier just to buy and use Peloton at home. 

However, I think there would still be a niche for gyms to provide the future full selection of Peloton machines which most people won't be able to afford at home. I'm not entirely sure of Peloton's aims here aside from, currently, they're focusing on the leisure sector (hotels and resorts and the like)."
03/19/2021,stocks,I bet those clients still pay $40 a month though
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thank you! :) You're right, it really seems culty, which is great for the bull case! Hopefully it's not a fad and stays a popular brand, but even if it were a fad, I'd expect it to last at least a year or two, which is still enough time for some good profit in the stock."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thank you! I really appreciate your bearish input on it. 

The PE ratio is one of the reasons I picked this stock actually. I saw it was wildly overvalued, but then saw that analysts were giving it high PTs and I had no idea why or what the best position was, so I thought I'd practice DD on it to find out.

I agree with you regarding the barrier to entry. If PTON wasn't already aimed at the high-income sector I'd be bearish on it in that regard, but instead I'm of the belief that its high prices and cult-like brand are what is giving it the edge over many of its competitors post-pandemic. 

Although I think at-home fitness will continue to increase since it's more convenient (as well as the fact remote working has been given a boost by the pandemic), it makes sense that it will slow. However, I think people with higher incomes are going to be putting their convenience first because they can afford to do so, and the fact that PTON is focusing on the commercial sector unlike most of its competitors gives it some real potential.

The uncertainties for me are 1) The high-income market is limited, and 2) Will they be able to dominate gyms?

Like you, I'm not entirely sure about gyms. I think the fact they've already started supplying some gyms is a bullish sign, but the rest is where I'm betting and taking a risk.

I found [this resource](https://www.pelobuddy.com/travel/map/) that shows which gyms and hotels they're already in, but I haven't investigated yet whether this is enough for it to be a safe bet.

You make a good point about the high subscription price being justified, btw. It's fine for the high-income market, but if they plan to also get more of the middle and lower-income markets in future, charging $39.99/month to people who buy the equipment vs. charging only $12.99 to those without the equipment seems pretty silly since it won't encourage those outside of the high-income sector to purchase their equipment. In my opinion, they need to change their pricing model if they want to get a better market share there."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thank you. :) Yeah, unfortunately I've only scratched the surface of learning financials and I suck at maths, so it's my weak point. I feel like it's going to take me another year of study to feel even vaguely competent analysing that part, lol.

I think you're right about the two types, and only time will tell as to which side is right. I'm willing to lose my investment if I'm wrong, but I believe in connected at-home fitness in general so I'm also invested in another stock that is just starting out. 

Good luck to you if you've also invested!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks very much for the feedback! And you might very well be right with the price target. It's early days, and I haven't invested a lot since I know this is a risky stock, and I'm not very experienced in stocks.

Precor was acquired by Peloton, so I don't think they'll be competing, but I agree Nordictrack has potential to be a major competitor. Imo it really depends on how Peloton and Nordictrack handle the commercial sector and branding. Peloton has the advantage at the moment, but ofc it could change (the recent death being an example).

I didn't know about the cancel and re-order fiasco so thanks for bringing that to my attention. That's good to know and I'll need to look into it.

Regarding the free content online, again that goes into the low income, casual user market so imo it's not part of Peloton's target market right now. It's not going to include the metrics, community and bells and whistles. There's already a separated market between those who want to get more serious about their fitness and pay for apps, and those who look for free content online. 

That's just my take on it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Peloton has a lot of bear cases, but I'm not really concerned with this. Branding and first mover is going to help this company a lot and if this 'fad' of home workout exercises stays post-COVID, this stock is going to do well.

Being grossly overvalued and the 'fad' disappearing is what's concerning to me.

Other companies moving in? Nah."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Good points. Imho though, I think you're underestimating the brand itself that Peloton has built and the celebrity-like status that its instructors have, which really set it apart from Nordictrack and others trying to enter this space. This being said, I also swear by the product (which is always a good reason to be bullish on something), and have tried the youtube classes and other of these monthly fitness programs, but nothing compares to the interface and user experience of Peloton."
03/19/2021,stocks,"To be honest when I think of companies like Nordictrack I think about dusty unused crap boomers have taking up space in their garage. I don't know that those brands have any cachet with gen z/millennials. Also in terms of durable fitness equipment, from the people I know with them I have heard nothing but good things about the build quality of Pelotons.

They're not for me personally but I think old legacy fitness companies are not really a major threat here unless they majorly undercut Peloton on pricing and I don't really see that happening. The pricing on their existing products aren't that low."
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s up 5% today
03/19/2021,stocks,Parents fault. PR baybeee
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that's a possibility too. It's a pretty big deal. I have considered selling my own shares and taking the L, but I'm going to take the risk holding since I think it's big enough to recover."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Lol, if you've read something and know even less, that's quite an accomplishment. I don't think I've ever read something and decreased my knowledge. As for ""making you"", the choice to read it was always yours.

As for shorting it and being in the money, that's great. As I said in my DD, I expect it to go down and be volatile short-term. However, if you think it's going to be down in a year, we disagree."
03/19/2021,stocks,That’s peloton’s fault?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, I mentioned it at the end of my DD. It may have a major negative effect on the stock, but it's hard to tell if it will affect it long-term or short-term."
03/19/2021,stocks,The partnership with Adidas is going to be interesting too.  On the Snacks Daily podcast they were speculating that it isn't really about trying to sell clothing to customers because the profit margins are so slim.  It's actually just a perk to keep the instructors happy (and possibly to recruit new instructors too) by allowing them to design their own workout clothing.
03/19/2021,stocks,"No worries, it's good work.  With respect to multiples, P/E should generally only be used for more established companies that are consistently profitable."
03/19/2021,stocks,100% they are set for owning the home market if they continue this.
03/19/2021,stocks,"If they became a gym equipment supplier I think they would kill it. Peloton already has a big brand name so gyms would feel pressure to have the latest and greatest equipment when they upgrade their equipment. If Peloton we're to offer financing for gym equipment like they do for home I think that would be a huge market.

I'm not to optimistic that the hotel sector will be a huge market. Hotels lost so much money with the pandemic and they don't make money off their gyms so I doubt they will want to put down a bunch of money to update a sector of the hotel that doesn't make money."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah that's a toughie because the high cost subscription is attractive for revenue, particularly considering that new sales will likely slow down with the high cost to buy. If they lower the subscription cost, then it hurts their revenue, and I'm not sure they will be able to find a pricing model that works.

I'm also thinking that it's more of a niche product that really boomed due to the COVID constraints. The problem is that the number of people who are big into fitness but would prefer to work out from home AND can/ are willing to buy a peloton and pay for the subscription is probably pretty low. For peloton to penetrate the gym market there would have to be a reason to buy their equipment over someone else, which would be the video services. But then there is this problem where their ideal customer works out at home so they don't benefit by getting into the gym space because you're not attracting customers with the option to use the peloton video at the gym (people aren't going to want to pay for a gym membership AND a peloton membership on top of that to use the peloton bike at the gym). 

There are probably creative ways around this and they might be able to innovate and create a strong foothold in this area but I think there are significant concerns. I would also be surprise to see this play out well in the short or even medium term... if they are able to establish a dominant role in the fitness industry and expand into these other avenues successfully, I think it would take years. It's interesting and exciting and if you do more DD and like the play then I say go for it, but my tendency is to believe the stock price will trend downwards and settle there for a bit. If puts weren't so expensive I'd put my money where my mouth is haha"
03/19/2021,stocks,Wow i thought they had made a manufacturing agreement with Percor! How did I miss that they acquired them!
03/19/2021,stocks,People who use them have a positive emotional attachment to PTON for sure! Talk about brand loyalty!!! The question is what is their total addressable market.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Ok, interested to see what will happen. Thanks for the post"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Oh shut I didn’t even know that was a thing, that’s dope. The instructors literally wear entirely different fits every time, you won’t see a piece of clothing recycled and it is all peloton branded. It’ll still be great good built in product placement for adidas"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Brilliant, I'm glad to hear that opinion from someone in the industry. :D Their potential to dominate gyms is what's had me most bullish tbh. They've already started supplying equipment to gyms, but whether or not they can become the new standard is still in question. From what I've read, gyms pay for a special subscription that allows anyone using the PTON machine to make their own account. This is why I think it could attract new customers for the hybrid home/gym fitness scheme, or attract the ones who give up the gym and decide to work out at home.

I agree, I don't think the hotel sector will be a huge source of income for them, but my thoughts were that having them, even in a small number of hotels, could draw new customers since they'll have a chance to try Peloton without having to fork out the money, and if they aim at higher-end hotels they'll be hitting their target market of high-income consumers who haven't yet been pulled into the Peloton craze.

For reference, this resource shows hotels and gyms that are using Peloton - [https://www.pelobuddy.com/travel/](https://www.pelobuddy.com/travel/)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"yeah, it was a MASSIVE buy for Precor. Precor needed an uplift, and most of their line are not premium products. Peloton gives Precor a leg in the premium fitness space and gives them reach for their other at-home products that can pair well with Peloton bikes & treads.

Peloton needed to speed up the time from an order to delivery as well as they want to move into the commercial fitness space & that wasn't happening fast enough. Truly a win-win for both companies."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Good news is they can keep expanding their TAM by adding more kinds of fitness classes and equipment types, which they're already doing. Also, they haven't done too much internationally outside of Canada, the UK, and Germany, so there's a lot of room internationally to run once they add support for more languages."

2021-03-19 16:27:46,stocks,"JPM, thoughts? Hey! So I wanted to see what other peoples opinions or predictions are for the future share price of JPM. I invested when it was around $99 a share, currently up 44% which im happy with. 

Looking back on the daily chart, the price just doesnt seem to have slowed down much since last November, apart from a small dip. How much further do you think it can go before it loses steam? Or do you believe it wont climb any higher?

Havent seen any posts recently about JPM, so genuinely curious to see what other peoples positions are and predictions. Also, anybody know why is it that whenever 99% of my portfolio goes into the red for a day, JPM is always in the green? And when the 99% are in the green in a day, JPM is red? Could be a silly question, but always found in interesting!"
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s highly correlated to rising interest rates.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Hold, it’s a solid dividend payer. 5yrs from now today doesn’t matter and it will be higher. I’m not adding but holding."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The reason why JPM is currently rising when everything else (tech) is falling is that banks have a positive correlation with rising interest rates. Interest rates are, in effect, the banks' margins. Therefore, it does not hurt to invest a certain part of the portfolio in bank stocks to protect against rising interest rates.

&#x200B;

And to your other question, I think JPM is a great stock, makes up about 25% of my portfolio. It's by far the best bank you can have. How far it will go I can't estimate. Maybe up to 170/180? But then they would be very expensive."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've been long JPM for several months now as part of my portfolio rebalance away from growth, towards value and other reopening stocks.  Rising interest rates are good for the financial sector."

Are there any brokerage apps for beginning investors that are easier to use?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Some of the easier to use brokerages such as webull and Robinhood utilize payment for order flow. Which routes your orders to particular market makers for execution. This doesn't always guarantee the best prices for it's customers. For that reason I can't recommend either one. TD is more difficult to navigate but it gives you more information and also doesn't use payment for order flow. I'd stick it out with TD but that's just my own opinion.
03/19/2021,stocks,"TD let's you paper trade in real time(real time in prior days), great way to get familiar with the app without going broke, spend the weekend rerunning gme on the days it gained 200+ points, going up and going down, it's a very good trading platform with a small learning curve and paper trading is a great way to learn.

&#x200B;

03/19/2021,stocks,I got ya. Well good luck on your search. Maybe someone else will chime in with the brokerage they use.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Check out Thinkorswim. If you already have TD, all the data is essentially the same. On your positions tab, you can customize the data you see.

So if you only want to see current price, profit - $, %, P/L, net liquidity, etc, you just see-select what you don’t want to see.

Same thing with a ticker. You can collapse or expand the data under the current price and bid/ask. You can also customize that area so if you only want to see basic stuff - like Low, High, Open, Close, 52W High/Low, market cap, etc - you can get rid of what you don’t feel like watching and then always add it back later as you get more acclimated to the different data points and figure out what you feel like keeping tabs on."

The order, issued by the military, advises Tesla owners to park their cars outside of military property, according to people familiar with the directive who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The ban, relayed to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via the cars’ in-built cameras in a way the Chinese government can’t see or control, one of the people said.

They literally only know your device details and your content recommendation profile.

So it’s not the primary use of the video data, but it’s stored and it can be used. Why take that risk?

This is conjecture not fact.  So obviously there’s an agenda behind these type of opinion articles. Fact is that TikTok does everything in its power to comply with every single privacy and data security law in every region it operates. Fact is for the time being at least, TikTok protects user data of all users outside of China.  Fact is that nothing personally identifying is even collected by TikTok besides your face and that is only should you choose to post.

It has monetary value only when applied to a use case such as ad targeting. That’s how TikTok makes money for now.  No one wants to “sell your data” except Facebook once upon a time and after Cambridge Analytica they no longer do. 

But the point is, the camera turns on only when you allow it.  And Apple/Google make sure of that through their SDK’s and are just about bulletproof.  Unauthorized access patterns are caught and result in apps being banned, they have teams that audit applications end to end down to compiled binaries, quadruply so for apps as popular as TikTok. So you can rest assured that if TikTok hasn’t been banned by App Store or Play Store that there is no risk to users.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Who cares how Tik Tok makes money?  Value does not necessarily equate to money.  If Tik Tok has location data of a person working in the Pentagon or the White House, that's valuable.

That data may not have been sold, but you can be damned sure it's valuable.

>  But the point is, the camera turns on only when you allow it. 

People who don't own dogs, have never owned dogs, and don't talk about dogs, can lay their phone down and have a conversation about their dog, and twenty minutes later they're seeing ads about dog food.  If the microphone is always listening even if you aren't using your phone then why is it so difficult to fathom the idea that the camera can see when you aren't using it?  Again, if you think your phone isn't watching and listening, I have property to sell you...

> Why is it so hard to believe that a popular app is safe and secure

Because a healthy dose of paranoia is how secure systems are built.  Security isn't about what an app does or doesn't do, it's about what an app COULD be made to do.  It's not about what the app's administrators do or don't do with the information, it's about what they COULD do with it.  I can't walk into a courthouse with a gun anywhere in the country.  It's not about what I am or am not doing with the gun, it's about what I COULD do with the gun.

Willfully sending data overseas to one of the U.S.' rivals is the opposite of security.  Now, we (and they) may not care about how well the drunk girl's friends can dance or what night club they went to and how long they were there, but the location data of someone who works at the Pentagon?  That might be real interesting to the Chinese government...

Does Tik Tok share information with the Chinese government?  Who knows.  They say they don't, of course, but we can only speculate.  If you want a good security policy, however, you HAVE to assume they do."

Yes in Douyin as part of compliance with the Chinese government, but this type of policy wouldn’t fly in TikTok and would lead to a scandal and tremendous damage to the company.

So if it makes you feel better, TikTok is financially incentivized to grow as a global company and distance itself as far from China policy-wise as it can.  

But what you’ve say you’ve seen so far can be explained by false positives from an imperfect set of content moderation algorithms and TikTok’s anti-bullying and hate-speech policy.  


Content policy in TikTok is driven by American based professionals who follow American regulations to the tee and have no reason to jeopardize their professional careers running a censorship campaign.

Investors (quite rightly) perceive the Chinese market as more uncertain, which is why they demand a higher risk premium (a higher return) for exposing their capital to higher risk.

There was one share sold before and after the 222,995 shares traded and that 1 individual share moved the price more than 222,995 shares.  

The other oddity is that there were also 0 shares sold at the exact same second as the 222,995 shares.  

Does anybody know what was going on?  Unfortunately I'm not able to post pictures here, but there is a screenshot over at [that other site](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8d41h/abnormal_trade_in_after_hours_222995_shares/)..."

Seems like this is the usual MOC trading / reporting in order book.

Read up on MOC [here](https://www.nyse.com/article/nyse-closing-auction-insiders-guide).

The volume is pretty high at that, so this is - imho - tied to the volatile nature of the current stock trajectory with its many actors on both ends of the trade.

Also note that the options chain is currently ITM above the 200 mark. I am pretty sure you'll see a tug of war on Friday shortly before close since the 210-220 are in direct reach."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Alright, today confused the hell out of me. Can anyone help me understand?

Here's what I think happened.

- The Fed announced it would not extend SLR
- SLR reversed a rule from the 2008 crash that was meant to keep the crash from happening again by making it harder for people with no money to get loans
- The rule was paused during COVID-19 to help small businesses that were hemorrhaging money stay afloat
- At first, the market and bank stocks dipped because this means less money is flooding into businesses
- After about 30 minutes, people realized that this is actually a good thing because it makes it less likely that people defaulting on loans will cause a big market crash that collapses the whole economy
- Tech went up because speculation started feeling safer again
- Banks stayed down because a profitable, predatory practice was eliminated

There's a lot of other information here so if there's anything specific anyone would like me to share from the document, feel free to ask. I don't think that would be illegal/unethical, huh?

Edit: Also, FYI there are four proposals being voted on:

1) to increase the authorized capital stock of Tilray from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 890,000,000 shares of Class 2 common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.

2) approve the issuance of Tilray Class 2 common stock to Aphria shareholders 

3) to allow the compensation that may be paid to Tilray's named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions contemplated by the Arrangement Agreement.

4) to allow for postponement of the vote if there are not enough proxy votes available at the time of the meeting"

*Nothing.* Absolutely nothing.

I pulled data on the last 20 years of Quad Witching Days and learned that, on average, they're actually slightly *less* volatile than normal days.

Today is actually going to be the first day in a long time where ~~*nothing happens.*~~ There's ~~*no*~~ *is* JPow, *is* ~~*no*~~ bond surprises, ~~*no*~~ *is* reports on the economic outlook of our country. It's ~~*just*~~ *not* going to be a normal day.

My daily predictions have been really bad lately, ~~but I feel a bit more confident now that we're on a day without surprises. I think that we're going to try really, really hard to break through resistance at NASDAQ 13,191 today -- which isn't too far up from where we're going to open -- but we're not going to succeed.~~

Today will end red with a NASDAQ high of 13,191. We may have temporary support at 13,113, but will see lows of at least 12,996.

03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm convinced most retail investors determine whether a stock is over valued or under valued simply by looking at the chart. 

If the price is at or close to all time highs then it's over valued. And if the price is at or near all time lows then it's under valued. 

This inevitably causes many people to buy dogshit companies because the share price is low and this tricks them into thinking they're ""value investing"", which then causes them to miss out on incredible companies whose share price is high. Then as the price of said incredible company rises more, it reinforces their opinion that the stock is over valued even more than it was before, which obviously makes them avoid the stock even more. 

They're basically choosing not to invest in a company because the stock price goes up. Isn't that the most insane thing you've ever heard? Yet it seems that's what most retail investors are in fact subconsciously doing.

Investing psychology is such a fascinating subject."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Honestly the big guys were panicking this morning, but nothing has changed from before. Bond yields are up and we have a Green Day across the board. I don’t know what this means and I’m speculating, but I see some hope ahead."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Some of usually steady players had pretty bad days ( CAT, DE, MA), and NKE went down as expected. But, overall, just down a touch, so it could have been much worse. Still feeling decent about the long ride, but worried the rest of this month is just going to be a slow bleed. Oh well."
03/19/2021,stocks,Can someone ELI5 (or 18) why the bond yields are disproportionately impacting tech stocks?

03/19/2021,stocks,those January buys on Apple and AMD really fucked my portfolio. Would be in the green if it wouldn't be for those. God damn FOMO.

03/19/2021,stocks,"What the fuck. Like HOW? NASDAQ already tanked 400 points yesterday lmao. Throw me a bone. I’m not salty that I’m down, I’m salty cause I’m out of cash to keep buying these down days rofl."

03/19/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Weather Forecast Results**

I've been trying to predict the stock market every day. Last week, it went swimmingly -- so well, in fact, that people started getting annoyed with me because I was getting kind of smug.

All those people will be glad to know that, this week, I got *every single prediction wrong.*

That's a little disappointing. But at the beginning of this week, I also predicted that I would get my predictions wrong this week. So, when you think about it, I *nailed it again.*

Here's a [dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/1Jw6B) of my horribly wrong predictions."

Oh ****! That changes the equation bigly.

I now wouldn’t put it out of the question that the Nasdaq-100 sees 11.5-11.8k next week."

03/19/2021,stocks,Yes yes yes pull up
03/19/2021,stocks,What the actual fuck is happening today
03/19/2021,stocks,"Short term explanation:

- SLR exemption for banks expiring today (bank sell-off)

- Big investors panicking over the rate of rise in bond yeilds (even though they were much higher pre-pandemic, hense the word panic)

- Big investors panicking over inflation

Summary:

- Big investors are panicking and will likely continue to do so for possibly the next few weeks or even months.

Suggestion: 

Don't panic sell anything, slowly average down your current investments, and look for new great deals currently being provided and slowly average into those new positions over the next few weeks."

03/19/2021,stocks,"If the more cyclical sectors of the S&P are repeating January, they have farther to drop before a possible recovery. 

4% more in the case of XLE.

6% more in the case of XLF.

5% more in the case of XLI.

At that point, the Dow itself will likely be too oversold for a further fall, and it could ""maybe"" change minds on intervention too, as I said in a long post yesterday that some of the moves since mid-February are likely not worth intervening on by the Fed."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Added more Carnival (CCL) in this ""dip"".

I don't know how much higher it can go, but I do know that the second any of the major cruise companies announces their first cruise, stocks will soar even though they should already be priced in."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Long term 15-20 year portfolio...

I am trying to decide if SCHD (dividend based ETF) is a good addition. The actual performance of the ETF is great and pays a nice dividend. However i am seeing a lot of people's saying that its not worth holding because its just unnecessary taxable income everytime it pays out. So what are everyone's thoughts?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"My portfolio consists mostly of high volatility/risk plays like ARKs etc. Almost everything is red right now. Have been planning to diversify better and add some safer index ETFs.

The problem - I'm about to not be able to actively monitor it for quite a while - wondering what the play is here? Do I take the loss and move over to safe investments like VTI now, or stick with what I have hoping for green and maybe set some trailing stops and buy indexes when they trigger?"

03/19/2021,stocks,Fidelity will not approve me for level 2 options (2nd time I've applied). Do I have any recourse? Literally all I want to do is buy calls. Do I have a likelihood of it being bumped up if I call or do I just need to go to another broker?
03/19/2021,stocks,"$VISA big dip, good time to buy?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"What do you all think about RYCEY? They make airplane parts (among other things). It's down about ~~19%~~ $0.19 / 6% from a jump a couple days ago and I think it's about to reverse upward again, and I like the idea of hanging onto it through the summer as pandemic restrictions begin lifting and people can travel more. I see generally good stories about them in the news."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Automatic down on OPEX wins again on the S&P. Welp.

Somehow that other trend is intact though very, very, very barely (up compared to the previous OPEX, although on SPY you won't be able to see it because today was ex-dividend day).

I'm looking for weakness next week, but maybe my wild thought that you might now see corrections happen in rotations instead of it being everything (most of the time) ends up being the case."
03/19/2021,stocks,Xpev really smashed a lot of shorts today lol
03/19/2021,stocks,Wtf why did sbux dropped at the last minute?
03/19/2021,stocks,"If inflation is suspected to jump to 2.4%, does this mean that 10 year bonds will have to increase to the level above 2.4%? This would mean that tech stocks will continue to tank throughout the year. Is my reasoning correct?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"To anyone that thinks this market is totally over valued and in a bubble -

We are now about 20% higher than the market peak before COVID. 

Sounds like a lot ?

Well, the year before that (2018-2019)also saw about a 20% growth. 

Guess what 2017-2018 was ? About 20%

And the year before that ? 20%

So unless you think the last decade is a bubble, we are actually just seeing the market where it would have been anyway without COVID. 

When you factor in the massive amounts of money printed with nowhere to go but stocks, we actually should have even more room to grow than usual. 

I am still very bullish on the market and see no reason why it won’t continue to grow at a rapid pace. 

The worst disaster in modern history barely hit productivity and the economy on a global scale.  Capitalism is gross, but it is very effective at making money and growing. Embrace it if you want to have a slice of the pie."

03/19/2021,stocks,"I hate all these news articles this morning, don't be misguided by people with their own skin in the game.

All I see is nasdaq signalling recovery blah blah blah. We just lost 3.5% yesterday and we are only up half of a percent! I'm not saying to not buy, but don't fomo buy because you think today will miraculously recover. It could get worse.

And I'm certainly not telling anyone to sell, don't do that either. Just be cautious is what I'm saying and do your research. Worry about the long term this is all market panic.

Edit: plus it's only up half a percent pre-market. We could easily open red."

03/19/2021,stocks,Someone want to eli5 how the fed capital requirement reinstatement affects the market as a whole? I see they say it shouldn't but in general it should knock bond yields down slightly right?
03/19/2021,stocks,"In theory if bond yields did rise and the fed said ok we’re gonna rise interest. Wouldn’t it take the market a fall quickly , but it would eventually recover from that? I also have another question we’re we in a bear market in 2018-2019 because the bond yields were much higher then."

03/19/2021,stocks,"I wasn't paying attention and bought some eeenf based on a recomendation on the penny stock subreddit. Apparently fidelity charges a foreign investment fee of fifty dollars though for stocks like that and does not issue refunds. It also will hit me with a similar fee if i try to sell my stocks,meaning that unless the value of eeenf goes up astronomically, I will also lose money if i try to take out my profits. This is a frustrating development that negates alot of my careful purchasing strategy this month, learn from my mistake.

Option expires on 3/26; do I wait and hope to god and Elon that the stock rises close to $141? Or do I just wait for a jump today/Monday and sell as soon as losses are nearer the 50% range?

Can't really get any worse than it is now :("

2.	demand for bonds not high enough 
3.	therefore yield goes up to make bonds more attractive 4. yield indirectly linked to interest rates so if one goes up, the other can go up too 
5.	growth stocks depend on low interest debt to grow 
6.	if the interest increases, less room for growth in these stocks so the value drops 
7.	last bit to remember is that stocks are forward looking meaning everything is ‘priced in’ to the value of that stock. So if the potential for growth in the future reduces then the stock reduces even though nothing has physically happened to the company today."

Funded type: industry). A lot will not be “give drug fix disease, drug makes money” sort of endeavors like you’re looking for so you’ll need to do some digging manually. When I think of the big money maker drugs that companies have been putting out recently there’s been a huge shift towards monoclonal antibody based therapeutics so I’d have an eye out for that.

These stocks are great long term investments and will indefinitely recover from dips like yesterday or this whole month and will continue to climb over time. Unless I’m missing something??
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm in BP and SU and they have been strong. Still not to pre-covid levels, so I think they have a lot of upside yet especially when demand kicks in.

Next month or so might be a little rocky depending what OPEC+ does in April about supply and how re-opening goes, but I like both long term.

Also picked up XLE etf awhile back to play the other majors.

Positions: XLE, SU commons, BP commons and 9/17 calls of various strikes"

03/19/2021,stocks,"Second on the proofreading. I am not an expert, but I do plan to sell some of my QQQ today, which is at like a 1% gain from when I bought and buy some XLF (financials ETF) and VDC (consumption stocks ETF). Would love feedback from anyone on this move. I’ll buy more QQQ later this year as I think it is going to trade sideways for awhile. Again, I know nothing, but have been reading a lot and trying to understand how to weather the uncertainty right now."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yep, bought early this week off a recommendation here, pretty happy that it’s held strong. I’m already up 20%. My biggest regret is not getting more when I bought at <$30."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm also of the opinion that we have one more deep dive down in this perfectly healthy corrective period, before a broad rally into spring/summer. I got my cash position ready to buy, if/when that another market selloff does occur."

03/19/2021,stocks,Looks meh.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’m not. They’re releasing a lot of new stuff later this year along with other announcements. AAPL isn’t a high-growth tech stock, it’s just a solid high-end consumer goods stock.

03/19/2021,stocks,"> Market manipulation by big players at its finest. 


I used to think this way, but the more i invest the less i think this is true. The market is just deeply irrational and does a lot of movements in all sorts of directions.


If it was easy to predict the big players's next move, people could make a killing in the stock market. The truth is, the market is extremely tough to predict and often makes no sense.


Retail like us is a tiny drop in the ocean and we don't really move the markets at all. Yes if we all invest massively in the same business (gme) then yes we can move it a bit, but the market as a whole, nope."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nasdaq went up because it went down so much yesterday. I don't know why people here hate to hear it, but the market always pulls back (or is it pulls up?) in the other direction after big and sudden changes."

Apple is simply not planning that much growth, has some debt, high P/B ratio.


But i think fang stocks are never really a mistake."
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s almost like the market was being propped up artificially for four years.

03/19/2021,stocks,"are you fucking stupid? Does nobody remember the december 2018, march 2020 crashes that wiped out years of growth?"
03/19/2021,stocks,another redditor who thinks everything is manipulation
03/19/2021,stocks,"No, it was the Fed announcing that they're not going extend the SLR. That sent the yields spiking."
03/19/2021,stocks,And the previous days when they spiked at 2 AM was manipulation too or was that maybe cause that's when EU markets were opening?
03/19/2021,stocks,Anything below 120 IMO given this trend.
03/19/2021,stocks,I just don’t get it. I’ve had ARLO since 2015 and have consistently been disappointed. I do like their doorbell camera but even that has major software flaws.

03/19/2021,stocks,It’s also nice to not have to constantly check after market pre market with one eye open waiting for the bottom to drop.  Yes you’ll lose 2 or 3% here and there but then gain it back the next day. There’s a lot to be said for peace of mind.
03/19/2021,stocks,I'm also bagholding nio and refuse to sell it...I think it's a steal at these levels and it def is oversold at this point

03/19/2021,stocks,I love pay pal. Sold some shares a month ago w the tech crunch and regret it. A very lovely stock

03/19/2021,stocks,Wait in that case shouldnt we be buying bonds right now? That paradoxically would convince people rates wont be jacked up.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Exactly! Buying at the very bottom is next to impossible. It’s the same as when you sell something at say $100 a share and then the next week watch it go to $140. Almost every single investment I’ve ever made that’s paid off the most has dipped at least 30 to 40%. Despite what you see on Wsb. It’s a long game. Everyone including myself has seemed to have forgotten that lately. I swear it’s because of Tesla, gme and wsb."

03/19/2021,stocks,I'm in the same boat. I think Freelancing is a big market that they can capitalize on. I'm just going to wince and ride this out because I think it is down due to the market more than anything else.
03/19/2021,stocks,"It's their whole MO. Prop up homegrown companies while making it difficult/impossible for foreigners to compete. It's obvious they're planning to push Tesla out or at least relegate it to the sidelines.

Now if Tesla can cement themselves as a status symbol like Apple they have a good chance of overcoming that. Chinese people will eat that up, it's like oxygen to them."
03/19/2021,stocks,Pretty much. All ch evs did well today.

03/19/2021,stocks,What's happening in April?
03/19/2021,stocks,"The yeilds will continue to spike and the big investors will continue to sell their entire tech portfolios, cause they're bipolar like that. Until one day they flip and decide tech is a great buy. The rest of the market just has to go with whatever they do.

Recently it's either yeilds or inflation that scares the market and neither of which is good for the nasdaq. And don't be misguided by my bearish sounding comments because I'm digging out all the spare money I can find to try to buy into this dip."
03/19/2021,stocks,That’s what they said about today yesterday though..
03/19/2021,stocks,"You dumb bastard that’s a insensitive joke. It was a child who had a whole life ahead of them.

This ones on the parents nonetheless."
03/19/2021,stocks,No? I said the last few seconds of trading it’s literally a vertical line down. I’m curious what caused it to just go down like that.
03/19/2021,stocks,Less about what happened overall 0.62% is nothing. But literally at the last minute you just see it shoot down.
03/19/2021,stocks,After hours it was a bit up

03/19/2021,stocks,I have a bunch of shares averaged in the high $24 range. I don't plan on having an opportunity to average down in a meaningful way.

03/19/2021,stocks,LOL
03/19/2021,stocks,"Honestly got into it based on some very simple DD, such as it having a lot of buy ratings from analysts, the Morningstar report on the company and their estimate of $36 as a fair share price, looking at the weekly/monthly/yearly charts and just my overall feeling that they're a bit undervalued right now.  $40 per share is probably a bit optimistic on my part, but I think it's really possible.  I'm probably a little biased too because I own a Honda.  EDIT: the stock has also kept rising in spite of bad news regarding some recent supply chain shortages/bad weather."
03/19/2021,stocks,Thank you! Yeah I'm just trying to go high risk high reward with fun money I can afford to lose. My retirement accounts are 100% SP500 index funds (I'm 26)
03/19/2021,stocks,"Haha hopefully. It was them that helped convince me to buy it, but I found it using my own screener on finviz. Bought in at $8.24. It's been frustrating because the upwards movements have all been tiny since the drop from that price. Like 1% at the most, but most of the time like .25% and things like that or trading flat. Nice to see 3% today haha.

Got a lot of faith in this bad boy though, so I'm in for a long while."

Usually I assume hedge funds are going to manipulate or drive up the price of AAPL at least once a week.

That being said, it seems like momentum stopped recently, so I'm a lot less convinced than about two hours ago. Now, I assume it may just trade sideways."

03/19/2021,stocks,The yield rate needs to be higher than inflation to be worthwhile which is predicted to be 2.4% this year(recently raised from 1.8%). So we might see bonds increase until they equal or greater than inflation.

03/19/2021,stocks,"I personally like (DFS) - Discovery Financial Services, they're at a good price today relative to the past few weeks. Also think WFC and AXP are good buys."
03/19/2021,stocks,Exactly. There is no longer an incentive for Banks to hold US treasury bonds as far as calculating their capital ratios. The bonds will be viewed the same way as loans to consumers and businesses.
03/19/2021,stocks,"You certainly could but your premium would be low and at the end of the day there’s no guarantee you’d be assigned, so is it worth it? If you really want the stock today and you’re happy with the current price you’re likely better off just buying. 

If you want the stock but the price is above where you want it or your trying to lower your cost basis to entry (and you want to buy 100 shares or multiples thereof), and you’re ok with waiting and taking the risk of not owing (the price goes up, OTM) it’s usually more profitable to sell a CSP for 30-45 days to expiry (DTE)."
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you're going for the wheel strategy you want to write several puts before being assigned. 

You're going for the premiums not necessarily for the growth of the stocks while you hold it. 

If you just wanna buy the stock and lower your buying price with selling a put first then it's probably fine but I'm not an expert at options trading"
03/19/2021,stocks,I don't remember off hand. Might be 9/2022 and a 1/2023.
03/19/2021,stocks,"For MSFT it's like buying shares, but the dips and gains are usually bigger on the option than on the share. For RIDE, I can maximize my upside while minimizing my capital at risk."

I'm in RIDE 15c 1/2022 around that price. It's risky."

03/19/2021,stocks,mmmm
03/19/2021,stocks,Tough decision for sure. The stock has been pretty volatile as well in general. Are you leaning towards selling?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Need to be more patient, don’t invest money you need soon. Apple will go up, not a matter of if."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I worry for you. Are you planning to sell BTC too once it lowers in value? 

Ask yourself this, would you even think about selling Apple right now if the price was going higher and not stagnant? If the answer is no, chances are you’re selling without a good reason and will likely just buy back into the company down the line for a higher price.

Be patient. It’s a long term game. Check back in a few years. Apple is a great company"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Compare the planned growth between apple and amazon... amazon has way more, and for longer.


Apple's EPS next 5Y is planned to grow 14.69% annually. Not bad

ICLN itself will recover though by my NAV calcs I think it needs to come down to ~21 before it's a buy. Instead I recommend just buying the best of it's components directly so you can avoid paying growth premiums for stagnant value plays."

FWIW GuruFocus estimates fair value at $150-200, and it's trading at $320. https://www.gurufocus.com/stock/COST/dcf

my Fidelity account ranks COST at 42/100 on valuation, where 50 is fair value and 1 is max overvalued. so a bit overvalued here. 

so long-term prospects for Costco are probably good, but right now it's a bit overvalued. for me it would be a hold position, watch and wait, but I wouldn't buy any more shares until it came down to or under fair value."
03/19/2021,stocks,I bought it a week or so ago and have already made a little profit. I was looking at costco walmart pepsi at a discount to try to hedge my technology heavy portfolio. I ditched walmart and pepsi but Costco has been trending up it seems.
03/19/2021,stocks,I have too many shares at a 340ish cost basis. I'm not sure what to think about it. It has lagged a lot and trades around it's pre covid level. If you pull charts of the worst performing stocks in the last 3 months costco is right up there. I thought it was a for sure buy at 330 and lowered my cost basis. Not sure what will drive it up again. It'll probably float in the 310 to 330 range for some time.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Food for thought, as someone else had mentioned, Buffett had recently sold all his COST shares.

Most would agree that Walmart (with 83% *more* stores) has way more growth potential (essentially working to compete directly with Amazon, and W+ subscriptions), and their P/E is only in the 22-27 range.    

People on here seem to translate ""I like this company"" into ""there is literally no price too high!"" That's why they're buying Tesla at a 1000+ P/E, and not seeing the *risk*.   

Costco is a buy at a certain price but I'd put that price lower than Walmart's P/E, not higher, because the growth profile of the two is so wildly different (PS - I don't actually like Walmart, and I do like Costco)."

03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm invested in both Costco and Walmart and I disagree with the assertion that Walmart has more potential growth. I do think WMT has growth potential as I'm invested, but so too does Costco. Nearly a third of their warehouses are international. The Costco effect transcends US borders. They're also closing in on bumping up the membership fee - straight to the bottom line.

People will sit it out as they did a few years ago when it was ~$150 and they'll miss the boat again. It's the kind of safe blue chip consumer staples stock that will outpace the market for the coming decade. Both Walmart and Costco have a low beta as an added plus for those looking for (an aggressive) proxy bond."
03/19/2021,stocks,I have another two words. It will
03/19/2021,stocks,"> Nearly a third of their warehouses are international.   

And yet fewer international locations than Walmart (6,101 international Walmarts, 245 for Costco). A third are because they simply have *less*.     

> They're also closing in on bumping up the membership fee - straight to the bottom line.  

You mean their only way to increase their growth. Costco hasn't proven very innovative, and squeezing their profitable membership has diminishing returns.   

> People will sit it out as they did a few years ago when it was ~$150 and they'll miss the boat again.   

In order for that to be Costco would either have to double revenue or people would have to believe in enough future growth to value the company at a 60 P/E. The 50% growth in the last few years (relative to 35% market) isn't proof that Costco can go up infinitely, in fact it is quite good evidence that Costco is valued like a growth stock and therefore more fragile.   

But let's meet back here in five years and compare Walmart, Costco, and the market."

I said that in retail Costco's P/E is unusually high and used Walmart as a good reflection of that (more stores, strong fundamentals, better grown opportunities & more aggressive, yet somehow a 10 point(!) lower P/E).    

If you cannot grasp that retail is a sector and that sector comparisons are normal, I cannot help you."

03/19/2021,stocks,"If you watch GME, almost every day at 10:30-10:40 in ticks up to somewhere around what will be the high for the day. Then in the last 15 minutes before close it will hit around it's daily low. This has been around a $20 spread lately. This only applies to these boring, low volume days. If something really happens I am sure we will notice. Just an observation from a bored guy who watches GME too much. I am holding GME and am still hopeful..."
03/19/2021,stocks,lol this shit is.. impossible to predict

03/19/2021,stocks,What the actual f* is happening with AMC? Price has been pinned to $14 for almost all day & option chain looks weird.
03/19/2021,stocks,"We’ll see what happens today with GME. I remember many redditers saying something big was going to happen on 3/19. I’ve been reading it since the first squeeze. I think it’s a bunch of BS and never bothered to listen to these folks, and probably still won’t if something does happen. Prove me wrong though"
03/19/2021,stocks,"So predictions for GME today? Personally I think very little will happen, matching the recent theme of hyped up days amounting to nothing. I think the quarterly meeting next week wil be more of a catalyst"
03/19/2021,stocks,🅱️🅱️ come on baby keep that tiny green gain today

AMC - 4,800,000 down to 700,000
UWMC - 4,600,000 down to 1,800,000
RKT - 2,400,000 down to 450,000

And GME is 150,000 down to 100,000

So ... do you guys think this is due to the new rules in effect today concerning shorts?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I know it's all guesswork, but what do people here think the ceiling for GME is? Do people think the huge numbers are actually possible, or would hedge funds just stop buying and rather pay the interest at some point?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Anyone have any thoughts on UWMC stocks?  
 I was expecting to see it stay above 8.90 but fortunately could not hold."

03/19/2021,stocks,Hiya folks! Trying to carve through all the noise and get a bit of a better sense of whether this 'quadruple witching' happening today is a real phenomenon or more likely a nothing sandwich?

There was a big crash first thing today, but it seems to be creeping back up now. I expect Friday to end just a little bit down from Thursday."

03/19/2021,stocks,"All that hype for today and it barely squeaks by above previous close.

03/19/2021,stocks,So many shorting RKT keeping it lower than it should be.....and killing my position!
03/19/2021,stocks,"I know quad-witching did nothing last year, but the market is in a state of flux and WAAYYY more volatile. Nothing may happen, but I don’t think we should pretend it won’t simply based off last year (seems to be what many are doing). Nothing in the market is predictable right now"

03/19/2021,stocks,Is today a micro-dip or are we expecting an extended unwinding?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Trying to understand something about how the suits lost so much on GME.  If they were shorting, then wouldn't a stop loss be in place?  So they short at 20$ with a stop loss in place and take a small loss when the stock goes way up. They can just wait till later on for the optimal time and make the move or move on to something else and let this cool off.

If they do it right then wouldnt all of the suits take their small loss and make it back up on something else?"
03/19/2021,stocks,I don’t get the Correlation between growth stock and bond yield rates.  I get that there is a fear money will pull out of high risk stocks and park it in bonds if the rates are attractive enough BUT won’t the yield rates go down as people buy in?  Essentially capping itself at some point in time and become less attractive to buy in?

03/19/2021,stocks,"I've noticed that this week as well.  


Notably today volume seems to be over twice as high than it has been premarket. AMC's volume is pretty high as well.  


Could be an interesting day but who knows anymore."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Increased volume supposedly goes hand-in-hand with witching.

I honestly see a short-attack today. Too many people on WSB are talking & excited about “3/19! 3/19!”. It’s a great opportunity to demoralize those holding who believe today will be amazing."
03/19/2021,stocks,I would hold gme but I don't really have the privilege to watch gme. I'd rather hold and forget for a long time.
03/19/2021,stocks,It's gonna go up. Only 3000 borrowed shares left.. They are running out of ammo.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yay! Been holding Nokia for a while, good for them!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’m amazed that they seem to have a negative correlation to good news. So weird. 
I keep buying the dips... :sigh:"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Sell walls, I’m sure. The GME chart is hilarious. There’s like 20 transactions for exactly 53 shares being traded back and forth. Hopefully it’ll rip free at some point"
03/19/2021,stocks,Likely nothing will happen today. Anyone setting dates is setting themselves up to be dissapointed
03/19/2021,stocks,"I mean some of them believe that gme is affecting all of NASDAQ due to HFs pulling out of all of their long positions so they don't get margin called. Maybe they're right, I certainly am not educated on market movement enough to say. But it doesn't sound right."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The 3/19 date was important due to calls being ITM, unless this thing rockets up to $300, that won’t happen. People forgot the reason and just remembered the date. Next week has a better chance due to potential catalysts, but nothing may happen from those. GME is 100% unpredictable

Honestly, there’s a better chance of it getting short-attacked today due to how excited people are over this date."
03/19/2021,stocks,"So far, nothing exciting. I'd love to be wrong though."
03/19/2021,stocks,It will most likely go down. They have borrowed 2m shares and will try to lower the price. 👇
03/19/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I think it will probably do the same thing I posted a little while ago, up at around 10:30-10:40, down at 3:50- 4:00 with a lot of meaningless jumping around all day and low volume."
03/19/2021,stocks,"spoiler alert:

it did not hold its gains"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I was so hopeful yesterday that I could do a little peak sell off Friday afternoon.

wompwomp."
03/19/2021,stocks,i saw this and have no idea what to make of it. I must be missing something. Why bother? Are there any non grassy knoll theories?
03/19/2021,stocks,">Rolls Royce

looks like 26 cents to me?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Total guesswork, but if I had to make a bet, I would say 350. There’s just too much incentive to sell for people bought high during the January hype. These people over on WSB who are talking about $1000 or even $10,000 are delusional. People will sell off before then."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I will probably sell at around $299. If it goes back down to ~$50, I’ll prob buy back in hoping it will happen again"
03/19/2021,stocks,"All the talked about catalysts are priced in to some extent tbh, the HFs have been getting out of this slowly imo and if we do see it pop, the resistance at the $400 by bag holders finally seeing green is going to be pretty huge.

The absolute state of pump on GME at this point is something else; the top comments on the wsb thread Rn are just such retarded horse shit, I can understand hedges being afraid before but Rn they’ve got their game plan and wsb hasn’t done anything to adapt besides posting retarded DD daily

That being said I personally feel that IF it does pop, it’d hit 600-700 before dumping hard"
03/19/2021,stocks,I’m out at $500 and I don’t think it will even reach that. All this talk of 100k is just crap.
03/19/2021,stocks,I'm selling at $350 and getting the hell out.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I bought in too. I’m holding a bit longer, personally. Even if it doesn’t moon, I’m happy to be in low enough to dip at profit in the next month if nothing changes 

I don’t see it getting too volatile unless it decides to go up."
03/19/2021,stocks,Update: this stock is ridiculous
03/19/2021,stocks,"lol 100k.

1k possible. That's my target as YOLO. Then keep some for 4-5k as YOLO's YOLO. 

But that's it."
03/19/2021,stocks,Bigger chance that the world tomorrow ends than gme hitting 10k.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would be inclined to agree that $100k is outlandish. Even $10k seems unlikely but there is a small possibility. Thing about GME is, I wouldn’t rule anything out, because it’s already blown past my expectations three times before so who knows what’s in store?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If it hits $1k and you don’t sell, you’ll be left with a bag"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Did you see the crazy fight to keep it over 200 eod? I had fun watching it.

Hoping for a beautiful cup movement, personally 🤩"
03/19/2021,stocks,"There’s an earnings report happening on Tuesday. Not setting a date, but it might effect movement. 

We shall see 🤗"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Looking at patterns in the chart, mostly, for me. Upcoming or recently passed Earnings. Whether or not they hold up to those earnings consistently. News about them: any acquisitions/contracts/projects/products...

There’s a lot, and it’s never perfect, but there are things you can immediately look at to make a guess.

There’s absolutely more, and the Greeks of course."
03/19/2021,stocks,"That info is from Iborrowdesk.com. It only displays one of the brokerages (a large one, but still). But yes, a lower amount of shares means there’s nothing left to short with, they simply use that site as an indicator for others. That said, if the shorts are smart (they are), they’re holding on to a ton to attack with"
03/19/2021,stocks,The more shares that are bought raises the price that the hedge funds have to buy back at.

blah blah gme blah blah moon blah blah screw the hedge funds. that’s what it sounds like to me at this point"
03/19/2021,stocks,It's about as legitimate as   **dowsing**

03/19/2021,stocks,"He's a clown.

Deleted his account when GME was at $40. Back now. 

Ignore him."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I don't see anything wrong with what he wrote. I think that putting money into gme now is riskier then before the first squeeze in January. 

Retail isn't the one that's making the moves anymore so we can just hope that the big bulls in gme are going to win right now."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Hostess is TWNK and it’s up 45% over one year compared to 35% for Mondelez, 32% for Hershey and 9% for Kellogg’s. Shows you what people have been eating during the pandemic I guess. The less healthy the better."

03/19/2021,stocks,Oh nvm it's already green lol
03/19/2021,stocks,"Still looks a bit cuppy to me, but you never know."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Most of them don't set stop losses since they believe the price will keep going down. The interest they pay for a year is way cheaper than buying back shares at a 10% loss. 

By settting a stop loss, you are also purchasing shares at the next available bid price. If you shorted 1million shares ay $200 and set a stop loss at 10%, your order could get filled at a wide range of prices since there aren't enough people selling their shares at a low price. 

Imagine if you set it at at 10% loss. Your order could execute at a price between $220-400 or even higher. That is because for 1 million shares at 1 time, you would probably buy out all the orders at $220, $230, $240, $250...and on"
03/19/2021,stocks,It's all people panic selling like idiots
03/19/2021,stocks,i almost bought end of the day as it got beat down so bad but i just didnt have the guts. plus it looks like it was due a pull back on the daily chart. so held off.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah anytime I see someone post something about how ""x date will moon"" I usually expect it to go down that day"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Agreed. People shouldn’t be setting dates on ‘the GME rocket’ because no one can reasonably predict it. So they’re setting themselves, and others, up for disappointment."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Sarcasm noted, I wouldn't call it a privilege, I have lung disease so I am pretty much locked down. I would much rather be at work than stuck at home. Being able to go places would be a privilege."

03/19/2021,stocks,What are they doing with the money then just letting it sit as cash?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, especially considering that GameStop's Q1 earnings call is on Tuesday, March 23 after the market closes,"

03/19/2021,stocks,lighting doesn't strike 3 times does it?
03/19/2021,stocks,"There’s some good DD on GME on WSB. Even if they talk about $10k as possible, the research is still sound, just gotta ignore the fluff.

That said, they’ve done what they can. It’s hard to convince people to buy in to GME at $200/share, it’s not going to move the needle. What moves it now is holding and waiting for a catalyst or a whale to push them back to $250-$300 to start getting calls ITM again"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I don't know how they even call that garbage DD. If anything, it's that stupid behavior that makes me think investing in GME is wrong. I'm still holding what I have and seeing what happens, though."
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s hard to think the 100k stuff is real. It really feels like people trying to con you into bagholding so they can get out

03/19/2021,stocks,So you’re saying there’s a chance
03/19/2021,stocks,If it hits 200 and you don’t sell you’ll be left holding the bag. Get the hell out of there. Take a god damn profit. There’s a guarantee it’ll go back down then you just wash and repeat. Don’t for a second believe the hold hype.
03/19/2021,stocks,People keep saying it can moon Tuesday...how could the report effect this? I believe nothing and hope for nothing. Can’t be disappointed with no expectations😉
03/19/2021,stocks,I know. But why does the amount of shares left to short matter specifically? How will that metric affect the price in any meaningful way?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks! I figured this was the likely answer, but wanted to see if folks here had particular views. Personally I'd be OK with a reasonable dip at some point so I can load up some more..."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Getting in now is not a bad idea. But the lack of movement on the stock lately is frustrating. This is the biggest mortgage company with stellar reports. But it is majorly shorted, about 40%, and the amount of overhang doesn't help either.
I'm still confident that it will turn around and we have to be close to the bottom so getting in now is not a bad idea, but be prepared to hold for a while and stay tunedm"

03/19/2021,stocks,"I can't take this stupid yield talk anymore...

Who the fuck cares if bond yields go up??

Are you really going to shift your portfolio into bonds now that you get 1,7%?

Sure, there will be some reallocation by major players like retirement funds or whatever, but what makes everyone think that stocks will continue to get slaughtered? So many stocks already lost about 30-50% from their ath and people talk like we had a minor blip. Stop focussing on indices and actually look at individual stocks. 

And don't come at me with: bUt ThE fAIr ValUe gOeS DoWn iF tHe RisKfReE RaTe gOes Up

Really? Go ahead do a dcf valuation and change the riskfree rate. See the influence for yourself. A change is not as impactful as people always say.


A short explanation: 

The riskfree rate basically comes into play 3 times:

1) In the Cost of Equity 
2) In the Cost of Debt
3) As a proxy for stable growth

So yeah sure, all in all you have a slightly higher discount rate, but at the same time your stable growth rate is higher.

Also, the Discount rate is not that much higher anyway. That is because the riskfree rate occurs twice in the cost of equity formula:

Cost of Equity = rf + Beta * ERP

ERP = market discount rate - rf

You see that? The (implied) ERP goes down when you have a higher riskfree rate, at the same time it is added back for the cost of equity. So, if Beta = 1 it literally has no impact on the cost of equity. 

Sorry for the rant, but people always share some half ass knowledge and never seem to actually have done a dcf valuation in their entire life."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I've rotated out of growth into, mostly, safe/recovery stocks (primarily breaking even currently) . I'm hoping to gain about 5% - 10% over the next couple of months, but as soon as the bond yield goes two weeks without a sudden bounce it's buy time. I would attempt to do some knife catching, but the last few weeks have left me a little scared of trying that."

If people actually understood the things they were buying they wouldn't freakout when the price goes down they'd buy more. Too many new folks not even close to being desensitized to market volatility and who have no idea what they're doing."

That’s more of a millennials belief since they likely entered around 2010, and we’ve been on a 10 years bull run from then to now. If you got in any time between 2010 to 2020, you could indeed think the market always goes up or stays flat at worst."

If there is a violent correction to low interest rates, like I believe, this is indicative of another liquidity crisis, which is not a good sign for risk assets, either.

Not saying trying to time the market is the ideal approach or anything but I think it is a warning against buying into assets that are crazy inflated.  Eventually (well, mostly) things will catch up but if you buy an asset at double or triple a real price then your cash is gonna be tied up for a long time while other assets at reasonable prices have normal growth."

Most millennials didn't have good jobs with disposable income for a while after  2010 because we were either a) still in school, or b) suffering from the after effects of a worldwide recession. Also the fact that we're saddled with student loan debt, medical debt, low-paying jobs even after getting a college degree, etc. means there's not a ton of money to invest. I had a really good job and no student debt out of college, but was living in a super expensive area (in a fucking studio) so I still very little no disposable income (and no investments) for several years."

03/19/2021,stocks,"I actually think people getting in around the 2020 crash would be more likely to *not* fear a crash. This is all speculation, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. But first of all, the 2020 crash was brief and had explosive market growth directly after (most people who got in just after the covid crash probably wish they could have gotten in earlier to buy the lowest point and may not see it as so dangerous if it happened again), and if that's the only crash you've been through the view of what a crash entails may be more than slightly skewed. Second if you've only been investing for about a year or so you won't be set back as much as if you had 10 years of investing on the line."

2021-03-19 12:21:10,stocks,"What exactly is a naked short put position? 

i was looking at doing whatever position name is for a cash secured put, but without the cash secured.  i thought that would be a naked short put, but it seems like naked short put is when you are simply not short on the underlying. which makes sense.

so what is it when you are simply opening a short put position, without a CSP?

i cant seem to see the downside here. because:

1. if underlying goes up, you keep premium like any short put position.

2. if it stays flat but above strike. same as 1

3. if it drops, dont you still buy the underlying for the strike price?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"A short put is where you sell or ""write"" a put contract that didn't previously exist. You are selling someone else the right (but not the obligation) to sell you 100 shares of the stock at the strike price, before or on the expiration date. You're the one who has to buy if the holder chooses to exercise their put. If the option is exercised, you call this ""getting assigned"" or ""assignment.""

&#x200B;

A covered put is where you're already short 100 shares of that stock, so if the you get assigned and have to buy someone else's shares, you're covering your shortsold shares, at the strike price. A cash-secured short put is where you don't actually shortsell those 100 shares, but you have enough cash to cover being assigned if it happens anyway, and put that up.

&#x200B;

If you have a cash-secured put, you must keep the required cash to pay for the possible exercise of that put, in your account, at all times, until AFTER expiration or assignment. So if it's a strike of $50, you need to keep $5,000 cash in your account AT ALL TIMES until this option goes away one way or another.

&#x200B;

A naked short put is where you sell the put without having short shares, or the cash in your account to cover being assigned, and unless you know what you're doing you are going to put yourself in a dangerous spot by doing this, and probably won't be allowed by your broker to do it anyway."
03/19/2021,stocks,">i was looking at doing whatever position name is for a cash secured put, but without the cash secured

You 99% lose all your money and any money you made within the next 3 months with this mentality. You dont even know what a naked short is but you want to sell put contracts without any cash for the underlying. Put your car into your sisters name, they going to take the lot.

There is so much incorrect terminology frankenstiened together in your post its actually scary. Do not do anything you think might be a good idea OP. For starters selling Put contracts means you are bullish on the stock and expect it to go up. Naked shorts are illegal and you do not have the means to even achieve this. You are mixing up what shorting and writing put contracts are."
03/19/2021,stocks,If you don't know the answer to that question you are not likely to get your broker to allow you to do it.

oh ok that makes more sense.

i moved from Robinhood to TOS. and in Robinhood, they would literally tie up the cash collateral for a CSP.

so i was wondering how you would 1. do a CSP on tos, if they do or do not tie up the required capital as well. 2. how you would do a short put position without typing up the cash and how that would look like. if that means you would be paying another different price if the underlying drops way below strike.

so what happens if i try to enter a short position without the cash on hand? does TOS deny the trade to go through?

i understand why naked covered calls and short positions on the underlying is dangerous. but i dont quite see why for a short put. because cant i simply put the money into my account if i get assigned to buy? since the min price ill have to pay is still the strike price?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Idk if the brokerage would let a new retail trader do naked shorts.

care to elaborate?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"That not the theta wheel.

The theta wheel is specifically selling CSPs until you stop rolling your position and finally get assigned then selling covered calls until you stop rolling your position and you get assigned in which case you are at the beginning of the wheel selling CSPs.

03/19/2021,stocks,I started at the beginning of December with $1300. I barely read anything and was jumping in and out of stuff. I started reading about 1-2 hours a day about companies and the market a few weeks in and have kept that up. Made my first win Dec. 31 and while I've still made a few bad plays I've made better and better plays since then. Sitting at 22.5K right now with no more deposits other than that $1300. I've actually withdrew about 3K so I would be at 25K in gains.
03/19/2021,stocks,Perhaps a bit...knowing what I know now I certainly would have handled investments a bit different from the get-go. Still made profits though...but I could have made nearly the same amount through passive low cost index ETF’s.
03/19/2021,stocks,"All I did in 2019 was read. In 2020 I started investing and read half as much. I was able to contribute more money than I've ever saved over a year. I made great buys and ruined them by averaging up on margin, which was something I knew was a bad idea from all that reading. Now I'm focusing more on volume and value to funnel growth and volatility into large cap stability. I didn't read that. I done learned it. I done theorized it myself. That's my way of building a compounding machine. I've found it's good to read. It's bad to go in debt. It's good to buy companies that earn money. It's bad to be emotional. It's good to experiment with the portfolio as a laboratory.

It's not hard to get really good results with small amounts of money. It's not hard to beat the market. I did it immediately with an out of favor cyclical. I doubled it, tripled it, held it for a long time, and sold for double. I would have made 800% if I'd have bought my second choice. Then I lost money on what I thought was a better company in a better position in the same industry.

I bought a leader in an emerging market and did really well. Could have done twice as good if I had sold earlier. But I held.

I bought BlackBerry below $10, before the hype, and sabotaged it by averaging up on leverage. Sold at a wash.

Most positions I entered would have returned over 100%, or over 300%, if I had let them be and gotten out at the peak. It's been a really fun year. Lots of learning. Lots of experimenting. Very valuable experience.

It's not hard to do well in a bull market. Now we are in recovery mode and there will be growth. I don't plan on making the same mistakes twice. I mean, I ruined three solid positions by averaging up on margin, but I don't plan to make the same mistake four times. I made great choices and ruined them all by myself. Theory confirmed: leverage ruins lives. The successes wouldn't have been possible without reading. I think of this quote,

""My face is my warrant""

\- Agent fuck head from Transformers: Age of Extinction

What a stupid line.

But then I think of this quote,

""Dubstep is what Megatron sings in the shower""

That's helped me through a lot."

03/19/2021,stocks,"1. Generally people have what is called ""beginners luck"". This is for games of chance and not games of skill. What really happens is because they don't know anything they purely guess and have a 50/50 chance but it seems more because when they do win it's like ""How the hell did they win?!?"".
2. After beginners luck people start to learn but because they actually don't get it they do worse on average. They confuse concepts, terms, definitions, etc and it hurts them overall since they are more likely to choose the wrong thing.
3. The more they learn the more they rectify the mistakes and there chances go up to and possibly past 50/50 depending on the game.

&#x200B;

This is not hard to see. Imagine playing blackjack and not really knowing how to play and someone helping you and you basically guess hit or stay. You have about a 50/50 chance of winning. Now you start to learn the game but don't know many of the nuances so you think you are doing good thinks like hitting a lot but in fact it causes you to lose more often than not. As time goes on you learn to play the game better and better and your chances increase more and more. 

This is just the natural state of things, it's called learning. This is why humans learn, it gives them an edge.  Many humans, of course, resist learning mainly because of bad experiences or their own ignorance(they never progress to stage 3, at least in general). The only cost of learning is time and that is probably why some do not learn. Learning = understanding. If you want to understand how something works you have to learn about it. What you learn is, at least at the start, proportional to the time you put in to it."

They basically put themself with their split as a pennystock. (many funds and indexes will never add pennystocks to their portfolio)

Usually you want your stock price not too high and not too low, so that the average investor can buy 1-X stocks. (Amazon with a stock price of 3000$ probably splits soon, because the average investor can't even afford 1 stock)

And it sounds better you bought 10 pieces instead of 1.

In conclusion stock price lower than 1$ is bad and everything too high is also bad."
03/19/2021,stocks,I am an amateur so hopefully someone can confirm or correct this information but it’s my understanding that a split can occur for a lot of reasons and those are the factors you want to ID.

The decision to purchase Bitcoin (at a cost basis around $25,000) was brilliant. The debt he took on also allows the bond holders to convert to Microstrategy stock at certain price points which means he gets a low interest loan to grab something that is going to be 10X his cost of capital in just a few short years.

Fucking ballsy. However, if you listen to his thesis on what is happening with the dollar and its role as a failing reserve currency his logic is spot on.

I believe Elon Musk bought his Bitcoin as an insurance policy for Tesla. He knows that the 25% increase in vehicle sales no way justifies an 700% in his Tesla's stock price.

Bitcoin (in his mind) will save Tesla in 5 years. If we have a major correction his Bitcoin will provide the value for analysts to justify a $350.00 stock price.

2021-03-19 07:23:07,stocks,"The 10 year and its effect on markets In light of recent events, can someone please clarify how the 10 year effects the markets? I seem to be a little confused.

From my understanding, the 10 year is the prime benchmark that measures investor sentiment across financial markets. If bond prices are down yields go up, that signals that investors feel they can make a higher return elsewhere ( i.e. confidence in the markets) if bond prices are higher and yields are trending downwards it would suggest the opposite. 

My question is this: why did a hike in the 10 year yield spook the market into a sell off today? Rising yield rates indicate that investor confidence in the market is high, right? So wouldn’t we only need to be concerned with lower yield rates? (i.e. low confidence in the market; investors feel that their money is better off in bonds rather than the stock market)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Great answers in this thread. The one I want I focus on is [Graham’s calculation for the intrinsic value of a stock](https://tradebrains.in/graham-calculator/). Let’s say you have a company that isn’t profitable yet, but has positive earnings per share and is growing at 100% per year. You’d be a fool not to invest, right? This is where Graham’s calculator comes in:

V* = (EPS x (8.5 x 2g) x 4.4)/Y

Where V* is the intrinsic value of a share, EPS is the earnings per share, g is the growth rate, and Y is the yield on corporate AAA bonds. Let’s say the growth rate is 100%, EPS is $0.2, and corporate bond yields are 1%. This would give us the following:

$185 = (0.2 x (8.5 x 2 x 100) x 4.4)/1%

Awesome! $185 per share! This is going to the moon 🚀

Now let’s say nothing changes, but the denominator (bond yields) jumps up to 2%:

$91 = (0.2 x (8.5 x 2 x 100) x 4.4)/2%

$91? The Bears are shorting the stock! Market manipulation. 

What has happened is that the interest rates on the loans the company needs have increased, which directly hurts their profitability. Doesn’t matter how great the company is - if they need those loans, profitability is going to suffer. This is what people mean by growth vs. value stocks - growth stocks depend on that growth number to outpace interest rates. Value stocks don’t need it as much, but sacrifice growth. That was true during COVID-19 when interest rates were low. The economy is recovering, and so are interest rates.  Now you know something about how the algos think. There isn’t an evil cabal of hedge funds manipulating your favorite stock - it’s just leveraged and it’s growth was always fragile. 

This is why EV, tech, and other stocks are getting hammered. Now, it’s frustrating because not all growth stocks depend on corporate bonds equally. But there’s something of a snowball effect to this. Some stocks are going to be great buys because they’re getting dragged down by panic. Others are going to get hit much worse. It’s hard to say which right now, but debt is a good place to start to sort them out.

A quick addendum: Fed Chair Powell’s primary goal is to decrease unemployment, and he recognizes that interest rates should stay low - fighting inflation now would hurt job openings. But he doesn’t control the 10 year. It is responsive to market demands. The fact that the 10 year is behaving erratically suggests to me that we are heading into unknown territory, and we’re seeing volatility because the future isn’t clear to anyone. Algos are thus being defensive of profits, hence the whiplash we’re getting almost every week."
03/19/2021,stocks,Because businesses have to pay higher interest on loans and this holds doubly true for tech stocks
03/19/2021,stocks,"The 10 year is also used as the risk free rate in valuation methods. The higher the rate, the more discounted future cash flows, then the lower the present value of stocks. The stocks that get hit the most are ones that have most of their expected cash flow far out in the future."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Powell says the Fed won't increase interest rates anytime soon. 
Big money is saying BS. 
Now its a game of chicken."
03/19/2021,stocks,"It has to do with company’s debt load and the value of the bonds.  US has a lot of Zombie companies and as the interest rates go the cost of borrowing goes up.  Then you have another gigantic problem with pension and 401ks.  If the bond yields go up the price/value of the bonds go down.  Most pension, life insurance, and 401ks expect to get 7% return.   This is over for now that interest have bottom out and will have to go out on the risk curve to try and get 7%.  Negative interest rates are bad for markets since it destroys savings.

The thing to remember is banks create money through loans.  So if the cost of borrowing goes up the amount an individual or institution can borrow goes down.  So the real estate bubble now pops and companies also get liquidated due to lack of ability to rollover debt.  Remember theses loans are money creation so if people are paying off more loans then they are destroying money.  People also can’t get as big loans the money creation slows down.  Now it will spill over to other markets since people will sell highly liquid assets to raises funds to cover loses.  Due to the selling prices will drop on theses assets.  If those prices drop enough it can trigger margin calls and there is currently a significant amount of margin in the system.  Remember when you pay off a loan which margin is the money is destroyed.  This further decrease liquidity in the system creating a negative feedback loop.  That’s why the fed was panicking last March because this was happening and they basically backstopped all of the debt markets.  This process is called debt deflation and used to be fixed through debt jubilees.  In biblical times it was referred to as year of our Lord.  

QE is just an asset swap so it doesn’t effect liquidity in the system.  The bank has to loan this money out to put money in the system.  If people use the stimulus money to pay off debt it also destroys that newly created money."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Wow, the answers in here are pretty bad."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thank you for finally providing the answer I've been seeking for years. But I have a question. If these people are playing defensively cuz they are unsure of the future, what do they do with the money that they pull out of the market? As far as I know, no one is buying bonds and that's why the 10y yield rate is going up. So where exactly is the money going to?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Best answer I’ve come across so far. Very helpful, thank you!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"One of the best answers here. I don’t have a gold to give but I give it to you from my heart.
Can you elaborate on “some stocks are gonna be a great buy because they are dragged down by the panic, others are going to get hit much worse”. E.g. Which sectors, boundary conditions and etc."

03/19/2021,stocks,"So if my main holdings actually have more cash than debt and strong earnings outlooks, but are suffering from this pullback somewhat due to being nasdaq listed, can i reasonably hope for them to hold on stronger if this keeps going and to bounce back easier than stocks not in low debt high earnings situations?"
03/19/2021,stocks,But powell just said that the fed will not be raising interest rates
03/19/2021,stocks,Why? I thought interest rates haven’t changed.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Cash and value stocks, like banks. Everyone knows the wisdom of ""buy low, sell high."" Institutional investors know it even better. 

One reason stocks are going up and down might be because they or their algorithms are trying to wait for others to sell, so that they can buy in at cheaper prices. Nobody wants to be bag holding. Once again, practically *everybody* at this stage believes that a crash is followed by a new high, so they want their money out now, so they can buy the bottom, later. 

Effectively, everybody is trying to time the crash to maximize profit. They're not necessarily buying anything else - they're just selling and waiting until it's time to jump back in."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Money is not leaving the market. Look at the S&P 500 and the DOW, we are at all time high. Money is leaving overvalued stocks, or growth stocks that depends on low yields to finance their debts, into value play and low PE, dividend stocks."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Exactly, the fed said it isn’t going to raise interest rates anytime soon, so why are businesses going to pay more for loans?"
03/19/2021,stocks,What do you think the tech stocks/growth stocks are  using to actually make the company profitable?. Most of them are losing money and not profitable right now . They are priced at future price value rather than current value. The 10 yr bond is the one that most companies use for valuation/risk. No company focuses on the 2 year which is a short term outlook for them.
03/19/2021,stocks,"The 10 year isn't set by the fed,  the market prices it"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’m not talking about the 10 year, I’m talking about federal fund interest rates, which are what would affect company loans..."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The bond market is the loan/debt market, you are literally giving money to the company in that market for an expected yield on your loan. If the safest bonds go up (government bonds, typically) then yields on all corporate bond offerings also have to go up.

The only way to get the yield under control would be to institute yield curve control, which would involve raising short term interest rates."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Ohhh okay, so corporate bonds track with the 10 year basically? That makes sense"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Depends on the duration of the loan, a bond offering will have a set amount of time, and the yield generally corresponds to the treasury’s bond rate’s yield at that duration."

People get into one camp or the other and stay irrationally loyal to it for life. Plus, tool trucks are nice but flea market Snap On is booming and the truck bill is first thing defaulted on if the COVID recession is indeed coming. 

We do have positions in TA, Penske, and Werner.  He wants Ryder but the charts don't get me excited.  I will also periodically swing steel companies and ones that make the bearings/parts for tools. That said, Snap On is a solid company.  If your investment goal right now is low to moderate growth and you're a little older they are probably not a bad choice.

Techs near me buy a fair bit of tools from them, a new tool or set of tools every few weeks I'd say but they also end up warrantying out tons of tools too.

I know a lot of people love VXUS but im personally betting on US market > international. Ive heard people suggest BND but looking at the trends and my age (28) i dont understand how people really make money there. Thoughts?

Ive also considered maybe doing ARKK or ARKW for the risk play after the above mentioned reallocation. I told myself the individual ARK funds were better but maybe it would be better just told hold K or W. W has a better return but K is ""total market"" it says. Thoughts?"

03/19/2021,stocks,"Actually the first thing you should do is look at the overlap for all of your holdings. 

I don’t know your risk tolerance so it is hard to make a specific recommendation.   I will tell you what I own but I bought them at the depths last year

BA
CAT
F
XOM
APA

All of these are strong economy plays

You might also look for transportation names.  I have LUV and SABR.  BA is also a transport related name but less directly so"

03/19/2021,stocks,JNJ will never disappear but I would just add to something like VTI in my opinion. I’m sure there is an index fund that includes everything but tech.
03/19/2021,stocks,"My preference is PINS - Pinterest it's the 21st century way to advertise.  Active users and avg revenue per user significantly increasing yoy.  Lots of potential for growth in the US and have barely tapped the growth potential internationally despite international users doubling in 2020.  Co-CEO's have large stakes in the company which I like as well.  I like the stock but I like the company even more.  (Not financial advice, opinions are my own)"

So I'll go with TSM, every piece of technology will have their manufactured chips in them. AMD, NVDA, AAPL, even INTC in the short-term rely on them. They are the superior foundry and with anti-China US tailwinds they should see a lot of growth in the next 10 years."

03/19/2021,stocks,">but im personally betting on US market > international

just FYI when the US moves to value dominate over growth, the historical trend has been that international stocks tend to outperform US stocks.

https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/FiveMythsInternationalInvesting_Webinar.pdf

there have been long, long periods where US stocks underperformed relative to the rest of the world. it varies year to year, but the nordic nations tend to come out on top pretty regularly among the best performing stock markets. so I vote for an international fund/etf of some type.

I think VW has a winner here that will take market share away from Tesla Model Y.  The VW fit and finish was great.  It drove very well. feels and looks a lot like a ICE car, and the price was great. Even more so when factoring in tax credits. This will be a great bridge vehicle for getting ICE customers into EV. A few cons with the VW was the software, but that is likely to improve with OTA.  VW partnership with battery co QS looks promising.  TSLA may be the iphone of EV, but I see VW being the Samsung.  It will be interesting how tsla responds."
03/19/2021,stocks,Sounds like you read the news lol. Have you test driven a Tesla?
03/19/2021,stocks,"I own Tesla shares, so you \*could\* claim that I'm biased, BUT my stock purchase/choice was based (among other factors) in my strong preference for Tesla over VW (and other competitors for now). I'm going to stick only to the car related stuff here, not the stock:

1. I test drove both. They are both fine. However, VW feels chintzy to me. The reason why no one wanted an electric car for the longest time is that chintziness (edit: and low range). Tesla made people want to buy an electric car, not only for the environment, but also for their own enjoyment and the pride of ownership. I was an owner of a VW (not electric, obviously), and I can't get excited about having another. If I were to be buying Tesla, then yes.
2. VW's weakest point has always been the software/the electric. THAT was always the glitchiest, most annoying part of their cars. So I'm a bit concerned with them going full electric when they couldn't even implement a non-glitchy software in their Jetta. In other words, I cannot even compare Tesla's software to VWs. Or I can... and Tesla wins hands down.
3. For me, the aesthetics are incomparable. Tesla feels like a spaceship. I admit it's a different price range, but the inside is incredibly comfortable and aesthetically beautiful. And I'm still impressed that they pulled off the falcon wing doors.
4. My four year old daughter tested both with me. She doesn't know that we are peasants who can't afford either of these at the moment:), but she told me to ""go to your computer and order Tesla right now!"""
03/19/2021,stocks,VW stock has already soared from low 20s to 40s
03/19/2021,stocks,To the people saying things like 'the quality of tesla is better'. Think about this thing as a investment and not a popularity contest. VW stock is vastly cheaper and will produce 1 million electric cars this year. Tesla has lost momentum on their way to the valuation they currently have.

In Norway (where I live), the VW brand has been eating Tesla’s lunch. Porsche, Audi and VW have all been selling extremely well."
03/19/2021,stocks,"VW has no electric vehicle that is worth talking about. It will take at least 4-5 years before QS' technology comes to fruition, and several years after that for the battery technology to be mass produced. By then, we'll be in Mars.

03/19/2021,stocks,"To be honest, every stock mentioned on Reddit has doubled in price then had a steep drop, then raises again and is dropped. VW is dropping now, wouldn’t be surprised if it makes backs down to the mid-20’s.

03/19/2021,stocks,"I personally wouldn’t buy a VW on principal.  Buying them is like buying/using WFC, two of the most morally corrupt corporations outside of the China sphere.  It is almost comedic that after the clean diesel thing, they make electric.  It’s probably secretly running off of uranium and poisoning everyone it comes into contact with."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Porsche is the iPhone 12 to TSLA iPhone 7, Ford is the LG and VW may be the Samsung. In every way TSLA is dead money. Porsche gear box is considerably better than Tesla and a truly better high end alternative in the luxury class (vs BMW who needs to catch up).

The paradigm shift is coming to smart motors in wheel wells that eliminate gear boxes, frictional losses and other efficiency killers. This will lower costs by 30%+ and extend range. This is only 3-5 years away and will be talked about en masse in 2022 and will destroy Tesla market share and pricing power in 2024. Market will start to discount this and contract valuation multiple by late this year or early 2022."
03/19/2021,stocks,Tesla has other endeavors that will yield huge returns

03/19/2021,stocks,"That’s a bold statement. I own two Tesla’s - a M3 and a MY. When ID.4 is released with an AWD or larger battery pack in Canada, I will buy it. 

I like some of my Tesla friends have had fun with the extra power of the Tesla vehicles... but in the end I don’t use that power often. I would like a more reliable EV with better fit and finish. I resent the number of service calls I have had and the fact many end with me being told that a defect is within spec and won’t be fixed. I resent the fact that Tesla FSD isn’t much more than a enhanced cruise control... won’t even recognize advanced green lights."
03/19/2021,stocks,"QS is like two years from their final product I think they said.  If they meet their own schedules.  Then there's the factor of mass production and cost.  If the battery can't be scaled to production because of high cost that's going to take even longer.  Makes no use if it's a superior battery but it cost 5x as much.  QS integration gonna be a while, years."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think you need to get out of your bubble and actually see what’s going on out there.

03/19/2021,stocks,"QS is a long speculative play. I know they don't have a product yet, but seem to be on the right track.  They have some big investors behind them as well, and VW spoke of them during their power day (like tesla battery day event)."

03/19/2021,stocks,"The same reasons you argue to yourself about why you don't actually need the ""tesla"" are the same reasons I will use to say VW is inferior, etc. You clearly have an affection to certain brand ""VW"" which means sure some people will purchase them based off the ""brand"" but lets face it. I don't see VW owner on twitter like Elon Musk is. I don't see VW sending rockets to mars. Tesla has great branding and with Elon Musk being the figure he is. VW will have to do more then make a car that is almost but doesn't actually compare to tesla to have a huge market share impact.

&#x200B;

Eventually one of these large Vehicle companies will come close to the being on the same playing field but tesla will always be the fore front leader."
03/19/2021,stocks,28 percent gain 😄
03/19/2021,stocks,"It'll take so many years before this technology comes to relevancy (mass production is what matters, not prototypes or several hundreds of them).

This decade will be dominated by Tesla. If VW plans to be the runner up to Tesla, it won't be before late this decade or probably next decade. Don't want to be negative but the only reason why they're pushing this narrative is because 1- governments are cracking down on ICE's 2- they realized Tesla's success. The only issue here is that Tesla is light years ahead of companies like VW, Ford, etc."
03/19/2021,stocks,">In Norway where I am, the VW brand has been significantly outperforming Tesla in the past year.

Interesting, because in March Tesla grew to have the largest market share in new vehicle sales in Norway"
03/19/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/19/2021,stocks,"Didn't Tesla break Norway's EV sold this month so far? But anyways, forget my last statement. In fact, why are we even talking about EV business in Norway. What about performance worldwide? When did cars sold in Norway ever become a proper a representation about the EV business, LOL? There's like 0 iPhone sold in some countries, why don't we put Apple to the same standards in their business line? Seems like some Tesla haters are trying to find all negative news they can find. I.E. reporting every single Tesla crash on the road. Imagine if I reported every single VW/Ford/ICE car crash.

I have not seen a single ID.x (whatever the number is, 3 or 4) sold in North America. I have not seen a single VW EV on the roads. Ford talks about Mach-E, yet they can't even build proper ICE cars without major issues. VW lied to the whole world about how much they were polluting the world, and now we ought to believe they will magically shift to a business that will require so much $ from them?

As I said, there are several questions one must answer before concluding that X company is a Tesla competition.

1. How many EV's does X company plan to MASS PRODUCE, what year?
2. How will they manage costs? (INCLUDING all the legacy anchor businesses - dealerships, mechanics, parts/services, oil/petrol, factories, employees specialized in latter, etc.)
3. What do they do with the batteries situation?
4. Do you understand that Tesla does more than putting a computer on 4 wheels? SaaS business, Robotaxi, energy (both for B2C & B2B) business, Tesla Insurance, potential HVAC, etc. Will any of the legacy autos ever do the latter? If not, ask yourselves why.
5. Finally, ask yourself - where will Tesla be while all these legacy autos manufacturers are trying to crunch their spreadsheets for the above questions? To fucking Mars. And companies like Ford, VW, and Toyota will still be selling 2-tonnes machines that uses petrol/oil to function.

Tesla is the future. There is no competition. You know it, you just don't want to understand the technology behind such massive move."
03/19/2021,stocks,Oh boy is it going to be a tough pill to swallow for you my friend. That American garbage is going to be the most valued company in the world.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Oh fair enough. Personally Im playing MicroVast since they have the production & sales and the spac they have a DA with is trading much cheaper. 

On the speculation front they have plants being setup in Germany that's very close to the Tesla factory (same city if I'm not mistaken) as well as one in the US that will be very close to VW Tennessee factory (MicroVast in Clarksville and VW in Chattanooga) so if those manufactures ever want to cut down on shipping costs of battery and battery parts they are setup to jump in."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Love all the negative, now I am certain my thesis is correct."
03/19/2021,stocks,They’re establishing a presence in the energy market by powering cities and autonomous vehicles.
03/19/2021,stocks,always curious who has any real benefit from super fast and super accelerating cars. you guys are not in Germany where you can actually drive 300kph on the Autobahn - so what's the point?!
03/19/2021,stocks,"not sure those two things are worth the high cost, but would be nice!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"This issue is not necessarily about which is the best product, or who has celerity status, but which is affordable for the masses .    I'm not arguing the accomplishments of Tesla or SpaceX . Regardless, this mostly comes down to affordability and scale. VW will likely be able to provide that.  Not everyone can afford a BMW, which one reason that Toyota/VW/Honda, etc sell so many cars.  

Also, Tesla makes a lot of money selling regulatory credits. Once the other legacy automakers move to EV, they may start selingl regulatory credits themselves.  They will definitely  stop buying them from Tesla. This could further cut into Tesla bottomline (short term anyway)."
03/19/2021,stocks,">I don't see VW owner on twitter like Elon Musk is.

Sometimes that's preferable. 2 years he accused a guy of being a pedo because the guy was more successful at saving the 12 trapped children than Elon was.

For the record I like TSLA, but no shareholder should want their CEO tweeting garbage like that"
03/19/2021,stocks,Looking for like 8% after today. I like the stock and should have got in awhile back
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think this is what’s likely to happen as well. 

Tesla already won the decade for EVs imo. It’s really just a competition between legacy auto to see who will become #2, or just survive in general. 

I think a lot of people over estimate the odds of some legacy autos to survive the decade. I definitely think VW will be the #2 to Tesla but I dint expect them to ever overtake Tesla."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Norway is relevant because it has the highest EV penetration in the world. I assume also the most chargers per capita. You don’t think it’s interesting to look at the purchasing habits of a country leading the race on EVs, when discussing the future of EVs???

Your second paragraph is the problem for me and why I’m bearish on Tesla stock. You haven’t seen an ID3 in the US. Most Americans still think Tesla is basically the only choice for EVs. Tesla continues to be valued as if it’s going to dominate the whole EV space.

There is a TON of competition here already in Europe. How long is it before most of these are exported to the US? How long is it before ICE also gets into the game?"

03/19/2021,stocks,"People don't understand shit in EV's, let alone understand Tesla's business. Their under impression it's as simple as replacing a combustion engine w/ a big ass battery.

The whole factory changes. Your costs change. Your whole business model changes. How will legacy auto manufacturers (Ford, VW, Toyota, etc.) lose their service/parts/dealerships partnerships? Assume that they do figure out how to overcome the latter challenges. When will all of this come to fruition? Better yet, where will Tesla be by then? Tesla is looking at Robotaxi + providing a sustainable energy business to the world, while VW/Ford are still trying to figure out how to transition from a \[soon-to-be-illegal\] legacy (ICE) business to EV."
03/19/2021,stocks,Tesla doesnt deliver much in Jan/Feb there. Majority are towards the end of the Quarter for Tesla so looking at 2 months is irrelevant. Look at the actual quarters.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Exactly my question, how long until these legacy auto companies put out EV cars on North American roads that can compete with Tesla's? It'll take years before they are seen on the roads in North America. By then, Tesla will ramp us Texas' factory, and finish Berlin factory to mass produce cars for Europe.

Also, even the cars in Europe is no competition to Tesla's. Assume they are competition, what is their plan to mass produce and handle their legacy businesses that I stated? There's no plan, because they don't know either. How would we know?

In the end, you failed to address any of my bullet points questions. If you're stuck in the bubble of thinking that a car is just a machine w/  4 wheels and that going from ICE -> EV has no repercussions on costs/profits, then you have failed to understand why no one can compete with Tesla. Again, no mentions on SaaS business, Robotaxi/self-driving, batteries, etc."

Secondly it seems customer satisfaction repeat business is spotty. Folks don't like the long lead times, the options for repairs and service, and not to mention the abhorrent return for selling your 50k+ mile EV. Not to mention many dealers (all very connected) won't take the thing simply because of the aforementioned parts availability should anything go wrong."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Absolutely spot on man. Most people who bash on Tesla and say that Ford, GM or VW are about to destroy them probably think you can pick up a 2010 VW Jetta, jack out the engine and throw in a Double A duracel battery and voila."

As you’re aware, 1Q20 is not finished yet"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think you greatly underestimate the speed with which legacy companies can compete with Tesla. VW has shown that this is already the case. 

Regarding your second paragraph, I guess you completely missed the VW CMD with their plan and the reason why the stock spiked 50% this week. 

How much money is Tesla making on SaaS, robotaxis, autonomous etc? How long before somebody develops a better battery? There is a reason I don’t mention these factors, and the revenue stream from most of them is currently zero. Maybe they will be realities at some point, but Elon has already been claiming FSD will be ready soon for the last 5 years. Forgive me, if I am skeptical."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yes.
03/19/2021,stocks,"That's what I am saying. Wait for the quarter to be over to see the actual results. Tesla doesnt deliver much in the first two months. Also Tesla is not focused on Europe. Their factory isn't finished yet so they have to ship from China or Fremont. They can sell everything they produce without shipping to Europe so why focus there when the factory isn't ready. All of these arguments are just not thought out. Wait a year or 2 and tesla will have a ton of cars being sold in Europe, they will be all over the place. They will be produced on the same continent and at a cost that they will sell a ton."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Have you seen the FSD Beta video clips people have been posting on Twitter? Real cars driving by themselves, with ""almost"" no human intervention. This is beta. No general release. All cars delivered by Tesla has the hardware to support this software update. All it needs is 1- fine tuning the ""edges"" 2- regulations from municipalities. Miami City mayor \[I spoke to him\] is already willing to try it out ASAP \[Robotaxi that is\].

Again, less words, more action. There's currently 0 mass produced non-Tesla-EV-car that is better than Tesla's 2012 Model S. It's 2021."
03/19/2021,stocks,How dumb are you where I need to convince you people enjoy driving fast cars?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Clearly we have different viewpoints here. Tesla has dominated the EV market in Europe and especially Norway for the last half decade. As I am telling you, I believe this is no longer the case and Tesla will only continue to lose market share.

I would also make the same argument you did but the other way around. Wait a few months or couples years and you will see all these European EV models coming to the US and also taking market share there."
03/19/2021,stocks,"U miss the point, most people don‘t give a fuck about fast cars and are not gonna pay a premium for such an EV. U live in a bubble."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would argue that Tesla will likely lose market share like you said. The segment is growing so it doesnt matter if they literally sell every car they can produce. This EV competition is coming statement has been said for years now. Every year it's this company is coming, this one is coming. It's not stopping Tesla and their trajectory. When tesla has a factory on the continent of Europe and they start producing a 25k car before incentives. It's going to blow up. Millions sold in Europe."
2021-03-19 05:15:39,stocks,"How safe is money in EFT's/Brokerage accounts? So I have had an account at etrade forever.   They are my main bank account and I have a small amount in an investment account that I have just invested with an index fun, in this case VOO.

I have low six figures in cash savings, and I'd like to just drop it in an index fund and forget about it, but I'm a little worried.   What if the brokerage (etrade) goes bankrupt?  Is it all gone?   What about firm that runs VOO?  What if they run into some kind of trouble?   Do I need to split my money into a few different EFT's or among different brokerages?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’m kinda of the school of thought that if something like Vanguard or VOO goes bankrupt, you have significantly bigger problems as we’re facing a global economic collapse.  Too big to fail here.

I don’t envision this happening, at least until the Ross ice shelf really starts melting."
03/19/2021,stocks,"ETFs are not insured or guaranteed... but I think you should be fine using an SIPC brokerage Or brokerages’. Personally, I would spread it around; most brokerages can track all of your accounts through their site"
03/19/2021,stocks,">What if the brokerage (etrade) goes bankrupt? Is it all gone?

No. Another brokerage firm will likely come along and scoop up the assets of the insolvent firm, and deposit them into accounts with that institution. 

>What about firm that runs VOO?

03/19/2021,stocks,"ETFs are not brokerages. ETrade is a broker regulated by the SEC, FINRA, and is a member of SIPC. If ETrade goes bankrupt tomorrow SIPC covers you. That is completely different that an ETF. An ETF can cease trading. You are not protected in any way by investing in an ETF."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Those funds are kept separate. If vanguard (for example) goes bust, your $ is kept totally separate.  

Having said that, if vanguard goes kaput, chances are everything is crashing and your investment will be crashing too (unless you are in some inverse fund).  But it is still your money, separate from vanguard."
03/19/2021,stocks,As safe as me sticking my dick on a random girl in Vegas ... you never know what will happen next..
03/19/2021,stocks,In for info
03/19/2021,stocks,"That’s why you don’t put all your eggs in one basket lol. Chances are if one basket fails though they will all follow like dominos. At that point it’s like, good luck getting your money out and even if you do the hyperinflation might just make it as usefully as toilet paper."
03/19/2021,stocks,"there are a few things to consider. 

stocks themselves are not in any way guaranteed. if a company goes bankrupt, you can lose 100% of your investment. 

however, if the brokerage goes bankrupt/out of business ... usually it's bought out by another broker. if that doesn't happen, your access to the stocks is in most cases guaranteed by SIPC. like if your bank goes bust ... the FDIC guarantees your accounts up to a certain point."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right, I'm aware that ETF's aren't brokerages.  Is an ETF like VOO backed by vanguard?   Are my losses limited to what the market might loose or am I at risk that Vanguard might just stop trading the ETF?"
03/19/2021,stocks,You should probably read the prospectus: An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.[vanguard Prospectus](https://personal.vanguard.com/pub/Pdf/sp968.pdf?2210142649)
2021-03-19 05:13:07,stocks,"List of books to read if you want to actually become knowledgeable about stocks and not stay a normie who doesn't know what they're doing I'm about to hit you all with some knowledge, so get your big kid pants on! You should read these books in the order they are listed, because they stack up on top of each other and the lessons learned in one are needed to understand the lessons in the next.

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor or registered securities analyst.*

*Another disclaimer: If you do not know what exactly a stock is, how to buy or sell a stock or what dividends and earnings are, please look up some crash courses on YouTube or something before starting this list.*

**Let's begin:**

1. **The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle** \- For those of you who don't know, John Bogle is one of the most important people to ever walk this planet when it comes to stocks and investing for the average person. He founded a little company called Vanguard (ever heard of it?) and he also invented the first index fund. In this book, Bogle gives us a primer on the classical approach to passive, conservative and long-haul investing. He goes into the statistics on how around 90% of mutual funds and most people can not beat the market. He makes it clear and simple that if you want to benefit from stock yields over time, you should deploy your money into index funds and sit back while earnings and dividends carry you to wealth. Many people (probably most people to be honest) can stop here and honestly do perfectly fine. The info in this book is all you need to build serious wealth. You will also understand the theory that picking individual stocks is usually a *losers game*. One of the reasons I believe you should read this book first is because the lessons you learn inside of it may show you that the rest of the books on this list may not even be worth reading! If you aren't content with boring old index fund investing though, you can read on..
2. **One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch** \- This book is dated but the principles written in its pages ring true to this day. Peter Lynch is considered one of the most successful mutual fund managers of all time. He achieved returns that beat the S&P 500 for over a decade straight for his investors in the Fidelity Magellan Fund in the 70's and 80's. Yes I know I said most people can't beat the market by picking stocks, which is why those who can do it consistently are very special. In this book he teaches you about the tools and strategies he used to achieve those results. It's a great book because it doesn't get too crazy in terms of math and logic, and it's easy to understand.
3. **Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman -** Now it's time to take a break and get into the *psychology* behind stock investing. Let's be honest, we're all pretty stupid and we all have internal biases. These two facts can be serious roadblocks to investing success. The sooner you admit that the better off you'll be. This book will help you understand how to separate your irrational mind from your rational mind when investing and it will make you better at objective decision making.

&#x200B;

\--

Ok, now at this point you have two paths you can take. After these three books you'll have a good grasp on the *theory* and *mindset* to making money in stocks, but you will be lacking the knowledge to actually ***pick individual stocks***. I mean how are you supposed to do that? Just buy whatever is trending on Reddit or what that idiot Jim Cramer on CNBC is talking about? Well as long as you still understand (from book #1) that the odds are against you when picking stocks, you can continue on one of two paths:

**- The Value Investing Path** (Finding, analyzing and buying stocks that are ""undervalued"" and waiting for them to rise back to their fair market value, thus making a ton of money. This is what Warren Buffett does. It's also extremely difficult, boring and requires *rock-solid* emotional stability to ignore the ups and downs of the market.)

\-OR-

**- The Traders Path** (Following market trends and sentiment to find opportunities that can make you money. I personally would not consider this path to be an ""investors"" path. This is a ""speculators"" path, and they are very different. However, you can make money speculating. This could involve shorting stocks or doing a bit of technical analysis, or maybe even playing with some derivatives like options. This path is also extremely difficult and will cause most people to lose *hours* of sleep each night sweating as they panic about their positions)

\--

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Value Investing Path**, continue here:

1. **All of the accounting books you can find** \- You NEED to understand the fundamentals of accounting in order to value businesses. There is no getting around it. Yes, it's boring but if you find yourself enjoying it, you may have an inclination for this. Read everything you can on accounting. Learn to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. Learn about assets and liabilities. Do the practice assignments in the books and all of that!
2. **The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham -** This is probably the most famous book on this list, and guess what, you're not going to understand ANY of it. This is the book that Warren Buffett swears by. In fact, Buffett studied with the author of this book when he was a lad. This book is the bible of value investing. Every successful investor knows this book. Within its pages you will learn about what to look for in the stock market, how to understand market behavior, what a good business looks like, how to find the *intrinsic value* of a company, and much much more. I recommend reading this book at least twice and researching everything inside it that you don't understand.
3. **Margin of Safety by Seth Klarman -** Physical copies of this book are extremely expensive, so you're better off finding an online copy (shh don't tell). It's a bit more modern than the title above and it was written by a very successful value investor!
4. **The Dhando Investor by Mohnish Pabrai** **-** Fantastic value investing book that offers some fresh ideas and new things to think about that are built on top of the previous books. Also written by a very successful investor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If you chose **The Traders Path**, continue here:

1. **Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefèvre** \- A classic that most traders are told to read at some point in their lives. It teaches so many valuable lessons of reflecting on your wins/losses, psychology of trading, knowing yourself and your weaknesses and more fun stuff. It's an old book but definitely worth reading.
2. **Getting Started in Technical Analysis by Jack Schwager**  \- If you don't know, technical analysis (TA) is the process of finding opportunity by analyzing the market indicators such as price, volume and trends. It ignores company fundamentals and is often seen as a type of voodoo that you either believe in or you don't. I personally am not a fan, however I do recognize the importance TA plays in understanding some stocks at certain times. I do believe that in combination with other metrics, TA can provide valuable insight. This book will teach you the basics.
3. **Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Nicholas Taleb -** It is not possible to predict the stock market. This book will help you reconcile with that. It will help with understanding how randomness and a bit of luck ties into not only your trading, but your whole life. You will learn about risks and the consequences of taking them.
4. **Market Wizards by Jack Schwager** \- Another great book by the same author as #2 above. This is written in a sort of conversation-like format where the author interviews some of the most successfully traders of the time. There is tons of information in this book on all of the topics we've discussed since it's like you're reading a conversation between two people.

I hope this post will help some of you.

03/19/2021,stocks,Hmmm did not see investing for dummies on this list...
03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks for taking time to put this together. Definitely going to check some of these out.
03/19/2021,stocks,"For the most part, after reading investing books you still don't know anything, but you can articulate better what it is that you don't know"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Quality post. For ppl into value investing check this out:

https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need

The deeper you get into it the more u realize how nuanced it can be and that passive investing (bogle style) is probably more efficient. But it's pretty awesome you can learn everything on ur own these days."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I am a high school teacher who has a unique class in which students choose what to do with their time, one of my seniors has chosen to invest in the stock market and has decided that his goal is to become a day trader. He is intelligent and hard working and I have no doubt he could be successful at anything he sets his mind to.

My question is, for graduation if I was to buy him any one single book, that would both help him and keep an 18 year olds interest, what one book should start him out. Thank you in advance."
03/19/2021,stocks,I recommend *The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins*
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thank you!  Absolutely saving this post.

Im reading A Random Walk Down Wall Street now but The Richest Man in Babylon got me started."
03/19/2021,stocks,I'm a big fan of Michael Lewis and would like to add Fast Boys.  Also Liar's Poker was required reading while getting my MBA.  Well worth the time.  Thanks for putting together this list.
03/19/2021,stocks,"There is a high probability that even reading them I won't know what I'm doing, my favorite book is modern portfolio theory and investment analysis"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nice list and I haven't any arguments against it.  Thanks for putting in the work.  I'd like to remind everyone that fundamentals are the who, what, why, where, and how and the technicals are the when.  Note 5 types of questions are answered by the hard? boring work.  

Again, nice list."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks for this post! I’m grateful you separated the recommendations by value or trading, because I already know I’m a value investor (and professional accountant) and will therefore check out the books by Klarman or Pabrai. I started my investment journey 15 years ago with two other value investing books: The Little Book of Value Investing, and Rule #1. :)"
03/19/2021,stocks,Awesome! I can wear headphones almost 40 hours a week at work. Time to get to learning. Better than the 4 playlists I’m sick of or political podcasts
03/19/2021,stocks,"You should add, How to make money in stocks; A winning system in good times or bad by William J O’Neal. He’s had a few protégés win stock investing championships. 

The CAN SLIM method is great looking for growth. It gives you info how to simply read charts, find sector rotation , knowing when the market is in uptrend or down. Be disciplined and sell at a 5-7% loss.  It’s chock full stuff"
03/19/2021,stocks,The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel should be near the top.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I have a 4 year degree in financial markets. Several years work experience working as an equity analyst and have read over 500 books on investing. 

And I don’t know what the hell the markets going to do tomorrow or one month from now. 

For anyone who wants to learn about stocks, here is my simple advice. 


Don’t bother reading up on stocks, don’t bother trading them, Pick up an index fund, and keep putting money regularly into it. That’s it. That’s all there is to it. 

Nobody here generates any alpha on their portfolio once you put a value on the time it takes to track the market, research stocks etc."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I asked for this content multiple times and the auto-mod said “merp, read the sub details, you’re question will be ignored, derp” 

So thank you for posting this"
03/19/2021,stocks,Audiobooks for the win. Start out with youtube with audiobooks if u dont want to pay for audible etc. This works well if u are busy
03/19/2021,stocks,"Add :
Flash Boys by Michael Lewis. 
Excellent book on HFT and how to recognize and avoid the downfalls caused by it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would point out that for people who want to engage in value investing, if you find research, reading financial statements and annual reports and making spreadsheets and taking notes a boring chore, you might want to consider doing something else. 

Yes, it's a time-tested strategy, but why would you spend your time doing something you think is boring in the hopes that it will make you rich? All you'll be is a slightly well off bored person. 

It isn't hard though, and I personally find it quite engaging to read through financials and get a feel for a business, but I can completely understand that not everyone necessarily enjoys it as much as I do. I just want to say that there's no shame in that, it doesn't make you dumb or less valuable as a person, and honestly, a lot of people who claim to be ""sophisticated investors"" are only pretending to be better than you. SA is rife with those kinds of people, and all they're good at is making other people feel bad about making more money in some YOLO than they made in their bag holding.

I would encourage everyone to give value investing and doing research a try though, just in case you find yourself liking it. Plus, it never hurts to learn new things, so at the very least, you'll learn some financial accounting and that's useful in other areas of your life as well.

Thank you OP for making the list."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Unpopular opinion: reading more than 2 financial/stock market books is a waste of time, just get the basics and dip."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I hate to read, as I am ape, but since I am getting into stocks, I need to be less ape and be more man. So picture books bore me now and words for money make me happy. I’ll be looking for these books, but as I don’t have a lot of time in my daily schedule from swinging from tree to tree, I might be lost for a while. Good thing my ape fingers hit the save button on this post."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Excellent recommendations. I’d say only one book is missing—The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks. It premised on the idea that there is no one “most important thing” in investing, and he goes through about 23 concepts that make for a successful investor."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I would rather just invest in one stock, have that stock go up, then later, sell that stock."
03/19/2021,stocks,Thank you making this list! Definitely gonna at least go through 'The Little Book of Common Sense Investing' to decide if I want to fully go through with investing in individual stocks
03/19/2021,stocks,"Saved. This is why I joined this subreddit, for extensive DD on companies/industries I know nothing about and posts like these."
03/19/2021,stocks,Commenting for later follow up. Definitely need to get a couple of these on my Kindle
03/19/2021,stocks,"I've read all of these and many...many more. Can confirm most of this is correct. A few add ons if I may: 

-Howard Marks deserves mention. He has a phenomenal track record and more importantly he is a phenomenal TEACHER. I'd recommend The Most Important Thing and Mastering the Market Cycle. 

-This is more personal but maybe some others will agree: Nassim was very hard to follow at first. I received his Incerto series as a gift before I read Daniel Kahneman's work. I'd recommend reading Thinking, Fast and Slow (you mentioned so kudos!!) first before even attempting to read NNT but once it clicks it reaaally clicks."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I will check it out 
Thank you"

03/19/2021,stocks,Yes thanks for this comprehensive list - I find a lot of times posters recommend books but don't provide a general perspective of what objective the books strategy focus is. It helps to understand what kind of buyer one is and wants to be so we are reading material that is relevant to our end game
03/19/2021,stocks,"At first: Thank you for this great list. 

I would add: Flash Boys - Michael Lewis

That book gave me a good understanding of high frequency trading works."
03/19/2021,stocks,have read almost all of these and still not a millionaire. Good recommendations though
03/19/2021,stocks,Anyone have suggestions for some accounting books?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks for taking the time to write this. As a Boglehead, the only book you’ll need from this list is Bogle’s. His is the only true way of generating wealth consistently from the market. In a way, it’s paradoxical that his book be suggested on this list and even on this subreddit."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Good info, thanks. I read this post in Samuel Jackson's voice ( mix of Coach Carter + Pulp Fiction) until halfway through and when i saw the word ""lad"", my mind switched voices to a combination of British Nanny and Queen Elizabeth.😆 Lol!"

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, you could invest a ton of time into gaining a deeper understanding of a trade you won’t derive most of your income from. An industry, I might add, in which 90% of professional stock pickers perform worse than the index benchmark.

OR you can just contribute money to VTI every month and never have to think about it."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Anyone rate John j murphys T A book, just finished thought it was great"
03/19/2021,stocks,">he also invented the first index fund.

Quibbling, but Jack Boggle did not start the first index fund. For reference, the Vanguard S&P 500 index debuted in 1976. 

Arthur Lipper petitioned the SEC to start an index tracking the DJIA way back in 1968 or '69, but it never got off the ground. The idea of index funds had been floating around for a few years at this point based on Eugene Fama's research from the University of Chicago, and had been boosted by Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson (among others) who said the typical mutual fund in the 1960s was a ripoff and people would be better served with passive management tracking an average market return. 

Jeremy Grantham started an index fund for the public a few years later (1971) but it was such a radical idea he didn't have any customers for a while, not until 1973 or '74. Also starting in 1971, John McQuown managed part of a pension with an index fund while he worked at a Wells Fargo branch in San Fransisco. 

Rex Sinquefield tracked the S&P 500 at a Chicago bank starting in 1973, open to the general public, and had billions of dollars under management after a few years. Sinquefild and McQuown both went on to work at Dimenaional Fund Advisors, started by U of Chicago alumni, whose oldest fund dates to 1981. 

So while Boggle certainly desrves a lot of credit for promoting index funds, he simply did not invent them nor was he the first to sell them. the last time I checked, Dimensional Funds was still a top-10 American firm by assets under management. but they're not as well know as other firms, always done little or no advertising/promotion, preferring to let like-minded clients find them rather than seek them out. 

For sources see Justin Fox's The Myth of the Rational Market, and this: https://www.stlmag.com/The-Return-of-the-King/

great list, BTW. I've read about half of those books now I need to check out the others."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I recommend cutting to the chase and dropping a few bucks to buy a Kaplan home study course for passing the Series 7. It was only after passing that and getting into the field that I realized oh, most of these idiots I work with just took it because they had to, and retained nothing. 

Once you learn the mechanics of how markets work and a broad overview of regulation you realize literally everything is stacked again the retail investor (under the guise of “protection”) but you learn how the sausage is made in terms of market makers, call/put strategies, the main points of fundamental and technical analysis, Fed policy/theory 101 etc. I repeatedly go back to my online 7 manual (especially in light of the egregious market manipulation by RH) and it’s super helpful. Now when I read other investing books I have the foundation to understand them. Kinda like learning the alphabet before you learnt to read. Having the series 7 makes me a much better investor for myself but you don’t need to take the test (you’d need a FINRA firm sponsor anyway) to learn a shit ton from the prep course. 

The $200 or so bux I spent on the course was worth it. Quitting that dumb job and investing on my own: priceless"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I have two others that aren't so much mathy as much as they are about mentality:

- Your money and your brain - Jason Zweig. It just describes all the mental traps you set for yourself and how people fail to stick to a good plan and how to not be your own worst enemy.

- Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation - Edward Chancellor: this book is mostly just a historical review of all the various stock crashes major stock market crashes from the south seas bubble to railway manias, the great depression and more recent modern crashes such as the tech bubble. It's a great overview of the public mindset around each of these, and how pretty much every time there was a genuine belief of ""this time is different"".

The two of these really helped me stay grounded and realistic, not fall for pattern seeking where they don't exist and not panic or get greedy from fomo.

I'd really recommend anyone to read them whatever they believe about the stock market. They won't teach you strategies of what to buy and what not to, but they'll give essential perspective on both yourself and the nature of the beast"
03/19/2021,stocks,I just started reading Thinking Fast and Slow. Definitely going to put the other two in my Amazon cart today!
03/19/2021,stocks,I wanted to post yesterday bout book recommendations but boiiii here we go. Thanks for the list.
03/19/2021,stocks,"It's old at this point, but if you read Thinking Fast and Slow and you want to go deeper, ""Your Money and Your Brain"" is an absolutely FANTASTIC book that explains relevant Neuroeconomics in relation to investing.

You are correct, you will not under that book at all. I recommend to anyone to read the commentary section first and then read the actual chapter. I also, recommend getting this book: The Devil's Financial Dictionary https://www.amazon.com/dp/1610397762?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

It is by the editor of The Intelligent Investor. It is a dictionary of the word used by Wall Street. The  young are not taught how to invest so we have to figure out this by ourselves. Great post and I wish I can give you more upvotes but what let’s take this to the moon 🚀🚀"

03/19/2021,stocks,No Kostolany?
03/19/2021,stocks,"So my first book on investing was the Intelligent Investor. I just dove right in and looked up every word I didn’t understand. I went through about 200 pages in a weekend, then the next 400-500 hurt a lot. It’s definitely something everyone should try to read. There’s some really good advice in there. Specifically looking at second tier companies in a bull market and looking at not so popular large companies during a bear market (expecting a turn around). 

Whatever you read, don’t try to correlate too much of it to what is happening now. There’s never been a time when the retail investor has had so much influence on the equities market than we do now. Communication, influence, etc is reaching 100’s of millions of people. We need to continue to recommend fundamentals to new investors and not let them waste money on speculation. Now on the flip side there’s something about ‘special conditions’ which  I think is what’s happened with GME. However an investor knows when to dip their toes and when to pull back. A new ‘speculator’ with no real plan, is more likely to lose it all. Which is what’s happened in previous crashes. Anyways, good post OP. Heading to chapters after work to grab one of your recommendations. Happy Friday."

I am interested in podcasts that are both entertaining and informative on the topic of finance, and also any interesting books on significant economic events. The big short was such a good read but I also learned a ton about it. I’ve been reading online about the Enron disaster lately and I’m interested in reading more about it.

I have a Buffet story that I'm still salty about...In business school many years ago, I took a Value Investing class, we had a competition to pitch a stock. The winning team gets a lunch with Warren Buffet. My team won. The Office of The Oracle of Omaha took so long to coordinate with our professor that the trip was not confirmed before we graduated. 

Months later, our prof followed-up  ""Guy, I'm truly sorry to have to tell you this but Warren has said that as a policy, he only meets with *current* students so he will not be able to meet you. But they feel bad about the mix-up so the good news is that he will meet my entire current Value Investing class. Your alumni association has generously raised funds so that we may charter a plane and fly the whole class to Omaha!""

03/19/2021,stocks,This is absolutely amazing OP! I have so much reading to do for sure!!!!!
03/19/2021,stocks,I read Thinking Fast and Slow a couple years ago— great read!
03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks for the effort!
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm surprised ""Thinking Fast And Slow"" in that list. There are better (read as: more direct) books on cognitive biases and the allusion to a 1 & 2 system often get confused for *actual* things rather than simply homunculi. Actually if you want to succeed I'd recommend **Nudge** by  by Thaler instead."
03/19/2021,stocks,Maybe just like talk to people who actually invest and learn from them.... saves you time reading outdated books based on market patterns from the past
03/19/2021,stocks,"And to anybody thinking about posting noob questions in stock subreddits without reading books first I will fucking find you. You can't hide from me, motherfucker"
03/19/2021,stocks,"No, don’t read the TA book. Read Hull."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Currently reading Thinking, Fast and Slow - What an eye opening book it has everything - academic humour, psychology, probability, economics + more. Probably the best book I've ever read."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Dr Seuss- great day for up, also If I ran the circus and the fan favorite, I can lick 30 tigers today"
03/19/2021,stocks,you can try to make money on the Asko project - Bringing Innovative dApps to the Forefront of DeFi. High income and profitability at ASKOLend
03/19/2021,stocks,r/wallstreetbets has that covered
03/19/2021,stocks,Maybe there are a few versions of it but mine in german isnt really good. It tells a lot but not very in detail and a lot of unuseful history of stocks.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Is this sarcasm, or is it a genuine underappreciated book?"
03/19/2021,stocks,Good luck
03/19/2021,stocks,Same
03/19/2021,stocks,There's nothing in these books that you can't get for free on the internet. Look up their table of contents and Google.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm not a trader though probably read half the list. I just like these sort of books. But what I reckon books like The Intelligent Investor do is actually create a certain thought process in what an investment is about. 

Nassim Taleb specifically I read all his books except for his papers, I just love reading them as they put your mind to work."
03/19/2021,stocks,Even that can help your decision making a lot. Being aware of your own limitations and biases is important.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’d highly suggest “Options, Futures, and other derivatives” by John Hull. If you’re getting into derivatives. This is the Bible on it."
03/19/2021,stocks,I invest because it makes me money but I don't consider myself an investor.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I feel like none of these books can relate to the current state of the market anyway.

Still, learning *anything* stock/trading/investing related is good if you want to legitimately make money and do it consistently."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Honest question: If you believe in value investing, but don't want to put in the work, why not buy stakes in value firms and ETFs like BRK.B or VTV instead of going full Bogle head? 

It seems like the best of both worlds: Value investing, but professionals are doing all the work for you."

03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks!
03/19/2021,stocks,I'd there a value investing subreddit? This sub and /r/investing have turned into a speculative day trading dystopia. I had a guy argue with me the other day that PLUG is a good investment with no idea of their fundamentals
03/19/2021,stocks,I would buy him The Little Book of Common Sense Investing and show him this list of books. Especially the ones from the trading list.

03/19/2021,stocks,"The movie collection of Wall Street, Wolf of Wall Street, Margin Call, Boiler Room, Trading Places, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Big Short. The trading floors and attitudes are what the current generation is up against. The ideals these movies posses are not going away and only growing stronger. I think these movies are a great way to learn about the underbelly of the market and even gain knowledge of a few key ideas and terms over the books that are out there. Follow it up with a few Nightline documentaries around the housing crisis and tech bubble and there's quite a lesson in greed and risk taking to be had"
03/19/2021,stocks,A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis by Anna Couling
03/19/2021,stocks,The New Trading for a Living.
03/19/2021,stocks,"A Random Walk Down Wall Street, because it explains the world does not go in a straight pattern. It starts with historical market events even up to now. And then explains what theories people use on investment. The rest is pretty much to tell one to invest passively, so one can have more time to invest actively in one's knowledge and experience.

A book is like a beginning, what really goes well with any book is the experience. One does not gain unless one started to invest, both time and money."
03/19/2021,stocks,A better approach is to buy him a share. Internet will teach him faster and better than any one book.
03/19/2021,stocks,Is this more on the beginner or intermediate side? Trying to figure out where I should position this in relation to OP's lineup
03/19/2021,stocks,What is the babylon book about?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Literally two thirds thru random walk. I love his anecdotes, such a fanciful writer."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I just got this book, how is it so far ? I heard it’s mostly about investing in Index Fonds, which I’m not that interested in, but we’ll see."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The Richest Man in Babylon is fantastic for basic financial competency.

It's not a long read and is very easy to digest. 

I think more people should read it, especially in America where tons of people seem to struggle with handling their money on a  fundamental level."
03/19/2021,stocks,Flash boys?
03/19/2021,stocks,Amazing :)
03/19/2021,stocks,I’m in the middle of this one right now.
03/19/2021,stocks,This in conjunction with Mark Minervini - Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard
03/19/2021,stocks,"The Psychology of Money is the best book on investing that I have ever purchased, and it hardly even dives into finance and dry data. It is the only book I have ever read that I truly think will add hundreds of thousands of dollars to my net worth. I can't even write the right words to praise it properly but the reviews and ratings speak for themselves. This is the book of our generation and its lessons will likely still be relevant in 30-40 years."
03/19/2021,stocks,Hey thanks man!
03/19/2021,stocks,What index fund/s would you recommend? Thanks
03/19/2021,stocks,i let the audible read for me while i follow the words in the book lmao changed my book game
03/19/2021,stocks,This one is more for entertainment value but a very very good read. If you liked it i'd also recommend The Man Who Solved the Market. It's not gonna help your investing much but it's really interesting.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Eh sometimes you have to do boring things to get something you want.  I find cleaning, like deep cleaning my kitchen or something, incredibly boring and tedious but I also want my kitchen to be clean. I haven't done the readings on anyone company to consider myself a value investor but I really like researching so I've enjoyed the small amount of research I've done for my portfolio.  

When you are looking for a company, do you prefer to look into a company you know and have a rough idea of or do you try to find something entirely new to you?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you are looking to do long-term value or growth investing rather than trading - I recommend reading some books listed above then diving into 10-Ks. Trading is different, and you are correct probably don't need to read to much to start. It is more about getting the feel for how prices move within the overall market."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Upvoted. When I tried to get into stocks 10 years ago I decided to take a smartass approach and read like 10 books on economics, finance, investing, stocks and whatnot. Should I mention that without an external motivation in a form of actual money invested in some stocks I gave up in like week after reading 1/5 of “intelligent investor”. Shit gets boring when there’s no money at stake"
03/19/2021,stocks,What? Care to explain what you mean?

03/19/2021,stocks,what if it goes down?
03/19/2021,stocks,Peter Lynch and Ken Fisher both promote growth investing
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes I understand what you mean. I recommended most people could stop after book #1 and not continue, but I think it's important to realize a lot of people (especially in this sub) want to try to pick stocks - whether or not it's the smart thing to do"
03/19/2021,stocks,Lmao
03/19/2021,stocks,Almost perfect. We need some cash to buy good deals too.

03/19/2021,stocks,FFS.
03/19/2021,stocks,I can't wait to see how this comment ages!
03/19/2021,stocks,No problem
03/19/2021,stocks,Noooooo read the first book!!
03/19/2021,stocks,The Investors Business Daily founder. Can’t go wrong
03/19/2021,stocks,"Value investing is literally piss easy, if you need to read a book to learn that you probably shouldn’t be investing"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm pretty certain that a lot of them (the older user accounts) know exactly what they're doing. It's just really, really masked."
03/19/2021,stocks,"it’s very appreciated, but it’s also apparently a pretty good book."
03/19/2021,stocks,Amazing post. Thank you so much!
03/19/2021,stocks,"To be honest, experience in the market trumps any amount of books you can read. They can definitely help with getting into right mindset but is not a “Golden Egg” when it comes to profitability. If anything stick to 2-3 books and master them. 

It’s also important to understand that the foundation of investing or trading isn’t even profits, it’s risk management, you need to keep it before you can grow it. 

Learn how to apply what’s known as “second-order thinking” and build a habit of thinking in probabilities is also key. 

Other than that, experience and trial and error is all you really need. 

Source: MBA in Finance, work as a junior equity research analyst valuing stocks all day. 

Most of my our investment strategies come from experience asides from the basic applications learned during my core classes in school and from pursuing the CFA which teaches you concepts relative to portfolio management, investment analysis and asset allocation.

I don’t think anyone at my work, has ever read a stock book. Because again, strategies and investment styles are all relative to ones investment objectives, financial situation, risk tolerance, and time horizon etc. which is different for each individual. 

The author maybe risk seeking but you’re risk averse. They may have large amounts of capital to take on added risk while you only have $1k to invest. 

Other knowledge from classes were pretty much not applied unless you wanted to go into Corporate Finance or Investment Banking. 

I also swing trade as a hobby on the side, primarily in FX (currencies) as well as options (only long positions) and commodities; Crude oil CFD’s and Gold ETF’s. 

I make a pretty decent compensation from my full time job + performance bonuses, but ironically, there are some months when I make more from swing-trading. 

Success rate: 52%. 

Most hedge fund managers are usually 60 - 65% and that’s really really good. Don’t believe in the 80% stock picking  guru hype. 

It’s all about having bigger winners that offset losses (4 trades, 2 $500 losses, but 2 1k gains) still means you’re still net ‘Green’ at the end of the month/year. 

and not placing ‘crap trades’ and again risk management, (ex. Taking the month off to rest when you hit 20% losses and apply diff strategies, DCA, DRIPS, scaling in and scaling out, pyramiding , sector rotation or market timing etc.) 

Remember, don’t get caught up with FOMO, being flat is also a position. If you don’t know why you’re investing and don’t have a clear game plan, wait until you do before entering positions. 

Other then that, it’s a gamble play. 

Lastly, Fundamentals.. learn how political, economical and social catalysts affect the economy, the market and most importantly, your investment.

For example, the inter-relationship of how stocks, bond prices, commodities and currencies affect each other and ultimately the market and economy."
03/19/2021,stocks,"wow amazing list! Have you ever come across a book that explains how a person who loves and enjoys investment (and has reached a point where they have a good amount of experience) can aim to start some sort of an investment company? In the past we have heard of people who have started holding companies, wealth management companies, their own ETFs, and all the way up to hedge funds. I am a medium experience investor and I have improved quite a bit over the years and I would find it very interesting to learn how people start these companies. These days there are all also less formal types of companies people can do such as starting a finance education company where people make youtube videos and social media content and generate a big following.

Its not easy work, its very hard to succeed, but just want to try to learn how the journey has been for different people who have succeeded in it."
03/19/2021,stocks,What are your thoughts on candlestick pattern books?
03/19/2021,stocks,I didn’t wanna go without passing along my thanks as well! I’ve been needing a post just like this!
03/19/2021,stocks,"Antifragile is his best book imho. People really don't seem to understand how important robustness is, and he makes a really good case for it in that book."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.
Here's a copy of 

###[The Bible](https://snewd.com/ebooks/the-king-james-bible/)

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Big firms like those have a lot of money to manage, so can’t sell out of and buy into positions as easily as you can. It takes them weeks or months to buy or sell a position and doing so may cause the price to go up/down while they’re doing it. 

Another effect of the liquidity issue is that they’re forced to overdiversify, limiting gains. 

And also they won’t even bother to take positions in very small mkt cap companies which could have huge potential because they have so much cash it’s just not worth their time, since they could only sink like 0.01% of their holdings into it without destroying the market for that company and forcing the price super high."
03/19/2021,stocks,/r/valueinvesting
03/19/2021,stocks,"These movies are great for learning what working on Wall Street is like - other than that, I don't see much investment advice within them. Wall Street Finance is quite a bit different than what a retail investor should be looking for. Peter Lynch's books are written from this perspective - it is senseless to try to beat high finance at their own game. 

You are better off reading 2-3 books about how to evaluate companies then dive into 10-Ks of companies that are involved in industries that you are familiar with."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I watched The Big Short yesterday.  I have to say that, because I am still new to learning about the market, I was a bit lost with all of the acronyms, but it was a compelling lesson in greed.  I wonder if the book would explain things more or if it's not great for a noob.  I'm learning more every day, but it's really like learning another language, which is purposeful, I imagine."
03/19/2021,stocks,Nice list.
03/19/2021,stocks,Why is this downvoted?
03/19/2021,stocks,"It’s more about general investment and financial health philosophy. He dives deep on some of the strategies and tactics, but overall it’s a good book for someone just starting out and who is overwhelmed by all the financial information out there. 

He is more of a bogglehead and It can come of as a plug for vanguard, but he really does a good job of explaining why he’s making certain recommendations and simplifies complex concepts. He has helped me structure my portfolio and sort out the noise."
03/19/2021,stocks,"It’s all about putting money away, interest, paying yourself, and similarly basic financial concepts that we all struggle to master, all written in classical English prose from the perspective of multiple characters in ancient Babylon. Short book but a good read just for how different it is compared to all the other financial books. It was written about a hundred years ago but the concepts still hold true today."
03/19/2021,stocks,Easy-to-read book about the simple principles behind wealth. I really enjoyed it.
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s an amazing book. It does hammer home how hard it is to beat the market.
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s a great book which gives an overview of most common strategies and presents studies that show most if not all methods will underperform in the long term and best long term strategy is buying the total stock market.
03/19/2021,stocks,Am American and I couldnt agree more.  My only regret is I didn’t find it sooner.
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah sorry.  Sometimes the fingers typing get ahead of the brain.
03/19/2021,stocks,FXAIX or SWPPX. Both are dirt cheap in terms of expense ratios.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I do both, actually. So if it's a company I haven't heard about and in an industry I'm not that familiar with, I research that industry and look at the companies within that industry. As far as I'm concerned, it's all research. 

I think it can be beneficial to think outside of the box every once in a while."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Experience is what teaches trading stocks/investing. Reading a book can help with terms and concepts, but actual trading psychology is forged through market participation and the research required therein."
03/19/2021,stocks,"What I mean is that you’re better off learning about stock trading from actually doing it and learn from your mistakes from there because when you read you don’t make any. Study real companies and industries, look at their management, 10ks and qs, press releases, create DCFs. These books are great but you’ll find a lot of points are repeated or are useless IMO."
03/19/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/19/2021,stocks,Can't I return it back? It's not the way the stonks work?
03/19/2021,stocks,"It's a 50/50 chance, don't need rocket science."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah that's why I'm not sure what the hell OP is about. Lynch is for sure not a value investor
03/19/2021,stocks,I understand. I'm curious though; how do you reconcile the pro-passive investing approach Bogle advocates for with the pro-active stance the other books take?
03/19/2021,stocks,Yes good idea.
03/19/2021,stocks,It’s my pleasure
03/19/2021,stocks,"Everyone learns differently. Without a base knowledge of how things work, it's difficult to learn from your mistakes. You can get this base knowledge by intuit over time, as any field's pioneers did, but the point of education is skipping ahead. Experience teaches you how your knowledge actually applies. Both are valuable."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Agree to disagree, if you actually have a financial education you *have to read books* or watch someone explain them for you on YouTuber. Experience without knowledge is still ignorance, and knowledge without experience is still knowledge. Experience come from *misstakes* and is costly, reading a book means you *learn from others misstakes* so you don't repeat them.





Sure, no single one book will allow you to ""win"" the market but the whole  *anti-intellectualism* on reddit is plain dangerous. The kid killing himself because of a margin call only panicked because *he didn't know, he didnt read up*. Reading books allows you to understand they market, and prevents panic. It also gives you *tools to use* rather then pick random hyped DDs on reddit and judge their worth based on how many emojis there are."
03/19/2021,stocks,">I don’t think anyone at my work, has ever read a stock book. 

Yes, but during the education of these people they basically did read all these books, just indirectly. All the material they read and practiced or lectures they listened to were derived from books like this. In that case it wont help much if you only keep reading, experience is more important then.

But if you have a completely unrelated education and job I think it's definitely smarter to read a couple of good books first so you have a bit of an overview of the landscape and can orient yourself, otherwise you simply don't know anything about the possibilities and limitations and you're just flopping around aimlessly."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Good write up... but like you did study and read lots of books while in school, right? Albeit textbooks, but like yeah... while I agree experience is the best teacher, for someone who wasn't trained in finance, reading a book or two doesn't hurt."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Damn bro, awesome advide. Wasn't looking for books, this was what i needed."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Books have limitations, but so does experience. Experience can’t prepare you for black swan events by definition. Survivorship bias is also a problem. I think reading books like Taleb’s, Thinking Fast and Slow, and stuff like that where the focus is on how we think can help identify holes in our thinking."
03/19/2021,stocks,I think trading essentially boils down to hedging. Diversified portfolio is just one of the ways to hedge.
03/19/2021,stocks,I too am interested in starting one
03/19/2021,stocks,"I looked into this a little myself. I haven’t seen a book that covers the process well, but you can check the SEC for offering securities and states blue sky laws. If you set up a company and outside investors and directors are involved what I’ve read suggests you or someone else has to come on board as an employee. What I’ve seen also suggests that disclosure rules get more serious if you advertise and move beyond friends and family, at that point you probably need to be dealing with only accredited investors. Obviously what I’m saying here is not legal advise. You should look at the sources mentioned."
03/19/2021,stocks,"https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/basic-candlestick-patterns

This should help. No need to buy a book. 

It’s a free Forex educational website for trading currencies but the great thing about candle stick patterns are that they are all generally the same with regard to applying technical analysis and looking at price action in equities, options, currencies, indices or commodities. 

Teaches you single, double and triple candle stick patterns, all you really need to know and concludes with a cheat sheet you can screen shot when you wanna go live and try it out.

(Remember to apply the candle stick pattens with support and resistance levels for them to work effectively)."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Fair enough, makes sense. Any suggestions on smaller and more nimble firms or ETFs that take a value investing approach? 

I'm hesitant to dump money into S&P right now given the prospect of an upcoming (or ongoing) correction for overvalued equities. But I don't have the energy, time, or expertise to do my own research into undervalued equities."
03/19/2021,stocks,"On the other side, when BRK.B is taking a share of a company, they get to negotiate, speak with management of the company etc. which you can't."
03/19/2021,stocks,True - I guess I was focusing more on the greed and personality aspects. That's something a lot of books don't capture. While they are actors and exaggerated role most of the time its important to realize these are the people you are working with/against when it comes to being a day trader. Its just as important to understand the mentality as much as the technicals in my opinion
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks! Sounds really interesting.
Is it a hard read? Not a native English speaker.

Also do you have any similar books like it?

Thanks again!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Cool beans, thanks. I'm trying to start value investing with some of my portfolio but still need to learn more about accounting before I pull the trigger on anything.  I appreciate the insight."
03/19/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/19/2021,stocks,Just save the receipt.
03/19/2021,stocks,"My favorite description of Lynch's about his investing style is ""buying growth at a reasonable price"" - for sure he is a growth investor, but has an intesting take on it. I think OP means ""Long-term Investing"" rather than ""Value Investing"" - long-term investing can consist of growth or value or most likely some sort of combination of both. The modern concept of value investing needs to be revised to include more consideration towards intangible assets anyways."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, but no need for books. Most base knowledge can readily be accessed online. 

Investopedia, Kiplinger, YouTube, Reddit etc. Google is your friend. Just make sure they are credible sources.

and again, books are fine, but no need to read too much books. A couple would be fine to get the foundation and get you started.

I’ve also learned a lot from people on Reddit as well who I believe have never even gone to business school but probably have decades of experience more than me in the investing and trading the markets."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Both books and experience are so important, for me I currently enjoy books that focus on obscure technical details of markets, since I’ve read plenty on general philosophy. I do think Taleb is fantastic in helping to understand and mitigate risk. At the end of the day though, practitioners practice. There must be some baptism by fire."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Right, but different people also learn in different ways. Some people do well learning from books. Some don't."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, but all this information can also be readily accessed online for free. Not as in depth, but free nonetheless. 

Investopedia for example is a great source. Most stock books also focus more on psychology rather than technical knowledge and those that do offer such knowledge, again can mostly be found online. 

Books are still a great source, but no need to read 10+ books as I’ve seen some people doing. Like I said, pick 2-3 you believe are of high quality and master them."

03/19/2021,stocks,I read that book on a 16 hr flight to Japan in an effort to put myself to sleep. Read the entire book. Didn't sleep or retain any of the book. Should read it again.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I never stated it’s a waste of time. 

I stated you can learn the basics and foundation online, which are free and accessible, in which case, buying books are not needed. 

Again, Investopedia. 

You can take the CFA course without having to take all 3 exams to learn about investment analysis and portfolio diversification but I think that’s not really needed to be a successful investor, there’s other ways around. 

I also stated if you are going to read a book, make sure to master few, high quality ones rather than reading a book every month which some people do. Knowing everything about many topics and areas but not mastering any of them in the process takes away from the purpose in the first place. Quality over quantity. 

It’s all about practice, mastery, high proficiency  and precision as with any other craft.

$CCCC - What a beautiful channel up. No it will not last forever, but this is a beauty of a channel up right near support. I love it.

&#x200B;

$CCEP - A great wedge up that has more juice lefit in the tank I bet. Indicators all low so we just need one more swing up and we are golden.

&#x200B;

$EVBG - Let this come to value, this needs a few days I bet. This will eventually be killer, but let the red wash away and let everything settle before buying in, we wait for value.

&#x200B;

$GMED - Great short term trend up, and nearing a strong support area. I like this play but I need some form of life first.

&#x200B;

$MTCH - Just another grogeous channel up, called earlier this week - hit my price target - now coming back down. Round 2, I think so ;)!

&#x200B;

$NOG - Another just beauty of a channel up, at support looking like a whole snack right here.

&#x200B;

$RRC - A great horizontal channel and a strong trend line up here. I love it and showing some life.

$VECO - One more beautiful trend up / wedge up. simply put, I like it a lot."

I have never considered investing in ETFs since I enjoy the process of searching for individual stocks and reading about them (doing DD). This is also pretty much what I do for a living (transaction advisory).  

I would like to direct my question to long time investors. What do you do if you don't find undervalued stocks? Do you just invest in ETFs or blue chip stocks? Is this a smart move to have cash until you find the ""right"" stock?

It is mostly value stocks, I also don’t think the price has inflated (on financial fundamental basis - ie PE, forward PE, etc) since Covid. What I’m doing though is high risk, basically that there will be a long term decline of the dollar and a good chance the Fed will implement YCC - both a boon for emerging markets. EYLD has a good track record and has outperformed the index which is tough to do with the Chinese internet stock melt up. It’s still emerging markets so they have a tendency to vomit sporadically. The China exposure is fairly low at like 20% and I go in and have bought a few of the Chinese large caps separately that I liked. I think EM value is the best overall value in the world right now - however no strategy is risk free and this is the hardest time for me to invest over the last three decades because we’ve completely detached from fundamentals thanks to the fed.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Not true already have from my cpa. You do know 77M is easy to add up when your scalping, right?

One thousand shares at 120 = 120k in and 120+ out with a profit or loss.

Do that 20 times in a day and do the math.

Do it right you can make decent amount a day."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks - j spoke to CPA and attorney about this but last year I had a huge wash loss issue where I had all the gains and my loss were passed on to this year.

They told me if I end up getting trader status then I no longer can off set capital loss with capital gains.

So all my gains are tax free until I use up my capital loss. I might go to TTS and 475 mark to Mark election after I'm all good."

Nice vacation money. 
That's if you gain..lol I have big losses as well because don't like holding."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Bag holding nio and some other bs. This is why I rather scalp for pennies and keep position to 0 end of day.

Look at Apple yesterday was 127 and today 120 what a joke

Can you imagine if you had it 127? What a scam"

03/19/2021,stocks,"Buy 1000, then scalp for pennies sell 1000 shares.


Dollar wise depends on stock price. Ex: apple

2021-03-19 04:30:30,stocks,"Why I bought Motley Fool and why I hate fool About a month ago my wife saw this motley fool (MF) promotion on our Amex card. Before I can object the card was already processed and now she’s strongly insist that I take a look. Now it’s no cost since Amex rebated 100% of the first year, but she wasn’t happy with my constant cringe when she ask me to check it out...so yea I got sent to the dog house. 

Why I hate this type of advice: well if the idea is so great and an investor can do consistently beat the market then they can easily sell their service to manage other peoples money. So by selling this kind of publication it means what they do here is probably not their core competency. 

Upon paying the 100 bucks that’s not mine by someone that’s not me...I got a  very glossy portfolio of welcome packages and my membership card! In there it also introduced me to the founder, founder philosophy and their core staff...my trusted advisors who are passionate about stock investing. let’s look at my trusted advisors...they come from all corners of life experience...except business, math, or finance. Typical bio tend to be like “marketing major got their taste of investing while interning here then stayed here ever since”. Maybe they can bring a different perspective than a seasoned professional. 

The HATE: 

ok maybe I don’t hate hate these guys like most of the others. I do find their advertising deceptive. I tried recreate their portfolio based on their past stocks. Because they don’t post when each position should be sold, I can only build it on a rolling 5 year holding period for each position while adding the 2 per month they rave about. 

Rolling Returns does indeed tend to be higher than SP500, but why? 
For the past 2 years it really shot up but It is really attributed to FAANG. Removing this abnormality then return are more consistent to historical rate of returns. 

One of the glaring difference between their stocks and the index was the company sizes. Each of the company MF suggested at the time of suggestion to be averaging 8Billion in market cap. The minimum cap to enter SP500 is around 6B or 7B, so this means by adding only the smallest companies, you introduce more volatility thus a higher expected return. By their selection, SP500 is not the most appropriate index to be benchmarked to. An appropriate benchmark is more like SP400 or Russ1000(not 2000). These are more like mid-large cap stocks. Running the same model with these benchmark the excess return is reduced significantly. 

There’s also an issue with their investment philosophy which is supposed to be good valuation, good growth potential, and not in the spotlight. Well it tends to be only a growth story at the time of suggestion. Valuation always tend to be on the high side, and they are usually in the headlines. 

Conclusion:

So at least if you follow the 5 year holding period and keep adding it. It’s an OK strategy. MF definitely embellished A LOT in their ads...my reasoning on what they’re selling are these mid caps that has a nice growth story that their writers can justify on. If the stock can solidify themself within SP500 then it’ll outperform, and they’ll quietly not talk about those that flopped (like Lukin Coffee). They have been aggressively marketing probably because they are just riding the faanged unicorn right now. 

Is it worth the 100 per year? If you some money to spare and no better resource other than wallstreetbet....I guess you can try it.  To make this worth it you probably need to allocate $500 for each stock. That means 12000 a year....less than 1% of outperformance to break even for something that so far looks ok given the risk you’re taking on. Anything less 10K per year wouldn’t make it feasible. It also means holding for 5 years while adding so means in 5 years you need to be investing $50K-60K. Does one have the fund or strict discipline to do this?

First of all, looking at the ATH for the 10yr is baffling. The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago. They have consistently gone down over time. Isn’t it kind of obvious this is only short term? 

Secondly, how exactly is the 10 year related to a huge increase in inflation? I don’t get this concept. 

The way all this seems to me is that the media and other influencers are leeching onto something to create a bearish case against a roaring market. 

Thanks for your guidance!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"So, there's a few things happening that are all kind of related in varying degrees.

>how exactly is the 10 year related to a huge increase in inflation? I don’t get this concept.

They are kind of related but not really.  They are more separate than linked.

Let's start with inflation.  Inflation generally occurs in large amounts when there is a prolonged period of high velocity money printing.

A relatively recent example of this is pre-WWII Germany.  In this period, the German government employed a large number of its citizens to print money.  The recounts of the paper mills and printing presses are staggering.  In those days, they had to physically print the bills.  So, they did this for months and months and months and months.  Ultimately, it caused rampant inflation and economic collapse.

So, there is fear from some US investors that the combination of the 3 stimulus packages, the US government's history of running a deficit, and the federal reserve's current monetary policy will cause inflation.

This is more or less the inflation argument.  I wouldn't panic or get super worried over it.  The US government has economic tools to create and to reduce inflation.  If it starts to get too high, they can reign it in.

Next, the US Treasury bond interest rates are set by the US Treasury.  At its core, it is that simple.  Any given week, the bankers get together and decide how many bonds they want to sell and at what rate.  Then, they go out and try to sell them.  The results of the sale determine what happens going into the next week when they try to sell more.  If no one bought last week's set of bonds, they likely need to raise the interest rates to make them more attractive to buyers for the following week.

Now, the logical follow-up question, ""Why are people not buying them?"", is a very hard question to answer and is beyond what I know and can explain on the internet.

&#x200B;

>The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago

This is correct.  The US government has been pushing interest rates down since about the 1980s to stimulate the economy.  This is worrisome to certain US investors but, again, is beyond my understanding and ability explain.

And finally, stock prices.

There is a math equation analysts use to predict the future value of stock prices.  So, think like: ""x + y + z + w = stock price in the future""

One of those variables is the interest rate.  When the interest rate goes up, the stock price the math equation produces gets smaller.  So, large institutions and investors start selling as the interest rate climbs."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Investors aren’t buying 10 year tbills at current prices because they think their return will be eroded by inflation. The US government still auctions off new debt (increasing supply). If no one buys these bonds, but supply increases, the price of these bond decrease (causing yields to rise). 

This is bad for stocks in a few ways:

10 yr is used in a lot of valuation models as risk free rate. Higher discount rate means lower valuations. 

Rising yields also increase the cost of borrowing which means less available cash for growth initiatives. If the company can’t grow, neither can their stock price. 

Higher bond yields also make bonds more attractive leading to a rotation out of equities.. we haven’t really seen this yet, but I’d expect this if/when 10 yr hits around 3-3.5%. 

Rates are not high relative to historical norms but we’ve been in a suppressed environment for 10+ years. There is also SO MUCH debt right now, which is why small movement in rates has caused this much volatility.

We are in a very precarious situation. So far the FED has played its cards right, but one wrong move could blow up the bond market."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Its really not that complicated. If you think there is going to be inflation. Why would you buy a 1.5% bond? If rates zero and only headed up, less reason to buy bonds and lose money. With inflation picking up, yields rising, why would anyone buy bonds? The rate could go much higher. Now think about if your bank offered a savings account or CD with 5-6% guaranteed returns. How many people do you think will just say ""forget stocks"" and just park it in there for zero risk?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If you think there will be 2% inflation in the future, would you buy a bond yielding 1%? As expectations of inflation rise, so do bond yields, because otherwise no one would buy them. 

Bond yields have been low since 2008 because of QE, the Fed has been buying them, if the Fed had never bought them, the rates would be much higher. 

Additionally, the Fed won't let them rise much because it would crash the whole economy, so as they rise, they print more money and buy more, creating more inflation, which creates a never ending feedback loop. 

TL;DR dollar is fucked yo buy commodities"
03/19/2021,stocks,You have formally been introduced to stupid. Welcome to the market.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think it's primarily the speed of the rise, not the number and yes, it's an overreaction.

By April 2nd or 5th, the rates will be 2 but barely matter."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I already answered this a week ago. Inflation has little to do with it. It’s the bond yields by themselves.

03/19/2021,stocks,Its a bunch of wealthy inflationistas throwing a fit. Im getting sick of it.
03/19/2021,stocks,Commenting bc I also have this question
03/19/2021,stocks,"What im trying to figure out is if the fed continues to buy a certain amount of bonds to keep interests rates low on the 10 year, and bonds are debt issues, does this contribute to the national debt? But rather than it being public debt it would be intergovernmental debt correct?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"It has nothing to do with inflation. When bond yield goes up, mutual funds, hedge funds, etc move their money from stocks to safer bonds. Simple as that."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The yield on the ten yr treasury is tied to the price of the bond, which itself is governed by supply and demand. You may recall that the yield is just the coupon payment divided by the price, so the yield is inversely related to the mkt price of the bond.

When investors think that there is going to be a lot of inflation, they demand fewer bonds. This is because bonds pay back a fixed amount which that be worth less after inflation occurs. Thus, the price of bonds falls, which causes the yield on the bond to increase."
03/19/2021,stocks,"tl;dr Treasury bond interest rates control money supply which controls inflation. Increase in Treasury bond interest rates decrease money supply which decreases inflation, not increase. That means money is invested in Treasury bonds and not markets which makes market go down. Market going down might cause sell off which means cashing in investments and might cause crash. More people with money in hand might cause hyper inflation due to supply of goods and services decreasing while demand increases. But that might all be just speculation. One indicator of that is stock market is at all time highs. There's no reason for markets to be this high other than the money printed went to corporations listed on the stock exchange through people investing stimulus money instead of spending and the CARES Act. No one knows if a crash will happen, but fundamentals say it should. Fundamentals also say hyper inflation will happen, but fundamentals might be screwy right now.

&#x200B;

There's a lot to unpack to answer your question. It's not a direct relationship, it has to do with using money supply and interest rates to offset inflation/deflation and promote market investments.

The consumers determines inflation rate, the CPI just helps track it generally. Inflation/deflation in prices is constant and ongoing and it's actually region dependent, but most people don't notice because they don't see it until they go to buy something, and bulk volume of products/services helps to keep the price stable i.e. $5000 increase in cost of producing a bulk of 100 millions cans of Coke won't be noticed by individual consumers. Only time they'll notice is if they keep track and remember that something used to be cheaper. Inflation is just consumers bidding up the price of goods/services because they have money. The price of something will be whatever consumers in general are willing to pay. If they use credit to bid up prices then you have a bubble that is either sustained or popped depending on borrower's ability to repay. It's one of the reasons why ""printing"" money is supposed to cause inflation, because the idea is the money supply gets to the general public and will bid up the price on the limited quantity of goods and services. Inflation and deflation in small ranges is always happening to every product/service all the time as long as it's being bought/sold, nobody just announces the inflation rate and that's now somehow the inflation rate everyone must impose. However, they do exactly that with interest rates.

Take the above concept and relate it to cash/a $1 bill. Think of the $1 bill as a 0yr 0% interest bearing Treasury security. So if on day XX the price of a good is $1 and on that day you can pay and buy it. But then money supply is increased and let's say inflation rate is 2%, now you need more than $1 to buy the same product on day XX+1. This is just a generalized example, so don't take it as an exact event. So what inflation effectively does is it discounts the actual value of the $1, or what is also called the purchasing power. Now instead of $1 you need $1.02, and it's doesn't just stay at $1.02. The 2% will keep compounding until 10 purchase cycles later the seller won't sell for less than \~$1.22 unless something causes deflation and the price drops back down. Think oil prices.

When Treasury securities are bought you're exchanging cash for a government backed IOU with a expiry date. Corporations and people can exchange cash for IOU too but carries the risk of them saying screw you and not paying you back. That inherent risk discounts the price of said corporate/personal IOU, which is why they offer interest as incentive to buy the IOU. But inflation works against the interest rate, so if interest is 10% but inflation is 2% you're effectively only getting 8% return on investment. The risk of gov't not paying you depends on the stability of the country, so a US IOU is pretty solid and can offer a small interest rate to entice buyers whereas I don't know who would buy Congo IOU, they probably need higher interest rates in relation to US IOU if Congo Treasury securities even exist. I'm not into it personally, but apparently there's an international bond market with big money players. Financial and gov't institutions keep track of all this for themselves but not for you, which is why savings is garbage.

So with all that in the back burner, the thing you have to know about Treasury bonds is that they're marketable securities that are used as one of many tools to control the money supply which in turn helps influence inflation/deflation. So if there's a mechanism to push money into the public there also has to be a mechanism to pull that money back in to try to keep the currency stable. They can set the interest rate at whatever they want so long as it accomplished the goal, but make it too crazy and you cause destabilization. Typically when money is printed the interest rate on bonds go down because the whole point of printing money is to have the people spend it on goods and services, not spend it to buy Treasury bonds which defeats the purpose. So if Treasury bonds yield greater return than the general market (retailers, contractors, etc.) and/or the stock market, people will buy the Treasury bonds and give the money right back to the government. To discourage this behavior the bond interest rates are set low so that if people want to use their existing money to make profit then they spend/invest it in the market of goods/services. When the government wants to pull money back in it sets the interest higher. If they want a lot they set it a lot higher, if they only want a little back they set it a little higher.

What's so interesting right now is that in the past year the money supply was increased/printed by more than 65% during a mandated lockdown that destroyed lots of ""non-essential"" small to mid size businesses, and yet hyperinflation hasn't happened. So the $4 trillion dollar question is, what in the F is going on?

Less businesses should mean less supply of goods and services which should mean massive increase to inflation, but because it was mostly small to mid size businesses that weren't ""essential"" the supply of goods didn't go down enough for drastic prices changes. Most of the price changes seem to be the result of supply chain disruptions that never recovered and not the money printed. But then where did the increased money supply go? It was spent/funneled to the ""essential"" big businesses that were allowed to stay open during the lockdowns which is reflected in the stock market being at record highs. Unfortunately this would also mean that the stock market is currently the most over inflated bubble of all time which is why there's so much talk about a coming crash, and if a crash does happen it's expected to be at least twice as worse as the 2008 crash. Market crash means people are pulling out their money out of investments and either spending it or putting it somewhere else which could be the trigger to hyper inflation. It's all conjecture at this point with higher chances on increased inflation but the mechanisms are all so distorted IMO it's a toss up. But I wouldn't be surprised if Treasury bond interest rates go even higher before the next election cycle.

Edit: forgot to mention another incentive for Treasury bonds is they're tax exempt."
03/19/2021,stocks,This guy gave you the perfect answer but I’ll add a caveat. The US $ is the world reserve currency and Russia and China want to be that. If we ever get deep enough in a hole and China or Russia find the opportune moment to be the financial powerhouse we have been we are up the creek w/0 a paddle.
03/19/2021,stocks,Perfect reply. Thank you so much
03/19/2021,stocks,"This is a great answer. To fill in the one gap, people are not buying bonds because there are more things to spend money in a healthy economy. Individuals ramp up spending on “real” things like houses, cars, and vacations. Businesses greatly increase spending on expansions into new businesses or new countries, adding inventory, extra marketing, etc... In a not so good economy this money is mostly invested in stocks and bonds instead. 

At that point you have significantly less demand for both stocks and bonds. For bonds, borrowers and investors start selling them cheaper (meaning better yields) to compensate for the lower demand. Then people with lower risk tolerance or higher liquidity needs (mainly banks and businesses) sell a portion of their stocks to take advantage of the safer bond opportunities.

So when the dust settles it’s the same number of bonds being bought and sold. It’s just a different group of investors, and at the expense of stocks."
03/19/2021,stocks,I think this is the best explanation I’ve read so far. Still going to keep researching. Thanks.
03/19/2021,stocks,"10yr hitting 3.0-3.5%?!?!?! Remind me when that happens. Take a look at the 10yr historical yield. Inflation isn't coming. Inflation didn't come during the best labor market in decades (leading up to 2020), despite all of the feds inflation targets, it didn't even get to 2% then. IMO inflation, as we fear it, will never come unless the wealth gap narrows from the bottom 50% of US earners having a substantial wage power increase, which will also likely never happen short of universal basic income or a rapid increase in minimum wage."
03/19/2021,stocks,What do you mean by blowing up the bond market? What effects would that have?
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah this dance that the fed has been doing since 2008 has been on my mind as well. What we are seeing now is the same game multiplied. It will keep multiplying until it can't anymore and I don't know where things are left when that happens.
03/19/2021,stocks,"No this explanation lacks depth.


When the 10yr goes up, its because people sold a lot of bonds. Then the fear isn't ""omg everyone will sell stocks to buy bonds at 1.7%!!!"". No the real fear is that the yield will actually keep increasing because nobody buys these dumb bonds.


And then what does this mean? A very high 10yr yield will start affecting business loans, mortgages, etc. This is bad for stocks."
03/19/2021,stocks,Yeah but it does have to do with inflation if the fed is printing money to buy the bonds?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Russia is nowhere near that. Most limely never was. However the remnimbi is a prime candidate to become ""THE"" currency of the world."
03/19/2021,stocks,Sure. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. I’ll try my best to explain.
03/19/2021,stocks,Jobs aren't coming back rapidly either.. unemployment data would have to plummet to justify the current yield spike. The bond market has gotten ahead of itself IMO. If the 10 hits 1.85 I'm starting to buy treasuries
03/19/2021,stocks,"That’s not correct at all. There have been numerous articles for years about how stocks have reached these heights primarily because of low bond yields. If you think bonds at 1.7% are not impactful then you need to learn m a lot more about finance.  Not everyone is looking for the maximum return. In fact, many investors aren’t. 

There are a variety of reasons. There are legal limitations to how much risk and stock equity some companies can take on. This is true for many financial companies and real estate firms, and some nonprofits. These companies often favor bonds in most environments. 

There are liquidity needs for many firms that necessitate favoring bonds, like insurance companies that constantly withdraw from investments to fund claims and payouts. Pension and retirement management firms also do the same, maintaining a certain percentage in bonds. 

Bonds exist for a reason. They would not exist if no one wanted them."
03/19/2021,stocks,Pls explain how you think this is possible. It is not possible but I would love to hear how they are “primed”?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Do you at least understand the relationship between bonds buying/selling and the treasury yield? When people sell a lot of bonds, the yields goes up. This is why its going up, people are selling bonds. If people bought them back, then the yield just goes back down, and this isn't an issue.



The big problem is this isn't what's happening... bonds keeps being sold, and the yield keeps going up, and it goes up too fast, this is where its very dangerous."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The dollar is ""THE"" currency nowadays simply because you can buy oil and high tech goods for dollars. It is a remnant of a time when the US was the largest industrial producer in the world and controlled most of the oil reserves indirectly. However both of these premisses are changing: China increased its industrial outpu to the point that it is a major exporter of consumer goods. And as the oil dependence of the world weakens, the petro-dollar system weakens with it. For instance you can buy solar panels for remnimbis not just dollars. All the while China is increasing its influence on Africa, grabbing the last untapped minerals."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I literally work in finance. And you’re half right but you are not considering the supply side of the equation (higher levels of government issuance), or the fact that there are alternatives to both bonds and stocks. 

Sure, in the aggregate, the percentage of bond buyers does not really change, because as you said, lower yields represent selling. But this post isn’t about the aggregate it’s about the stock market. Relative to the stock market, people are buying more bonds than stocks. When returns are easier to find, the growth stocks in the stock market become less appealing."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The most important advantage for the dollar is global trust in institutions. The trust in Chinas and russia's transparency has been eroded in the former, if it ever existed in both especially the latter. The fact that the US government came back after the capitol storming to finish it's business and did not fall to a coup told the world that despite the battery to the systems, they still work and they're here to stay. This is why the world looks to the US treasury market and why US debt is seen as the most secure despite the printing of money. It's either some(maybe) inflationary devaluation with the USD or outright theft/fraud/loss with others."

03/19/2021,stocks,"REITs are not about growth, they are about income. They have to return 90% of their profit to investors as dividends or they lose tax-exempt status.

03/19/2021,stocks,"If you think REITs have historically poor performance, you obviously aren’t investing in the right ones or looking at long term historical returns. Basically all I have been buying over the last six months have been REITs because all the other stuff I want to own is overvalued right now. 

If you are looking for total return instead of just income, start with the lowest yields first. These REITs generally trade at a premium and can issue shares to make acquisitions and grow their dividend faster than low valuation REITs with higher yields.

Basically I try to stay 100% invested with buy and hold stocks.   When March 2020 hits,  my regular contributions plus dividends let me buy more QCOM at low prices then my contributions alone would have. (I sold all but 100 QCOM after the last earnings announcement) ."

I also bought Simon Property Group (the biggest and best of the mall REITs). 

The safer part of the the REIT sector is the triple net lease sector. Each REIT is different in this sector, but the tenant is on the hook for all of the expenses, so these tend to be income plays with some capital appreciation potential.

Kilroy has some great assets and they were able to sell a property in the last month they had built pretty recently for a massive gain. I also own Boston Properties which I bought in the last couple months around 95 because these are the office REITs that have some of the best assets and dirt cheap valuations.

I don't know much about those services, but I do know that they generally lead to fees and other expenses. I'm not working with a huge sum of money (little bit under 100k), so REITs are the best way for me to play Real Estate. 

I like REITs because of the steady income stream (as long as you pick quality), the tax structure, the growth potential for some of them, and the overall landscape for REITs over the next 5 to 10 years. I think that some of the publicly traded REITs are going to deliver massive returns over the next decade, and it just takes some foresight and patience to pick your horses and let them run."
2021-03-19 03:57:45,stocks,"due diligence on the buyer of eBay's Classified business - potential explosive trampoline Full disclosure, I'm a low level employee in one of the child organisations of Adevinta (ADE), which is the buyer of eBay's Classified business. I own no shares YET, however I'm attempting to time the market within the next 2 weeks and I would like to share my due diligence and also get your feedback on it. Feel free to change my mind or chime in.

**The company**Adevinta is in the business of classified ads, which is mostly B2C and C2C ad listings for cars, real estate, jobs and miscellaneous (think of companies or products such as craigslist, gumtree, facebook marketplace). Adevinta owns the largest classified ads companies in Europe and South America. On top of that they're gaining more control over the market by closing a deal for buying eBay's Classified business.

**Bull Thesis**

*Fundamental Analysis*

1. Adevinta is about to buy eBay's Classified business. [Deal set to close in 2021](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-ebay-classifieds-group/). Update: [set to close in Q2 2021](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-asa-ade-and-ebay-issue-update-on-proposed-transaction-of-ebay-classifieds-group/)
   1. *""Combined entity to benefit from solid market positions across 20 countries, covering one billion people with three billion monthly visits""*
   2. *""Strong combined financial profile, with estimated* ***US$1.8 billion*** *in revenues and close to US$600 million in EBITDA in 2019"" -* keep in mind, [Adevinta's revenue was around **€730 million ($870m)** in 2020](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-reports-solid-performance-despite-a-challenging-environment-in-q4/)
   3. eBay Classifieds may turn Adevinta into a sleeping giant. Although Adevinta is paying $2.5b in cash and $8.5b in shares for only $200m/year revenue, I believe that the company can turn it into a cash cow with the reach, solid market position and experience in this business (Adevinta owns multiple classified ads sites, it's all the company does).
2. Although covid had a huge impact on the business, the company's response was great, which only resulted in -2% YOY revenue. I believe that the company is well positioned coming out of covid considering the company's response and its result in the face of the following challenges over the last year:
   1. people were locked down and in fear. meeting others for exchanging goods was heavily limited. people stopped spending on upsellings on the sites for a while. traffic slowed down which impacted digital advertising revenues
   2. the car market slowed down, people were not spending much on cars due to uncertainty. as a result services with car dealers slowed down
   3. people held on to their real estate due to uncertainty. as a result services with real estate agencies slowed down
   4. digital advertising took large hit as everyone was cutting their marketing and advertising budgets and site traffic dipped
3. At least one of the child companies has implemented a feature in which users can buy items on the site with buyer's protection with the money held in escrow until the transaction is completed with no issues. The seller will automatically receive a postal ticket for the package, which the seller only has to slap on the package and ship it. Automatic package tracking, automatic payments, etc.. very convenient and covid friendly and also very useful coming out of covid
4. Adevinta is buying back shares, announced just 2 weeks ago [\[1\]](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-asa-ade-initiation-of-a-share-buyback/) [\[2\]](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-asa-ade-repurchase-of-shares-by-adevinta-asa/)
5. Vaccines being distributed, business is starting to breathe again, users and clients are using the services more heavily again
6. [Speculating on a strong quarterly report](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-reports-solid-performance-despite-a-challenging-environment-in-q4/) (""rumor"")
7. [eBay deal set to close in Q2](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-asa-ade-and-ebay-issue-update-on-proposed-transaction-of-ebay-classifieds-group/) (another ""rumor"") -> plenty of time to trade the ripe chart pattern coming up in the next section before selling off when the news come out

*Technical Analysis*

Here's the [chart](https://s3.tradingview.com/k/kLe3fUmq.png). Or directly on [tradingview](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ADE/kLe3fUmq-Long-ADE/).

1. We can see a descending broadening wedge on the daily chart which is a **bullish reversal pattern**
2. The current price is falling towards the bottom of the wedge and may reach it within the next 2 weeks, which is where the price will be met with double resistance (horizontal resistance and pattern/trend resistance). This may result in an explosive bounce considering the rumours and fundamentals from the section above

**Bear Thesis**

1. eBay (not eBay Classifieds) receives not only cash, but also a huge amount of Adevinta shares as part of the deal. Will they dump on us? *""eBay to receive US$2.5 billion of cash and c. 540 million shares of Adevinta at closing, representing a 44% stake in pro forma Adevinta, of which c. 33.3% voting shares and the remainder non-voting shares""* [source](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-signs-agreement-to-acquire-ebay-classifieds-group/)
2. The buyback program may not be as bullish as it may look at first glance, but probably isn't that bad either: *""Adevinta ASA (“Adevinta” or the “Company”) has decided to initiate a buyback of up to 1,700,000 of its own shares. The shares are to be used as settlement in the Company’s share-based incentive schemes as well as employee share saving plans.""* [source](https://www.adevinta.com/news/adevinta-asa-ade-initiation-of-a-share-buyback/)
3. ""Technical Analysis is useless""
4. Adevinta is paying a premium for eBay Classifieds which only generates $200m/year"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Attempting to time the market can be a huge mistake, especially when the deal can still have further complications along the line. The CMA still can reject the proposal and possibly push back the deal even further.

I'm bullish on Tesla long-term and ultimately think it's a good buy even at the moment, but needless to say there's alot of uncertainty in the market. 

What do you guys (and girl) think of Tesla at $610 for a long position? I'm thinking of selling a put at this strike price expiring next week. Was thinking of selling at a lower strike price but I do have a bias for being assigned those shares and want to avoid the scenario where TSLA goes back up and I end up picking it up at a much higher price (aka FOMO).

Obviously, you're not liable for any financial advice blah bal blah.. just trying to get a sense of the general sentiment."
03/19/2021,stocks,I think Cathy is right.  She is buying TSLA because they are years ahead of their competitors on autonomy.  It's hard to see what that market will look like but some people have that vision.   Maybe it might amount to nothing or it's a several trillion dollar market.  I'm betting that they will get the lion's share of that market so it's a buy for me.
03/19/2021,stocks,Tesla is what apple was when Nokia was a monster
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm very bearish on TSLA. Extremely overvalued by market cap alone. It got pumped up during an extreme bull year of Black-Swan COVID-19 which ramped up the stock to some astronomical levels for no fundamental reasoning. They can make electric motors and cars but they aren't long term brands at it like the other manufacturers and will suffer to claim the demographics that will pay in the future (i.e. Gen-X and Millenials). They'll never control more than a few percent of the market unless the unlikelihood of most major manufacturers today don't make it.   


On a more personal and less diligent note, I just don't like their cars all that much. They almost all share the same type of stylized design, cost too damn much for what they are, and tend to still have quality control issues anyway. Vehicles are depreciating assets and buying used is a smart life decision until you can afford to buy new with cash. I wouldn't trust a used EV at all. It would be like buying one of those Prius's with the hybrid batteries that need replacement and oops you just had a major cost sunk into your car. I look at it in the way that I would look at any stock and that's what do I feel like is going to happen in my lifetime over the next 30 years before I'm at the traditional retirement age, as that is going to be my most aggressive investment strategy. I don't like self driving cars, I grew up in an era where they weren't a thing. Kids today grow up with cell phones, so they won't care, but there's still going to be a massive market of drivers that don't want the latest and greatest IMO. I think Tesla does better long term if they keep pivoting towards home generation as they could potentially bring about what Nikolas wanted with global electricity. I also honestly think you're not buying actual Tesla when you get the stock - you're just buying Elon's Ego."

I'm sure people are going to argue with me using Gordon Johnson logic. Probably use automotive comparables. They'll think FSD is 10 years away. Or that their only main plays are cars and solar panels. I've heard it all. 

Best thing I can say is do actual DD before you invest in Tesla. Understand what it is, and what it's not. Ask yourself what you believe the future looks like. Use logic, understand S-curves and how markets will be created where none previously existed. Understanding wright's law is also important. 

I've been invested since 2018 and continue to add to my position on dips. This is a long term buy and hold, talking at least 2030+. Total cap will be 5t+ if they continue to execute, which they have a track record of, even if they don't meet the deadlines on time. 

We're likely headed for temporary inflation before settling down with target 2% inflation (if that) long term with higher rates, which won't impact Tesla the company. They have plenty of cash - and bitcoin - so there's not going to be any dillutions or need to raise capital at higher rates. Point being, it's a good time to start a position. You do you, I'd add Tesla as a part of anyones portfolio though that has high conviction and isn't a short term holder.

03/19/2021,stocks,"I think it would be wrong to compare Tesla’s valuation to other automakers based on their current earnings. Because ICE cars don’t matter. How many gas cars Ford and GM can sell are irrelevant. If you believe by 2030-2040 all cars will be electric then car makers should be valued based on their future EV *profit* share.

 There is a very high probability that Tesla will take the lion’s share of EV profits in the future, just like Apple with smart phones. Market share can be misleading. VW will sell more EVs than Tesla probably but their profit margin will be terrible comparatively because Tesla’s technology is that much better and it will likely stay that way. If you haven’t noticed Tesla innovate their way out of problems while the legacy companies seems incapable of innovation. EV is very much a developing field so innovation will be key. I don’t think current infrastructure will matter much because the way EVs are built will evolve and optimal factory design will change with it.

Current ICE car leader is Toyota and is worth $240B. A leader in EV should be worth multiple of that as EVs will inevitably have software revenues. Now add in the fact Tesla is also a leader in green energy, AI, a not small probability that they solve FSD and have robotaxi. They may also launch human ride hailing with better cost per mile if FSD turns out to be intractable. There will be many unexpected monetizations when a company has penetrations in so many different areas.

I guess the implication is that the price is inflated by hype and the company is overvalued, but if the hype persists, this will account for price support. In a sense, my own (perhaps ignorant) bullshit sentiment is baked into the price as much as any fundamental quantity. on a more substantial level, I think TSLA continues to prove itself to be a disruptor in the industry and it's potential market share in the fully autonomous transport space may in fact bring its fundamental value to 7 AMD's and more"

Tesla is definetly still attractive, but it's also harder now to x10 again. On the other hand, imo the company is much safer now since the model 3 ramp was successuful. The stock might still be very volatile, but that's why I believe if one wants to get into tsla it's best to dca in and to have a time horizone of at least 5y."

Maybe the market is right. Maybe it isn’t. In my own opinion the next 10 years or more of growth is already priced in Tesla. There isn’t much upside to have. GM already makes 4x the revenue Tesla does yet GM is worth $85 billion."

I wouldn’t consider Tesla a tech company. Most, if not all of their revenue come from selling cars. They have to sell a car before they make money. If Tesla’s car sales collapse tomorrow then the company will fail the next day unless they take on massive debt to keep the company running. All their side hustles that make them a “tech company” is to sell more cars. It’s a car company.

03/19/2021,stocks,"> I suspect, going on fundamentals alone, TSLA is not worth 7 AMD's, 

This is my perspective. Sure Tesla one day could be massive, but right now and the next 10 years it’s unlikely. 

So to answer your question, at $610 that would put Tesla’s market cap at around $585 billion. Which imo is still too high and leaves little room for growth. 

> I guess the implication is that the price is inflated by hype and the company is overvalued, but if the hype persists, this will account for price support. 

But is hype a good thing to buy stocks off of? Hype comes and goes with whatever is new and exciting. At the end of the day, a stock is a company, it’s a productive asset. 

> it's potential market share in the fully autonomous transport space may in fact bring its fundamental value to 7 AMD's and more

That could be 10 years or more away. Elon said we’d have FSD by 2016...and then 2018....and then in 2020 Tesla’s learned what a stop sign was. In my own opinion I don’t think FSD is possible with just using cameras, they’re too many variables for a computer to safely navigate traffic. Not to mention if a bug occurs or god forbid someone dies, Tesla is going to get sued into oblivion. So while one day I think it’s possible, I don’t think the day where cars drive without drivers will happen within the next 10 or 15 years."

AMD is a tech company because they produce components used in technology....are you claiming CPU and GPUs aren’t Tech?? Amazon.com isn’t considered a technology company, it’s a online retail store, hence why it cycles like a retail business, AWS is the technology side. However many people consider Amazon a technology company because it does its retail business though technology.

> I’m not fooling anyone. You’re just taking what I said out of context. I said their retail business is retail, while their AWS is technology. You can consider Amazon a tech company because they’re an online market place.

Your exact reasoning for Tesla not being a tech company is that it makes most of its revenue from car sales. Well, Amazon makes most of its revenue from selling things online, so using your logic it isn't a tech company either. I hope you realize how smooth brained that statement was.

> Someone’s been watching too much Cathie Wood videos.

You are literally the first person I've ever heard try to claim that EV/autonomous cars aren't groundbreaking or disruptive. Sheer insanity. The single craziest thing I've heard all week, and I browse r/GME from time to time.

> So your definition of “tech company” is disruption though tech? You’ve been brainwashed by Ark Invest’s propaganda. Like I said in my previous example, is Toyota now a tech company when they developed crawl control? That was disruptive and tech. So should Toyota now be considered a tech company?

There is no hard definition of a ""tech company"". It doesn't fit into the ""technology"" section of a stock sector map but neither do NFLX, GOOG, AAPL, genomics stocks, etc. For all intents and purposes, everyone who is talking about tech stocks is including Tesla, because their entire business model is based on disruptive technology (very clearly not the case for Toyota). I feel like you realized that you were wrong a while ago but are too stubborn to admit it. Cut your losses."

So what you’re saying is Tesla/Ford/GM/Chrysler/Toyota/ect should all not be considered car companies but rather be valued as technology companies?

Yeah ok there bud. Tesla is a car company."
2021-03-19 03:43:55,stocks,When will 10 year treasury yield rate be priced into the market?? Was just wondering when the consensus is that the increasing 10 year treasury yield rate will be priced into the market? I am tired of all my tech stocks getting obliterated lol...

03/19/2021,stocks,"JPow basically told lenders that they are okay with 2,5+% inflation for a decade. You tell me if you’d buy US10Y for 1,7% when Germany’s yield curve is partially inverted with the US heading there. ~20% of USD were created in the last 12 months and the FED just told everyone that this is going to continue and that they don’t care about the market with their priority being jobs. The amount of margin debt is headed towards an all time high, the stock market is at all time highs with little actual economy to back it up. The question is not if the biggest bubble ever blown up in the history of men will pop, it is when.

No, IMO it is not priced in, not even close. 1,7% yield still is excruciatingly low, and the parallels to the Weimar Republic are spooky to say the least."

2021-03-19 03:33:07,stocks,"SKLZ - A Rising Esports Giant (DD) Hey all. I'll be focusing on the fundamentals of the company here. This post is my first DD, and as such I welcome you to comment, provide feedback, poke holes in my analysis, and so on with open arms. If this is detailed enough to inform anyone about the company, then even better. With that being said, I'm organizing this in accordance with my DD spreadsheet that I use.

What is SKLZ?

SKLZ, or Skillz, is an online mobile multiplayer competition platform that is integrated into a number of iOS and Android games. Players use this platform to participate in millions of mobile and online competitions across the world daily. Skillz doesn't directly create games, as it lets third-party developers create them and then capitalizes on the opportunity to host online tournaments on said games. The company was founded in 2012 and, as far as I can tell, currently has about 230 employees. Their market cap currently sits at $10.84 Billion.

CEO Notes

Andrew Paradise is both the CEO and original founder of Skillz. He has led the company to $400 million in revenue. This is also not the first company he has founded and grown. In 2012, Paradise founded Double Picture, an advertising technology company, which went on to develop partnerships with Apple and was eventually sold. Paradise also founded AisleBuyer, a company whose technology was eventually sold to Intuit and became Intuit GoPayment. Having a CEO with this much prior experience and success is a great sign to me.

Financials

Skillz released their last report in December of 2020, which is what I'm working off of. Revenue grew 92% to $230 million in 2020, compared with $120 million during 2019. Gross profit grew 91% to $218 million during 2020, compared with $114 million in 2019. Gross margin was 95% during 2020, the same as the year prior. Net loss was $122 million during 2020, compared with a net loss of $24 million during 2019. GMV grew 80% to $1.6 billion during 2020, compared with $886 million during 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $263 million of cash and no debt.

Partnerships (if Applicable)

Skillz joined forces with the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) in 2019, which was a large vote of confidence. In February of 2021, Skillz also started a partnership with the NFL. As part of the multi-year agreement, the organizations will hold a global game developer challenge. Those that take part will need to create an NFL-themed mobile title, which will be powered via Skillz's esports platform. This is a huge opportunity for visibility, and to expand Skillz's player base.

Potential Catalysts

The NFL agreement was my main one here. I think this partnership is a great way to expand the company's player base.

Other Notes

Management at Skillz says their users average an hour a day on their games, which is more than TikTok or Snapchat. Gaming tournaments, much like gambling, are addictive, and Skillz seems to be very adept at capitalizing on this. The CEO also mentioned in the company's last earning report that the company gets 90% of revenue from North America, and hopes to expand into India later this year. R&D also grew over 40% over the prior quarter, as the company moves to expand into new game releases (CEO has mentioned fighting, racing, and FPS games as future additions to their library) and further researches how to boost engagement among its user base.

Smartphone gaming revenue was estimated at over 63 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2020, with revenue from tablet games reaching 13.7 billion U.S. dollars. Moreover, forecasts suggest that revenue from the mobile gaming industry will continue to grow, surpassing the 100 billion U.S. dollar mark by 2023. This company is already in a great position to continue to capitalize on this market, provided they continue to focus on growing their player base and available games.

The Bear Case

Skillz currently gets over 70% of its revenue from three games alone, underlining how critical it will be for Skills to develop new games over time. Its regular users also dropped from 2.7 million to 2.4 million over the course of the past year. While their paying users did double, maintaining their revenue anyway, it could be a cause for concern. The company spent over $250 million in advertising last year, and their user base still declined. These numbers aren't damning by any means, but they do raise some concern for me.

Overall Opinion

In general, I believe that this company has massive potential to be huge. The global gaming market was valued at USD $162.32 billion in 2020, with a large portion of that market being in mobile and tablet gaming. With a current stock price at $26.75, I honestly feel that this company has the potential to grow and dominate the mobile esports market, and may grow to upwards of $60 over the next couple of years - and I feel that is a conservative estimate."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Go look at the games that are using their platform, then let me know if that is worth a $10b valuation."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I own a small position in Skillz, but I'm not adding to it any time soon.

Anyone investing should know that Skillz games are available on iOS, but not on the Google Play Store. Skillz games violate the Play Store's TOS as it relates to real money games. The recent changes that allowed apps like Draftkings back on the Play Store do not apply to Skillz. Currently, Skillz games have to be side-loaded on Android.

On their recent earnings call, CEO Andrew Paradise said that the recent Play Store changes may be indicative or further policy changes down the line. Personally, until the app is available on the Play Store I can't see myself adding to my position. No matter what the company says, a lack of availability on the Play Store reduces your potential customer reach on Android."
03/19/2021,stocks,"It is not an e-sports platform and basically is misrepresenting itself by calling itself that. Looking at the games they make money from, no esports at all. The only aspect of esports is  the partnership with NFL. I sure it will appreciate in value over time though."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Honestly I went on their website and just wasn't at all impressed with what I saw, so I got out of it. The hype for it just doesn't seem to match up with what they've actually achieved."
03/19/2021,stocks,"By looking at their games their valuation seems just stupid. Simple card games at an valuation of 10B!
If their valuation is anything near to realistic Roblox suddently seems wildely undervaluated."
03/19/2021,stocks,Compare it to draft kings or a similar company in that space the valuation is not so crazy
03/19/2021,stocks,"The games aren't great at the moment, I agree. But going forward for this company, what I believe is more important is the tournaments and betting within these games, and the addictive nature therein for the player base. Games can be improved, and games can be made and released."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah my thoughts exactly. Calling this an ""esports"" platform is insulting. I actually interviewed at Skillz a year ago and tried to play all the games that they were integrated in. Most of the games, IIRC, were by one developer and you really had to look for them in the App store. I was thoroughly unimpressed by the product.

There's nothing ""esports"" about this."
03/19/2021,stocks,"As usual, the real DD is in the comments"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Skillz provides a complete platform for developers to monetize their games outside of just ads. Sure, the existing quote of games might not be up your alley but they said on the earnings call they are rolling our fps, sports, racing, etc soon and the nfl developer challenge starts in q2. You're not just buying now, but you're also buying the future, most of which is near term."
03/19/2021,stocks,DraftKings revenue can skyrocket overnight as states legalized betting. Esports is growing quickly but it's not the same kind of potential overnight revenue explosion.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Holy moly, they just did another at 24. What's going on?"

2021-03-19 03:32:27,stocks,"AMD, MSFT, WLT, AAPL thoughts? Hey everyone! I’m new to the stock market scene and I was wondering what your thoughts were on AMD, Microsoft, apple, and Walmart for long-term holds. I am a 25 year old novice and I’m looking into investing in things that are relatively safe long-term plays. Almost my entire portfolio is in etfs, but I wanted to get into “blue chip” stocks as well. So my question is, do these have potential? AMZN and GOOGL are also potential buys for me, but they’re a little rich for my blood at the moment. I’ve tried to do my own DD but I’m not sure what to look for.

Dont worry about this short term volatility, interest and inflation going up might be bad for tech stocks atm, but at the end of the day a strong economy (which results in higher IR and inflation) will always be the backbone for growth.

They are cutting service such as Minnie vans, Magical express, and many more services. They are struggling. Disney+ has helped them, but they messed up and let people sign up for 3 years at 140 and Verizon people 1 year free pre pandemic . So they didn’t make the amount of money they should have. Also keep in mind majority of their staff is on furlough."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Well, if that’s your only argument, or even your central one, you could apply it for a big portion of currently traded stocks. Basically, we should expect a market crash by June (note that this has been a recurring claim made by many investors since July 2020). I do believe that a correction is imminent, but not an actual crash; if you look into DIS a bit more, you will see that such a big drop is highly unlikely in such a short period of time... Anyways, we’ll have to wait and see

Edit: note that the pricing at 150 was rationalized via the information available up to that time... meaning that we have obtained a lot of (positive) data from DIS since then, which was not priced in the $150. A fallacy in your reasoning."

03/19/2021,stocks,"I am not sure wether inflation is negatively correlated with the WHOLE stock market. Usually, effective inflation hedges are bonds, stocks real estate and gold. So, in that regard, I wonder how inflation may directly affect value stocks (I am aware that growth stocks usually take a hit, but value ones perform better during high inflation periods, therefore a crash wouldn’t make much sense solely based upon inflation fears). Also, the severity would depend on the government’s monetary policy and its expectedness. On the other hand, it is indeed true that an increase in the treasury yield is not optimal for the stock market, but on the other hand, I believe that if it gets completely out of  hand they will try to control it with QE or other methods. It is hard to believe that they would let the whole market collapse knowingly. But then again, if I could foresee the future I would be a billionaire right now. Let’s just say, I try to have some faith in the fed"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Did you look at their Q1 2021 earnings report, compared to the prior quarters? Did you look at the insane amount of subscribers they obtained (excluding the ones via Verizon), in such a short amount of time? Capital expenditures will be mostly due to investing more in the media and entertainment segment and less in the parks segment. The latter, depending on how soon they will reopen, will provide another huge boost to the stock. The fact that it’s leaning more onto the streaming and subscription based services, which some would classify as “becoming more tech”, shows that it can provide different streams of revenues... 
Anyway, I am not here to make a bull case on DIS (there are much thorough ones in this subreddit that you can find), and obv there will be that one person that will make a counter argument for each of the above points, but time will tell, and in my opinion, <$150 is NOT a realistic PT by June. And I think this number was thrown out there  simply because of “fears” of a “possible collapse”"

2021-03-19 03:15:47,stocks,"Yeezy x Gap Investment Thoughts? Hi, I'm pretty much brand spanking new to this whole thing. I have a few days of general trading research under my belt at least.

I'm interested in investing in GAP because I believe by the time Gap's collaboration with Kanye West's brand Yeezy comes in July, the stock price will have skyrocketed.

Kanye West is the wealthiest black man in American history, is entirely self made, and is a serial winner (besides the presidency of course). I trust his name and commercial power will be a huge factor in Gap's success in the coming years. I want to invest. As I said, I'm new to this and I'm fairly sure I'll either mess it up entirely or won't make as much money as I could with your help.

Please share your thoughts and recommendations, and any wisdom you can give for a beginner investor."
03/19/2021,stocks,I think you are giving Kanye too much credit. There are a lot of folks (like myself) who were utterly repulsed (and still are) by his statements during Trump’s presidency. I used to love his stuff but now I really can’t stand to listen to him. He has become literally his own worst enemy. Hopefully he finally gets help for his bipolar condition but I don’t see it. He loves being erratic and living in the spotlight for his outrageous claims but it’s become too much.
03/19/2021,stocks,"it's priced in, and overhyped. Going back to 20s if the chart is any indication. And finally, Kanye isn't the wealthiest black man in American history. this is called investing emotionally."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Kanye’s clothing was literally a complete L. His kicks sold, but everyone made fun of his clothes with holes in them. They did not sell. He’s not the wealthiest black man in American history either. That report was based off potential. Trump style shit. 

There MAY be something here, but the “I can succeed at anything” Kanye is long gone. You seen the “presidency”. There’s 0 sanity there left. He’s obsessed with Virgil Abloh so he’s trying to have something to be proud of with GAP. I honestly don’t see this going too smooth"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, I forgot on Reddit it’s considered a crime to be a trump supporter... narrow-minded liberals"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I think you're wrong. He said some shit. So? Words? His policies were good, and he would have been a needed change from the system. I don't think he would have made a good president, but that doesn't matter, because he was never going to win. Maybe if he runs again in 2024 and has his mental health under control, and improves upon his campaign, then I think he will be a good president.

If it makes you feel any better, every time he says something controversial, he's either right but unpopular or inappropriate (Taylor Swift incidents), or he misspoke or is misinterpreted or is taken out of context (slavery is a choice, etc.)

He's not a bad person. Nor malicious. Outspoken, and often misspoken is all.

Anyway on to the main point.

Giving Kanye too much credit? For real?

He became a legendary producer. Himself. He became a legendary artist and rapper. Himself. He became a generational fashion designer. Himself. He wanted to get into architecture, and I'm sure he'll continue pursuing that. A few years ago, he was $53m in debt. He's now worth $6.6 BILLION and is the richest black person in American history. That is almost unbelieveable.

You don't need to like everything he says, nor his music or anything. But to say I'm giving one of the most successful people of this century too much credit is a joke."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Who is the wealthiest black man in American history out of curiosity?

I genuinely don't know the answer so I'm interested to hear who you think it is."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Look bro, I think Trump wasn't a suitable president for the most part yet I do believe he was treated unfairly by the public and the media. But aren't you being the same thing you're describing just on the other side?

I disagree almost entirely with what the guy you responded to, but you still didn't need to call him a narrow minded liberal lol. You seem like a narrow minded republican, and what's the difference? One and the same.

As a Kanye fan, I can really see how much the media twist shit. Kanye is always taken out of context and demonized for literally nothing sometimes. You ever think that's the same for anyone the media decides? You should understand as a Trump supporter too. He got it just as bad as Kanye. And some people just don't realise how seriously the media can misrepresent someone. Some people aren't narrow minded, they just haven't been exposed to the truth.

Anyway, this was meant to be about trading.

If you respond to everyone who criticised Trump on reddit, you'd never stop typing, just let it go. (I realise I've typed a whole load just to end it with that lol)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I’mma let you finish but Kanye as President would be just about as bad as Reagan. And no, not every Trump policy was bad but the vast majority of the time it was. 

I mean the list is never ending but some examples. We should bring back some manufacturing as it does strengthen foreign policy on not relying on other nations in times of need, that part he got right. His stance on immigration was pretty terrible tho, especially since he wanted to unban the countries with the worst covid variants right as he was leaving office. Fact is, we are a country of immigrants. Young people for the most party cannot afford to have children anymore due to trickle down economics so we need to replace labor so let people in the country. His stance on the media was iffy, yes, sometimes it is sensationalist. However, not all of the media is a lie. People had to kiss his butt with every question and couldn’t ask him hard questions or he would revoke their press passes for crying out loud. So he started the whole thing based on his arrogance and never admitting that he may be wrong. It’s the same thing the “Republican” media would pull on Obama. 

He also ended his term in a pretty terrible condition. Downplaying a novel virus (not implementing travel bans), that has now led to half a million dead, economic volatility, and mass uncertainty for the future. That and the first attempt of government takeover in 200 years. What part about that did the media over sensationalize? I watched twitch that whole time and it was awful. I also was at work when this whole virus was coming out and knew it would be bad yet someone with far more information than I did couldn’t make the same conclusion or be proactive? 

What we need is someone who actually is for the people as president, not another rich phony or a corporate elitist. Also, how are you standing there and telling me Kanye is so great but insinuated that African American slavery was a choice? I watched the video, he said it. I didn’t want to believe he said, but he did. I have yeezy’s for christ sake, I was a big stan. I know he worked hard and that’s why it’s terrible how much he’s fallen. Hoping for his recovery, but as it stands right now, I would not want him to be our president."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Ok I'm really going to show my inexperience here. How do you recommend going about determining how much I think the company is worth, and it's future cash flows? How do you do your research on companies?

Instinctively, I see the company's value increasing, and more cash coming into the business due to the hype around the release, and because Gap had been side-lined for many years, and will now be popular again. Is that what you mean? Sorry if I completely missed the point.

You're right about how there's no rush. But I would like to get in earlier rather than later. Especially for the reason you said, with the new school year a few months after the YzyGap release, and the overall hype around it.

And I said IF Kanye sorts his mental health out and rejigs his campaign then I think he’d be a good president. At least he is a good person, despite what the media will have you believe. Perhaps ‘good president’ is a stretch, perhaps it will be awful. Perhaps just ok and virtually un-noteworthy The point is, the public hate him and the media will do anything to keep it that way. Even recently becoming the wealthiest black man in American history he isn’t getting any respect from anyone other than those giving it previously. He won’t win the presidency ever. He is too hated, and his public comments and outbursts don’t help that.
I’m fed up of saying this to people but the ‘slavery was a choice’ thing was taken out of context. Yes he did say those words, no he didn’t mean a load of Africans shackled themselves up and sailed across the Atlantic with hopes of being tortured for the rest of their lives. He meant that modern slavery (400 years later) is a choice. Mental slavery, as physical slavery luckily isn’t a thing in the US anymore. His music talks on that a lot. As a Kanye fan I knew what he meant instantly because I already got his meaning from his music. “400 years later, we buying our own chains” is a good example. And yeah he’s fallen from grace. He’s not the sweetheart he was in 2008. He’s grown up and had to deal with unimaginable shit for so long. Imagine the world turning against you everytime you say something just because you conveyed it wrong. It would be infuriating. Give him a break."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Firstly, if your a big kanye fan then get ready for season 8 of the dissect podcast that will start this month that will be dedicated to yeezus. 

Well if your fairly new to stocks and valuations then maybe this will be difficult. Some helpful tools are DCF models, which discount expected future cash flows to a present value and then helps spit out an intrinsic price value. This is helpful just to see hypothetical situations. Like what happens if they meet expectations. What if their growth is negative? How does all of that effect the value of the company?

But if all of that is a little overnyour head, start by looking at the 10k's and reports to see how much of overall revenue this gap deal could include because they have multiple other affiliate brands and companies. I mean they havent had any crazy earnings or anything in the last few months and the price has driven up. So its taking some of these expectations into consideration with the $30 price.

2021-03-19 03:12:58,stocks,"Question About PMCC’s and Brokerages Hello everyone, 

I’ve recently begun diving into trading with a small portion of my money mainly to see if I can grow a small account. I still have my long term that I don’t look at much but I’ll admit the whole GME craze has drawn me into the world of trading. 

I’ve had much more success trading options as opposed to outright shares in both swings and day trades...although I believe this is mostly attributed to the fact that my account size is so small. 


INFO: 

- I’m holding some long calls with far DTE; one LEAP 365+, another 180+. I want to sell some covered calls as a means to collect premium and reduce my breakevens...especially when market volatility is so high 
- WeBull allows you to choose the option strategy “covered stock” which uses 100shares either in your account as collateral. This method automatically links the shares and covered call, ensuring those shares will be sold if the call is exercised 
- There is no way to directly link my long calls as collateral for sold calls
- I contacted webull and got the following response: https://ibb.co/wNPQxCD


QUESTION:

- If I go ahead and sell a “”naked”” call with a higher strike price then my long call on the same or a closer expiration will WeBull liquidate positions of their choosing if I do get assigned OR will I have the opportunity to liquidate positions myself (aka exercise my long call) to cover the deficit? 
- I got into WeBull for commission free trading and free stocks. After ~1 month of research and actual trading it seems like WeBull is not the best platform to be trading on. I’ve tried paper trading on TOS but it’s a very complicated platform that gives me headaches after navigating through it over an hour. What other platforms would you guys recommend?


If you take the time out of your day to read/respond, thank you!!"

So high Year Over Year revenue growth, EBTDA growth, and/or EPS growth. 

It doesn’t mean value stock does have growth. It simply means they are trading at a discount to what their fundamentals are suggesting. 

TBH screening for them is extremely hard when you lack the data. Those data are expensive to the tune of a few hundred grand per year.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Wait what? OP is asking how to Invest in growth stocks for long term.

Literally not a single thing you said applies to OP's strategy or investing goals. 

It seems like you're telling him how to find a hot stock to swing trade or something, when that's not at all what was asked. Did anyone read the question or understand what a growth stock even is? Up-voted? 

We are at the top...."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Eh that’s my method, it’s made me a lot of money?   Not saying it’s even advice for anybody but just sharing what’s worked for me.   Finding a stock at $2 that grows to $15-20 is a lot easier than grinding away on blue chips for 10% a year."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Im glad your strategy has made you money that's what we're all here to do In some way shape or form. 

Again, you're telling OP how to use a bunch of technical screeners to find a stock that's currently hot or picking up hype. Which is not at all what he's trying to do. There are a million reasons why stonks pump unrelated to it being a growth stock, especially in this completely detached market. 

I'm saying using these technical screeners are not going to tell you if it's a long term growth stock, which OP wants. You lack fundamentals at all and are trying to teach him how to play technical pump and dumps. 

Good luck with your investment strategy, I hope it stands well against the test of time."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Indeed, but this one requires shelling $$$"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Oh Yeah you’re absolutely right.   That’s a screener intended for finding stocks to evaluate further, not to find stocks to buy immediately without further study. 

Perhaps I did misunderstand his question, but my response was targeted towards lead generation for getting a starting point of smallish cap stocks that are candidates for consideration.

I use a similar screen to find highly volatile things for day trading, but going through the lists I find a lot of stocks I actually like based on market niche that would suck for volatile trading, so I buy 1000 shares and park them.   Most don’t lose value.

If the OP really just wants a growth fund then he or she should probably just buy an appropriate etf or try to mimic an etf based on their published buys.   If he or she wants to find individual stocks with good capacity for long term growth, what I suggested is a starting point that will generate a lot of dead ends but will have some golden nuggets in it too.   There’s significant risk obviously, but if 1/10 hit you’ll be doing just fine.

The problem with buying stocks for growth that are all over the news already and pumped up is.... you already missed a lot of the growth.  They may continue to grow, but they’re typically valued higher than their financials should indicate due to the hype around them.   I’ve been burned on those types of stocks a lot, so just went a rung further down the ladder to find stocks in segments that I want to buy before everybody else knows about them.

Your words of caution around fundamentals and further research are spot on, and I assumed that was implied when you’re doing this type of search.   I typically generate a short list by industry and then go through each with a fine tooth comb, try to get an understanding of their management team and where they’re going.   It’s a ton of work, and most still come up duds or fizzle.  But again, a 10-20% success rate on stocks like those can easily pay for all the misses when they take off."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah I do a mix of high volatility trading on the short term and try to find nuggets to buy and hold for longer term growth / gains.  There’s a lot of overlap in the tickers though, since anything small and unproven with a lower float is going to be pretty volatile already.

The shorts seem to have three main strategies I’ve noticed.   First is run a company into the ground, drive away investors, and try to kill it.   That’s what was essentially happening with the recent meme explosion before DFV did his thing.    The second strategy is to keep prices down through manipulation while buying up larger stakes or option plays before releasing the pressure.   RKT for example.   If you have enough capital to move the market price down, then let regular buyers move it up for you, you can print money with options.   I see a lot of that happening.    The third strategy is just to drive volatility high to sell options, then let it settle for a week to buy them back with the reduced Vega.   You don’t need as much capital to do this and I’m assuming it’s smaller short players, just get enough swing to drive Vega up then stop and let it rest before they buy back.

None of those strategies make it easy to trade the stock based on traditional methods, as a huge 10% drop could come at any moment in a rally.   So if I’m trading swings or whatever it’s too much risk, and if I’m selling options against a longer term hold it’s got to sync with whatever they’re doing to make the most of it.   As a result I generally prefer lower short interest, but not zero short interest, as it works best with my system."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I get you now and you bring up a ton of great points. I edited out the longer fundamental part because I don't actually know fully understand what people are looking for in growth and won't pretend I do. 

Your technical approach used in conjunction with looking at the fundamentals seems like a great way to find some good ones. 

Anyways I just thought the first comment seemed like it was giving a different vibe of just straight trading on momentum and seemed like a risky thing for a new investor whose just looking for growth stocks to hold long term. Maybe it was implied to do further research, but with how things have been lately I tend to believe it's not implied a lot of the time lol."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah fundamentals for growth are deceptive, I like to see that a company knows what they’re doing but don’t overly consider the figures.   I’m trying to find companies at a stage when they SHOULD be losing money... the real question is how much and for how long, and will they break the curve before their competitors are entrenched.   

Companies are more than numbers on a page, and my preference is to really dig into the leadership and I wind up making most of the final picks based on a gut feeling about the type of person / people running the show.   

I don’t like to invest in leadership who’s a ghost and don’t appear anywhere in public.   I also try to avoid promoters, super nerds, and frat boy personalities for various reasons.   Definitely don’t invest in a company run by just bean counters, although it’s important they have competent financial oversight it can’t be the only thing going for them.   The ideal leadership profile for me would have a ceo with a solid operations focused background, paired with a talented cfo, and an energetic next layer down.   If the ceo is the market man / funding then a strong coo or president for operational is fine too, but really I look for a balanced triad of someone who can bring in funding, someone who can manage the financials, and someone who knows what to do to run the company."
2021-03-19 02:41:17,stocks,"I recently watched a video about investing during technological revolutions, and it made some interesting statements In the video, the presenter states that, on average, investments in companies related to the technology revolution tend to underperform. This is because a lot of money flows into these sectors, and while a few companies may see extreme growth and come to dominate the market, many more fail outright, leading to lower returns on average.

Additionally, the presenter states that investments in the antiquated technology actually tend to overperform on average during these periods. The reason being that while the technology revolution may hurt them, so much money flows out of them into the new companies that it makes their stock price very undervalued, while still remaining decently profitable.

What technology revolution do you think we may be in right now? What companies in the ""antiquated"" technology do you think are undervalued and poised for better than average returns?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Ah, ben felix, my favorite investment youtube channel. As with the technological revolution is that not obvious, EV, green technology, biotech.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Trying to think outside the box a little, I was thinking of the tech revolution being a move to more ""digital"" lives, the average person seems much more willing to spend money on non-physical goods such as video game skins than they were 10 years ago. I could see this progressing significantly. In this case, the antiquated technology might be manufacturing, shipping, and retail.

Also, here's why I *don't* think EVs and green power generation are as big of a deal as people think. Typically, a technology revolution massively increases the productivity of the society, think of the internal combustion engine, computers, or the internet. But we essentially already have all the economic benefits of EVs and green power, they just happen to run on internal combustion engines and fossil fuels. Replacing them with EVs and windmills, while definitely a good thing, isn't creating new productive capacity, it's just shifting the existing productive capacity from the old tech to the new tech."

Like many of you, I am considering transferring my stocks in Robinhood (around $31k) over to Fidelity.   I sat on the phone, on hold with Fidelity for 45 minutes before I hung up, so I’m hoping I can have my questions answered here.

Fidelity will transfer my exact number of shares at my exact average price, correct?  There is no disconnect here?

Partial shares cannot be transferred, but Fidelity does allow the purchase of partial shares - correct?

Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell on Fidelity , or any monthly fees or required minimums in the account?

No crypto on Fidelity.  If I keep my crypto on Robinhood and transfer everything else - is that unwise?   I don’t want to use RH anymore, honestly, but I’m also not keen on cashing in my crypto investments at the time either. 

Anything I’m forgetting or overlooking?

Forever regret the decisions I made to the grave. Went emotional on February and bought everything you tubers and WSB recommended. I’m down $20,000 of my own blood and sweat money."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I bought during the COVID drop and immediately lost 15k of my own money.

I know the feeling and it sucks.

I ended up doing well in the and turned my initial 40k into 160k in the last year.

I’m sure you will make that back, but you might want to consider some more “boring plays”

I still hold a lot of ET (energy transfer) for example (about 70k worth). Bought it at 6.80 initially

It’s not going up 1000% next week, but will likely recover to $10-$12 in the next year which is what I’m holding for.

If it hits $10 I’ll sell at least a 3rd of what I hold now.

Might want to consider some longer term plays.

I honestly take gains to early sometimes, but I’d rather be safe then sorry and I’m usually selling because those gains will impact my life in a good way."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Can’t do anything now. I’m all red in my own money. Holding til green. I’m out of capital. I withdraw all my savings into the stock market. Yea stupid, I know. Then market correction hit, bought ATH. Bad decisions altogether 2021. And I bought GME at 340 right before the dip. I have learned to sell in profits and not chase now....$20,000 lesson. Will probably see more red tomorrow."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Well Goodluck man.

My buddy who I got into stocks (picked my picks over the last year but with less cash invested)  was up with me a good amount. He YOLOd his money in GME and lost pretty much all the gains I helped him make.  Hard lesson for him as well.  He is basically at square one again now after a year of buying the large COVID dip we saw.

At least he’s not down a ton of his own money ATM but still lost about 50k in profits he made over the last year in a day."
03/19/2021,stocks,$50k in one day? Holy hell what happened?
03/19/2021,stocks,"Might have been a few I guess. It was less then 3 days though.

He literally put all his money in GME and BB. after the huge rally.

This was the first time GME Rose and crashed to $40 after.   He held at $40 and sold the day before it skyrocketed back up lol.

So yeah he turned like 25k into 80k the last year.

Then dumped 80k in GME and sold at like a 75% loss.   Not the exact numbers but close to around that."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yikes, how is he feeling? I’ve been emotionally fucked because of my bad decisions. Hope he’s doing okay."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah he was pissed.

Even went kind of silent for a week or so and didn't tell me about it. finally asked him what was up and he told me.  plus his dog died right around the same time so he was pretty down yeah.

Gotta take it as a learning experience."
2021-03-19 02:04:23,stocks,"Can anyone explain what is happening to Plug Power. There seems to be no reasoning for Plug Powers wild price changes.

Buy puts instead if you think the stock is going to go down. if you short a stock and there's good news, catalyst, or whatever the next day, you are screwed because you will likely have to cover your short or sell your position and lose, and the the next day, you might have to cover again or sell your position.  With puts, you know what you may lose.

2021-03-19 01:55:17,stocks,"Where are those who were around for the 2008 ""crash"" and do you remember the recovery sentiment? I do not claim to be a bear or a bull in this market. I am just along for the ride but some of the feel I get from the media and the public remind me a lot of the 2008 crisis. Well more so the recovery from the crisis. I was probably the age of the average reddit user trading today when it happened. FYI it was much harder to get into trading (and expensive) back then... make sure to appreciate the time you are living in! 

What I remember was that when the fed stepped in and started handing out money everyone was dropping the word ""hyperinflation."" It was the first time I had heard of it and I had to figure out what it meant.

They also cut interest rates in half and the theme was ""it is only a matter of time before they came back."" I bought a house in 2011 and my loan officer was pushing me to hurry before interest rates went higher. 

They started this ""quantitative easing"" for the stock market where the government dumped money in so it would move up ""artificially."" This is how it was explained to me at the time and why people started talking about the bubble building that was going to ""pop"" in the stock market as it recovered to it's ""pre-crisis"" levels. 

When I think back to the ""sentiment"" of the financial crisis I see a lot of the same things today but it is all compressed into a much shorter time frame now. It also has this ""double down"" feel. Interest rates didn't ever recover and were cut in half yet again during the covid crisis. The fed is printing far more money then they did back then (though the bail outs were huge). I don't think they ever really stopped (someone else can clarify) injecting money into the economy. I also would like to note that inflation didn't ""get out of control"" but it sure seems things are much more expensive even though the numbers they follow don't show that. 

TL;DR These are the things that come to my mind from watching CNBC everyday after work during the financial crisis. The worries of then seem to be similar to the worries of today but they didn't actually play out back then. At the same time it seems we never got ""back to where we were"" when you consider the fed's involvement after 2009. They seem to be perpetually stuck injecting money and keeping rates low. Whenever they try to step away the market throws a tantrum and they come back. Can anyone else make some comparisons as to how this time is different or possibly the same? 

Bonus Question: Are any signs of a weak economy always going to be the responsibility of the fed to fix it? (More in reference to 2018-2019 than the covid crash.)"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Psychologically it was the worst financial disaster the general public had gone through. Of course no one fathomed the possibility of a global pandemic. That was the stuff of scifi flicks. 

After the huge sell off people were day trading FAS and FAZ every day for weeks while the banks were in limbo. Real estate dove hard. Except in high demand places, it took years for condo prices in particular to recover."
03/19/2021,stocks,"My first stock purchase post crash was AMD for around $2 a share. The difficult thing was hours were cut everywhere, people lost their jobs, my apartment complex was about half empty for a while.

I was lucky to still have a job but we were cut to 4 days a week and hourly (we were a software company and was on salary with benefits and other great perks, which were all cut). 

In hindsight investing in all these cheap stocks was a missed oppurtunity but when it was going on, I wasn't sure if I would have a job left so spending excess cash on investments was not in the picture."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I graduated college roughly 7 weeks before the crash. It took me 3 years to find a job in my field and when I was unemployed was living without health insurance with a chronic illness. The depression I was in for years has caused serious  anxiety when it comes to work and work stress now. I feel that my job is everything, it is life or death. And I currently hate my job and want to quit. But the fear is overwhelming and it has allowed for my employer to abuse how much I care and I am completely burned out. But I managed to keep the job during this pandemic. And I have just been saving and investing and maybe I will be able to live a life of freedom I want by the time I am 40. I want to be a digital nomad. I will take a pay cut. But if I can make it work, maybe I can be happy.

Back then it was an economic crisis. This is/was a public health crisis with a competent fed and believe it or not Steve Mnuchin stepping up. And I think if the fed wasn't asleep at the wheel the entire time in 07/8/9 things probably would have been different."

This could be the first serious tax hike after 4 decades or more, could be very scary. My active portfolio is only about 4% of my total portfolio now and all I pick is risky speculative tech stocks, will see how it goes. No profits, no tax, see if that works.

For the 2008 crisis one thing I remember is apple took a few months from the then all time low in early 2009 to reach another all time high after 5 months or so, a 100% rally in such short amount of time."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I actually got lucky and got hired by the federal government at the start of 2008. Everyone I know that wasn't working in the government got decimated though. For me, it was just starting my career at that time, making little money so I didn't think one bit about putting into stocks. If I was established though, i would have had a ton of power during that time. Like if that scenario played out again today, i would be buying up all the real estate I could.

&#x200B;

2021-03-19 01:00:03,stocks,"$LAC - Securing America's Lithium Supply - DD Lithium Americas Corp TSX:LAC NYSE :LAC

# Summary

* With increasing demand for Lithium I wanted to find a Lithium producer that has strong reserves and upside in the medium to long term
* LAC has the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America and the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* These two assets are under development but are nearing completion. Price dipped recently but based on their existing assets and recent analyst price targets LAC seems like a decent investment

# Lithium Background

I wanted to understand how Lithium is extracted to make sure I could gauge the viability of the lithium mining companies I was looking at. I summarized my findings below if you are curious. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022. [here](https://www.thoughtco.com/lithium-production-2340123#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20extract%20lithium,increasingly%20high%20concentrations%20of%20lithium.)

Tpa = Tonnes Per Annum – essentially how much Lithium they can extract on a yearly basis

# Market Overview

To summarize – Lithium demand is expected to grow exponentially. 2 main factors:

1. Falling Lithium prices over the last 3 years reduce investment in Lithium production globally
2. Surging demand for EVs and shift to green energy

**Lithium prices continue to soar – up 88% in 2021** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/lithium-prices-continue-to-soar-up-88-in-2021/)

**Schlumberger unit to launch Nevada lithium plant as EV demand rises** [**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-schlumberger-energy-plans-lithium-134649877.html)

If you haven’t heard of Schlumberger check them out, they are the world’s largest oilfield service company. If they are shifting into the lithium production space then the leadership team sees value and growth here. Also from the article “Demand for battery-grade lithium is projected to grow exponentially, driven by growth in the electric vehicle market, and efficient production of the metal has become an important topic for regions, industries, and technology companies.”

**Battery grade lithium prices in China surge 68%** [**here**](https://www.mining.com/battery-grade-lithium-prices-in-china-surge-68/)

While lithium’s majors are beginning to reengage in expansion plans, three years of falling lithium prices have failed to incentivize sufficient investment into the supply chain, leading to greater risks of price volatility as battery demand ramps up.

Trading Economics forecast of Lithium Prices [here](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lithium)

The prices here are in yuan/tonne so if we use a conversion rate of 1 yuan = $0.15 USD. Assume price is around 80,000 yuan/tonne then it is about $12,000 USD/tonne

# Lithium Americas

Leadership is one of the key aspects I look at when considering an investment. Most of their leadership team has 20+ years in lithium or resource production. They have a CTO who has 1-\_ year of lithium processing experience and used to work for Tesla. Check out their investor [presentation](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf) for a bit of background, but essentially from what I’ve seen they have a strong management team.

2 Main sites under development for Lithium

**Caucharí-Olaroz, Argentina (Brine Extraction)**

* Caucharí-Olaroz is the largest known NI 43-101 lithium brine resource in development in South America
* Partnered with Ganfeng Lithium on the jointly owned operation in Jujuy, Argentina
* Average production 40,000 tpa battery-grade Li2CO3
* After-Tax NPV10% is $1.5 billion
* Quick math: 40,000 tpa x $12,000 USD/tonne = $480M USD annually
* Note: Production doesn’t start until 2022
* Capital expenditures for the Project remain on budget with $477 million (84%) of the $565 million committed, including $388 million (69%) spent, as of December 31, 2020.

**THACKER PASS LITHIUM PROJECT (Clay Extraction)**

* Developing the largest-known lithium resource in the United States
* 100% owned by Lithium Americas with offtake rights uncommitted
* On January 15, 2021, the US Bureau of Land Management issued the Record of Decision following completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process.
* All remaining state permits and water right transfers required to commence construction **are expected later this year.**
* Top ten biggest lithium mines in the world [here](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/top-ten-biggest-lithium-mines/) **Thacker Pass Lithium Project is #2**

Summary of March 2, 2021 Full Year and Q4 Report

I highlighted some key points and provided commentary to their recent Annual report

* · As at December 31, 2020, the Company had $148 million in cash and cash equivalents ($518 million as at February 28, 2021). **great position to be in, especially with heavy CAPEX projects, especially with amount that has been spend in Argentina**
* · On January 22, 2021, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of shares of its common stock and issued 18,181,818 common shares at a price of $22.00 per Common Share for gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $400 million (approximately $377 million net proceeds). **This is big especially if you look at the current price**
* On November 30, 2020, Lithium Americas completed an at-the-market equity program (“ATM Program”) and issued a total of 9,266,587 common shares from treasury for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million ($97 million net proceeds). **Price was \~$10 a share at this point in time**

Link [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lithium-americas-reports-2020-full-122600429.html)

**Analyst Price Target**

* High: $30.50
* Average: $21.42
* Low: $16.00

# Risks

* **Nevada Permits** – This is always an unknow, they expect to receive permits by mid to late 2021. The Biden administration has made it clear they want to secure supply of precious resources but this permitting is at the State Level so if there is an issue this could delay the project.
* **Argentina and China Partnership**: Their Argentinian assets is a joint venture with a Chines Lithium producer. So far it seems like development of the site has gone smoothly but geopolitical issues could prove to be a risk

# TLDR

* Price of lithium is increasing due to increased demand and ramp down of production over last 3 years
* Current US administration is looking to support and secure supply chain of critical materials and production – LAC owns 100% of the largest known lithium resource in America
* Opportunity to buy the dip and hold medium to long term

2021-03-19 00:46:11,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 18, 2021 Stocks fell Thursday after reaching record highs a day earlier as the Treasury yields rose again, igniting another heavy pullback in tech stocks. Moreover, a new report also showed US first-time unemployment claims unexpectedly rose last week. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.44% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.

The Federal Reserve’s assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance, “The Fed certainly gave the market some meat to chew on, raising its economic growth forecast for 2021 significantly to 6.5%. The implication of this projection is that, at some point in 2022, U.S. GDP will exceed its pre-pandemic path. Despite this very strong outlook, the Fed played down the risk from inflation, with their projections showing a very modest and, importantly, only temporary overshoot of their 2% target – certainly a more subdued inflation outlook than many investors were fearing.”

As of March 17, 73.7 million Americans—22.2% of the total population, and 28.5% of those 18 and older—had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine, according [to data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) from the Centers for Disease Control. That’s up from 62.5 million a week ago. 40 million Americans, or 15.5% of the total adult population has been fully vaccinated.

It wasn’t worth it to many people to apply when all that was just going away in a couple weeks. Now it makes financial sense to apply.

I could never understand what's going on here.  So today jobless claims were higher than expected, so the Nasdaq sells off and people put their money in the 're-opening"" stocks.  WHY?!  Then the next day or two or week everything reverses!

It's like musical chairs or something.  What the hecks the point?!  Also what makes it really stupid is that when someone is selling because of bad news someone else is buying the same bad news!

So people are selling because they think BECAUSE of bad news their stocks will go down and so consequently those same sellers are all driving the price down by selling!  Makes a lot of sense! 

So everyone panics and sells because they think everyone else is going to panic and sell and so everyone sells.  

And the funniest part is that a few days later everyone buys right back in again!  Talk about dumb!"

Someone is willing to sell the stock lower than they would otherwise because of the bad news. The other person would have bought at that price with good news or bad. The seller is motivated to sell by bad news, the buyer is motivated to buy by the low price.

03/19/2021,stocks,"its kinda getting old to see this ""HF shorting stuff to make money"" stuff.   
you do realize that they go long as well ? 

and options are not their only way to make money. they have access to other means (e.g. High frequency trades) and pay vastly lower fees for trading anyways. 

normal (retail) traders need actual price volatility to make decent returns, while

high frequency traders need only a few cents to be able to make bank. when stocks like GME, RKT, you name it, have daily spreads of several percent (or even double digits in %) and fluctuate wildly, they make hundreds of millions trading back and fourth. 

shorting stocks surely is one way for them to make money. but its a much slower process compared to the daily trade volume, which needs no human interaction at all, is highly automated and almost instant. 

all hail the supercomputers and algorithms. those with enough capital and the means to manage it really do not care at all in which stocks and markets turn. they profit anyways."

But honestly people forget that most trading volume comes from algorithms which are designed to execute orders at the best possible price for hedge funds (this includes the famous ""washing weak hands"" tactic). The volume and chart definitely looks manipulated but in truth, hedge funds are simply forced to squeeze every penny out of the stock due to their trading size.

 \- only rare earth minerals producer in the western hemisphere, most of the rest of the industry is centered in china

 \- rare earth minerals are necessary to power seemingly any future-tech, especially green tech (namely EVs)

 \- they're moving downstream. next they'll be processing their own materials, and then eventually (5-7 years) producing permanent magnets, which are used in EVs and many other things. 

 \- the US government is working aggressively to develop a rare earth supply chain that doesn't rely on china, has invested in this company, and has released countless dictates that we work to ensure supply chain security (again, MP is currently the only rare earth producer in the western hemisphere, and these mines take a long time to get up and running)

 \- Over the next 10 years the price of rare earth minerals is expected to skyrocket, and by 2030, IIRC, demand is expected to outstrip annual supply

03/19/2021,stocks,"It's too bad this revenue-generating company was not appreciated well enough as a SPAC.

03/19/2021,stocks,"Not Op but to keep it short on why I think they’ll succeed.. better management, cleaner/greener/more recycled materials in operation means higher margins, demand for REE is much higher than Molycorp and only getting stronger. The kicker: during the height of the pandemic, when congress couldn’t do shit they passed a BIPARTISAN bill which gave MP money. They have gotten grants from DOD, Congress, and Biden. Meanwhile, China has passed legislation allowing Winnie the Pooh to restrict export to counties with competing military at a whim. It seems to me that the government won’t let MP fail."

That does sound promising, although I still don't quite see how they will produce the metals from what is mined (bottleneck factor IMO - the USA is already a net exporter of RE mineral concentrate but has a 100% import dependence on metals and compounds \[[https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-rare-earths.pdf](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2021/mcs2021-rare-earths.pdf)\])

Meanwhile, there is definitely competition out there aiming to do direct production of RE magnets domestically ([https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/07/2012663/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-Acquires-U-S-Rare-Earth-Permanent-Magnet-Manufacturing-Capability.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/04/07/2012663/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-Acquires-U-S-Rare-Earth-Permanent-Magnet-Manufacturing-Capability.html)), though I don't know what their resource is if not the minerals from Mountain Pass - likely monazite or Appalachian coal refuse."

2021-03-19 00:24:51,stocks,"Intel (INTC) Could Double with Long-Delayed GPU Entrance *Obligatory Disclaimer – This is not financial advice. I do not currently personally hold a position in INTC, but others I advise do either directly or indirectly and I or they may enter into additional positions in the near future.*

Intel has had a tough time the last few years as manufacturing missteps, and tough competition from AMD has materially hurt their business. AMD’s Zen 3 offering has only highlighted the problem, particularly in the booming and sizeable enterprise CPU market. This has been the focus of investors for quite some time, with emphasis on their hybrid fabless model going forward dictating price moves recently. Despite the progress made in recent months in trying to address their prior missteps, street expectation is still for a 6% revenue decline in 2021 vs. AMD which is projected to grow revenue by 38% over the same period. This has caused AMD to outperformed Intel by 564% through the trailing 3-year period and has weighed on valuation metrics for INTC relative to semiconductor peers. INTC now trades at 8x BF EV/EBITDA relative to AMD’s 30x and the semiconductor industry’s mean 16.5x. 

The company replaced the former CEO in January of 2021 with Pat Gelsinger, who has a rich engineering background at INTC. His focus so far has been on stabilizing the CPU business, which I believe he has started to do (although there is still a lot of work to do). Additionally, by utilizing a hybrid production model primarily with TSMC the design team at INTC shouldn't be held back by any manufacturing missteps. This, in my view, gives marginal upside to street forecasts on the existing revenue lines, but nothing super compelling near-term.

What I think most investors are missing, though, is the rather substantial opportunity for Intel graphics. The GPU market has been incredibly starved recently with pretty much no availability. Tailwinds with blockchain applications, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud proliferation, etc., have only exacerbated the growth profile in GPU TAM. Investors, though, have been promised again and again compelling graphics offerings only to be disappointed by countless delays, which is probably the root cause of the mispricing and healthy skepticism.

NVDA and AMD currently dominate the GPU market. NVDA has had its dominant position go largely unchecked for quite some time, but both simply cannot supply enough GPUs for the demand in the current market. This gives Intel’s long-delayed Xe graphics offering an incredible opportunity as they don’t need to unseat NVDA in terms of pure performance to be competitive but rather just need to have a compelling offering with adequate supply. Though nothing is confirmed, they’re rumored to have partnered with TSMC for production on their 7nm process, which would be competitive. 

This also gives Pat Gelsinger an opportunity to reframe sentiment around the company by laying out a roadmap to dominate a massive market the company currently doesn’t play in.

I believe the “Intel Unleashed: Engineering the Future” webcast next Tuesday, 3/23/21 ([https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/media-alert-engineering-future/#gs.wiegid](https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/media-alert-engineering-future/#gs.wiegid)), will be a great form for this. Given the rumors around INTC’s Xe graphics and some hints such as Raja Koduri’s, INTCs chief architect, recent tweets, I believe this could be a catalyst for valuation repricing.

On the upside, I believe the company could reprice to the industry EV/EBITDA multiple of 16x depending on the potential market share capture based on how competitive the company’s GPU line is. If there is a lack of emphasis on graphics or the offering isn’t very competitive however I think the downside is minimized by the fact that the market doesn’t seem to be currently pricing in anything interesting with regards to GPUs, and the company currently trades at roughly its two-year historical average BF EV/EBITDA with the 2% dividend yield giving some support."
03/19/2021,stocks,"intel has household name recognition, but are struggling and have alot of headwinds.  They are too far behind to in the GPU field to do anything meaningful in that space. AMD was lagging so they bought ATI in an attempt to catch up.  AMD took market share from intel mostly in the datacenters.  ATI/AMD combo likely the reason for their success with gaming consoles.  IMHO Intel will need to buy a GPU company (but who??) to catch up.  Intel has struggled in IOT space, losing to ARM designs. Depending on the success of the macs with the  ARM (m1), could be another headwind for intel.  Intel benefited from covid  and remote work/learning in the personal pc space, but I see sells not doing so well for the next few years until those retail customers need to refresh.  I'm on the sidelines with INTEL"
03/19/2021,stocks,Intel just announced they will do some kind of announcement of their gpu on 03.26.21. I am all in Intel. Any decent gpu will sell like hot cakes in this market.
03/19/2021,stocks,When the ev booms then we'll see that intel shine.
03/19/2021,stocks,"If they are launching anything related to GPU in March 23, it would be their server GPU's based on their Xe hp architecture. Which should be beating both nvidia a100 and amd mi100 in fp32 and fp64 performance."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah..... but computers bought in the 1000s by companies at bottom dollar don't have GPUs. This is quite literally why Intel has on board graphics.

There are no chips, you'll be waiting a LONG time. 

There are 3 main drivers for GPUs: Gamers, Graphics (art, engineering), and mining. 

All 3 of the above do not buy only off of name recognition and absolutely care about specs.

In order for Intel to make a dent in this market:

They'll need to make a card that outperforms NVIDIA.

Undersell for comparative performance

And/or make a card that has amazing cost/performance to power consumption ratio (laptops).

I'm honestly not sure if you can find which is the biggest market? The above? Or the average purchaser of a higher-end laptop or middle- of- the- road desktop that looks at price over specs.

Half (probably over) the laptop market is Apple who is creating their own GPUs"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I agree for real success they have to make a competitive board. it really is that simple. This could be a flop for them, absolutely. This is no slam dunk, it is only potential. 

As for the chip shortage, remember Intel is basically the only standing designer and manufacturer anymore. Intel makes their own chips in their own fabs (mostly) they are not reliant on TSM to make everything for them like AMD and NVIDIA are. The chip shortage is because the overall demand for electronics has absolutely slammed manufactures. TSM is running at capacity and can't keep up, and they make chips for some 100 total companies. 

Intel makes chips for Intel... The chip shortage is a window of opportunity for Intel, not a roadblock."

My options are :   


1. Buy the options and hold on to them 
2. Let them go. Buy nothing. 
3. Sell up and get hit with taxes. Invest the take-home elsewhere. 

The company has had, publicly, a very rocky couple of years. The nature of its business will be impacted heavily by Covid19, the extent of the damage is a case of waiting. On paper it looks like a terrible gamble. I do think there's a small possibility they may manage to pull it back together but to what extent is the question. 

Ultimately, I would not sensibly invest now if the money was sitting on the table in hard cash, but it isn't. So, my instinct is to take option 3 over option 1. I am not seriously considering option 2. 

Looking for other people's thoughts on the matter before I make a move. I have tried to go into as much detail as I can without making it *too* obvious who I'm talking about."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Corrections on average last 3-4 weeks before bottoming, and there will likely be choppiness for the next week and a half before the market fully exhausts all sellers and decides to go up.

March 2020 crash peaked starting on Feb 19 and bottomed on March 23rd (lasted 4 weeks), the market bounced then dipped and made a higher low on April 3rd (1 and a half weeks later) before zooming up.

Correction that started on September 2nd bottomed on Sept 24 (lasted 3 weeks), markets bounced then dipped, and made a higher low on Oct 2nd (1 week later) before zooming up.

October correction started Oct 13, bottomed Nov 2 (3 weeks), bounced then dipped to form a higher low on Nov 10 (1 week later) before zooming up.

If we take Feb 12th as the local top (top of QQQ), then March 8th is likely to be where the bottom formed (3 and a half weeks from top), and either today or tomorrow will be the end of the choppiness (1 and a half weeks later).

03/19/2021,stocks,"Reposting this because apparently the ticker I referenced as a penny stock isn't allowed lol

There's two classes of penny stocks, those on the major exchanges, like the NYSE, and those on the OTC exchange. The ones on the NYSE are typically meh to outright bad companies, and often represent fairly risky investments, however they can present pretty compelling value if the company doesn't fail (often not a given). The most common reason people go after penny stocks is because of how cheap the shares are (owning 2000 *insert stock worth $1.50* shares seems a lot better than 1 AMZN share, despite them being pretty much the same value and amazon almost certainly being a safer investment), which is not a good reason to pick them, but they can be perfectly viable as long as you evaluate them the same as any other company.

The ones on the OTC exchange (the ""pink sheets"") you shouldn't touch unless you have a very compelling reason to. These are the stocks that can't even make the cut for the big exchanges and often represent dead, defunct, or failing companies. Not to mention these are the primary target of most pump and dump scams, so if you ever see someone recommending a stock to you from the pink sheets you should probably just stay away."

If it's less consistent of a stock, you can do the wheel strategy which is basically selling cash covered puts as soon as the covered call gets exercised. You sell that put at a strike you're comfortable buying the underlying 100 shares, then if it goes ITM and you get those 100 shares, you start selling covered calls again."

03/19/2021,stocks,">what happens if you sell an otm put and it ends up in the money

If you sell an OTM put and it expires ITM, you are required to buy 100 shares at that strike price (assuming it gets exercised). That's why if you're doing the wheel strategy, you set the strike price at a price you're comfortable paying. 

Edit: If you aren't doing the wheel and just selling cash covered puts alone for profit but don't actually want the shares, then you probably want to set your strike a little lower to ensure it doesn't get exercised. Definitely pick a strike <= .30 delta.

>let’s also say you never had 100 shares of the stock in the first place.

You don't need 100 shares to sell a put, but you do need the cash. If you sell a put (as in you are the original writer of the put option, thus in your brokerage account you ""sell to open"" in the trade window), you are promising the person who buys your put that will purchase their 100 shares of underlying at the strike price you set, on or before expiration. So if you sell a put with strike $25, you need $2500 settled cash to sell it so that if it gets exercised, you are able to buy those 100 shares.

>do i have to use other stocks as collateral?

No, you need cash. It's called a cash-covered put. If you don't have the cash and you still want to sell a put, you have to have a margin account thus you're borrowing the cash from your broker to cover your put."

But it seems there are always people sounding off alarms about possible imminent crashes. Going back to 2016, I remember many people saying that real estate was in a bubble. But housing prices have kept going up relentlessly. But now I see a lot of big names in investing saying the market will crash, from Charlie Munger, Ray Dalio, Warren Buffet, etc. are all saying markets are unreasonably high.

I'm only a novice to investing/trading, but my two cents are that I think there has been a lot of mania with retail investors (and investors in general feeding off the mania) trying to ""make it"" big and quick. Just like the crash related to the housing market in '08, I wouldn't be too surprised if the market is being affected by people investing money they can't afford to lose, or money they *don't even have in the first place* (i.e., money *lent* to them through margin or otherwise that if push came to shove via a margin call or loan payment or whatever, they would be unable to repay). After all, you need money to make money investing/trading, and what quicker/easier way to get one's bankroll than with margin/loans/credit? In that sense, I definitely feel the sentiment that we're in for a downturn in the future, but I have no semblance of when that downturn would happen or how severe it would be."

03/19/2021,stocks,"They're not wrong, the stock market is unreasonably high. Difference between a declining market and crash is the time frame. If it takes 10 years then people have time to exit safely even as they complain about a bygone era of high  productivity/growth. If it happens in 1 week that's a crash where people don't have time to adjust/lose too much and might end up leaving the country. Wealth is transferred not destroyed and there's no such thing as infinite growth. Hopefully the wealth is transferred into something valuable. If money leaves the stock market it might move to markets outside of stocks or even outside the country. The mechanism of market decline is when sellers/shorts outnumber buyers on a ongoing basis, so everyday people pull their money out which cause more people to pull their money until there's a sell of. All it takes to stop the crash is for people to buy back in, but who wants to buy in during a run off? At some point a market correction will happen and some think it'll be sooner than later. Personally I think it'll be later , and I think that money will just move to a new market that hasn't been identified yet."

Look at the list of guys you mentioned, super rich, market savvy, and they all have this one thing in common - they tend to be conservative, always expecting the worst. What if you invested that way all the time? Rather than chasing a few bucks after the hot thing, that you're likely to lose, you thought, ""Man, the market's gonna crash. Don't want to sit in cash.

That’s what made it so horrible. Had there been no exotic options house of cards built upon the real estate market, it would’ve been just a mini downturn, not a massive recession"

I know a couple of people that actually work in hedge funds and they’ve told me no ones touching GME.

You need to understand that financial reports are one of the most important things out there and one should not take news like this light headed.

Whether it's in the next 5 years or the next 20, it will happen. Oil is finite and therefore the economy cant rely on in infinitely. While it is true that we have been sluggish at adopting this change, it HAS to happen. Otherwise the world as we know it will be destroyed. Climate change leads to more frequent/extreme natural disasters, damaging the economy one disaster at a time. It's already happening. Wild fires, large hurricanes, extreme heat waves, etc. Every one of these has dramatic affects on communities and the economies within them. Along with this, ecosystems will collapse and the natural resources our economies rely on will be gone. Therefore, if we do not adopt clean energy and technology for a sustainable future we will destroy the world around us while simultaneously destroying the stability of our economic systems.

03/19/2021,stocks,Equityzen.com is a good site.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Brokerages that may offer you access to ***Pre-IPO*** without being an accredited investor: 

\-**TD Ameritrade**, from what I hear you still need over $100k to actually qualify but it is more attainable than being an accredited investor.

\-**Fidelity**, lower barrier to entry than TD Ameritrade but I hear their selection isn't what it once was.

\-**E-Trade**, I'm actually not sure if they still offer this, but I know they did not too long ago.

Of course be sure to check with the brokerage itself for the latest info and to see if you would qualify.

You can also check out **ClickIPO**. They offer access to IPOs by linking your **TradeStation** brokerage account. I've been using this one for a while and it works, but their selection isn't very good, mostly SPACs.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're looking to invest in companies before they even talk about an IPO, you can check out a multitude of crowdfunding websites that allow pretty much anyone to invest in startups. Some places still require you to be an accredited investor but they usually disclose this fairly quickly so it's easy to eliminate them as options. Of the ones that don't require you to be an accredited investor check out: **Republic, MicroVentures, SeedInvest, StartEngine**, and there are others. These usually offer youths chance  to invest smaller amounts, usually in the hundreds of dollars, and sometimes offer perks for investing certain amounts. Also of note, crowdfunding used to be limited to about $2,200 per year (at least for me) depending on income and net worth, but that has recently (as of this week) changed. Now I am able to invest over $20k 🤷‍♂️.

2021-03-18 22:35:42,stocks,"ZKIN 15m Outlook 
Since the last outlook the price of ZKIN stock has decreased by 5% in value as it's currently traded slightly above $9 area.

Although we've expected the gains to be extended furthermore, ZKIN wasn't able to close above key resistance at $10, which led to a correction.

ZKIN is currently correcting, but it seems like the price has bottomed at $8.60 from where the price may uptrend again.

Such correction is a good thing, as if the gains were extended to $11 area, a deeper correction would be seen, possibly scaring off more stock holders.

MACD is currently in a selling wave while the bearish momentum is faltering for a while.

RSI bottomed at 40, found support at key level and haven't led bearish momentum into action.

Overall trend remains an uptrend as the price is located above 50 EMA which is located at $9.07. A break above 20 EMA at $9.27 may resume the strong uptrend again.

2021-03-18 22:24:03,stocks,"An explnation of what happend in $YI Well, first of all, ill admit it was so stupid from me to rush to a stock, usually it doesnt happen to me.

anyways YI released their 4Q and anuual, which seems to have fantastic results, but i was doubting  a bit cause i wasnt familair with the company, i read a bit, and the results of growth in revenue (96.1%) and gross profit told me i got to get in, even tho its slightly lower tha nthe previous one, but how can u stick to 100%, and by reading about the expected revenue, i saw they beat the expactaion.

&#x200B;

so it was 18.06 at the pre market. i read the the report once it went out. and after a lot of times i was too cheap to get in because of 5-7% up in pre, i lost alot of ""winning trades"" - so this time i decided to get in whatever, if its not to high, so it got my order in lmt of 19.3 (ofc it got me in 19.3 and not 18.95 which was the previous jump) - but right away it jumped , to 20- after that it reached even to 20.5 which was 13.21$ already in pre. 

 i thought to my self that maybe its true and its a good report, but then it started to bounce back, while i still cant see any comment or anything about the report - i had my doubs maybe to get out, but i said to my self lets wait to the openning to make those decisions, probably just lack of volume ( which got me in the first place as a mistake, i think im dont with the pre from now on) 

any way its kept the down trend, i still made a lot of mistakes which i'll not get in detail in here for my sake, but they were just the worst, and from 13.21% in the pre to 8.25% now and still going - im still in, didnt cut looses, idk, i just dont know.

is it the market today, maybe, but its not just that, it seem the sell of related to the report too.

ill be glad if someone can look at  the report and the other company reoports and tell me what's the reason for that sell of, what have i missed, and should i stick a bit in the stock and it might go a bit higher?

HOL, SPCE, VACQ could potentially have an influx of volume in the coming weeks as ARK buys these popular stocks. Overall I’m sure the space sector will be bullish in the future although I’m sceptical that there will be any massive advancements this decade.

Diving in a bit deeper: **Orders up 65.8%** versus Q3-20 and 56.5% versus Q4-19 due to broad based demand increase across Besi’s end-user markets, particularly **mobile** and **automotive applications**

They're holding a good bit of cash at the moment: Net cash increased to € 198.7 million, up € 40.0 million (+25.2%) versus September 30, 2020

Key highlights for FY2020: Orders of € 472.1 million grew € 123.4 million **(+35.4%)** Net income of € 132.3 million grew € 51.0 million **(+62.7%)**. Net margin rose to 30.5% versus 22.8% in 2019.

Or, even better just buy the two stock indexes that they buy and forget bond funds for now (they are fine for traders who can switch between short and long positions but terrible long term; just look at the returns of TLT or IEF). Right now the best set it and forget it fund you can create would be 70-80% VTI, 20-30% VXUS.

03/19/2021,stocks,"The commentary is good imo, but agreed rest is a rough read. I think regarding bonds even if u read the book end to end they showcased the graph of interest rates through the years and it's relatively apparent that bond yields were simply solid during Ben Grahams times where as it's non existent now. If I remember correctly a line mightve alluded to just using a savings account these days , and it does add in REITs as a viable alternative."

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO.

&amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).

&amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards.

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)

&amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still).

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

2021-03-18 20:38:59,stocks,"Update on my post about Clubhouse, $API (Agora), Social Audio apps, $TWTR and $AMZN This is a follow up to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lhbw3q/lets_discuss_the_explosion_in_social_audio_apps/) on ways we could profit from the explosion in social audio apps. It's mostly opinion and educated speculation (as far as technology).

**TLDR: Agora ($API) was inflated as a proxy stock for Clubhouse. It's not going to be able to compete against what Amazon AWS is offering. Clubhouse growth is on the decline, and Twitter Spaces might be onto something.**

From my last post several weeks ago:

>the app's clunkiness (and what looked to be a poorly-built backend)

In the several weeks since then, it became apparent just how poorly built it was: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56163623](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56163623)

Since these events, which coincided with significant drops in Agora's share price, I commented that they'd struggle to sustain higher than $60. But with other developments in the past several weeks, I wouldn't be shocked to see it fall close to its 2020 IPO price of $25

>**Twitter** has a competing product: Spaces. Announced late November and soft-launched late December, it looks/feels better and has some functionality Clubhouse is sorely lacking,

I've become much more optimistic about Twitter Spaces since then.

# Agora's ~5x price increase since June was probably inflated by Clubhouse hype

I recently commented that $API wouldn't sustain around $60. Now I believe even that was greatly overvaluing the stock. I expect Agora to fall much lower, particularly as it draws more scrutiny. Possibly dipping below its June IPO price.

1. Most of its value is inflated by the hype of Clubhouse
2. Just over a month ago it looked like Clubhouse could reach 20M users by the end of February. Their growth acceleration seems to be declining, and they didn't reach 20M until the weekend, despite there being plenty of invites.
3. **Clubhouse is using competing service PubNub** (which offers similar services) for real time messaging rather than Agora's own RTM service. I'm wondering how this is anything but extremely concerning for Agora since it hints heavily at an upcoming transition from Agora
4. The security concerns of the service as well as the concerns people have had regarding Clubhouse/Agora/China have made it unlikely that Agora will at least be the go-to service for everyone entering the social audio space.
5. **Amazon AWS / Chime SDK.** This [tweet](https://twitter.com/dabit3/status/1357319440547856385) and its replies speak for themselves.

**From Wired:**

>*Recent security concerns about Clubhouse run the gamut from vulnerabilities to questions about the app's underlying infrastructure. A little over a week ago, researchers \[...\] found that the app was transmitting \[identifying information\] unencrypted, meaning that a third party could have potentially tracked your actions in the app. \[...\]* ***Clubhouse's infrastructure is run by a Shanghai-based firm \[Agora\]*** ***and it seemed that the app's data was traveling through China at least some of the time***—potentially exposing users to targeted or even widespread *Chinese government surveillance*. Then, on Sunday, *Bloomberg confirmed* *that* ***a third-party website was scraping and compiling audio from Clubhouse discussion***. Early Monday, further revelations followed that Clubhouse discussions were being scraped for an *unaffiliated Android app*, allowing users on that operating system to listen along in real-time.

# Twitter Spaces

1. After seeing Twitter's speed of development, and recent signals that they intend to go directly after Clubhouse with discovery features and a **dedicated Twitter Spaces tab**, I'm incredibly optimistic about Spaces.
2. **This is huge** ***because*** **it's Twitter** — the social network so boring it made headlines for doubling its character limit. This is a major part of something Twitter is going all in on.
3. **Twitter spaces recently released an Android version** — Clubhouse hired a single Android developer *three weeks ago*.
4. Clubhouse has been talking about opening up ""ASAP"" for at least 7 months — **Twitter Spaces is opening up in a few weeks.**
5. Add that to a host of new serious apps aiming to replicate (or rather *do better* *than*) what Clubhouse does (that notably do not use Agora) and the idea that Clubhouse is going to win this game with a few developers seems far-fetched. It may simply be viewed as the Friendster or Myspace of social audio networks."
2021-03-18 20:23:25,stocks,"If you like to play long-term, PLTR under 26 is a good steal I'm not really sure what PLTRs short term prospectives are, they are integrated with AWS, which I think will be very beneficial for their longevity, alongside their projects offered to counter-terrorism analysts, hedge funds, banks, financial firms. I'm sure there's plenty of bearish cases for PLTR, but looking historically, the price tends to float between 24 and 26 when it's doing nothing, and could probably hit 30 on a good day, but if you want to stock up on shares, and there's no news, you should try to buy your shares between this range. If you get in under 24, you're doing very well, but even between this range, you'll be profitable in the future. Of course, this advice is only good if PLTR doesn't come out with a brilliant earnings report, a new project that will solve world hunger, or find a cure for cancer, but in general, this is the best entry range to ensure you don't miss out on any upward momentum, while saving yourself from any major losses."
03/19/2021,stocks,"`PLTR is so awesome, I am SO bullish because:`

* `It integrates with AWS (this post)`
* `It uses React (another famous post)`

These posts really keep me far from buying PLTR."
03/19/2021,stocks,No thanks. Under 20 is even better.
03/19/2021,stocks,"From my point of view, I agree with you, considering PLTR to be a long term investment. For me is a clear example of successful startup in terms of finding a value prop, raising VC, building a business model and proving value to their customers. I don't know whether it would be the next big thing in tech or not, but they could represent a leader in the data/algorithms business. Comparing with other tech startups, $24-$26 makes an excellent entry point. I'll keep buying at the lowest of the range until a $4K position before considering moving to other choices."

My strategy: PLTR covered call: select 1$ above market price as strike price, expire day is the nearest (1 week),. By this way, every Friday I have extra income. as of today, I rolled lots of options and get about 10k.

For rolling, remember up, out and credit

Up: increase strike price

Out: select day until you get credit

Credit: always roll to get credit, DO NOT ROLL AND DEBIT."

03/19/2021,stocks,The company already has a 42 billion dollar valuation. Doesn’t really look like a steal. Sure maybe when it was around 9 bucks but not so much here. Plus with rates going up it could get rough for growth stocks that have ran up like palantir since alot of these companies are being propped up with cheap money. as people move toward the reopening trade palantir seems very risky and pricey here.

But if it breakes the sideways trend downwards i'll probably be watching from the sideline because i wouldn't know what to do from there.

\- Partnership with IBM

\- Partnership with AWS (this will help gaining aws and other customers onboard quickly and its going to be big deal!)

\- Data analytics is growing with strong CAGR (Data going to be most valuable commodity) and pltr to gain big from this trend

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah haha PLTR under 26 was all the rage like.. October 2020. I guess if you’re gonna hold for 5 years and you expect it to balloon then yeah, it still holds but"

I think ARK just always buys if it’s under $24 as part of a strategy so it never stays there for long."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Exactly. $21-$22 is a buy even if you don't like the stock.
I don't like the stock because I'm not a fanboy, but I will buy it if money is to be made."

03/19/2021,stocks,"If only the stock market would operate on P/E ratios, it would be easy to find value and sell overbought stocks but alas it’s not the world we live in. P/E on a growth stock is tough to work with. It’s constantly changing but it is a good validator as time progresses. It’s 2020 P/E was an unsightly 126. Not terrible given the nature of the company. 2021 needs to have PLTR see a P/E less than a 100 at least to maintain it’s long term bull case. 

Personally I hold about 800 shares at around $10 so I’m ok with waiting it out and seeing what happens. Mid $20s is a fine price for it to idle around with as they report more actuals this year. $45 was just insane and a complete bubble given the number of shares that were going to unlock in February. Bottom line the stock has to put up or shut up to its share holders this year. No doubt the stock has potential in the 5-10 year window to be solid as there is a lot to like about it however there are things not to like as well. For example they would be much more profitable if it wasn’t for the stock based compensation costs they’ve been reporting, will that cost reduce over time? Will revenue growth continue? Time will tell as it always does."
03/19/2021,stocks,Covered calls are the way to go to slowly reduce your cost basis. I don’t think the stock has coiled position anymore where it would move 15-20% in a day so CCs are safe at the moment. I was going to pull the trigger on selling January 2022 at the time near the money $40 calls but didn’t pull the trigger on it. If I did I would have owned the stock at a negative cost basis lol.
03/19/2021,stocks,Plus they are willing to work with agencies that the woke companies won’t. So there is a moat around their gov biz. People don’t understand this isn’t a startup and it doesn’t have competition.

But that's not necessarily the makings of the next trillion dollar business. Or even 100 billion. I know that's not what people want to hear. 

But it remains the case that PLTR has existed for well over a decade now IIRC. Has it found such broad application? Or have other software giants created niches for themselves and asserted themselves much more ably? PLTR may be a misunderstood gem. But then so are SNOW and AI. It's gravy. All claiming to revolutionize data. They'll all do well and all have their place.

Just another thing: ""that nobody sees coming atm."" PLTR has been around for a while. It's products are well known. It prides itself on applying them consistently. That's the business.

Volkswagen plans to **produce and sell a total of 1 million electric cars (including hybrids) in 2021**. About half of these will be purely electric. Due to the high number of existing production facilities (**VW produces about 10 million vehicles per year**), VW's EV division has been growing about **twice as fast as Tesla since last year**. Volkswagen has several factories in China and the USA where production is currently being switched to mass-produced EV models. The following EVs will be sold by Volkswagen in 2021:

Volkswagen: ID.3, ID4, ID.5, ID.6

Audi: Etron, Etron Q4, Etron GT

Porsche: Taycan, Taycan 2WD, Taycan cross tourismo

Skoda: Enyak

Seat: Cupra El Born

The VW Group also sells several hybrid models. **With a current P/E ratio of 13.6 the share is very favourably valued, the dividend yield is 2.11%.**

Volkswagen is definitely the best EV bet currently available. With its brands, the group has a comprehensive **range for all groups of buyers, with a focus on mid-range vehicles.** The software initiative is so extensive that VW's finished software division **will be the second largest software company in Europe.**"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Well, their global market share as of 2020 was 13% compared to Tesla's leading 16% (SAIC 9%, Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi 7%, and BMW 6%).

Luckily for VW, Tesla is relatively supply limited and the others are still trying to figure things out. Could they be Samsung to Tesla's Apple?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Tesla is actually not apple. Please don't compare a 10x overvalued company which builds qualitatively awful cars and pretends to be a softwarecompanie with the best company in the world. What made apple apple is that they have a 40% margin on their products, way more than all of their competitors.

And VW is growing way faster than Tesla, so they will overtake them this year in electric sales, and next year in pure BEV sales."

And to the point of VW growing their electric sales, I concede that they've grown fast. But, I said that they need to bring the latest technology to improve or even maintain their market share.

2) interesting technology. I think there is an open market for more automation in the personal security field. Can put cameras and sensors on a robot (one comes with a drone) and have that supplement security guard staff. I think that’s an interesting concept, and while I don’t know if it’ll work out, I’m willing to wager that it probably does. 

3) they have working products and (and this may sound weird) a functioning website. I don’t really encourage trading penny stocks, for obvious reasons. 99% of them are a scam at worst or a half baked idea at best. This is blatantly apparent when the companies website is just and investor relations landing page. This is not the case with AITX. They have real products (7 different models) and a real website. Real companies are using their products. 

4) growth. They just recently signed a 10 year lease for a new production facility, and have 15 new positions opened up to add to their headcount (I believe it around 25-40 people currently). They signed a new deal with a security company to sell their products, and have deals with a few other fortune companies that are actively using their models.

2021-03-18 20:12:10,stocks,"[DD] A reopening Small Cap Growth play with great upside potential ($DS) MODS: I posted this in /r/investing and thought you all might be interested in the DD.

Note: Greetings fellow investors! This is not financial advice. Just wanted to put some DD out there and get your thoughts on my analysis.

TLDR; I believe Drive Shack ($DS) is an undervalued small-cap reopening play that is likely to go well over $5 in the next 6 months. I am currently holding 3,000+ shares in addition to 8/20/21 5.0c and 8/20/21 7.5c.

# The Bull Case

What is Drive Shack ($DS)? What I would classify as a Small-Cap Growth stock under $4 that could easily go above $6 in the next few months. Drive Shack owns and operates multiple golf-related leisure and entertainment venues. It’s a boozy golf concept – think Topgolf ($ELY). Shares in Drive Shack have rallied by over 115% in the last year, with increasing volume over the last several months and significantly more Institutional ownership being added.

**Market Cap**: 286.4M

**Share Float**: 59.97M

**% Held by Institutions**: 35.69%

**% Held by Insiders**: 13.16%

**Short % of Float**: 1.3%

Quarterly supplement report [here](http://ir.driveshack.com/Cache/IRCache/a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9.PDF?O=PDF&T=&Y=&D=&FID=a72c7457-b828-2126-7fba-5f6e259b01f9&iid=4040318)

Drive Shack owns and/or operates 60 traditional golf courses and is the parent company of American Golf (AGC). They operate 6 Top Golf Style venues in Orlando, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; West Palm Beach, Florida; Manhattan, New York and a New Orleans, LA venue on hold.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe](https://imgur.com/KZxAcxe)

Here is where things get interesting. Drive Shack intends to open a number of new “Puttery” venues. What is Puttery? Think High Tech Miniature golf for adults + cocktails + premium food. They have recently announced a strategic partnership with Rory McIlroy for collaboration with the Puttery concept.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/McwqxI9](https://imgur.com/McwqxI9)

Their goal is to build 17 Puttery venues and complete the Drive Shack Manhattan by the end of 2022. Target Puttery venue EBITDA is $2 to $3 million and Drive Shack venue EBITDA is $4 to $6 million.

Why does this matter?

As we can see, the cost to develop a Puttery is significantly lower than the capital required to build and operate a Topgolf style Drive Shack location. ROI is also significantly higher with the Puttery concept. By 2024 they are targeting over 50+ Puttery venues.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM](https://imgur.com/Qk1cbzM)

Their next biggest competitor is of course Topgolf. Top Golf was recently acquired by Callaway Golf Company ($ELY). Topgolf currently has 28 open locations in the United States, with another dozen opening soon all over the place. Topgolf is continuing on its expansion plans in major American cities, as well expanding into Australia, Mexico and Canada through licensing deals. ELY details below:

**Market Cap**: 5.7B

**Share Float**: 93.1M

**% Held by Institutions: 105.76%**

**Short % of Float**: 16.77%

What did Top Golf recently announce they will be investing significantly in? [High Tech Miniature Golf For Adults](https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/emerging-brands/topgolfs-founders-tee-new-concept-us-expansion) of course. They are doing precisely what Drive Shack is doing, because the Puttery style concept is more lucrative and costs significantly less to develop. Pay particular attention to the % held by institutions. The real money often comes from institutional investors. Professional money managers are always looking to outperform the benchmark. In the exhibit below, we can clearly see the accelerated interest from institutional and professional money managers, with money increasingly flowing into Drive Shack. This is because professional money managers **want and need to** outperform the S&P and other benchmarks to keep their clients happy. They will continue to scoop up Drive Shack in the coming months which will put considerable upward pressure on the stock price. Institutional ownership on $ELY is HIGH.

# How High Can She Go?

I believe $DS will approach 7.50 by end of summer. The market will likely soon to begin pricing in more of these Puttery locations. Let’s have a look at the institutional ownership. Where the “smart money” is allocated currently.

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0](https://imgur.com/bfq6AM0)

As we can see, over 36% **OF ALL** 13f filings own Drive Shack – up from 33% previously. What is our PUT/CALL ratio among 13/f filers? 9.32. 9-to-1 are shorting. Buy why? How many total Calls do we have? A mere 208 thousand. Why? Likely these short positions among 13f filers are simply there to protect themselves on the downside. Why so few Calls being sold? Would you sell covered Calls on an asset that you know is going up? No, but you would protect yourself on the downside – which is precisely what the smart money is doing. They are grabbing this stock hand over fist and this trend will likely accelerate as money managers look for places to put their money.

I think realistically the market cap for Drive Shack could end up between $1-2B in the next 18 months, perhaps higher. This is simply based on the number of Puttery’s and Drive Shack venues they intend to open and the accelerating trend of people getting back out into the world in the wake of the Rona. **This could also be an M&A target as the market cap grows.** The market will soon begin to price in this expansion quickly as the economy reopens.

**A market cap of $2B implies a Drive Shack share price of $12-18 dollars.**

# The Rona Factor

New COVID infection numbers are declining in the US. New treatments and therapeutics are coming out every day. In the US, it looks like this summer may get close to resembling something that we remember as “normal”. In short, there is massive pent up demand for this kind of leisure activity. Have you ever driven by a Topgolf? At least where I am they are always packed. I’ve been myself several times and while it’s not exactly my thing, people throw money at this without hesitation. People are tired of being on lock down. The next 6-18 months in the US are going to see an explosion of interest in these kinds of leisure related activities as the virus fades into a distant memory. I believe this pick is most interesting as both a reopening and growth play.

# Latest Earnings

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates | Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/drive-shack-jumps-18-as-4q-earnings-exceed-estimates-2021-03-14)

The stock has been on fire as of late. Why? Drive Shack's earnings announced on 3/12/2021 of $0.13 per share compared favorably with the year-ago period's loss of $0.25 per share. **Analysts were expecting a loss of $0.19 per share.**

Revenues of $60.3 million topped the Street’s estimates of $55.7 million but declined 16% year-on-year, mainly due to lower revenues from the company’s four entertainment Drive Shack golf venues amid COVID-19 restrictions which led to lower event revenue. Nevertheless, the company said, “The strong momentum and demand for traditional golf continued for American Golf throughout the fourth quarter of 2020.”

From the CEO on the last earnings call, “As we look ahead into 2021, our focus remains on strategic priorities to drive growth and profitability, including the launch and expansion of Puttery, capturing market share using data and analytics, growing brand awareness and advancing technology and innovation to remain at the forefront in our space. With our currently liquidity position and relatively unlevered balance sheet, we can maintain flexibility and optimize our capital stricture to be better positioned to react to future business needs. We believe 2021 will be a momentous year for us that is carried by a team that sets us apart and will drive us forward.”

Key takeaway: **2021 will be a “momentous” year.**

# Upcoming earnings

This is where the stock could really take off. The next scheduled earnings date is 5/5/2021 to 5/10/2021. Most of their locations have had to deal with capacity limitations and other Rona related shutdowns. Revenue and earnings numbers will likely be impressive when they next report earnings. All of their locations will be at or near full reopening’s as COVID shutdowns begin to wind down. They will also likely make announcements regarding the upcoming Puttery rollouts. **This will put further upward pressure on the stock price.**

# New Analyst Coverage

The number of analyst and boutiques that track a stock can have a significant impact on price direction. Let’s have a look at the number of analysts currently covering Drive Shack:

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/yHrknQD](https://imgur.com/yHrknQD)

Now let’s compare that to $ELY (Topgolf):

**Supplemental Exhibit:** [https://imgur.com/md6m8LI](https://imgur.com/md6m8LI)

As we can see, the analyst coverage for $ELY is significantly higher than Drive Shack. Over time, the increased analyst coverage has pushed $ELY much higher. As new analysts begin to initiate coverage on Drive Shack and add their price targets, it will put further upward pressure on the stock price. **The current analyst price target for Drive Shack is over $5**. Institutional investors will therefore become more interested and the market cap will continue to grow. When a respected analyst simply initiates coverage on a stock it can often itself serve as a catalyst to push a stock price ever higher. I believe the coverage on Drive Shack will increase significantly in the coming months.

[Drive Shack Jumps 18% As 4Q Earnings Exceed Estimates](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drive-shack-jumps-18-4q-115954581.html).

Of particular note, “BTIG analyst Peter Saleh maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $5 (59.2% upside potential) on the stock. In a note to investors, the analyst said that despite soft sales, the company recorded “materially better than expected” earnings in 4Q. Looking ahead, Saleh expects cost-savings measures to continue to drive EBITDA growth as COVID-19 restrictions ease.”

# In Conclusion

Drive Shack is a stock that has primarily traded well above $4 since 2013. The Rona has significantly depressed the price of this asset. Institutional money has been flowing rapidly into this company. The smart money already knows where the price is headed. As lockdowns begin to lift and COVID infections/death rates plummet in the US, people will be desperate for leisure activities within the US. Boozy golf is the medicine everyone needs. This trend in behavior will likely push the stock price well above $7 in the next 6-9 months. If the Puttery concept proves successful, this stock will be trading above $10 quickly.

I will try and update progress on my $DS positions periodically."
2021-03-18 20:08:53,stocks,"Margin Requirements - FINRA Rule 4210 interpretation [https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/Industry/p122203.pdf](https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/Industry/p122203.pdf)

""(b) Initial Margin

FINRA Rule 4210(b)(4)/02 © 2010 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.

For the purpose of effecting new securities transactions and commitments, the customer shall be required to deposit margin in cash and/or securities in the account which shall be at least the greater of:

* (1) the amount specified in Regulation T, or SEA Rules 400 through 406 of the Customer Margin Requirements for Security Futures, or Rules 41.42 through 41.49 under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”); or
* (2) the amount specified in paragraph (c) of this Rule; or
* (3) such greater amount as FINRA may from time to time require for specific securities; or
* (4) equity of at least $2,000 except that cash need not be deposited in excess of the cost of any security purchased (this equity and cost of purchase provision shall not apply to “when distributed” securities in a cash account). The minimum equity requirement for a “pattern day trader” is $25,000 pursuant to paragraph (f)(8)(B)(iv)a. of this Rule.""

&#x200B;

\*\*My doubt:\*\*Help me with the interpretation of the point 4, does it mean that the Initial Margin will be $2,000 if it is greater than the Reg T amount (generally 50%)?

Example: I want to open a long position worth $3,000, will the initial margin be the greater of Reg T 50% ($1,500) and $2,000? It is this the correct interpretation? The greater is $2,000, I would have to deposit $2,000 to cover the Initial Margin and so my account after the purchase will be:

* LMV = $3,000
* DR = $1,000
* Initial Margin = $2,000
* Equity = LMV - DR = $2,000

Or the correct interpretation is that $2,000 is just the MINIMUM EQUITY to mantain in the account? In this case if I wanted to open a long position worth $3,000, the Initial Margin would be the Reg T 50% ($1,500) but I should deposit the $1,500 of the Initial Margin plus $500 in order to mantain the Equity at least equal to $2,000. In this case, after the purchase my account will be:

* Cash = $500
* LMV = $3,000
* DR = $1,500
* Initial Margin = $1,500
* Equity = Cash + LMV - DR = $2,000

Which of these two is the correct interpretation?"
2021-03-18 20:08:34,stocks,"I need some advice and opinions on my “poor” stock decisions I have made so far. For a few months now, I’ve been following, reading and trying to understand how to invest properly, so I finally gave it a shot to see how it would go. 

First I began with EA, I put $50 into EA Games, and after a month I’m getting a $2-$5 dollar loss, but it comes back after a while. I know they had a massive dip in 2018, so I tried to see if I could potentially benefit, but I guess it didn’t work out as planned. 

The worst thing I did then, was invest $50 more into... GME. I tried my luck last week, and I have lost $12 dollars as a result now lol. Unsure if I should sell it and move to something else, or keep it for some more time?

I’d appreciate any advice, I really cannot afford to lose more money in the short term"
03/19/2021,stocks,"The reality of investing and trading is, the more money you have the easier it is. With $10,000 you can buy something that costs $500 without risking much of your entire portfolio. With $10,000, a really solid 25% return on a year is $2,500.

With $50 bucks... Even if you pick a magic stock which goes from $50 to $300 in a year, you gained $250. If you spent even a small amount of time researching that stock, you would have made better gains just working 2 extra days that year"

If an AAPL bond goes to $0, I'll buy it for the same reason assuming interest rates are non-zero. Anything that pays me to hold it has a non-zero value.

Predicting how much money you'll receive from a bond is easy, and a bit less so for a stock. Predicting how much that $0.205 a share 10 years from now is worth in today's dollars is much tougher. Small increases in inflation can seriously erode the value of a dollar 10 years from now."

Secondly, the people who actually want me to explain have asked me nicely and I have explained.  The people who don't actually want me to explain have asked me in a provocative way, and once I explained they told me I was an idiot, so it was indeed a waste of my time.

Ah, you're ignorant.  SPACs are hyped and that is a problem, but you understand less about them than the people who are being too reckless and yoloing with them.  

SPACs, by their nature, are a way for companies to build capital in a way that is more attractive because it is cheaper and faster than IPO.  For the investors it provides a way to invest at the same time as the institutions (more or less).  The vast majority of retail investors cannot participate in an IPO, but they can get a similar experience from a SPAC."

Are these good businesses to own? Buffet doesn't give 2 shits about a 1-year bounce on these lame-duck companies - stop comparing him to traders and market-timers, it's a disingenuous comparison.

The ""intrinsic"" value of that company is how much it took to make it minus debts. The thing that's arbitrary is the price in which that company is sold for or in the case of stocks, the fragments of that company. The company could be sold for what it's worth dollar for dollar or it could be sold for more or less.

03/19/2021,stocks,"There is only one definition of intrinsic value: the amount of money you are paid in the future for holding the asset (e.g. stock dividends, bond coupons, and real estate rent) and calculating what those payments in future dollars will be worth in today dollars.

Government bonds have the simplest intrinsic value formula because governments never default and they pay a fixed coupon rate on their bonds, so cash flow amounts are guaranteed. The only variable they have is the extent to which inflation will erode the value of future dollars. Forecasting the time value of money will always be hard, and that's why government bond prices fluctuate and nobody can agree on a specific intrinsic value even if they all agree on the definition.

Stock dividends and real estate rent not only have sensitivity to the time value of money but also unknown future payment amounts. Again, everyone can agree on the definition of intrinsic value but everyone has different models for forecasting what those future cash flows will be.

Commodities and currencies are even harder because you aren't entitled to income just for holding a commodity or currency so you need to find a way to use the commodity to generate income. One way you can generate income from FX is to deposit it in a foreign bank, for example, or you can buy foreign stock with it. Since the income streams are so different between these two uses, it's even harder to model intrinsic value though it's still a factor in how the commodity or currency is priced."

AMC doesn't provide a product that people are dying to buy.  Yeah people like going to see movies.  But how many different cinema chains are there?  What's so special about AMC?  How can you really go above and beyond in an industry like that?  Furthermore, is there a future for a company like AMC?  Microsoft and Apple are expanding into new sectors like cloud computing and electric cars.  But AMC?  Where can they expand?  Movie theatres are dying out thanks to Netflix, streaming, etc.  AMC will become a thing of the past.

Investors, knowing that Microsoft and Apple (and not AMC) provide and will continue to provide top-notch products that consumers demand, want to invest in these companies.  Why?  Because 1. we know they won't go bankrupt, and the important point, 2. we will be entitled to part of their cash flows via dividends. 

Those cash flows we are entitled to are the intrinsic value of a stock. 

There's a speculative element, too, I mean, one can reasonably assume that the price of these companies will continue to rise.  But these increases are rooted in the long-term prospects of these companies being able to return capital to investors via dividends, buybacks, etc.

Lol, what's with the shade on economics coming from everybody?

Diamonds and gold have some level of intrinsic value.  They're shiny.  They're pretty.  You can make jewelry out of them.  Why are they more valuable than water?  Because they're scarce.

You know what else is scarce?  The butt ugly drawing I made of a monkey today.  It's one in a bajillion.  But that doesn't mean the value is going to go through the roof.  Because it serves no purpose.  There's no value.  So it's not all about scarcity.  It's a mix between value and scarcity.

Yeah, there's no INHERENT value to anything, we give things value.  That's true.  But we give things value because they **serve some sort of purpose,** be it survival, comfort, leisure, whatever.  Things that serve no purpose have no value... that's kind of the definition of value."

03/19/2021,stocks,"notapersonaltrainer said they find discussions about intrinsic value devolve into pedantry and different definitions. shortyafter said they were not sure how there can be more than one definition. 

The different tools used to measure length measure the same thing, the differences in the result come from the tools having slightly different calibrations of the defined unit of measurement. 

This is not the case with intrinsic value of a stock.

DCF models, DDMs, and IRMs all have different definitions of the intrinsic value of a stock, and there are assumptions to be made, timing of the measurement, one-time expenses or incomes to be discussed, and so on. 

Defining intrinsic value of a stock is like measuring the length of a rope needed to measure the distance between two cities. First you have to define where to start and where to stop. Then you have to decide if you should measure the distance between the two points as a straight line or as the road traveled. Once you’ve decided that, you need to decide whether to measure it from above (like on a map), or as a straight line on the ground (meaning altitude differences will affect the distance). And if you choose the road traveled, do you choose the road which is the fastest or the road which is the shortest? And if you cross a body of water when adjusting for altitude, do you measure along the bottom or across the water?

Then once you’ve decided on all of these things, it’s time to start discussing how to define a meter. 

That’s the kind pedantry and different definitions notapersonaltrainer is referring to, applied to your example of length."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Market pricing is not the same as value and value is not decided subjectively but by social impact, which is *intersubjective* and hence part of objective reality inasmuch as that is accessible to humans. That's an elementary philosophical point.

The stockmarket is not the same as the society or the economy at large, and none of these three systems is subjective."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Imo value is a primary philosophical concept which doesn't need an operational definition, so you can talk about it in isolation from how you measure it.

The same applies to length. For example space (according to Kant) is a primary concept which we are capable to understand by birth (it is genetically encoded in the human brain) but how we measure length, area, volume, angles etc. is not primary but operational. Thus we all know what space is before we learn how to measure it and even before we learn to talk. Kant's point of view seems to be supported by modern cognitive psychology (including Piaget's studies of child cognitive development and various follow ups), by genetics and even by the AI models developed by Google's Deep Mind. It is also supported by how we deal with space and its measurement in practice.

If you agree to this premise then it makes sense to try to develop various ways to approximate and measure value without doubting its existence and legitimacy as a primary concept. In the case of valuation of a company, you can talk about market value, economic value and social value and about various ways to try to approximate and measure economic value (which is what most people call intrinsic value in this context). The issue of what's the best way to measure and approximate it is then separate from the existence and legitimacy of economic value as a concept. Also it becomes clear from this perspective that market value, economic value and social value can and do differ.

One can delve much deeper into this discussion going for example into the philosophical basis of various theories of social reality (such as that of Durkheim and others) but my basic position ought be clear from what I said above.

Economic reality is part of social reality so its correct conceptual understanding ultimately relies on a philosophical theory of what is social reality.

If you believe that social structures and phenomena are 'things' (i.e. objective realities) as I and Durkheim do then it makes sense to talk about them separately from the issue of how to best measure them. In that sense economics is ultimately grounded in a philosophy of social phenomena.

Thus you can debate and criticize any model or procedure for measuring economic value without doubting its objective existence or the legitimacy of the concept of economic value."

Hitchhiked and traded my way through CA and Baja with people I'd met on the road. Long story short, I settled in So. Cal later. Found a job etc.

The reason I'm telling you is this... you don't have to be in medical school. It's a choice you've made for yourself. Just as me quitting and going on an epic adventure was (sometimes not the most glamorous, but still epic). I chose all of those decisions, just as your desired career has left you in debt.

My end point is, you *can* not be in debt. You can have a decent job (electrician, plumber, insurance, debt relief, solar etc.), white collar or blue collar, and not end up in debt.

There are certain professions that if you choose, you'll end up in debt. That's unfortunate, sincerely. My whole point was, for the vast majority of jobs though, you shouldn't end up in a ton of debt to get there.

You know the average American has 40k in unsecured debt? Stuff that isnt houses and cars etc.?

That's literally just not having good financial sense for a ton of those people or medical debt, which can be avoided by the very poor and the very rich. Certain costs can be mitigated through living benefits life insurance, but for the middle class... medical debt is the one burden most cant afford at all.

The one area where I truthfully think the US system is explicitly fucked is in the healthcare industry. That and housing. Those markets are fucked and cost the middle class their... well middle class status. It's a trip, because either you get public housing or can buy property outright or you spend 30 years if your life to own something that you don't really completely own (property taxes etc.), or you get hit with a non-covered medical expense and you're fucked.

Which is the point that you attacked initially with a nonsensical argument that has nothing to do with the wikipedia quote you reproduce above, from an author that you most clearly never read or understood (let alone digested critically).

Economics and finance are not subjects that can be dismissed by amateurs with word soup arguments inspired by pomo mis-education. You need to have studied and understood a subject before attempting to deconstruct it, for whatever cultural deconstruction is worth."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Lmao, you can read any econ textbook and it will tell you the same thing. Price is determined by supply and demand and not intrinsic value. Sorry but your beliefs in objective theories of value is simply irrelevant in economics. 

>Economics and finance are not subjects that can be discussed by amateurs  with word soup arguments inspired by pomo mis-education. You need to  have studied and understood a subject before attempting to deconstruct  it. 

I have a degree in economics and I'm literally repeating the very basic stuff you are expected to know but I guess you must know better random irrelevant guy on the internet.  You should publish your research and revolutionize the field of economics. Lmao. Get the fuck out of here."
03/19/2021,stocks,Whoever gave you that degree obviously made a mistake.

03/19/2021,stocks,"????? Of course, do think the government should be killing innocent people by lethal injection?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I suppose you support banning chemotherapy then too, I mean after all it is literally government approved poisoning of you. The fact it’s used to treat cancer and is completely voluntary is irrelevant?

Your comment might the stupidest thing I’ve ever read and I’ve read a whole lot of stupid shit in my lifetime."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Chemotherapy is not administered by the government, therein lies the difference. Also a vaccine is inherently different from a cancer treatment - when getting a treatment for a disease such as cancer, you're willing to take on at times large amounts of risk because the underlying disease is deadly, painful or both. A vaccine should have 0 risk, especially for a virus as mild as covid, because there is no underlying disease. Do you think condoms should be on the market if a small percentage of people's dicks are falling off? Would you feel comfortable using the condoms even if the percentage was small?






Lots of things are ""government approved"" that are deadly including alcohol and cigarettes. The problem is that the vaccine is administered by the government. Your comment is undoubtedly the stupidest thing I've read today, and displays an alarming lack of understanding or critical thinking"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Chemo isn’t mandated in any country. You missed the distinction and then called someone else stupid. 

Take a break"
03/19/2021,stocks,Please disclose how many AstraZeneca shares you own
03/19/2021,stocks,"1.	The vaccine isn’t administered by the government, at least in Canada it’s being in part administered by private pharmacies. But even if it was I don’t see how the government administering it makes a difference.
2.	I assume you take Advil when you get a headache. Advil has been linked to an increase in the risk for blood clots. You’re not going to die from a headache, yet you assume risk taking Advil. Same thing goes for 99% of modern medicine, everything has risks, no treatment will ever be perfect across a large population.

Then again you equated a voluntary vaccine with the government giving lethal injections to innocent people. I don’t even know why I’m responding to you, I’d probably have a more intelligent debate arguing with a brick.

https://utswmed.org/medblog/nsaids-heart/"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I didn’t, no country that I’m aware of has mandated the covid vaccine. You don’t know what the word mandated means.

Take a break."
03/19/2021,stocks,None. Nor in any pharma.
03/19/2021,stocks,If someone dies from those blood clots is that not exactly the case?
03/19/2021,stocks,I didn’t know Canada was the global standard for vaccine administration
03/19/2021,stocks,"It is for healthcare personnel. Thank you for playing, maybe next time"
03/19/2021,stocks,Is Advil an over the counter suicide pill? No for the same reason a toaster isn’t an electrocution machine.
03/19/2021,stocks,"It’s literally not the vaccine is recommended sure but mandatory no. Individual hospitals can require healthcare workers to vaccinate but that’s a private business making a requirement for employment. There never has been and never will be mandatory vaccines. 


Try citing things when you say them, when you find no sources, don’t post it. It might prevent you from making yourself look like an idiot.

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55193939 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/hcp.html"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yes, and I would’ve been “asked to leave” my job had I not gotten it. Compulsory, mandatory, pick your favorite adjective. 

Had I had cancer, I wouldn’t have “been asked to leave” had I rejected chemo. 

You’ve drawn a false equivalency and then doubled down. Again, sit down."
03/19/2021,stocks,"That’s not a government mandate. You’re the one who created a false equivalency between Government mandated lethal injections and a voluntary vaccine. 

If you don’t like the risk associated with your job feel free to cry about it (which in terms of taking the vaccine is so low you’re probably not getting sympathy from many). But don’t start spewing bullshit like that.

And if you go into whether the risk is justified, that’s a whole different debate than whether the government approving a vaccine that may or may not have some level of risk is ethical (spoilers it is). But at this point I’m convinced you might be the stupidest person I’ve ever had the displeasure of interacting with so I’m done."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You seem to be trying to distract from the fact you suggested scrutiny over one of four available vaccines  for possibly creating fatal blood clotting is tantamount wanting to ban chemotherapy.

Did your teachers insult your intelligence as a child? It made an impression. It seems to be you’re favorite way of convincing someone you didn’t just try to create an equivalency between a vaccination produced by a single manufacturer and chemotherapy. Someone important in your life maybe? Relationships must be hard with all that self loathing."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I never suggested that, I was replying to the point that allowing a vaccine that may potentially kill 1 in a million is the same as government mandated lethal injection. By showing 
1.	It’s not mandated
2.	It’s not administered by the government (it is procured by the government but that’s different)
3.	The government approves many medical treatments that have a wide range of risks from chemotherapy to Advil, just because there is a risk to the vaccine doesn’t mean it should be banned

Scrutiny is fine, although like I said the evidence doesn’t back it up in this case. Equating the vaccine to government mandated lethal injection is completely and utterly stupid, and anyone who can’t see that is stupid."
03/19/2021,stocks,"""I suppose you support banning chemotherapy then too, I mean after all it is literally government approved poisoning of you.""

Here is your response on this thread to another Redditors scrutiny over one of four immunizations on the market. Is it a memory problem?

Please person on the internet, tell me more about how you have a better understanding of these issues than Norwegian researchers trying to keep their population healthy and safe."
03/19/2021,stocks,"That was a reply to “????? Of course, do think the government should be killing innocent people by lethal injection?”. That’s not scrutiny that’s just plain stupidity. You tried to take my reply to the literal point I said I was arguing against, and then strawman me into saying something I didn’t. 

If you can’t see my point was that we can mischaracterize things to make them seem way worse than they are (even if there are risks) then I don’t know what to say. It was making an analogously stupid comparison to show the stupidity of the initial comparison. I hoped that would be obvious. Then again never underestimate the power of stupid.

I don’t claim to know more than the Norwegian government and I never have once claimed it’s not dangerous (other than stating the link to blood clots is up for debate which is true considering the different global medical authorities response to it)."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You didn’t illustrate anything. People should know if there are more risks associated with a certain manufacturer, which is what these researchers are investigating. The power of stupid is comparing a treatment to preventative measure. And then name calling. 

Again with the ad hominem. Best to avoid those deep seeded issues. You don’t know when they’re going to surface."

03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm just gonna drop some adages/sage lines in here that I've heard over the years, and as someone who is himself new to investing and thinking about the long term, I'd love to hear what the experts have to say.  

-Buy what you use.  

-Buy every month. You'll buy high, and you'll buy low, but if you buy the right stuff, it'll all add up to growth no matter what.  

-Risk is risk, reward is reward, but a 14% annual return over a lifetime feels better than jumping off a cliff.  

-Buy the dip.  

-If you have to question it, the answer is no.

Anyway, the money from the sell is in my TD account and it shows it in my full balance, but when I try to transfer out I end up getting denied. Is this because my account is so young?

G and Q I went hard and have set and forget. F I’m slowing building up on the dips

Q is so underrated, no one ever talks about it but the holdings are great IMO.

I don’t like K - it’s too broad with ‘massive’ disruptive players. Great for a very strong bull market, but not now.

W I just think is overvalued. It’s so easy to hype up web tech and then easy to get an inflated price. Also I would have been overexposing myself to Tesla. So I just picked one stock from W - PLTR as a set and forget long play. I got in at 25$"

03/19/2021,stocks,"I think there are three reasons:
1.  They are an anti-recovery stock with the thought process that once gyms open back up, people won't need to use Peloton anymore.
2.  Their bike and treadmill delivery have been constantly backlogged and they have not been doing a good job of delivering so people are cancelling their orders.
3.  As many growth stocks, they were overvalued and are now being sold off.

Now, that all being said, I have been using the Peloton app since August and it has changed my fitness more than anything else I have ever done.  I will not be stopping as long as they keep producing this quality of workouts.

I haven't figured out yet how to calculate price targets based on earnings/reports, but the analysts give it a $150ish target, so it's probably a safe long term buy."

The problem is, you can't time the market. Most of us thought for sure tomorrow is red, but futures are actually getting pretty green so who the hell knows.


Only thing we know is the market generally goes up over time and yesterday is usually a better time to invest than tomorrow."

E: DFS is up like 150% for me. I dunno how much more steam they have but it's been a solid play and as a customer I really like their service. That's the whole reason I bought into them last spring."
03/19/2021,stocks,Can also add that if you are afraid of buying in at a bad time you can slowly put in say 20% every month for 5 months. Research shows its better to just invest it all as a lump sum ASAP but that can be pretty scary to do.
03/19/2021,stocks,"The ""30% more at the end"" argument really only works if this is the only time the investment is made for the future, one lump-sum saving. Chances are they'll be putting in chunks over years at various time in various conditions,  hitting all the low points AND high points, with the end result being a very average performance nearly identical to the one where the same money was put in over time, but starting a couple months later for the ""real dip."" The worst investment is the one you don't make. Or YOLOing into the GME 800 calls, that also a terrible investment."

03/19/2021,stocks,"It's very simple, in this new trend that was started since that late October sell off, all OPEX Fridays are down days by the S&P. Tomorrow is another OPEX Friday. If you don't understand OPEX, OPEX is the monthly options expiring day.

But another part of this during this pattern is the S&P always finishes higher than the previous OPEX Friday. This part is already very close to violated and a slight down day would have a good chance at violating it.

Max pain for options on the S&P is around 3950 this time which is why I was being trolly about that today until that massive sell program hit. 

IMHO, it would not be a great thing at all for this pattern to get violated. Would quite possibly be a change in tide in the pattern that started back in early November.

My lean would honestly be that it gets violated. But there will likely be a huge fight here tomorrow about that. The market makers didn't want to pay out the 4000 calls, and they won't want to pay out the 3900 puts either."

The late January event was due to the short interest, then it dropped to $40 and everyone (including those who held down to $40, idc what they say) thought it was done. Then it spiked again and the only thing to point to is Ryan Cohen being added to a panel and the termination of the CFO (things that arent that different from the first 2 things I listed), and then it rode the wave of ITM calls. Through all that ... it was never worth that market-cap. It’s been over $200 for a couple of weeks now, and that’s strictly because of a large group of “apes” holding because “I like the stock”. Attempting a blanket statement concerning GME from a positive or negative view is asinine at this point.

03/19/2021,stocks,"If you own a full share, they're required to register you.  How else would you get a dividend or mailed ballots?  

Fractional shares are a creature of clever brokers, you get no vote, you may even get no dividend... See their terms."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Not really. The broker is registered with the transfer agent and holds the shares for its clients in street name. The transfer agent doesn't have to know the internal book keeping of the broker, who acts as a proxy for all of the broker's clients. So it's the responsibility of the broker to act as a correct proxy, which the broker is required to do by law. In particular the broker is responsible for all book keeping of shares held and traded by its clients and for tallying the shareholder votes which it represents as a proxy. This isn't related to fractional shares, those are a different matter. The broker is also responsible by law for correctly distributing dividends to its clients. A serious broker would not usually offer fractional shares in the first place."
03/19/2021,stocks,I begin to see where brokers get shares for options.. thanks
03/19/2021,stocks,"The options story is quite complex and it is also highly regulated. In any case brokers don't have that much freedom regarding these matters since they have to satisfy legal requirements regarding correct clearance and ownership rights of their clients. At least in developed markets such as the US, UK, Canada, Australia and the EU. They are liable for any violations of such requirements.

Brokers such as Etoro etc. who supposedly offer fractional shares usually only offer their clients CFDs (contracts for differences), which do not represent actual ownership of shares in a company. Imo they aren't real brokers in the first place, but rather betting houses who deal in bets made on shares and futures."
03/19/2021,stocks,"VW went through the whole diesel thing and is still standing strong. This should be a testament to VW's resilience.  I believe in VW and its associated brand and products. Once they, and other manufacturers get the EV side going strong Tesla continue to lose it's limelight. 

Even if  many of their vehicles aren't fully electric now and in coming years, they will continue to develop and advance their battery/electric capability's VW has been very overlooked  in this aspect in recent years, and is positioned to be a front runner.  

Another thing about VW, is that they have been the biggest/one of the biggest auto manufacturers for many many years. They have a proven formula of success, and have expanded greatly over the years on the success and profits of this.  

VW has built an automotive pedigree over the years.  I think the stock is very overlooked, and has a lot of upside potential, another thing is I'm sure their P/E-Price to Earnings ratio has to be better than Tesla's!! 

They may not have been the most radical and early adopters of EV technology like Tesla, but they had a global brand to maintain and keep profitable.  Also have been working on EV's for almost 2 decades in the public eye."

03/19/2021,stocks,I agree. They’d have to crank out absolutely stupid ridiculous numbers to sniff a 140 billion market cap this year or next or year after. Im lookin at it now and 45 bill for a defense company like this is a bit ridiculous at this stage. But it’s got cool buzzwords so we’ll see
03/19/2021,stocks,"I use Schwab and love all the products it offers. I have a checking account, regular brokerage, and Roth IRA all under one umbrella. The research is good and if I ever get arrested I can call my broker and place an order."
03/19/2021,stocks,"unpopular opinion- but tbh i like robinhood. granted i have ""only"" around $17k in there, which is small potatoes to some. its easy to operate and it integrates nicely with turbo tax for example when it comes time to file. sure they pulled some shenanigans blocking AMC and GME and that was due to a liquidity issue given how they operate with their cash flow and clearing house.

I'm not looking for an app that's going to change the world, just a place to buy and sell basic stocks. I don't do anything fancy with options or calls. just good ole fashion buy shares and sit on em.

I will say the lack of customer service is my biggest worry, haven't had any issues yet tho. we shall see."
03/19/2021,stocks,I’ve been using T D Ameritrade for years with no problems. Schwab  bought them out not long ago .I can only remember having to call customer service one time and it was my issue not theirs I swing / day trade almost daily.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I heard you man, but I came to Reddit for trading knowledge way too late. RB is so freaking seems less, I open a TDA account and it’s just too much. I’ve tried and tried but I find myself doing my moves on RB, my charting on TDA and ultimately I keep depositing money on rb time and time again"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I am kinda pissed almost no brokerage has a normal option chain interface. Delta/theta, simple an sleek interface like RH? Forget it. Some ugly HTML from 1990."
03/19/2021,stocks,"> when have you ever got on the phone with google? 

several times in fact.  With their project stage stuff especially their service has been great."
03/19/2021,stocks,"That's great, I'm two months into my request to transfer to fidelity now with no response so I wish it were that easy."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Any other brokers with as low of a margin rate? Besides M1, I don't like their trading window bullshit at all."
03/19/2021,stocks,I’m new trading and am using RH because it’s simple to look and feel like I understand what I’m looking at. I checked out the list of different brokers. Does anyone have a recommendation of something that can be easier to understand as a new trader.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I like Robinhood. Obviously not the most sophisticated platform ever but it looks great, works great, and it's free to buy and sell stocks, which makes it great for having fun or a new investor. I literally don't care if ""I'm the product"" if I prefer it over other platforms. Robinhood is the reason why free equity trades exist across many brokers today. Revolutionary for people who aren't going to spend tens of thousands on every trade."
03/19/2021,stocks,FTD squeeze GME video!!! https://youtu.be/UvLxSFdLP8M
03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks. Damn I love Vanguard but their UI makes my brain hurt
03/19/2021,stocks,"Man...I'm thinking of switching, but I'm concerned about the transfer fees. 

From what people say, a lot of brokers stopped trades for the GME run, so whats the best thing to do?"
03/19/2021,stocks,And no way to designate beneficiaries if you die.
03/19/2021,stocks,"i guess we shouldnt use google, facebook or reddit by that logic"
03/19/2021,stocks,"So...if all brokerages are the same, is it fine to stick with RH?"
03/19/2021,stocks,This is literally the only thing stopping me from getting off RH. No other app even comes close to their UI
03/19/2021,stocks,"> Fidelity does allow the purchase of partial shares - correct?

Yes.  The buy interface (web) lets you enter # of shares or $ amounts and if you enter a $ amount it spends it all so you end up with partials that way.

ETA: I haven't explictly bought partial shares by entering a fractional # of shares, but I have bought them using round $ amounts.  Also I'm pretty sure they are advertising fractional share buys on TV."
03/19/2021,stocks,damn Fidelity really timed it perfectly huh
03/19/2021,stocks,Curious about this too. I’ve liked Wealthfront thus far.
03/19/2021,stocks,They are crap. They made mistakes on my 1099. I was looking it over and discovered them myself. If I hadn't noticed I could've been screwed out of some money. Customer service is the worst and it took multiple emails and more than a week for a response from a rep.
03/19/2021,stocks,After you do your taxes turn off Schwab access to third parties such as turbo tax.premier You can never be too sure now a days
03/19/2021,stocks,"When commissions were 5 bucks an insider told me the houses need to make 15 bucks to make money.  Whether on flow, spread, margin or other fees etc. they need to support their work force."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I did not say they are all the same. I said that all of them make money off of the client's data.

There are some differences in fees, but those should be a factor only to very active traders. But then there is speed and reliability of execution, how good UI is, how good their support is. 

Vanguard, for example, has an antiquated and unintuitive web UI. Their mobile app is still in the stone age without biometric login, their email support is very slow and their phone support is on only during business hours. But if you only invest in index funds that you never sell, Vanguard is a good option.

And if you are happy with RH (I hear they have a pretty nice UI), why not use it? Regardless of whether their GME trade suspension was good or bad, I suspect most other brokerages would have done the same. We can hate on RH all we want, but that does not make their competition paragons of virtue."
03/19/2021,stocks,Oh wow I sincerely hope your stocks transfer over appropriately! Did RobinHood or Schwaub give you an estimate of how long it would take for you?
03/19/2021,stocks,that fee is if you do a full transfer. You can do 99.999999% transfer and leave 1 share of your cheapest stock at RH and avoid the fee correct?
03/19/2021,stocks,"By default, anything you buy in RH is margin because the default account is margin. When you transferred over, RH tells Fidelity the stocks were bought in margin so they get marked as margin. Fidelity knows this so they convert it over to cash after a few days off the transfer being completed, but if it doesn't automatically convert, then you need to call customer support and have them change it over."
03/19/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/19/2021,stocks,"Thanks for replying. I'm debating right now whether or not to move to another brokerage in light of events. 

I only started using RH more actively this year. I heard that RH sold some shares from users without their consent during the whole GME thing, but I don't know definitely for sure. It hasn't happened to me thus far, at least not to my knowledge, so I don't really have qualms with RH, but I just think...what if I'm affected. What happens to all my hard work and investment?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"No word on how long, but I've seen other people comment around reddit saying it takes around a month."
03/19/2021,stocks,"The DTCC raised capital requirements on specific securities, namely those with increased volatility. That increase lead to them running out of money. If the requirements for those specific stocks hadn’t had gone up, they would have been fine. Therefore, the only choice they had was to limit buying of those specific securities so they could continue to comply with DTCC requirements. It would have been significantly worse for them if they limited buying everything, which is something they didn’t have to do if they limited those specific securities. If you don’t understand how these things work, I would suggest looking it up instead of automatically clinging to some far fetched conspiracy theory with no evidence. It’s a fairly simple and boring explanation had you taken the time to look."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Really hope that goes smoothly for you Imyxle, thanks for letting me know, I’ll transfer mine to my Fidelity account soon too. Have a great weekend!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Just talked with Schwab support.

> It can take 5-15 business days to send over the cost basis from the other institution. Brokers have 15 business days to send your basis over. If it doesn't come over in 15 business days we will then request it for you. If it's been about 3 weeks and you still don't see it, you can contact our client reporting group for additional details.

They also said RH has been slower than usual because of the large amounts of out transfers they have been receiving."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You mentioned it without giving it.

A nice vapid position."
03/19/2021,stocks,"I see. You lack intellectual stamina. I apologize for being ablest. I didn't realize you needed help using the internet.

The picture in the link looks like four separate motors to me. There could be different kinds of hub motors and mounting which I don't know about. I have seen the eCascadia in person though. The other styles would be using an electric motor with a driveshaft and traditional axle or using an axle with an electric motor built into in.

03/19/2021,stocks,"the more the yields rise, lower TLT will go because it's got older bonds on shittier yields, and the price needs to drop to match the fresh ones issued by treasury, until the fund manager starts front loading more fresh ones and dumping the old ones with lower yields

foreign investors won't be buying TLT when the fresh stuff has a better coupon yield"
03/19/2021,stocks,"This is really interesting. It’s crazy that the advisor has zero ability to own up to his past mistakes. I’ll take this to heart. Most of the people here are just contrarians for the sake of it. I do like this trade but it’s all about timing, I think we all know that. 

I’m curious about your trouble with options though. The bond world is usually the black box, not the options and equities market. I’d like to hear more about your trading/investing strategies."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Interestingly,  someone was on CNBC talking about TLT last night and he said bonds is not where you want to be right now.  But you're doing something with puts. that may be a different animal.  There was also talk of the 10 yr rate going back to 1.5 as fast as it zoomed up.  That may have been Josh Brown midday yesterday."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Rates haven't gone up in 30 years doesn't mean that they're not going up now, you have to play the hand you're dealt.

Please do update us on how your positions go. I'm opening a 04/16 125p today. Let's circle back here and compare our loss and gain porn that week once the SLR expires and TLT takes a literal dump into double digits."
03/19/2021,stocks,"hmmm okay, I think im hung up on the concept of holding capital versus holding collateral. I guess my thinking is that bonds have been sold off, now with the SLR, if the suspension expires, then they need more bonds to be in compliance with the SLR, and will prompt buying.

 Maybe I need to search around the various documents and try to find a mention of changing the treasuries to be ""liquid enough to be considered cash""."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, collateral and capital are two different things. Collateral is what they would need for repo operations or overnight loans to meet their reserve requirements (or whatever reason they would need to get a loan for). Capital is more of, if you go bankrupt tomorrow what can be liquidated that will make the people you owe money whole? Collateral, to my understand, has nothing to do with SLR.

Now, honestly, I would personally think that treasuries should be considered *capital*, not a low-risk asset, but that's just me."
03/19/2021,stocks,"thanks for that. yeah i think the connection im making is this:

Rule comes into place excluding treasuries from the SLR. aka banks dont HAVE to hold them anymore, and thus have been selling. Once SLR exclusion expires, they will be forced to hold treasuries again and will be buying. 
treasuries = collateral  

IDK if I just doubled back to my previous comments or not but in essence, this is what I was thinking. too much macro thinking lately I need a break"

03/19/2021,stocks,"Uh yeah, they just announced it WILL EXPIRE."
03/19/2021,stocks,No it doesn't. Deflation isn't the same as supply and demand. If your the only person who can produce a product you can charge whatever you want. In fact it makes you more profitable as generally your inputs to produce it should be getting cheaper.
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'm not eating my balls, sorry to disappoint. It is awkward though, I will admit"

You also don't have the WOLED substrate patent.  Deflation doesn't not equal monopoly busing lol.  If anything it makes monopolies more profitable as they expenses go down and they can continue to charge whatever.
03/19/2021,stocks,NEVER. I will leave my comment up so I can be shamed though.
03/19/2021,stocks,"Patents don't grant monopolies. Royalties can't be onerous.

As deflation proceeds the incomes of people and companies decline, and companies go out of business. Your sales will fall unless you lower prices or cut production. Cutting production makes margin fall faster than cutting prices would.

Deflation is *worse* than inflation.

That's why central banks are willing to offer negative interest rates to prevent it."

03/19/2021,stocks,"We got around the peak oil issue with technology unlocking previously inaccessible oil (fracking). Scientists weren't wrong at the time, but more info was added that changed their prediction. 

Scientists have made a ton of climate models, and the only ones that give us a fighting chance in hell have us dropping oil and switching to green technologies and doing it soon. That's why I say if oil is still profitable in 20 years were screwed, because it means we're following another model which has the effects of climate change severe enough to cause major climate disasters within 50 years. 

Also, comparing economists to scientists for credibility is a pretty bad comparison. Everyone know economists do their best to predict market trends but the models they use are hugely sensitive to their own factors they input. They do their best to predict the markets, and might even do a good job some of the time. Science (physics, biology, chemistry, environmental science) is not at all the same; there's no guess work, there are testable hypothesis that can be used to build a larger model. Science models don't vary with market forces and their ability to accurately predict cause and effect is significantly better than economics models. If you believe otherwise I encourage you to look more into the topic. You sound like your skeptical of science because of economics, when the two fields could not be more different."

Like yourself, I've always enjoyed that data and analytics behind things. Never really got into investing / trading until a few weeks ago. So glad I found your post.   


Quick questions about the sheet:   


For #1 under your conclusions. Is the ""Paper Trading"" tab where I should be looking to see the tickers for the day and their social score (to try and find some under 500 to do my own DD on)?   
Each day this tab is updated with new data?   
What do the dates in the ""bought"" column represent? Your personal open positions that day?   
What does the data represent in columns ""0"" through 30 or 40 in both the Paper Trading and % Calculation tabs?   


I'd like to give this strategy a test run, and want to make sure I'm understanding the data clearly. Thanks again!!"
03/19/2021,stocks,Wow! Great work!
03/19/2021,stocks,Awesome post thank you so much. If I could - #1 finding stocks in Unbias - what time frame are you looking for that sub 500 in? 6 hour? 24 hour?
03/19/2021,stocks,"When you say you look at a stock that has grown 5% and you think you can get another 10% from it, what timeline did you look at for that 5%? Is that 5% gain over the course of a week?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"> I've only taken a loss twice

I'm most interested in hearing about those losses. 75% PT hit rate is fantastic, and the rest being green trades is also extremely good. What was the % loss on those two red trades?"
03/19/2021,stocks,wow good find.
03/19/2021,stocks,"1. Paper Trading tab: This is where I post the data for the day. I'd say it's raw data, but it's not quite since I process it. But it's the large spreadsheet of all the tickers that I copy and paste into each day. To look at today's potential picks I just filter it by today's date, Reddit, a score grouping of 500, then go from there

2. I update the the Paper Trading tab daily. I put the ATH data each day after market close so I can capture everythign that hit an ATH that day. The sentiment data I do the next morning before market open so I can capture all the conversation that happened after market close the day before

3. Bought is kind of misnamed, but I didn't expect to share the sheet with anyone when I created it. It's the day I pasted it into the sheet

4. col 0 = Price the day it got entered into the sheet. The rest of the columns are how many days after that day. So if the ""Bought"" is 3/10, then 0 is the price on 3/10. 1 is the price on 3/11 (3/10+1), 2 is 3/12, etc. I did that so I could write an excel function that gathered the stock price every day automatically without me having to go get them"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I do every 24 hours, except on Monday when I do 48 hours to cover the weekend"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Depends on the average number of days to max profit for that category. In my example above I'm talking about to under 500 category, and as of yesterday's data that category averaged 6 days to hit an average of 15%. That's the timeframe I'm looking at"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I'll have to look back, but both were pretty small - around the 1% - 3% range. Since I'm not bag holding for a long time and I bought before they had any spikes then usually (I'm finding) they just kind of stay flat until I sell"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Happy cake day.

Yeah, it looks like what this actually points to is a strategy to buy the day *after* an ATH if it's lower and put a limit sell at the ATH. Since you know your PT you can set an alert for your risk area etc etc. 6% better than a coin flip is all you need to be profitable"
03/19/2021,stocks,You da real MVP. Thanks again so much! Wish I had an award to give you - maybe after following your strategy I'll be able to afford one! Cheers!
03/19/2021,stocks,"One more question... Do you find there's any significant decrease in price between when the trade is entered and when it becomes profitable? EG any given stock that hits your 15% price target, have any of them dipped more than, say, 10% below your entry price? Do you set up any sort of stop-loss alert on any trades at a certain % loss?"
03/19/2021,stocks,"thanks for the response. what I am still unsure of is WHEN he makes the buy. from what I understand, the market is pretty volatile at open so I wonder if that makes a difference"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Hypothetically, the data in the sheet would change to reflect the new patterns. As more people sell earlier and at a lower % gain, the price changes across time to reflect that. And as the price changes, OP's spreadsheet updates to reflect the new trend (number of days to max gain, average % gain) At some point, the spreadsheet will point to a new trend that's more profitable than this current one (eg 500+ scores over 3 days with 12% average profit) and people will move to that.

Realistically speaking, there are potentially thousands of trading strategies that produce consistent profits. IMO so few people will actually stick to this strategy that those using it will not move the price of any stock in any meaningful fashion, which means even fewer people will develop a counterstrategy for it."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Some do get sold at a loss, but it's not significant. I'd say normally somewhere between 0% - 5%. I think it's because I'm looking at stocks that are just starting to get mentioned, so they haven't spiked yet and don't really have a lot of room to fall. That means that after 6 days the ones that haven't spiked are usually just kind of sitting around doing nothing. Some DO drop, but most are pretty negligible"
03/19/2021,stocks,"If I had to guess, the stocks he's buying that 'haven't popped yet' are probably consolidating around some price point. That, or he waits for the lunch hour or after market to buy when the prices are typically less volatile.

Or he just buys whenever, idk."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Keep in mind that the ATH data isn't sentiment data, even though I'm tracking it with the others. It's strict numbers from Finviz"
03/19/2021,stocks,"True, but why is it important at all?  Have you run numbers against what would have happened using something else as the buy trigger? 
I would think that mention percent increase would be a more reliable trigger."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Sentiment tells us how popular a ticker is getting. What made me want to start tracking it was the theory of the Wisdom of the Masses. The more people that all agree a stock is about to go up the more likely it is to happen. You're standing on the shoulders of dozens or hundreds or thousands of people who have done their own versions of DD, so it wasn't too big of a surprise when trends started occurring.


As for the ATH data, there's nothing involved other than price point for that specific day, and that's not really an indicator of anything. The data reflects that, since it turns out that a stock that has hit an ATH has basically a 50/50 chance of going either direction over the next few days. That makes sense if the data point you're tracking doesn't have an effect on the price"
03/19/2021,stocks,"As to your question, I haven't started tracking other categories, but I'd be interested in seeing if any showed a useful trend. I might start tracking other criteria if something occurs to me"
03/19/2021,stocks,"I wasn't paying attention and realized that 2 of my Chinese stocks were delisted!!!!!  CNOOC Limited (CEO) & China Telecom Corporation Limited (CHA)

I don't even know what to do now!!!!!  More trouble than it's worth.  I'm thinking of selling all my NIO because don't want this to happen again!!!  very annoying.."
03/19/2021,stocks,I stupidly wasn't paying attentions.  I have CNOOC Limited (CEO) & China Telecom Corporation Limited (CHA).  Just realized that they are delisted by the US Government!!!!  What should I do?????

03/19/2021,stocks,Oh I'm sorry tho
03/19/2021,stocks,thanks:)
03/19/2021,stocks,"Nice, thanks for explaining this!"
03/19/2021,stocks,"Ha! Yeah, tons of US politicians flying up to Canada for health care, right?

At least you only pay relatively massive taxes for the “free” checkup."
03/19/2021,stocks,"You live in an ignorant fairy tale world that doesnt exist.  We pay less of our GDP in medical costs and have lower COVID deaths per capita.  Our tax rates arent that high, especially factoring in the cost of medical insurance.  Our country should be a role model to your collapsing country."
03/19/2021,stocks,All hail the world power that is Canada LMAOOOOO
03/19/2021,stocks,"Lol, typical American.  Yes you are behind most countries in health care outcomes, cost of healthcare as a percent of GDP, you have a worse functioning democracy, more corruption, you have more wealth inequality, rampant gun violence, unbelievably bad education system.  

And what do you come back to? WE HAVE ALL THE POWER THOUGH.

OK.  All your nukes are going to make me wish I lived there right? Fuck no. Your shitty dystopia can go fuck itself.

Too much maple syrup on the brain? I won't deny that the US is on the way out - we have a lot in common after all! I just think it's hilarious that you expect Canada to last ten minutes in a world where the US isn't the hegemony."
03/19/2021,stocks,"Who gives a crap what one person does? I just linked you some hard stats about the cost of your broken healthcare system and your actual statistical outcomes.  Your objectively behind Canada in all metrics and you cant get  your freedom boner down long enough to make a point that isnt about national security.

Nobody is attacking Canada, get your head out of your ass."

You literally have zero power or influence in the world. The only reason you can even have your sub-par health care system is because the US is present to provide military protection. Your land actually has some pretty good resources, but you're too backwards to leverage them."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Yeah, one is the American stock, the other is the Canada stock. Same company."
03/19/2021,stocks,Would it matter which one you buy? Or do they follow each other? I only have access to the Canadian one.
03/19/2021,stocks,"They are pretty much the same, I don't think it matters but the Canadian one is probably better since that is where they started I believe."

03/19/2021,stocks,Thanks for the advice. I am definitely taking notes and looking up everyone's recommendations. I will look into the discord as well. Love this community already!

I'm not to worried about GM and Ford, but when KIA and Hyundai get deep into EVs, I think that's where the quality and price points are going to make a huge dent in Tesla's market share."

This stock should be taking off. Low gas, increasing business, new plane orders, fine financials, much brighter future than a year ago. 

The only thing that makes sense about the god damn market is that it doesn’t make sense. Too many firms with big money that want to influence a stock’s price for their own gain."

03/19/2021,stocks,"My day job is in selling toys, and I am very bullish on Funko. The NFT thing is a perfect pairing as they are planning to back it with a physical product, so that is going to give people a way to collect a physical item as well as the NFT. I could see people having virtual Pop Walls they can share with other collector's online. It also helps address issues of authenticity, as the very rarest pops become targets of counterfeiting. Already in their physical products they have Chases, which are rare special editions that are intermixed in with common versions of a pop. These are much more valuable on the resale market. But the biggest thing about NFT's is the digital royalty that allows the creator Funko to capture resale value. Right now Pops have a MSRP of 10-45 depending on size and exclusivity. But anything rare is go for 2-20x that in it's lifespan on the secondary market. That's a lot of margin they could tap into. 

Besides this NFT play as someone who retails their products I have noticed a lot of smart decisions. They have been rereleasing stuff that has done very well on the secondary market to give more people a chance to collect at MSRP. They have done collaborations with Youtubers to get fan input on new lines. They have been branching out into the board game market using their top IP like Harry Potter, Golden Girls, Five Nights at Freddy's, etc. Board games are a huge market, and games related to IP are very collectible in themselves. They also came out with a surprise toy called Snapsies. Surprise ball toys have just been dominating the girls toy industry for the past 3 years. The biggest names are LOL, Hatchimals, and Mini Brands but those have all had their peak Q4. That's not to say they aren't still doing very well but they have all gone through a year where they couldn't keep them on the shelves and now supply matches demand. I noticed on Amazon, that Snapsies are now on the first page of results if you search for surprise toys. Their ranking just broke the top 2,000 in toys in the past few weeks, which is a great place for any toy to be although for comparison LOL toys are pretty consistently in the sub 500 group or even sub 100. It may not be what I would call a run away hit, but it looks like it's going to be successful foray into the 3-8 year old toy market. That line is inhouse IP so maximum margins. If it takes off they are poised to create a full line of plush, Pops, tshirts, etc."

03/19/2021,stocks,"Any time you buy a stock you should be doing atleast some sort of technical analysis. Stocks clearly follow trends, some more than others. But ultimately MA and Bollinger bands routinely provide support/resistance patterns which the stock follows, I find. 

Of course with times like we are experiencing outside of the market, it sometimes nullifies the usefulness of technical analysis, since technical analysis doesn't account for company news or world news. But technical analysis should just be one part of DD."
03/19/2021,stocks,I was wondering about this too. Have you found anything with your additional research?
03/19/2021,stocks,"The only thing I found is that VWAGY is popular here in the US and we are all turning it into pump and dump stock. Where VWAPY (the more liquid ticker) is the one that is traded on the exchange in Germany and is popular there. So it is a lot less volatile because investors there aren’t as crazy as we are here. 

I don’t know if it is true or not but that’s what I have been reading.  I see some posts on Twitter by Europeans all confused why Americans are trading less liquid ticker that pays smaller dividends."

03/19/2021,stocks,"What are your opinions about the sheer amount of energy required to keep BTC operational? The more it grows the more energy it will require to continue.  Seems like at a certain point, especially if it does take over as the main worldwide financial system. The energy demands required to do so seem like they would be too costly to operate at that scale compared to a blockchain that runs on proof of stake. In a world that is growing more and more conscious about energy usage, I see BTC going the way of the steam engine. Right now everyone is shoveling coal to make the beast trudge uphill, and everyone is cheering because they all got a ticket to ride. That ride might continue well past we are long dead, but at some point, people are going to realize that there may be an alternative where we don't need to trade natural resources, coal, lithium, solar panels, and graphics cards to make a secure record of finances.    


That being said, Union Pacific and their investors made a fuckton of cash on the way up."
